   "lyrics": "Parents Just Don\u2019t Understand Lyrics[Intro]\nYou know parents are the same no matter time nor place\nThey don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue, parents just don't understand\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remember one year\nMy mom took me school shopping\nIt was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister\nAll hopped in the car\nWe headed downtown to the Gallery Mall\nMy mom started bugging with the clothes she chose\nI didn't say nothing at first\nI just turned up my nose\nShe said, \u201cWhat's wrong? This shirt cost $20\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!\u201d\nThe next half hour was the same old thing\nMy mother buying me clothes from 1963\nAnd then she lost her mind and did the ultimate\nI asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!\nI said, \u201cMom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep\u201d\nShe said, \u201cYou're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, let's put these clothes back, please\u201d\nShe said \u201cNo, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show\u201d\nI said, \u201cThis isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer\nMom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers\nBut if you don't want to I can live with that but\nYou gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks\u201d\nShe wasn't moved - everything stayed the same\nInevitably the first day of school came\nI thought I could get over, I tried to play sick\nBut my mom said, \u201cNo, no way, uh-uh, forget it\u201d\nThere was nothing I could do, I tried to relax\nI got dressed up in those ancient artifacts\nAnd when I walked into school, it was just as I thought\nThe kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought\nAnd those who weren't laughing still had a ball\nBecause they were pointing and whispering\nAs I walked down the hall\nI got home and told my Mom how my day went\nShe said, \u201cIf they were laughing you don't need them\n'Cause they're not good friends\u201d\nFor the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom\nThat I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times\nSo to you all the kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue\nParents just don't understand\n[Verse 2]\nOh-kay, here's the situation\nMy parents went away on a week's vacation and\nThey left the keys to the brand new Porsche\nWould they mind?\nUmm, well, of course not\nI'll just take it for a little spin\nAnd maybe show it off to a couple of friends\nI'll just cruise it around the neighborhood\nWell, maybe I shouldn't...\nYeah, of course, I should\nPay attention, here's the thick of the plot\nI pulled up to the corner at the end of my block\nThat's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking\nI picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking\nYou should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions\nI honked my horn just to get her attention\nShe said, \u201cWas that for me?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYeah\u201d\nShe said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nI said, \u201cCome on and take a ride with a helluva guy\u201d\nShe said, \u201cHow do I know you're not sick?\nYou could be some deranged lunatic\u201d\nI said, \u201cC'mon, toots, my name is the Prince\nBesides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?\u201d\nShe agreed and we were on our way\nShe was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word\nWe hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive\nWe ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes\nShe kicked her shoes off onto the floor\nShe said, \u201cDrive fast, speed turns me on\u201d\nShe put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas\nWe almost got whiplash, I took off so fast\nThe sunroof was open, the music was high\nAnd this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh\nShe had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far\nI guess that's why I didn't notice that police car\nWe're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche\nAnd to make this long story short - short\nWhen the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell\nI said, \u201cI don't have a license but I drive very well, officer\u201d\nI almost had a heart attack that day\nCome to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway\nI was arrested, the car was impounded\nThere was no way for me to avoid being grounded\nMy parents had to come off from vacation to get me\nI'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me\nMy parents walked in\nI got my grip, I said, \u201cAh, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?\u201d\nThey didn't speak - I said, \u201cI want to plead my case\u201d\nBut my father just shoved me in the car by my face\nThat was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived\nThey took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving\nI can't believe it, I just made a mistake\nWell parents are the same no matter time nor place\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nTake it from me, parents just don't understand6Embed"

Shake the Room Lyrics[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]\nYo back up now and give a brother room\nThe fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom\nMercy, mercy, mercy me\nUh, my life is a cage but on stage I'm free\nHyped up, psyched up, ready for wildin'\nStanding in a crowd of girls like a island\nI see the one I want, I said \"come here cutie\"\nI flip her around and then I work that booty\nWork the body, work, work the body\nSlow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody\nHold up, yo let's get just one thing clear\nThere's only one reason why I came here\n\n[Bridge: Fresh Prince]\nYa really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (GO)\nYa really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (GO)\nYa really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (GO)\nI came here tonight to hear the crowd go\n[Hook: Crowd]\n(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)\n(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)\n(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)\n(Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom)\n\n[Bridge: Fresh Prince]\nWell yo are ya'll ready for me yet?\n(Pump it up Prince)\nWell yo are ya'll ready for me yet?\n(Pump it up Prince)\nWell yo are ya'll ready for me yet?\n(Pump it up Prince)\nWell here I go, here I go here I, here I go\n\n[Verse 2: Fresh Prince]\nYo, dance in the aisles when the Prince steps to it\nThe rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it\nOut in the crowd and yo it was a good throw\nHow do I know?, because the crowd went (HO)\nIn response to the way that I was kicking it\nSmooth, an individual, rhymes always original\nLike the Dr. Jekyll man and this is my 'Hyde' side\nI am the driver and you're on a rap ride\nSo fellas (yeah)\nAre y'all with me? (yeah)\nI said fellas (yeah)\nAre y'all with me? (yeah)\nWhy don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do\nYa wanna (oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ew)\nThat's right yo and I'm in the flow\nSo pump up the volume along with the tempo\nI want everybody in the house to know\nI came here tonight to hear the crowd go\n[Hook: Fresh Prince]\n\n[Fresh Prince talking during Hook and into break]\nYeah\nBreak it on DOWN, uh\nYeah, give 'em it\nUh, bring it back to 'em\nYeah, c'mon now\n\n[Break - DJ Jazzy Jeff - *scratching*] - w/ ad libs\n\"Mix\" - repeated\n\n[*solo scratching*]\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nHere I go\nThe F-f-f-Fresh P-p-p-Prince is who-who I am\nSo tell my mother that I never make a whack jam\nBut sometimes I get n-n-nervous and start to stutter\nAnd I f-fumble every f- word, f-f word I utter\nSo I just try to ch-ch-ch-chi-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill\nBut it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still\nI need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-kick into it\nThey help me calm down and I can get through it\nSo higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling\nLet it go y'all don't fight the feeling\nMic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring\nAnd like Jordan yo I'm scoring\nYeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow\nSo pump up the volume, along with the tempo\nMany have died trying to stop my show\nI came here tonight to here the crowd go\n[Hook]\n\n[Fresh Prince - talking over]\nYeah, uh\nKick it to the AM\nDon't stop\nAll night long\nAnd I'm outta here3Embed"

It was a whole new day\nI thought, \"Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.\"\nUntil I noticed those rips in my sheets\nAnd that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street\n[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]\nOh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff\nCome on, come on\nCome on Jeff, answer\nCome on, man\nHello?\nJeff, this is Prince, man\nJeff, wake up\nJeff, wake up\nWhat do you want?\nJeff, wake up, man\nListen to me, Jeff\nIt's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?\nJeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?\nListen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep\nMan!\nJeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff\nLook, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed\nRRAHHHH!\nAhhhhhh!\nJeff! Jeff!\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaa!\nAhhhhhh!\nJeff!\nRRAHHHH!\nJeff! Answer me, Jeff!\nI'm your D.J. now, Princey!\nAhh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaaa!3Embed"

    "plain": "This is the 1988 version of the first single by DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince and the first track of their debut album Rock the House. The Prince, a.k.a. Will Smith, tells a couple stories, ironically and with his particular humor, that prove how much trouble a girl can cause. DJ Jazzy Jeff sampled the melody from \u201cJeannie\u201d by Hugo Montenegro and the drums from \u201cCatch the Beat\u201d by T-Ski Valley. In this version there\u2019s a third verse and some parts of the song are cleaner than the original ones."

I said: \"Well... kinda\"\nAll of a sudden, she jumped out her seat\nSnatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street\nShe started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin'\nSo I shoved her away, I said: \"You better stop buggin'!\"\nShe got mad, looked me dead in my face\nThrew her hands in the air and yelled out: \"Rape!\"\nI got scared when she started to yell\nSo I handed her my wallet and ran like hell\nI was duckin' through alleys right and left\nBut when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death\nI was arrested, charged with aggravated assault\n(Hey, yo Clancy, we got him!) But it wasn't my fault!\n[Chorus: Fresh Prince]\nNevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Verse Two]\nI was in a bar one Friday night\nCoolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight\nI was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila\nWhen this girl walked up, she said: \"Hi, my name is Sheila\"\nI responded by saying hello\nShe paid for my drink and then said: \"Let's go\"\n20 minutes later, things were starting to cook\nAs we pulled up into her house, I said: \"I'm with you, toots\"\nThe music was soft and there was wine in the glasses\nShe started winking and making little passes\nAt me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold\nShe started feeling up my back, I said: \"Oh, your hands are cold!\"\nWe went into her bedroom thinking of one thing\nTook the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring\nI carresed her body and I kissed her cheek\nAnd that's when I observed those satin bed sheets\nI felt that it was time for me to make my move\nI thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove\nI leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue\nA door slammed and a voice said: \"Baby, where are you?\"\nHer boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin\nAnd said: \"Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!\"\nI was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?\nI just yelled: \"Geronimo!\" and jumped out the window\nJust my luck we were in a snow storm\nAnd all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm\nAnd to top the night off, I had to break in my place\nBecause my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case\nI was done, sneezin' and coughin'... (Aaa-choo!)\nI hope this doesn't happen too often, but\n[Chorus: The Fresh Prince]\nNevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Spoken interlude]\n[Jazzy] Yo man, you think they see your point?\n[Prince] I don't know, I don't think they really get it, man...\n[Jazzy] I think you should give 'em another example!\n[Prince] Aight, give me a scratch, let's make it funky right here...\n\n[Verse Three]\nI got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year\nIt was my girlfriend Betty, I said: \"Hello dear!\nI was just about to call you\nI got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert\" (I'm wit' it)\n\"It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?\" (Yeah)\n\"Aight, fine, see you then, Betty\"\nI combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth\nGot funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif\nGot to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet\nUntil Betty's mom said: \"Betty's not ready yet!\"\nI sat there for at least an hour\nIt was ten after nine before she got in the shower\n9:35, she comes downstairs\nAnd said: \"I need a little longer to finish my hair\"\nAt ten o'clock, we had been missed the show\nShe comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?\n\"Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!\"\nI was steamin' like a demon as I drove home\n[Outro: Fresh Prince]\nBut it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme\nJust remember my rhymes\nTake heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!\n\n[Outro]\n[Jazzy] Man, first your parents just don't understand...\n[Prince] I know, right, man...\n[Jazzy] Then you have these crazy nightmares...\n[Prince] Look, why me? Why me?...\n[Jazzy] What's next?\n[Prince] Not these girls man, but... you know how it is... can't live wit' 'em...\n[Prince & Jazzy] ...can't live without 'em2Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cBrand New Funk,\u201d was the first single from the duo\u2019s most successful album, He\u2019s The DJ, I\u2019m The Rapper. It embodied classic East Coast Hip Hop elements such as sampling and the \u201cscratch techniques,\u201d popularized by DJs such as Jazzy Jeff. As for as the sampling the song contains several, but the most noticeable would be none other than James Brown\u2019s \u201cMake It Funky,\u201d and \u201cMy Thang,\u201d.\n\n\n\nLike Brown, Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince are developing and delivering their new exciting music that will sure cause a craze. The song highlights how they both experimented and stumbled on the, \u201cBrand New Funk.\u201d"

It embodied classic East Coast Hip Hop elements such as sampling and the \u201cscratch techniques,\u201d popularized by DJs such as Jazzy Jeff.

The song highlights how they both experimented and stumbled on the, \u201cBrand New Funk.\u201d"

It's out of the ordinary\nIt's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary\nA literary genius and a superior beat creator\nHave come together and we made a\nMusical composition which we think is a remedy\nTo cure all the dance floors that's empty\nYou wanna dance? We got what you want\nJazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt was kind of an accident, the way that it happened\nOne day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up\nAnd all of a sudden, he brought in a cut\nAnd I dropped my microphone and said, \"What the...?\nHold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it\"\nHe just smiled and said, \"Yeah def ain't it?\"\nIt was {funky} it made wanna (get, get down!)\nAnd we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk}\nSo we continued to listen to it\nAnd we knew it was def when I started rappin to it\nSo I gave a hi-five to Jeff\nAnd without hesitation popped in my cassette\nI took it home that night, and analyzed it\nRewound the tape over and over, and memorized it\nThat Friday, we went to the club\nAnd out and out cold tore it up!\nYou shoulda seen the people dancin' and shakin' and movin' and jumpin'\nAnd spinnin' and clappin', while the beatbox was groovin'\nAnd screamin' and yellin' while on the microphone I was flowin'\nFresh rhymes I was showin', the people say, \"Yo keep goin'\"\nSo I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox\nSpecial assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock\nPeople fought just to get up front\nTo get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk\nYo Jeff! (Rock the beat)\nYo Jeff! (Rock the beat)\nYo Jeff! (Rock the beat)\n* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *\n\nYo Jeff! (Rock the beat)\nYo Jeff! (Rock the beat)\nYo Jeff! (Rock the beat with your hands...)\n* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *\n\nNow get funky with the beat!\n* Jeff starts spinning backwards *\nNow turn it all around!\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous\nRemarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous\nMusic that has ever been created\nIs ours - but believe me it was complicated\nBut we have done it, so now we can breathe\nA long awaited sigh of relief\nThis isn't a publicity stunt\nIt's the raw, untouched, pure, hard brand new funk!\n\n[Outro]\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *\n(Rock the beat with your hands..)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n(Rock the beat)\n* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *\n{Rock the beat with your hands..}1Embed"

    "plain": "\u201cI Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson\u201d was the lead single from And In This Corner\u2026. It reached #58 on the US Pop Chart and also did fairly well in Australia, New Zealand and the UK.\n\nWhen this song came out in 1989, Mike Tyson was the most feared boxer on the planet. His record was 37-0. Many of his wins were from knockouts, and many of his knockouts were in the first round.\n\nWill Smith\u2019s unfounded bravadocio and \u201carmchair quarterbacking\u201d is the source of the song\u2019s comedy."

It reached #58 on the US Pop Chart and also did fairly well in Australia, New Zealand and the UK.\n\nWhen this song came out in 1989, Mike Tyson was the most feared boxer on the planet. His record was 37-0. Many of his wins were from knockouts, and many of his knockouts were in the first round.\n\nWill Smith\u2019s unfounded bravadocio and \u201carmchair quarterbacking\u201d is the source of the song\u2019s comedy."

You tryin' to solve 'em?\nForget the small talk, let's get to the nitty gritty'\nMe and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City.\"\nYo, you got this you gonna bust dude up\nYeah, you can be my trainer\nWord up?\nI'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice\nAnd yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can beat Mike Tyson\n[Break]\nMan, you can beat him, you can beat him\nYo man, word up\nYou know I put on a couple pounds man we can do this, man\nYou can do it\n\n[Newspaper boy]\nExtra, extra read all about it. Get this...\nFresh Prince challenges 'Iron Mike' Tyson to a fight\n[Laughing] He's crazy\n\n[Old men]\nAin't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifteenth row?\nHey Leroy, you read the paper?\nThat boy done lost his mind\n\n[Verse Two: Fresh Prince & Lawrence the Barber]\nThere was press conference to see what trainin' I was doing\nBefore then I had never heard reporters booing\nCameras flashing, I was in the middle\nI didn't wanna look dumb so I exaggerated a little\nI said, \"Uh, I been trainin' twenty hours a day\nLiftin' big old cars and big bales of hay\n(That's what you're doing)\nAnd I jog 10,000 miles every morning\nThinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory\n(Tell 'em more)\nI drink water, 20 gallons a pop\nAnd I can throw a Volkswagen a whole half block\n(He can do it too)\nAnd 4 million sit ups... in a minute...\nI ain't lyin' I did it!\"\nThe general public thought I was a fool\nI was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool\nWell gettin' dissed is never good\nBut I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood\nI was at the corner at the top of my block\nThere was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop\nIt was Lawrence, my barber and friend\nAnd he yelled out:\nHey, Prince, you can win!\nI said 'really?' and I stopped to chat\nYou could beat him man, if you hit him with a bat\nHa ha...you gon' get wrecked\nBut can I have your shoes when he break your neck?\nEverybody was laughin' out loud\nI thought at least my own Grandma would be proud\nI went to her house and snuck in to surprise her\nI heard her on the phone\n\"A thousand bucks on Tyson!\"\n\n[Old men]\nHey, Leroy, i thought that boy was joking, [?] he really gon' get in the ring!\nMan, i don't think that boy can beat that big football player\nMan, i keep tellin', ya, he ain't no football player, he a boxer\nHey, Leroy, we gotta do something, that boy gon' kill himself!\n\n[Verse Three: Prince, Ring Announcer]\nIt's fight day and man am I hyped\nWoah, I can't wait to see Mike\nBoy I'm hyped, ready to do my thing\nTrump Castle Casino [bell rings]\nIn this corner, weighing a mere 165 pounds\nThe Lightin' Rodent, the Fresh Prince! (crowd boos)\nAnd in this corner\nThe heavyweight champion of the world\n'Iron Mike' Tyson! (crowd cheers)\nI came out hustling, slidin' and grabbing\nSlippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'\nFor a second I looked good out there (yep)\nBut then Mike brought to reality (look out) my worst nightmare\nOne punch, that's all it took (oooh)\nHe hit me in my ribs and my insides shook\nNow how can I say this and be a little discreet?\nLet's just say that my bowels released\nI called timeout and went back to my corner\nSaid to my coach, \"Ain't no way I'm goin'\nThe hell back out there, man you can forget it\nMy body's like a punching bag and Mike is gonna (Hit it)\"\nThey tried to make me go meet my doom\nBut I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressin' room\nThe next day the headline in the town\n\"Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins, first round\"\nSome fool asked why I ran away\nI said, \"A good run is better than a bad stand any day\"\nMy career is over as far as fightin'\nBut I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson\n\n[Outro: Prince and Jeff as old men]\nHey Leroy!\nYeah\nDid you see the fight? did you see the fight?\nThe..the..the football player?\nNo the boxer, come on man\nI was at the fight last night\nI paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars\nFor my ticket right...\nAh, you weren't at no fight\nI seen you around here last night\n..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring\nYou always lying\nI ain't lying...\nYou lie to your grandkids..\n..I seen it...\n...you been lyin' ever since you was a little kid\n...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off\nHis leg fell off and it fell over...\n...you always lying\n...and it knocked the HBO camerman's camera fell out his hand\nI said, god damn, I couldn't believe it Leroy\nYou shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there\n...I was right next to you playin' checkers2Embed"

I'm not jokin. No doubt\nYou know how many doubters bones have been broken?\nYou may not have known before but now you know\nThe reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nCharlie Mack.. the first out the limo\nHe's Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo\nIn closing, we'd like to say this to you bustaz\nIf you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up, plus get\nEmbarassed and laughed at by all of your friends\nAnd if you cross Charlie Mack it's the beginning of the end\nOf life as you know it. You might not die, sir\nBut if you're not dead, you'll wish you were\nBut if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go\nYou can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo\n\nHe's Charlie Mack\nAnd he's the first out the limoEmbed"

DJ Jazzy Jeff sampled the melody from \u201cJeannie\u201d by Hugo Montenegro and the drums from \u201cCatch the Beat\u201d by T-Ski Valley."

DJ Jazzy Jeff sampled the melody from \u201cJeannie\u201d by Hugo Montenegro and the drums from \u201cCatch the Beat\u201d by T-Ski Valley."

What's up man?)\nMan, this guy just walked to me and punched me in my eye, man\nSo I'm, I was just trying to talk to his girl\nI don't even know her, man! (Aw, man, that's dead)\nYep! Man, Jeff, get me some ice, man, I can't believe this, man!\n\n[Hook: The Fresh Prince]\nListen homeboys don't mean to burst your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Verse One: The Fresh Prince]\nJust last week when I was walking down the street\nI observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet\nI walked up to her I said hello\nShe said: \"Hey! You're kind of cute\" I said: \"Yes, I know, but...\nBy the way, sweetheart, what's your name?\"\nShe said: \"My friends like to call me exotic Elaine\"\nI said: \"My name is the Prince\" and she said: \"Why?\"\nI said: \"Well... I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!\nBut enough about me, let's talk about you\nAnd all the wonderful things that you and I can do\"\nI popped some trash and in a little bit of time\nI showed some cash and the girl was mine\nI took her over town, I wined her and dined her\nShe ask me 'was I horny?' I said: \"Well... kinda\"\nAll of a sudden she jumped out her seat\nSnatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street\nShe started grabbin all over me kissing and hugging\nSo I punched her in her chin, I said: \"You better stop buggin'!\"\nShe got mad looked me dead in my face\nThrew her hands in the air and yelled out: \"Rape!\"\nI got scared when she started to yell\nSo I hit her with a trash can and ran like hell\nI was duckin through alleys right and left\nBut when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death\nNow I'm in prison, charged with aggravated assault\nBut I didn't do nothing, it was that dumb broad's fault!\n[Hook: The Fresh Prince]\nNevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhymes and get the hell away\n\n[Verse Two: The Fresh Prince]\nI was in a bar one Friday night\nChilling out watching the Sugar Ray fight\nI was kinda laying back, sipping on tequila\nWhen this girl walked up she said: \"Hi, my name is Sheila\"\nI responded by saying hello\nShe paid for my drink and then said: \"Let's go\"\nShe bought my drink, I thought that that was polite\nSo I walked out with her, I said \"What's up for tonight?\"\nShe said \"Just get in the car\" so I obliged\nAbout 20 minutes later we pulled up in her garage\nShe parked the car, gave me some sexy looks\nShe started walkin' in the house, I said \"I'm with you toots!\"\nSoft music and wine in the glasses\nAnd then she started to make little passes at me\nShe said \"Sweetheart, today's your lucky day\nCause when I'm finished with you you're gonna yell 'Ol\u00e9!'\"\nShe stood up so I stood up with her\nShe puckered up so I started to kiss her\nShe grabbed me close then she got bold\nShe started feelin' up my back I said \"Ooh your hands are cold!\"\nWe went into her bedroom thinkin' of one thing\nTook the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring\nPulled down the shades then we dimmed the lights\nThen we took a tasty sip of Riunite, on ice\nI chewed a stick of doublemint to freshen my breath\nI gave her half of that stick, it was the last one left\nI caressed her bod, then I kissed her cheek\nThat's when I observed those Gucci bed sheets\nI felt that it was time for me to make my move\nI thought I'd better hurry up before I busted the groove\nI was kind of uptight and I knew she could soothe me\nI tapped her on the shoulder and said \"Ah-ehm, excuse me\"\nShe touched my lips and asked me not to speak\nGot undressed and pulled back those Gucci bed sheets\nSat down on the bed, laid back her pretty head\nKicked her feet up on the pillows and that's when she said that\nShe wanted me to be her one and only\nShe said \"Lay down, baby doll, I'm getting lonely\"\nAll of a sudden, out of the blue\nA door slammed and a voice said \"Baby, where are you!?\"\nDistinctfully I panicked, my heart full of fear\nShe said \"That's my boyfriend, babe, you better get out of here!\"\nHer boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin\nHe said: \"Boy, I'mma tear your butt limb from limb!\"\nI was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?\nI just yelled: \"Geronimo!\" and jumped out the window\nJust my luck we were in a snow storm\nI didn't even have my underwear on to keep my warm\nAnd to top the night off I had to break in my place\nBecause my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case\nI was done, sneezing and coughing...\nI hope this doesn't happen too often, but\n[Hook: The Fresh Prince]\nNevertheless don't mean to burst your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme\nJust remember my rhyme\nTake heed to my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Outro: The Fresh Prince (DJ Jazzy Jeff)]\nMan, girls ain't nothing but trouble, man... (Yeah, I hear that, I dig it)\nYeah, well... can't live wit 'em...\n[Prince & Jazzy] ...can't live without 'em\n\n(Better take care of that eye)\nYeah man. Alright, y'all stay cool, man\n(Alright, chill Prince)\nLater, Jeff (Aight)1Embed"

   "lyrics": "Nightmare on My Street (Single Version) Lyrics* has extra lyrics not on \"He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper\"\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nNow I have a story that I'd like to tell\nAbout this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!\nHe comes to me at night after I crawl into bed\nHe's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!\nHe wears the same hat and sweater every single day\nAnd even if it's hot, outside he wears it anyway!\nHe's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm asleep\nI can't believe that there's a nightmare - on my street!\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nIt was a Saturday evening if I remember it right\nAnd we had just gotten back off tour last night\nSo the gang and I thought that it would be groovy\nIf we summoned up the posse and dumb rush the movies\nI got Angie, Jeff got Tina\nReady Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life\nThat was all right though 'cause the lady was chill\nThen we dipped to the theater set to ill\nBuggin! Cold havin' a ball\nAnd somethin' 'bout Elm Street was the movie we saw\nThe way it started was decent, ya know, nothing real fancy\nBout this guy named Fred and this girl named Nancy\nBut word, when it was over, I said, \"Yo! That was def!\"\nAnd everything seemed all right when we left\nBut when I got home and laid down to sleep\nThat began the nightmare - on my street!\n[Fresh Prince]\nIt was burning in my room like an oven\nMy bed soaked with sweat, and man, I was buggin'\nI checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30\nIt had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty\nI wanted something cool, to quench my thirst\nI thought to myself, \"Yo, this heat is the worst!\"\nBut when I got downstairs, I noticed something was wrong\nI was home all alone but the TV was on!\nI thought nothin' of it as I grabbed the remote\nI pushed the power button, and then I almost choked\nWhen I heard this awful voice comin' from behind\nIt said, \"You turned off David Letterman and now you must die!\"\nMan, I ain't even wait to see who it was\nBroke outside in my drawers and screamed, \"So long, cuz!\"\nGot halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'\nThen thought, \"Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin\"\nI strolled back home with a grin on my grill\nI figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill\nI walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince\nBut Freddy killed all that noise real quick\nHe grabbed me by my neck and said, \"Here's what we'll do\nWe got a lotta work here, me and you\nThe souls of your friends you and I will claim\nYou've got the body, and I've got the brain.\"\nI said, \"Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong\nI ain't partners with NOBODY with nails that long!\nLook, I'll be honest man, this team won't work\nThe girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!\"\nFred got mad and his head started steamin'\nBut I thought, what the hell, I'm only dreamin'\nI said, \"Please leave Fred, so I can get some sleep;\nOr gimme a call, and maybe we'll hang out next week.\"\nI patted him on the shoulder said, \"Thanks for stopping by.\"\nThen I opened up the door and said, \"Take care guy!\"\nHe got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt\nI laughed at first, then thought, \"Hold up, that hurt!\"\nIt wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real\nI said, \"Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.\"\nNo further words and then I darted upstairs\nCrashed through my door then jumped on my bed\nPulled the covers up over my head\nAnd said, \"Oh please do somethin' with Fred!\"\nHe jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws\nTried to get me, but my alarm went off\nAnd then silence! It was a whole new day\nI thought, \"Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.\"\nUntil I noticed those rips in my sheets\nAnd that was proof that there had been a nightmare on my street\nFP: Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff\nCome on, come on\nCome on Jeff, answer\nCome on, man\nJJ: Hello?\nFP: Jeff, this is Prince, man\nJeff, wake up\nJeff, wake up\nJJ: What do you want?\nFP: Jeff, wake up, man\nListen to me, Jeff\nJJ: It's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?\nFP: Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?\nListen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep\nJJ: Man!\nFP: Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff\nJJ: Look, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed\n{FC} RRAHHHH!\nJJ: Ahhhhhh!\nFP: Jeff! Jeff!\n{FC} Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!\nJJ: Ahhhhhh!\nFP: Jeff!\n{FC} RRAHHHH!\nJJ: Jeff! Answer me, Jeff!\n{FC} I'm your D.J. now, Princey!\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa!1Embed"

It was released as the album\u2019s second single on November 8, 1993, peaking at #73 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #51 and #18 on Billboard\u2019s R&B and  Hot Rap Singles charts, respectively.\n\nNew Jack Swing creator Teddy Riley was called in to co-produce the song with Jazzy Jeff, and can be heard providing ad-libs throughout the song, and sings on the chorus with a Talkbox.\n\nThe album was recorded during airing of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air tv-show (1990-1996), which explains why this album isn\u2019t as good as it could/should have been. The focus was simply on something else.\n\nThis song has samples from James Brown\u2019s Funky President and The SOS Band\u2019s Tell Me If You Still Care \u2013 The latter of which was produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis."

   "lyrics": "Just One of Those Days Lyrics[Intro]\nHave you ever in your life experienced a day\nWhere nothing at all seems to go your way\nNo matter how hard you try to get out of the rut\nYou just could not break the string of bad luck\nA day where Murphy's law takes over your life\nAnd you just can't seem to do a darn thing right\nAnd when the day was over you just had to say\nYou said man it's just one of those days\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy day started off kind of cool\nI brushed my teeth I combed my hair and I got dressed and went to school\nI stopped at the store for a breakfast snack\nA Tastykake and orange juice and a bubble yum pack\nAbout that point I proceeded to class\nI spoke to all the pretty girls that I passed\nI went to my room which was on the first floor\nI had no idea what I was in for\nI sat in my desk and minded my own business\nSomeone knocked on the door the teacher said who is it\nThis girl walked in my imagination ran wild\nShe stole my heart just by the way that she smiled\nI couldn't resist so I grabbed her butt\nShe said what's wrong with you fool are you some kind of nut\nThe teacher turned around while my arm was extended\nShe looked me in the face and said Prince you're suspended\nI said your tripping it's just a bad habit\nShe put it in my face she must've wanted me to grab it\nI pleaded my case but she wrote the pink slip\nThen I just shook my head I said I don't believe this\nShe sent me to the head of the discipline staff\nI tried to play it off so I started to laugh\nI said ha ha this story is great\nIt's a big misunderstanding one big mistake\nHe didn't think that it was funny he didn't even smile\nHe said mmm mmm mmm you're an unlucky child\nI stopped laughing and I said why is that\nHe said just get out my school and don't you ever come back\nI said wait this is my school and you're telling me to leave it\nHe handed me my books and said yep you'd best believe it\nAs I walked out the school back at the wall I did gaze\nAnd said man it's just one of those days\n[Verse 2]\nI woke up around a quarter to eight\nI wiped the sleep from out my eyes and I was feeling great\nI flipped my radio on and to my utter surprise\nI thought that it was eight o'clock but it was half past nine\nI hopped up and put my feet on the floor\nRan to the bathroom then I (ow) hit my foot on the door\nThe pain was immense as it started to throb\nI said to hell with broken toes I was losing my job\nSo I combed my hair then I brushed my teeth\nThrew on my Fila suit and my Fila sneaks\nThrew on my Fila underwear and my\nFila hat\nThen I ran downstairs and kicked the fila cat\nI grabbed my jacket then I grabbed my keys\nThen I prayed out loud car start please\nThe car started but what good was that\nI couldn't drive it anyway because the tires were flat\nI did the hundred yard dash to the top of my block\nThen I grabbed a dollar bill from my left sweat sock\nThe bus pulled up I was late and kind of nervous\nI got real mad because the sign said out of service\nI started hiking it I wasn't liking it\nI saw a little kid I stole his bike and started biking it\nI thought I got away but when I ducked around the corner\nThere was twelve cop cars I said I'm a goner\nSlamed on the flat I did 180 turn\nPeddled the bike so fast I heard the rubble burn\nWith the cops in hot pursuit I started feeling like a jerk\nI thought man all of this cause I was trying to get to work\nI could've got away I almost had 'em shook\nTil this girl walked by something said not to look\nBut I thought what the heck a little peek can't hurt\nBut she made me miss the sign that said men at work\nI screamed out loud as I crashed through the baracade\nI saw my whole life flash before my face\nI felt kind of dizzy all I saw was stars\nI put my hands over my eyes and settled on the handle bars\nThat was stupid I got off track\nCause about that point everything went black\nThe next thing I remember is a head ache nagging\nI woke up face down in the back of a paddy wagon\nI pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dead\nA big Flinstone lump on the side of my head\nThey took my picture and my finger prints\nI said wait you can't arrest me I'm the Fresh Prince\nI demand that you release me you incompetent fool\nYou can't arrest me I'm the Prince you know the rules\nYou got five seconds 'fore I punch out your lights\nBut then the cop pulled out his gun I said ha ha psyche\nI had a call so I called my boss\nI figured I might as well what else could be lost\nBoss I'm sorry that I couldn't make it today\nHe said what are you talking about you're off today is Saturday\nStuck in a cell scared as hell\nI'm a hungry kind of tired and I hate this awful smell\nMaybe one day I'll get smart and change my ways\nBut for now it's just one of those days\n[Outro]\nIt's just one of those days2Embed"

Fresh Prince is back\nYou wonder how'd it happen; I wasn't rappin' for a long time\nBut now I'm back with a strong rhyme\nLook here, the camera, snap my picture\nI'll sign my name on it, then I get wit' ya\nLike LL said; \"don't call it a comeback\"\nAnd face the fact, Jack - I'm all that\n(I know ya gonna dig this)\n\nHere I am in the flesh (Who is) I'm the funky, funky, funky fresh\nRhyme authority, rhythm connoisseur\nHip-hop liaison, rap Ambassador\nDuke of daring, the king of the cut\nThe prince of poetry and all that stuff\nSexy, sexy, making the honeies yell\nGirlies passing out? Ah, well\nBack from the dead, like Jason\nPeople thought I was over, they were erasin'\nMe and Jeff's names out of the hit list\nBut ah, ah, ah, not so quick\nComing back at ya, can't no bad catcher\nCatch this fastball I'm throwing at y'all\nWake up and smell the coffee, I'm back now\nThanks for keeping my throne warm for me, pal\nThe man with the cape, the crown and the scepter\nOut for a while, but wisely kept a\nPen and pad by, so when I had my\nOpportunity to rap, man I\nSet my goals and then I shot for\nWhat I do best: funny, to hell with hardcore\nVoice on radio, face on TV\nSpanking new funky rhymes on a CD\nOut to attack the wack, full contact\nIt's gonna be a long night go get a knapsack\nI got a gat to make ya face the fact\nThat I'm the best rapper on wax - I'm all that\n(All that, you know what I'm saying)\n(Get wicked)\n\nGet up, get down, get funky, get loose\nI'm the best show and I got proof\nIn the past there were those that could doubt it\nBut now I'm back and there's no doubt about it\nThe writing is on the wall (Come on)\nGimme ya mic and a stage and I'm a live it-ive it up y'all\nCause I can flow\nIs there another rapper in the world like me? Hell no!\nNo one's like me, others try to bite me\nThere thebere thebere there might be\nSomeone like me somewhere\nThey're just not here; where the hell they at? Who cares?\nCause y'all got the ace in the hole\nThe super lover brother, numero uno, the rapper with soul\nComing out a little on the new tip\nFor those of y'all that thought I couldn't do this\nYo, well consider it done\nIt's the same got the parents\nJust don't understand the same one\nPeople said that I couldn't rap\nHa ha ha, you can stop that\nCause I'm a rapper and a half\nAnd in the past I chose to make people laugh\nAnd I was criticized for that\nSome called me soft, some called me wack\nI gotta admit it y'all I felt bad (Who'd ya call)\nSo as usual I called my Dad\nHe's sort of a fifty-one year old Casanova\nHe said son, \"Yo, come on over.\"\nHe sat me down and he told me this\nSon when your all that, you're gonna get dissed\nHe put his arm around me and he said \"Son\nI was all that when I was young\"\nSo from that point on I set my sights on\nMaking a record that people thought was the hype joint\nPhilly, born and raised, I've been gone for days\nI can't wait to get back with my new track\nRhyme like lava, voice like a volcano\nMy rhyme through your radio works like Drano\nA Porsche 911 and I don't stall, Jack (Yo, we all that)1Embed"

(Showin' you)\nWhere you're goin' to? (Goin' to)\nDo you know that we are down by law?\nWe want you all to know that we're primal of all\nAnd when we rock the house there is no doubt\nThat me and Ready C will turn it out\nDo you know where you're goin' to\nAnd do you like the things that Ready C is showin' you?1Embed"

I had plans for later on\nPlans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun\nWord! I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home\nLet me give him a call, on my car phone\nYo Jeff, what's shakin?\n[Jazzy Jeff] Coolin, whassup?\n[Fresh Prince] Girlies\n[Jazzy Jeff] I'm with it, come pick me up!!!\n[Fresh Prince] I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's\nA whole carload of girlies and they ALL was def\nWe walked into Jeff's and said, \"Girls, you can't resist\"\n{\"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"}\n[Scratched] \"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"\n\n[Fresh] Yo Jeff man, are you with me?\n{Jeff scratches.. \"Hit it!\"}\n[Fresh] I didn't hear you man, are you with me?\n{Jeff scratches.. \"Hit it!\"}\n[Fresh] I'm with it to GET BUSY!\n\n[Scratched] \"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nReady Rock C, give Jeff a hand!\n\n{Ready Rock beatboxes while Jeff scratches the same sample}\n\n[Scratched] \"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nThrow away them chairs, cause you don't need em anymore\nCause this hip-hop hit, is gonna keep you on the floor\nIf you dance everyday or if you never danced before\nIt doesn't matter if it's {\"somethin like this\"}\nTime is essential, so let's make the best of it\nToday we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away\nLet's use this time in a very special way\nLet's use it, {\"somethin like this\"}\nI went outside at about 12:30\nI saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good!\n.. if you know what I mean\nSo I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene\nI walked over to em, stepped in between them\nOne stepped to the other, \"I think that I've seen him\nSomewhere before.\" I said, \"Sweetheart, you might have\"\nShe said, \"Oh yeah, it was last night\nAt that party.\" I said, \"Yeah I tried to talk to you there\nBut you were acting as if you were scared.\"\nShe said, \"I'm not scared now.\" I said, \"Bet, well let's go then.\"\nShe said, \"But hold up, what about my friend?\"\nI said, \"I got a friend!\" So the three of us left\nWent back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff\nFive minutes later Jeff walked in\nAnd I thought to myself, \"Yeah, now the fun begins!\"\nBut the girls started buggin, and they said, \"Now we want\nDinner in the best restaurant in town\nWe want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight\nAnd Dom Perignon.\" I said, \"Yeah right!\"\nY'all must be crazy, and Jeff said\n[Jazzy Jeff] \"Y'know?\nI really think it's time for these ladies to go.\"\n[Fresh Prince] We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed\nAnd it went a little {\"somethin like this\"} *door slams*\nBut that was okay, that was alright\nCause we still had fun that night -- yaknowit!\nThe moral of the story is plain and visible\nWe always watch out for those kind of women\nBut the past is the past and the present is the present\nAnd we feel that everyone should be sitting down\n{\"so you all don't miss\"}\n{\"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"}\n[Doug E. beatboxing?]\n{\"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"}\n\n[Doug E. beatboxing?]\n{\"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"}\n\n[Doug E. beatboxing?]\n{\"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"}\n\n[Doug E. beatboxing?]\n{\"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!\"}Embed"

I =BEEN= talkin to girls, man what are you talkin about?\nThat girl looks =GOOD=\nMan look, you just, you buggin man, you know what you said?\nOkay, okay, alright, =YOU= show me how to talk to a lady\n\n[Fresh Prince]\nAight, bet, uhh sweetheart?\nListen up toots I like your looks\nI used to see girls like you in them girlie books\nI'm losin my mind, but it's not lost yet\nI'd pay a thousand dollars just to see your silhouette\nRed is a rose's color, blue is a violet's\nHere's my number baby, when you get home, dial it up\nI'll be your man and you can be my lady\nAnd YOU can come to my house and we can get busy baby\nGirl.. for..get about your boyfriend, he's nothin but a hassle\nYou can come with me and cold chill in my castle\nOh what a wonderful time it would be, imagine --\n-- you and me, in my jacuzzi\nOr horseback ridin or we can play tennis\nBut, the most intimate part will be when it's\nTime to eat dinner, we'll go get dressed\nAnd then we'll give a call to Antonie, my private chef\nFirst we'll eat crablegs, by candlelight\nThen sip wine by the fire for the rest of the night\nAnd if the time is right, I'll ask you to be my lady\nAnd we can dip right upstairs and get busy baby\n\nYou know since I first met you\nI wanted to let you know how I felt, so I could get you\nTo treat me like a phone and take me off hold\nAnd make your ear a cup so I can pour my heart and soul\nI can't help but dream about the ultimate life\nTwo kids, a dog, a goldfish - and you as my wife\nWe'd have a rosebush, with a white picket fence\nAnd all the neighborhood kids would call me Mr. Prince\nAnd on the lazy Saturday afternoons\nRight after me and the kids get finished watching cartoons\nWe could send them both outside to go play\nAnd we could spend some time upstairs, get what I'm sayin?\nThe only problem, that we would have\nIs whether or not to drive the Porsche, the Benz, or the Jag\nAnd every night before bed, flip the radio on\nAnd sip Dom Perignon to the quiet storm\nGucci, Louis Vuitton, you want more?\nGloria Vanderbilt or Liz Claiborne\nOr Christian Dior from head to foot\nThe world is yours if you'll be my toots\nOhhh I know what your problem is\nLook those other chicks are just good friends\nI'll give up my harem if you'll be my lady\nC'mon whaddya say, huh? Let's get busy baby\nLook, be honest, c'mon, don't lie\nTell the truth - I'm a hell of a guy, right?\nPretty smile, light brown eyes\nI've got miles on them other guys, face it\nYou could search America, Russia or Germany\nBut never will you find another man equivalent to me\nBut let's discuss it, perhaps over lunch\nAbout how I'll be your poopsie, and you will be my hunybunch\n\"Now isn't that special?\" Why ain't you widdit?\nYou'll be my only girl, yeah, that's the ticket\nLife's a risky business, babe you know the deal\nSometimes you just gotta say what the hell\nNow is that time, roll for the money\nLife is a gamble but I'm a sure thing honey\nGirl, you know you're drivin me crazy\nSo how bout it, come on, let's get busy babyEmbed"

I heard you say that girls are nothing but trouble\nAnd now I'm taking this time to bust your bubble\nYour arrogant conceited your stuck on yourself\nAnd bragging nearly every time you open your mouth\nYou think you're a gift to women success will turn your head\nWell I'm sorry to inform you that stuff is dead\nWait a minute let me talk to you\nI think I should inform you who you're talking to\nNo let me tell you so you'll remember me\nAs the one that bust your bubble I'm Ice Cream Tee\nWell I'm Jazzy Jeff and I'm the Fresh prince\nBefore we have you arrested what's the meaning of this\nYou say girls are full of trouble I must 'splain this to you\nGirls may be trouble but guys are trouble too\nYou're a compulsive liar your mind is full of dirt\nAll you do is worry about what's up a girls skirt\nYou can't have a secret love because you got a big mouth\nYou go run and tell your boys how you laid her out\nI think truthfully you're sick you need to be kicked\nSee I'll keep my loaded weapon you get on my nerve I go click\nGuys think they own their girlfriends\nFemales aren't possessions we are humans\nWe like to be wined and dined by candle light\nNot being cooped up in the house trying to be held up tight\nSo Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut guys of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo homegirls next time a guy tries to give you the play\nJust turn your head and cold diss him and walk away\n[Verse 2: Ice Cream Tee and Will Smith]\nThis amazing hot day I was departing from work\nMy briefcase in my hand sitting down on my skirt\nThe undergrounds of the subway was the scene of my walk\nI got approached from the rear he said Baby can we talk\nI looked him in the eyes with this fabulous smile\nHe said I just got paid lets hang out for a while\nI said first would be my pleasure to know who you are\nAnd do I have to use my tokens or do you have a car\nWell my name is the Prince and I'm a great rap star\nYou don't have to use your tokens I've got a Jaguar\nI knew there was no doubt I'd jump on this mission\nI proceeded to tell him my name with the least suspicion\nI said Ice Cream Tee was the title I was given\nSWP the name of the hood I live in\nSo we jumped in the ride hit I-95\nWe turned into his block pulled up in his drive\nFirst step in the house I saw a mouse\nI did a B-ninety in the room tripped and ended with an ow\nHe came running to my rescue he was a little late\nMy hair was broke my briefcase was in a totally different place\nHe said I'm sorry take a sip of this bacardi\nAnd excuse me while I go freshen up for the party\nI got a little confused I said party what's up with dude\nHe didn't even tell me I thought that was quite rude\nSuddenly through the door was three men in suits\nThey said hey sweet mama who are you\nI said I'm Ice Cream Tee and who may you be\nI'm brother Charles, brother Rick and he's brother Ali\nAre you here to see the Prince? See the Prince, no\nThe Prince works for me I'm running the show\nWork for you? Work for me\nAnd at 12 o'clock midnight you'll be working 42nd street\nOh my god I was totally stunned\nHe yanked me up slapped my cheek and put his hands on my buns\nI said huh you better watch it sucker\nI said to myself I got to go get my gun\nHe put me in this locker called me a b e and h\nLooked around noticed that there was no escape\nThey all left the room and went behind closed doors\nI pulled down got my briefcase that was on the floor\nFlipped the latch lift the lid pulled up my Smith-n-Wesson\nYes my shiny black loaded uh 357\nStepped out of the room dressed in fruit of the loom\nAnd said they all lay me down and hit me with this tune\nWhen they see my Smith-n-Wesson their eyes got bigger\nI relaxed latch off chilled back and pulled the trigger\nPicked up the briefcase broke out on the double\nLadies, guys of the world are full of trouble\n[Outro]\nCan't live with 'em can't live without 'emEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Time to Chill Lyrics[Fresh Prince]\nFor years I have been waitin and hesitatin to make a\nRap record, that had the pace of a\nSlow song, quiet storm, chillin while the fire is warm\nYou and your girl, with this record on\nYour radio or stereo, I don't know\nI love you so is what you'll be sayin, while this record's playin\nYou reminscin and kissin your girl\nRelax, lay back, unwind, because now it's time to chill\n\nSetting the mood, by the use of this groove\nIs an ingenious, perceptive, brilliant, a very clever move\nBecause the bass line, combined with the fresh rhyme\nAt a slow tempo entices passion to grow\nBut if it's not passion for which you search\nThen use the song as a massage after a hard day's work\nAnd if it's true that music calms the savage beast\nPlay this cut in the jungle and put the lions to sleep\nTake a deep breath, stretch, kick off your footwear\nPut on the tape of this record, but beware\nCaution, warning, it's your decision\nThere's nothin stronger that you can buy, without prescription\nIt's soothing, somewhat hypnotic\nA rhythmic anesthetic it's practically a narcotic\nYou want it?  We got it -- come get it we're widdit\nBecause it's all at the push of a button, yo Jeff, hit it!\nThe objective, of this musical extravaganza\nIs to enlighten you, stanza by stanza\nVerse after verse, have been precisely arranged\nRearranged and then changed until the best remained\nThe result being, this incredible song\nSo for at least eight hours a day, you'll have this record on\nIn the morning and at night in your room\nAnd all through the afternoon, you will be\nListening, mentally wrapped up in the cut\nSome people will sit down and some will choose to get up\nBut whatever you choose, just keep your ear to the wax\nBecause we got somethin def that other rappers lack\nWe haven't been able to put our fingers on what it is\nBut it's different and it's def and it appeals to kids\nAnd teens and adults and senior citizens too\nAnd I'd be willing to bet, that it appeals to you, too!\nSo if you're not into rap, give us a chance\nTo change your mind, and to make you dance\nTo this lyrical miracle, this musical discovery\nBut yo I wanna chill for a second, yo Jeff, cover me\n\nIt's like paradise, this music is nice\nIt makes you hot if you want it too, or twice as cold as ice\nIt brings love to the heart of a criminal\nWith this subliminal power, all the women'll\nFlock while all the guys rock, when it's on your box\nIt gained us a much bigger reputation than the White Sox\nYou may ask yourself are we that famous?\nBust this, the Queen of Spain knows what my real name is\nOur time is runnin short so I'll bid you farewell\nYou know this cut is so def, that you have been overwhelmed\nBe cool, be chill, relax, have no fear..\n.. I'm outta hereEmbed"

My name's Joe.\"\nI was lyin', so was she\nShe said her name was Donnie\nBut her shirt said Marie\nShe said, \"You get to know me\nYou'll never forget me.\"\nI said, \"Why?\" Then she bit me\nOuch!\nThat didn't hurt\nKinda kinky\nBut she ripped my shirt\nShe poisoned me (and) I went to sleep\nI woke up at her house\nIn the back of a Jeep\nA Blazer, '89\nTinted windows\nI wish it was mine\nOh, it is\nBut where are my keys?\nThere they are...in the ignition\n\nI'm at her house\nIt's a Teepee\nNo, it's a cabin\nNo, a skyscraper\nNo, it's an igloo\n... a shack\nForget it. I'll go around back\nIt's a castle with a moat\nHow I get across...boat\n\n(Twilight Zone noise)\nShooo...I hate that sound\nI went inside\nLooked right, looked left\nThere she is\nOh, no that's Jeff\nHe's invisible\nI went downstairs\nIt's a loft\nNo, it's a dungeon!\nThere she is, doing aerobics\nNo, yoga\nNo, that's karate\n\n*You killed my teacher!*\nBut what a body!\n\nNo, he wasn't there\nI'm telling you I saw 'em\nNo, really I saw 'em\nHe was playing checkers\nNo, Nintendo\nOk, I'm lying\n\nThere she is\nWatching T.V\nAll My Children\nNo, that's Cosby\nNo, Speed Racer\n... Shaft\nNo, that's Kimba\nMy fault...the T.V.'s off\nThere she is, what a doll\nNo, that's Chucky from Child's Play!\nI kissed her\nAnd she told me this was home\nI entered a dimension called The Twilight Zone\nWhere anything can happen\n\nI'm rough like sandpaper\nHard like algebra\nYou should be glad that I was nice\nAnd I allowed ya to\nStep on stage\nTo kick your rhymes off\nI tried to be nice\nBut you mistook that for softness\nNow it's over, to hell with your opinion!\nWhat I say goes from now on\nThis is my dominion!\nI dare any rapper to step on stage\nCause if you do you'll feel the force of my rage\nI'm on a rampage!\n\nPsych just kiddin'\nJeff wanted to do that\nBut I didn't\nI thought that it would make the record dumb\nI guess I wasn't wrong\n\nMary had a little lamb\nHer fleece was white as snow\nAnd everywhere that Mary went\nSo did Humpty Dumpty\n\nJack and Jill went up the hill\nTo fetch a pail of water\nJack fell down\nAnd broke his crown\nHickory, dickory, dock\n\nGot to use the bathroom now\nPsych, I was draftedEmbed"

He used to\nCome to my crib, and you know what we did?\nWe bugged out like two little kids, word\nJeff on the wheels, and me on the M-I-C\nA better combination there could never be\nSo let's go back, for old time's sake\nYo Jeff! (WHAT?) Pump up the bass!\nI . like . my . music . loud!\nThe volume, pumpin, the kickdrum thumpin\nThe people jumpin, up out there seats\nWhen this record comes on, you think something's wrong\nThe bass is too strong\nYou don't have to check your record, it's not defective\nIt's just the way we wanted it, pumpin! Get it?\nWe like it loud, strong like a magnum force\nI am the lyricist, Jeff is the rhythm source\nThis combination is virtually omnipotent\nThat means invincible, you know, dominant\nSo don't you cross our path, just stay out our face\nOr we'll knock you down, pump up the bass!\n\nYo Jeff man, how bout a funky scratch\n\nNow get funky with it\n\nNow bring in the snare\n\nNow break it down and bring it all back to me\n\nNow pump up the bass!\n\nI'm hyped -- psyched up\nAnd I'm flowin, so come on let's go in\nTo the next segment, of this hip-hop fantasy\nYou say this can't be happening, why can't it be?\nIt's an equation, mathematically correct\nIt's Jeff + Prince equals hit records\nIt sounds too easy? Word, I know it does\nYou wanna know why? Well yo it's cause\nMe and Jeff, oh, Jeff and I, excuse me\nBlend like Kool-Aid, and flow like an uzi\nThat's why we can't be taken or broken or braken, whatever\nAnd if you think we can, you're mistaken, we're clever\nCause what we did to make this record a hit\nWas turn down the treble, pump up the bass kick\nAt the same time the volume was increased\nAdding more strength, to this masterpiece\nOf poetry, by now you know it's me\nAll our creativity, pushin to our destiny\nI am on the M-I-C, Jeffery is the Disc Jockey\nAnd to keep us company, the human beat box Ready C\nBacked up by a family, and that is all we need\nSo that we can be successful as we want to be\nThe future is in front of me so here is a taste\nOf the future of hip-hop. Jeff, pump up the bass!\nYo Jeff one more scratch man\n\nReady Rock C man, give Jeff a handEmbed"

(You got it)\n(You got it)\n\n[Verse 3: The Fresh Prince]\nThe final night that I caught this girlie\nI was out of town and I came home early\nI caught her in a club kissin' some guy Fred\nStormed up right behind her, grabbed her and I said\n\"Yo Daliah! What's up, baby?\nCome on, you got to be crazy\nThat's your cousin? You think I'm a nut?\nWhat kinda cousin would you let put his hand on your butt?\nNah girl, you done got out of hand\nAnd it's about to seem like I'm the repo man\nYou vacuumed all of my funds like a rug\nBut you stretched the cord too far, you pulled the plug\nLet's what? Come on, it's too late to talk\nIt's like monopoly and I bought Cedar Boardwalk\nBut tomorrow you'll wake up and take a look\nAnd think the stock market crashed on your pocketbook\nBut it's over, now I want everything\nAll the way from Louis Vuiton bags to earrings\nEspecially the solid gold earring noodles\nAnd the diamond watch, the whole kitten kaboodle\nDon't tell me I'm trippin'\nOh, you got amnesia now, you're forgettin'\nWho did what for who, I gave my all to you\nI can't seem to see why you did wrong to me\nI finally figured out what you're about\nBut it's the bottom of the night, two strikes and two outs\nYou can go make a sucker of another fellow\nIt's 12:01, let's give it up, Cinderella\nI ain't goin for it, stop cryin'\nLike Ms. Melodie said: I ain't buyin' it\nGame over, girl, you finished clockin'\nYou wanted your walking papers? (You got it)\n(You got it)\n(Thought I was a donut)\t\t(3x)\n(Tried to glaze me)\n\n[until end]1Embed"

D...)\nBut now I'm the epitome\nHere for years and you can't get rid of me\nFrom the dark age into the renaissance\nThe rap obsession caused the regression\nBut one man stood up, and that man\u2019s me\nTo show you what it takes to be a real MC\nYou need [scratching] riggy-riggy rhymes and stiggy-stiggy style\nAnd if you fliggy-flow you get wiggy-wiggy-wild\nYou need to tiggy-tiggy take your take ya time to pursue it\nTill your riggy-riggy rhymes fliggy-flow like fluid\nChitty chitty bang bang chitty bang chitty\nI kick the nitty gritty for the people in the city\nHere's something that you'd best not miss\nAs we go a little somethin' like dis (Hit it!)\nCome on!\n[Hook]\nAha\n(As we go a little somethin like dis)\n\n[Verse 2: The Fresh Prince]\nYeahh the crowd rocks in the hoouuse\nTop feeling, hands to the ceiling\nAin't no playin around or sitting around\nOr standin around, clown, when I'm gettin down\nHeavy on bass, go lightly on the treble\nYou can't dig this then man you need a shovel\nWhere's the jam? I search like a hunter\nFind the party kick it like a punter\nBack in the day they used to judge a MC (On what?)\nBy how amped and loud the whole crowd would be\nI go 'uh', they go 'uh'\nIf I go 'yeah', they go 'yeah'\nYeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)\nIt's like a drug and I can't stand it\nMic like a pipe, music like a magnet\nIt's hip hop with a twist, uh\nAs we go a little somethin like dis\n(Hit it!) Come on!\n\n[Hook]\n(As we go a little somethin like dis)\n(Hit it)\nWord up\nWord up\n(As we go a little somethin like dis)\n(Hit it)\n[Verse 3: The Fresh Prince (DJ Jazzy Jeff)]\nIt's Jazzy Jazzy (Yo my name is Jeff)\nWell it's Jazzy Jazzy (Yo my name is Jeff)\nWell it's Jazzy Jazzy (Yo my name is Jeff)\n(And don't forget about my man the Fresh the Prince, kick it)\nGetu de dups de dit min e tin a harmen\nAnd edow ski dup nit up widu widout\nSit o to the funky did dat you can't mid who get hypnotized widup wid-ow gritu\nA mitay to eat wid-ow we di stit ow\nIt ain't what under test me sedi who do da best beat\nYou know, you know, what I'm talkin about\nBewede I didn't figure it out\n(Now pick it up)\nCause I'm superior, deffer than average, and stronger than many that (howled at?) me\nBut that is okay 'cause in time l will get the respect which is due to the greatest MC\nMy name is the Prince and don\u2019t ever forget it, you can\u2019t even if you try\n\u2018cause I\u2019m a hell-of-a-lover, a hell-of-a-fighter, an all-around-hell-of-a-guy\nYeah, can I do this? (Yeah, you just did it)\nTell em! Yo, can I do this? (Yeah, you just did it)\nNow here's somethin that ya just can't miss\nAs we go a little somethin like dis\n(Hit it!)

There was seven\nSeven whack crews in a football huddle\nTryin to figure out their next rebuttal\nThey came out strong, you'd think they are the ultimate\nBut we just dissed em and dismissed em, so now there's six\nSix whack crews, tryin to be tough\nWho the hell told em they could rock the mic like us?\nWe got straight down to business didn't pop no jive\nWe just {Whoosh} blew em out, so now there's five\nFive whack crews lined up in the hallway\nAll perpetratin like they're read to play\nMy secretary walked out, she asked for one more\nThey got scared, and left, so now there's four\nFour whack crews outside playin around\nI said I'll take you all on, now how does that sound?\nNot one had heart enough to pick up that mic\nI said, \"OK, I'll let you go, PSYCH!\"\nThat's the moral, of this story\nNever try to take me and Ready Rock's glory\nCause if you do, your future looks muddy\nCause you just can't beat me and my buddy\nHahah, word, uhh\nYeah, ay Ready Rock, hold up hold up hold up\nWait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute\nWhat man what?\nC'mon man, man, I wonder, can, can I just interrupt the record for a second?Embed"

Yo cut that out, son\n'Cause I'm a weapon, you heard what I said\nAnd I should have a danger sign on my forehead\n'Cause I'm lethal, fatal, unstable\nI'm nitro, standing in front of a mic cable\nWaiting to blow if there's a flicker of static\nTo ignite the fuse in the room, you feel the doom\nYou tried to break but there is no escape\nFrom the jaws of death you took the bait\nWait and if I say so you may go\nIt's like Mother May I\nMay you though? Hell no!\nGo ahead and play me if you think I'm a joke\nJust keep a brace around for when your neck gets broken\n'Cause you're gambling\nJust like craps at Trump\nGo ahead roll\nSnake eyes, you lost, chump\nThat's the way its gonna be every time\nYou try to go rhyme for rhyme\nYour rhymes against my rhymes are dope\nYour rhyming is weak, your rhyming is wack\nWherever you got it from I suggest that you take it back\nHold up Hobbes, you say you made it up\nThen cut your head off, because your brain sucks\nYou should a stayed back\nYou should a laid back\nYou Should a prayed that\nI didn't come back\nBut I came back\nRemember way back\nYou used to say that\nI wrote wack raps\nNow your screaming out somebody tame that\nLyrical cyclops\nYo Prince, please stop\nSomebody call the cops, go get you some eye drops\nNow here's a word for the wise, don't go into the light\nThat's how I get ya 'cause I'm a poetic poltergeist\nNow in ya mind is a vision\nThat's driven by my decision\nTo become an imaginational figment\nWhich gives me the freedom to explore\nAnd roam the realm of your mind\nAnd disappear when you look behind\nYou know I'm a gladiator\nAnd I really really hate a\nSucker stepping to me that's a p-p-p-perpetrator\nReally I'm the invader, t-t-t-terminator\nThat's like setting up do-dat-dat-n-detonator\nYou know what that was\nYou know that I'm def cause\nI just transformed it\nLike Jeff does\nFast like Flo Jo\nCrazy like Cujo\nBoth I and you know\nThat I'm numero uno\nMy crew is numero\nGrand number\nMy crew is numeroEmbed"

F him.\"\n\"F me yo what did i do?\nWatch your mouth man I don't even know you\nI'm a peaceful man real easy\"\nI said, \"Look you got a problem with me, B?\"\nHe said, \"Ya I don't like the way you act\nCars and jewelry and waving like you all that\nI ain't sweating you no matter who you are\"\nI ain't asked you to, homie\n\n---Chorus---\nX2\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star1Embed"

I don't know!\n\"No fool, that noise you was makin there!\"\n\"What this?!\"  *starts beatboxing*  \"Yeahhhh!\nThat was def man, where'd you learn to do that?\"\n\"Man, I don't know, I guess I always knew that\nI had this talent deep down inside\nYou wanna hear some more man?\"  \"Yeah!\" \"Come on let's take a ride\"\nHe made sounds like I never heard before\nAnd he still had more!\nThen he got me hyped when he played this incredible song\nAnd I lost my mind when Ready C played Donkey Kong\n[Interlude]\n*Ready Rock does the intro, Kong shaking the beams\nThe \"How High Can You Go?\" music, and the actual game sounds*\nYo Ready, get funky with it!\n*Ready gets busy on the beatbox*\nYo Jeff man what you doin'?  Give Ready a hand\n*Jazzy Jeff throws on another beat*\n\n[Verse 3: Fresh Prince]\nNow my life is wonderful and I feel great\nI haven't been in an arcade since '78\nThanks to Ready C I'm on an upward trail\nBecause he's always by my side, he never fails me\nWhenever I have a video attack\nHe's right there by my back, keepin' me on track\nSo if I bug out, and act like a lunatic\nHe does Donkey Kong, and as soon as it\nGets to my eardrums, from his vocal chords\nI get hyped up!\nNo matter how bored I am, he always comes through\nOh my fault, hold up, wait, let me tell you who\nReady Rock C is, here's a brief description\nOf the things that he can do in his musical position\nReady Rock C makes sounds with his mouth\nYo Ready give an example of what I'm talkin' about\n*Ready Rock beatboxes and then does Pac Man's death sound*\n\n[Outro]\nGame over!\nYo, Scram man, why you still standin' there?\nThe game is over, ha ha ha ha ha, sucker!Embed"

They just ain't get it\nThey didn't understand, they didn't quite see\nIt's all about adrenaline, straight up energy\nSo everybody say hey (hey)\nSo everybody say hey (hey)\nI wanna rip it J\n(Well homie go ahead man)\nI wanna rip it J\n(Well homie go ahead yeah)\nYo a super dooper\nParty trooper\nNever been a party pooper\nHeart breakin\nMoney makin\nMan they get them parties shakin\nMusic pumpin\nCrowd is jumpin\nGiving people what they want\nAnd always rhymin all the time and check it\nYo and now\nI wanted to make up a record\nThat I could just rock at the drop of a dime\nI wanted to make it so funky\nThat it would just stick in the back of your mind\nI wanted it simple so people could sing it\nAnd dance while they're bopping their heads\nSo gimme the uh, gimme the uh, gimme the uh, gimme the uh!

   "lyrics": "Trapped on the Dancefloor Lyrics[Verse 1: The Fresh Prince]\n\nYou're trapped on the dance floor\nIt's locked there's no escape\nThere's no eat no drink can't take a break\nNo seat to sit down you gotta stand up\nThe record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff\nYou're in a cage and this groove will bound you\nPeople in the club like bars around you\nThe doors open up and the people are pulled in\nHere are the prisoners the DJ is a warden\nYour mind is useless instinct takes control\nJam to techno groove to soul to soul\nYou been arrested, now you're being tested\nThe beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested\nSnare drum kicks like pistol in spinal\nYou gotta dance and get rammed like a rhino\nThe DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery\nSayin that the slice ain't nice that's perjury\nThe music infiltrates you and takes you\nGrabs you holds you molds you and makes you\nDo things you wouldn't have otherwise done\nLike shake rattle roll pump twist and then some\nAin't no law here you can't protest this\nStop looking around, there ain't no exits\nYou can't leave till the man pulls the needle\nTake that as a warning, take heed or I'll\nQuicken the pitch and make you dance faster\nThe drum is the whip, bass line is the master\nTemperature's hotter and yet you still want more\nYou're a slave and you're trapped on the dance floor\n[Chorus]\n\nOh oh I'm trapped like a fool I'm in a cage\nI can't get out\nCan't you see I'm trapped\nCan't you see I'm so confused\nI can't get out\n\nNow you're wandering lost in a jungle\nYou came in hyped up but now you're humble\nBringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes\nYou scream for help, blend in with the \"ow\"s and \"ho\"s\nYou try to sit but there ain't no spaces\nThe floor is a desert, a body oasis\nI know you're on the tip for the rhyme I just did\nBut here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid\n\n[Verse 2: El Sid]\n\nAy a prince it's the El Sid's version\nI'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon\nThe floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene\nThe strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine\nYou try to move no form of escape\nThe heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape\nParty's like a pimp\nGirls slim and trim on the floor\nDon't try to shoot for the door\nThis ain't the gym\nThe party goers every night had a scene\nThey might try to be fly but still trapped like Venus\nAin't a spiff or a spoof\nBoy you better not goof\nYou about to cave in although you ain't on a roof\nThe rhythm track from offside's to angles\nPlaying the wimp fight resist ... strangle\nYou can't escape until the DJ's banger's up\nSo play like a phone or coat and just hang it up\nThe speakers pumping out sounds and hip words\nLines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds\nYou better jam we don't care if you hardcore\nCause we got you trapped on the dance floor\n[Chorus 2x]\n\nMe and Prince got together just to kick our lines\nNo trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines\nDance floor secure, don't bother trying to get out\nYou looking for the late AM this man won't let out\nNobody cause killing is mean\nGot ya dancing in the dark and dressed like Springsteen\nRazzamatazz a pizazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh\n\n[Verse 3: Jazz Fresh]\n\nSoon as I worked through the door\nI got trapped on the dance floor\nSee this girlie that I never saw\nShe was looking raw\nCame a little closer\nThen I approached her\nThen I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her\nBreak the floor into flames it's the damn shame\nHard to explain\nI did it up like I was straight out of Soul Train\nListen as I discuss this yo bust this\nLike Hammer in front of a camera, you can't touch this\nTrapped on the floor like a vulture\nPart of my culture\nYou might even thought I would drive to falter\nGet live like the Jackson Five, Tito and Jermaine\nAdd a little Mike and Janet you can't understand it\nCause ham and Mike??? thought I was from another planet\nWay I'm whipping and dipping\nAnd sliding and slowly guiding to what I'm providing\nOther dancers go and hide\nLike Charles Manson\nI'm prancin'\nI keep you dancin' all night until\nThe party's over the party's over\nLike a cowboy at a rodeo\nCommence to make you do-si-do\nAround the dance floor\nStep to the new hardcore\nI'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped\n[Chorus]\n\nNext up to step up\nJust to keep this rep up\nThe time that he possesses the best in a contest\nDef with his right and left like Jazz Fresh\nNo other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff\n\n[Verse 4: DJ Jazzy Jeff]\n\nI'm the one dance floor at the station\n??? time around quarter to ten\nTime served hard\nThe customers scarred\nYour tickets to freedom\nYo you ain't gonna need 'em\nYour sentence is 25 years to life\nA bed and a pillow is your husband and wife\nTrapped behind the steel\nThe steel of the wheels\nDon't come to the party if you don't wanna know how prison feels\nI walk strong carry a big stick\nSell myself all packed in thick\nWhen they sound the drum you know its time to roll\nMight as well have fun there's no parole\nI set a trap and caught you like a mouse\nFor times ahead no chance for a halfway house\nPump the bass in all sections\nPrince, Sid, and Jazz my officers of correction\nCan't escape the floor cut the crime out\nFortified wall ain't no use trying to climb out\nCause I'm running this show and it's live in here\nYou try to escape another five years\nI got you trapped and I'm your savior\nYou dance real hard you might get out on good behavior\nBut if you don't I give you more\nCause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor\n\n[Chorus 2x]Embed"

   "lyrics": "Summertime \u201998 LyricsIntro/Chorus: *sung*\nSummer, summer, summertime\nTime to sit back and unwind\n\nVerse One: Fresh Prince\nHere it is the groove slightly transformed\nJust a bit of a break from the norm\nJust a little somethin' to break the monotony\nOf all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be\nA little bit out of control it's cool to dance\nBut what about the groove that soothes that moves romance\nGive me a soft subtle mix\nAnd if ain't broke then don't try to fix it\nAnd think of the summers of the past\nAdjust the base and let the alpine blast\nPop in my CD and let me run a rhyme\nAnd put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime\nChorus\n\nVerse Two: Fresh Prince\nSchool is out and it's a sort of a buzz\nBut back then I didn't really know what it was\nBut now I see what have of this\nThe way that people respond to summer madness\nThe weather is hot and girls are dressing less\nAnd checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best\nRidin around in your jeep or your benzos\nOr in your nissan stting on lorenzos\nBack in Philly we be ou in the park\nA place called the plateau is where everybody go\nGuys out hunting and girls doing likewise\nHonking at the honey in front of you with the light eyes\nShe turn around to see what you beeping at\nIt's like the summers a natural afrodesiac\nAnd with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme\nTo hit you and get you equipped for the summer time\n\nChorus\n\nVerse Three: Fresh Prince\nIt's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet\nHustle to the mall to get me a short set\nYeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair\nCause basketball courts in the summer got girls there\nThe temperature's about 88\nHop in the water plug just for old times sake\nBreak to ya crib change your clothes once more\nCause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4\nSitting with your friends cause y'all remincise\nAbout the days growing up and the first person you kissed\nAnd as I think back makes me wonder how\nThe smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia\nAll the kids playing out front\nLittle boys messin round with the girls playing double-dutch\nWhile the DJ's spinning a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion\nThen six o'clock rolls around\nYou just finished wiping your car down\nIt's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout\nIt looks like a car show\nEverybody come lookin real fine\nFresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon\nEvery moment frontin and maxin\nChillin in the car they spent all day waxin\nLeanin to the side but you can't speed through\nTwo miles an hour so everybody sees you\nThere's an air of love and of happiness\nAnd this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness\nChorusEmbed"

   "lyrics": "The Girlie Had a Mustache Lyrics(Get down)\n\n[Verse 1: The Fresh Prince]\nI was.. cruisin' down the avenue, early one Friday\nWhen I saw what I thought was a lady walkin' my way\nI turned my back to use my Binaca Blast\nAnd I said, \"Hm-hm, excuse me,\" and she walked past\nShe was about 5'6\", or maybe six and a half\nWith a body like a goddess, man, this girl was bad!\nTight leather pants that fit like a drum\nAnd two big - yeah well, she had some\nAnyway from behind she was fine\nBut when she turned around, her mustache was bigger than mine\nAt first I laughed, cause yo, to me that was funny\nBut the laughter ceased when she said: \"Hey honey!\"\nAt first I was confused, I was somewhat spell-bound\nMy mouth wide open and my chin on the ground\nAnd then it hit me, like a bolt from the sky\nI thought: hold up - wait - this girl is a guy?!\nI tried to get away, I said, \"Well, never mind\nMaybe I'll see you some other time\"\nBut then he grabbed me by my arm and told me I couldn't leave\nAnd said, \"Hey boy, you look mighty cute in them jeans!\"\nThis had to be the most embarrassing thing in the world\nMy whole neighborhood was watchin me get beat up by a girl\nAnd when my homeboys came, they didn't let me explain\nThey said, \"Prince, you're a sucker, you should be ashamed\"\nMy pride was busted right along with my eye\n'Cause my homeboys didn't realize that this girl was a guy\nAnd in retrospect I had to laugh\nI can't believe I didn't notice that this girlie had a mustache\n[Verse 2: The Fresh Prince]\nI remember last year, the day was October 5th\nAnd my family went away on a weekend ski trip\nAnd they left $100 and a note by the phone\nThat said: 'Don't have any company till we get home'\nNo company? I'm 18! They must be jokin'!\nAnd by 10 my crib was smokin'\nAll of my friends with their hands in the air\nScreamin' (PARTY OVER HERE, PARTY OVER THERE!)\nThe party was jammin' till at least about 5\nAnd as my friends were leaving, they were like \"Homes, it was live!\"\nI thought the party was over, but really was just beginnin'\nI turned around I thought I was dreamin', I saw four women\nDressed in red leather, tight to their booties\nI gestured with my index finger: come here, cuties\nI tried to be chill, I didn't wanna scare 'em\nI said, \"Hi, my name's the Prince,\" they said, \"Hi Prince, we're your harem\"\nI didn't waste time, I started shootin' the gift\nI said, \"Y'all the type of girls I'd like to spend some time with\"\nI walked upstairs, my adrenaline was pumpin'\nTill one hit me in the head with a lamp or somethin\nThe next thing I remember is wakin' up nearly dead\nWith another Fred Flintstone lump on my head\nOf course I was mad, this type of thing can burn at you\nThey tied me up and they were stealin' my furniture\nI said, \"Yo sweetheart, what's wrong with you?\nWhat kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do?\"\nShe turned around and smiled and laughed\nAnd that's the way that I noticed that the girlie had a mustache\nNot four girls, four guys!\nThey were in disguise, it was a set up all the time\nI made a complete fool of myself that day\nMy parents were pullin' up just as the u-haul truck was pullin' away\nThey walked in, looked like they seen a ghost\nThere I was, gagged and bound and tied to the bed post\nMy pop walked in and asked a brilliant question\n\"Son, where's the furniture and why is your room so messy?\"\nObviously Sherlock Holmes had been arrived\nI said, \"What do you think, dad, maybe we were robbed?!\"\n\"I'm tied up, nothing's in one piece\nLet's discuss the facts later, mom, please call the police\"\nI wanted to have a party, I thought I was clever\nMy pop told me I was on punishment forever!\nAnd in retrospect I had to laugh\nI can't believe I didn't notice that the girlie had a mustacheEmbed"

Why you askin' me?\nPrince: Nah, I ... I parked my car right here.  You're standing here. I ... Where's my car?\nJeff: I been here for about an hour and a half.  I ain't seen it\nPrince: 'Cmon man, stop playin' Jeff.  Where's my car at?\nJeff: No, I'm serious man.  It's not in my pocket.  I haven't seen you car\nPrince: Jeff, where's my car?  I parked my car right here, man!\nJef: I don't know!\n\n\nNow a joke is a joke and fun and games are chill\nBut this isn't funny y'all this is straight up ill\nNow there's a limit to humor and this has gone too far\nI ain't laughin no more y'all now who stole my car?\nNow I don't know if you ever had a car stolen before\nBut it's a real crazy feeling when you walk out the door\nAnd you don't need a map or any kinda chart\nTo know you're standin in the spot your car used to be parked\nNow you know you parked your car there but yet you keep lookin\nCause your mind didn't accept yet that somebody took it\nSo you're scratching your head and tryin to get things clear\nAnd there's always some idiot saying (you're sure you parked here)\nTo call the police would be the move that is smart\nBut instead you keep lookin where you know you didn't park\nSearchin for reasons like maybe tickets you owed\nSomething to justify that - maybe it got towed\nBut not stolen n-never forget it\nBut then you ask yourself well, \"Where the hell is it?\"\nIf there was a prize you'd win dummy of the year\nCause you're lookin somewhere else when you know you parked it here\nSo through never-neverland you find yourself strollin\nThen when you finally accept that it's stolen\nYou call the police and they come and say\n(That's the 437th car stolen today)\nAs if that's somethin that he really needed to mention\nThen they start askin you real dumb questions\nLike (well when's the last time that you saw it)\nYou idiot, right before they stole it\nNow you're mad this cop is talkin to you\nAnd somebody in your car headed to Kalamazoo\nOfficer Fool or whoever you are\nWould you please get off your butt and find who stole my car?\nI remember my first car, never forget it\nA candy apple red IROC, windows deep tinted\nTalk about fast like a rocket to drive\nWent from zero to 60 in like 5.5\nAnd matchin red rims but that wasn't enough\nIt had a car phone for when I wanted to reach out and touch\nAn Alpine stereo the straight up rock\nWith 12\" woofers you could hear for blocks\nThe first day I got it I was frontin real hard\nI could hear people sayin (damn, look at that car)\nI was hyped and I wanted my friends to check it out\nSo I went to the spot where they're usually hangin out\nJust my luck nobody's standin outside\nAnd I didn't really feel like parkin my ride\nSo I honked my horn and nobody was comin\nI thougth what the heck, I went inside and left it runnin\nI was inside for 20 seconds that's all\nI found my friends, I said, \"You gotta check this out, y'all\"\nBut when we came back out the car wasn't there\n(Man you ain't buy nothin) I did, I swear!\nMy friends went inside, I was mad they didn't believe me\nNow I'm standin outside the spot my car used to be\nIt's hard to figure out what to do all alone\nBut then I got it: call the car phone\n\n(Fresh Prince's car?)\nYo thief, bring my car back now\nBefore I bust your (hold up wait a minute pal)\n(Seems like you forgot who's got the keys)\nI thought: he's right, \"Well, bring it back, please\"\nHello Mr. Thief, don't hang up\nAw then luckily Jeff pulled up\nI told him what had happened someone stole my car\nI said, \"Come on Jeff, let's get him, he can't be far\"\nWe rode around for about 20 minutes\nAnd we were just about to say forget it\nWhen I spotted him, I said, \"Jeff, go get it!\"\nWe pulled up behind him and man dude jetted\nHe was drivin all wild and fast\nLike he was gettin points for the stuff that he crashed\nI called him on the car phone again and I said\n\"Of course you realize when I catch you you're dead\"\nAll through Philly was a high speed chase and\nDude was playin around like he thought we was racin\n100 miles an hour and he lost control\nAnd slammed my car into a telephone pole\nI ran to the car said man you're okay\nHe said yeah so I punched him in the face\nThe cops came up as if it was my fault\nThey saw me punch dude and charged me with assault\nIf his neck was closer I probably woulda grabbed it\nHe told the cops that I said he could have it\nI calmed down and they got things straight\nI saw half my car at 7th street the other half at 8th\nI wanted to just jump in the ocean\nMy car looked like it was a Lego explosion\nWhy does life have to be so hard?\nDon't laugh, next time it could be your carEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Everything that Glitters (Ain\u2019t Always Gold) Lyrics( *trumpet playing off-key notes* )\nAw man!\nPut that ol' dumb horn down\nHey, Jazzy\nJazzy\nShow this boy what some real music 'posed to sound like\nHe-he-ha!\n\n( *drums and horns set in* )\n1-2-3-4\n\n( *Jazzy Jeff starts scratching* )\n(Don't stop the rock)\n\nNow that's a record!\nNow that's a record!\nGo Jazzy, go Jazzy, go\n\nI want to be remembered for the songs that I sing\nNot only for the humor, but for the knowledge I bring\nTo broaden the horizons of others is why I rap this\nEnlightening minds with my lyrical tactics\nIn life everything ain't always what it seems\nBut people are enchanted by things that gleam\nYou know, bright fancy cars, big yachts and mansions\nOn the beaches of Aruba with a girlie romancin\nNow I'm about to tell you a very interesting fable\nMore fun than when you first got cable\nThe moral to be learned from this story to be told\nIs that everything that glitters ain't always gold\n\nOn July 11th I was sittin at home\nTalkin to my girlfriend Gina on the telephone\nFlippin through the newspaper checkin the news\nWhen I saw an advertisement for a Carribean cruise\nIt said, 'Sunny skies and romantic nights\nOn an incredible ship' - and I got hype\nIt said it's like the _Love Boat_, baskin in the sun\nPromisin fun for you and for everyone\nI said, \"That's dope! Baby, you're down?\"\nShe said, \"Yeah, we could leave right now!\"\nThe very next day I put the check in the mail\nAnd one week later we were ready to sail\nThe brochure said that the boat was large\nBut it was nothin but a  broken-down barnacle barge!\nAnd if it wasn't for my girlfriend, I wouldn'ta went\nBecause the captain was a cross-eyed hunchback with a limp\nThe cruise was paid for and the food was free\nSo I said what the hell and set out to sea\nIt didn't take long to notice something was wrong\nThe ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it\nI didn't wanna panic, so I chilled for a while\nTill the captain pulled up to what we thought was a deserted isle\nWe looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk\nWe saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts!\nThe said, \"Hung-a-dung-a-digi-dung-da-doa\"\nI said, \"Hey baby, I guess that means get off the boat\"\nTheir chief said they needed a human sacrifice\nI said, \"Well, just take my girl - he-he - psyche\"\nI was jokin, but things got serious\nTheir leader came out and he was curious\nHe got in my face and his breath was the worst\nI said, \"Hey baby, you got some mints in your purse?\"\nHis breath was stinkin with filthy brown teeth\nAnd two big crusty ashy hairy feet\nThe worst thing, he had no toenails on his toes\nAnd a big Pterodactyl bird bone in his nose\nI tried to reason with him, he wasn't with it\nHe said, \"Tenga-shanko,\" that meant 'forget it'\nHe said, \"Gunga-shang-tang-da-bong-da-boo\"\nThat meant 'tonight we're having Fresh Prince stew'\nThen I saw it - no, it's not\nThe big Indiana Jones people cooking pot!\nI wanted to fight em, but there was no way to beat em\nI thought to myself, 'Where's Tarzan when you need him?'\nJust as they were contemplatin cookin us up\nWe had a major struck of luck, a Navy ship pulled up\nThe troops came off and they got us out of the pot\nAnd I said to the chief, \"Yo, I get witcha, hops!\"\nThe guy that rescued us said, \"I hate to tell you\nThe captain of your ship, he had just escaped from Bellevue\nWe've been following him and finally we caught him\nWe're sorry, there's no way that you can possibly get a refund\"\nA thousand dollars and a weekend down the drain\nBut a lesson well learned, so let me explain\nThere's a very important message that needs to be told\nIt's that everything that glitters ain't always goldEmbed"

Come on!\nYeah! ha ha ha!\nUh!\nAight\n\n[Verse 1]\nHere's a little story 'bout a Friday night\nBuckwild, cause yo, that's kind of my style, check it\nOn the town with a girl named Kay\nBeing a bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie any way\nI was straight out illin\nWhy do I say so?  Cause yo, my girl was home chillin\nFancy restaurant me and Kay frontin\nIt was called Le....um, Ch\u00e9z...um, somethin\nI was ready to attack her, unh\nGiving the sexy look like Dracula\nA little bit of soft music playin\nAnd Dom Perignon, it was on, know what I'm sayin?\nEvery thing was lovely, but then\nWhat the damn, my girlfriend walked in!\nOh my goodness, danger, trouble, dread\nOh I'm dead, mayday, code red!\n[Verse 2]\nMy, oh my, what am I to do?\nGotta get away, cause my girlfriend's coming through\nUm Kay, I gotta... um, well, see...\nThere's... well, this, um... excuse me\nTo the back with the mucho-quickness\nMy girl's gonna kill me and leave no witnesses\nI'm in the bathroom hiding like a punk\nBut there's bars on the windows, I can't jump\nExit stage left, quickly plan B\nGotta find a way that my girl won't see me\nCrawling on the floor, I'm feeling sick\nLike this some old Charlie Chaplin flick\nHeart poundin around a mile-a-minute\nThis time I really done did it\nDown on my hands and knees on the floor\nI'm looking at the front door\nReady, set, make the dash\nHer back is turned, maybe I can get past\nI almost made it, but then, damn, she turned her head!\nCode red!\n\nAlright... got a little problem here... need assistance\nMayday...\n\nBreak it on down!\n(Get down!...)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll was perfect, the ship was sailin\nBut now it's sinking, so yo, I'm bailin\nI kept on runnin, even though she saw me\nAnd I sat and waited at home for baby to call me\nI watched a little TV\nPhone started ringing 'bout 12:23\nI picked it up real slow, and said:\n\"Mmmmm..hello?\"\nShe wasn't having it, she snapped, went bezerk\nGirl made my head hurt\nI tried to be as cool as I could be\nI said \"Hey, wasn't me\"\nBut she wasn't having that melody\nNeedless to say, she left me\nAnother brother just couldn't control his head, (the other one)\nCode redEmbed"

(Yeah, right!)\nJeff's about to give an incredible display\nAnd unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay\nHis name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparing to shake and make you move\nTo this long and strong theme song, Jazzy's Groove\n\nAnd it'll (make em clap to this)\n(Make em clap to this)\nHey yo, Jeff\n(Come on, yeah)\nAnd it'll (make em clap to this)\nAnd it'll (make em clap to this)\n(Come on, yeah)\nYou know, a lot of deejays, they're just show pieces or statues\nMy deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you\nTo other deejays Jeff is just too much\nHe doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch\nNever missing beats, always on time with the rhyme\nYou know the scratches are fine when intertwined with a bass line\nLive in concert, Jeff is never Memorex\nYou don't believe he's def? Check the flex\n\n[ Jeff cuts up ]\n(Don't stop to the rhythm, cause I..)\n\nI could talk forever, but still never explain\nWhy deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name\nJeff is number one, even though he just begun\nRuling hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun\nWe make records, it all adds up a kaleidoscope\nWe work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope\nSome music makes you shake, some makes you move\n(Now here's what I want y'all to do...)\nThis beat is dope and it's called Jazzy's Groove\n\n(Come on, yeah)\n(Na-na-na-na)\n(Come on, yeah)\n(Now here's what I want y'all to do)\n(Na-na-na-na)\n(Break)\n\n(The uncannible)\t(3x)\n\n(Break)\n(Break)\n(Break)\n(Breakdown)\n\nMusic has a tendency, a way of making you feel it\nIt's been a secret and Jeff is about to reveal it\nHe'll get you hype, no deejay is def as Jeff is\nHe makes you smile and bow while he's flexin\nHe's a magician of sorts, it's kind of a sport\nJeff houses the wheels like Michael Jordan the courts\nAsk who's the best and people'll say that Jeffrey is\nHere's a math lesson, so you can all see how def he is\n(1) plus (1) is (2)\n(Once again back is the incredible)\nAnd (2) plus (1) is (3)\n(The music just turns me on)\nAnd (2) plus (2) is (4)\n(Play it on the radio)\nAnd (1) plus (2) is (3\n4\nHit it!)\n(Breakdown)\n\nLook, it's simple, just admit it\nJeff is the deffest, you wanted a battle, forget it\nYou're a fool, you're slippin, you're looney, you're crazy\nNo ifs, no ands if he tests your butt, baby\nThe music is dope, don't fight it, just give in\nHey yo Jeff, man, tell 'em why you did it\n(I made the beat hype, but still kinda smooth)\nAnd it's dope, right? (For sure) Jazzy's Groove\n\n(It goes 'Oooh' (Oooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt goes 'Oooooh' (Oooooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt goes 'Oooh' (Oooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt'll make you go 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'\n(Na-na-na-na)\nHere we go\n'Oooh' (Oooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt'll make you go 'Ooh' (Ooh)\nNa-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)\nMake you go 'Ooh' (Ooh)\nNa-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)\nIt'll make you go 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'\n(Na-na-na-na)\nHere we go)\n\nJazzy's Groove1Embed"

Huh - don't even try it!\n\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nWord man\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nMan, people are a trip, man\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nPut everybody down about what's up with that\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nYo word, man\nI gotta let em know\nI gotta\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nBust this\n\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nI used to know this girl by the name of Theresa\nI did all I could to make her release her\nEmotions to me, but she just wouldn't do it\nShe built up a wall and I couldn't break through it\nI used to walk to school every day of the week\nWatchin Theresa walk on the other side of the street\nOne day I finally got my heart up to speak\nBut she dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek\nSo I bought six bottles of new fancy cologne\nBut all I got from Theresa was (Leave me alone!)\nI bought new clothes to wear everyplace\nBut all Theresa would say was (Get out of my face!)\nSo I gave up this quest for Theresa\nBut then on the day my record was released, a\nStrange thing happened when it came on the radio\nTheresa broke her neck just to say (Hello..)\nI looked at her, I said, \"You must be foolish\nWhy did you ignore me on the way to school if\nYou were interested?\" She said (Oh, I apologize)\nI looked deep into her dark brown eyes\nI said, \"You ignored me for months on and\nNow all of a sudden you wanna be my friend?\nYou didn't talk before, so don't talk now, be quiet\nWhat, you really like me? Huh - don't even try it!\"\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nMan - she had a lotta nerve, man\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nWord man\nHey man, but she ain't had half as much nerve as that old record producer, man\nRemember when he dissed us, man?\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nWhat - what up?\n\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nWhen I first started rappin I had one idea\nAnd it was set in my mind very vivid and clear\nI knew that I wanted to be a rap artist\nI would give my all and work my hardest\nBut when I took my song to a record producer\nHe told me that I better go drink some rap juice, or\nSomething, cause my song was really absurd\nHe said that it was the worst trash that he'd ever heard\nYou know my ego was shattered, he busted my groove\nI could hear him crackin up as I left the booth (Ha-haaa!)\nI thought my song was good but he busted my bubble\nThe title was 'Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble'\nLuckily I found someone who had faith\nHe lifted my ego back up into place\nHis name was Dana Goodman and he thought my song was on track\nSo two weeks later it was out on wax\nIt busted up the charts like a hydrogene bomb\nUp, up, up, up it clim-clim-climbed\nI made people eat the words that said I couldn't achieve\nNow they had no choice but to believe\nIn me, then no sooner than my record came out\nThat same old producer started callin my house\nOne night he called me 'bout at half past 12\nHe said, \"I've got some cash if you wanna sell\"\nI said, \"You big, stupid, half-wit idiot\nI told you before that my record was a hit\nBut you just laughed like I was some kind of kid\nNow don't you regret what you did?\nI wish you'd get off my tip, yes, that's my request\nYou see, he who laughs last, always laughs best\nOkay, I'll be reasonable - You wanna buy it?\nOkay, I'll sell it - psych - don't even try it!\"\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nHa-ha\nThat's how you gotta put it to him\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nWord man, that's how you gotta..\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nYou know what?\nLet me tell you something\nI got dissed so hard, man\nBust this\nI'ma tell YOU what's up\n\n[ Jazzy Jeff (& Fresh Prince) ]\nYo Prince - do you remember when we first started out\nHow we used to go to all the parties just to rock the house?\n(Word man, I remember those good days well)\nWhy chill out, man, cause I got a story to tell\nAbout five years ago I began my quest\nTo be the best deejay in the whole U.S\nThere was a lot of deejays strivin for my spot\nThey would put me down every chance they got\nNever cut me a break on any given night\nThey used to all look at me and say (Pfsss.. Jeff's aight)\n(But when your 'Magnficient Cuts' were released\nAll of that laughter ceased)\nWord\n(When you and I used to do our shows\nAll the crowd would say was 'HO, HO, HO')\nYeah, time after time we were tearin it up\nWhile you rocked the mic and I rocked the cut\nBut now that I'm makin a name for myself\nAll those deejays are like (Yo Jeff, what's up?)\nBut all that stuff is dead, no, I ain't with it\nThey approach me on the street and say (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a ticket\nMan, to your very next show?)\nBut I say no and I tell em where they can go\nI can't believe that they had the nerve\nTo hop on my tip now! (Yeah man, word)\nJust the other day homebody approached me on the street\nAnd said (Yo Jeff, how 'bout a record for free?)\nI said, Man, the way you dissed me, you better go buy it!\n(But Jeff - we're friends) For real? Don't even try it!\n\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nHey man, I'm tellin you\nStraight up\nYou know how it is, man\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nMan people\nPeople are a trip, man\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nMaybe they'll know next time not to dis people\nKnawmsayin?\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nWe told em\nWe let em know\n[ Jazzy Jeff ]\nCause I ain't with it, man\nThat stuff is dead\n[ Fresh Prince ]\nDig it\nAight Jeff, chill, man\nAightEmbed"

(DOG)\nI'm a dog, right? oh, okay well um, RUFF (RUFF)\n[Chorus]\nYou ain't nothin but a dog\n(Is a dog, is a dog, is a dog)\nYou ain't nothin but a dog\n(Is a dog, is a dog, is a dog)Embed"

   "lyrics": "Just Rockin\u2019 LyricsEach and every day when I come home from school\nLike clockwork I go up into my bedroom\nI secure the door and it's the moment of truth\nI flip on my sound system and let the bass loose\nThe earthquake bass makes the walls all tremble\nA discotheque is what my room resembles\nHow loud it gets to me it does not matter\nI open up the windows so the glass don't shatter\nThe blast falls off my neighbour's wall\nMy phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls\nBut I just let it ring and I don't go near it\nI turn the volume up so that I can't hear it ring\nMy ear drums rumble my lungs vibrate\nI'm in my own world and this realm is great\nWe rock this power at my command\nThe decibels exceed the limits human ears can stand\nThe lower frequency better known as bass\nSitting nice with the treble at a jazzy pace\nMy neighbours complain they say they can't endure\nThey form a congregation outside my front door\nMothers who yell saying its too loud\nStart banging on my door to turn it down\nMy response to my mother when she starts knockin\nIs come on mum I'm just rockin\n[Rockin']\n[Ready, rock C]\n\nThis style that's mine is rarely heard\nSuddenly there is an opportunity to observe\nPeople gots my rhyme the super computer\nThe literary genius rhyme ruler of the future\nI'm the fresh prince slaying all emcee\nSo hold the red cup when we take to your knees\nPay home submit you can't defuse my scheme\nCause I'm the fresh prince and this is my regime\nTo all other rappers you're being subdued\nI don't mean to be rude but this is my prelude\nThis introductory performance has just one plot\nA sample jeff and about me and my DJ rocks\nI'm not listening to reason so don't try to talk\nDo yourself a favour and take a walk\nOr I'll amputate your mic and repossess your core\nI'm the man salute to the prince the power lord\nMy friends I'll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and\n\nI'll strangle you\nI'm the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator\nI'm like a bomb and my turbo is the detonator\nThe crown chief of the poetry industry\nVocabulary that to others is a fantasy\nHighly respected by the public at large\nThe prince will rock is taking charge\nI'm like a tiger in a battle field I'm invincible\nYou want a battle me man be sensible\nI'll never submit to any other emcee\nBe a duel to the death either him or me\nAnd as I verbalise to my DJ's cut\nIf we kill a wack crew or two so what\nWe just rock it\nWe just rock it\nDJ Jeff\nBreak 2\n\nOn each occasion that I perform\nThe force captures my body like a magical storm\nSuddenly I'm rendered helpless in a state of shock\nBut it is rather abrupt when I start to rock\nAdrenalin rushes my ego swells\nAnd the yells of the crowd make my hype excel\nMy metabolism quickens my body gets sense\nThat's when I metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince\nAnd as I display all my lyrical beauty\nYou become a slave as your hype increases\nAnd as I vocalise I can see it in your eyes\nYou stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the\n\nMark of red\nYou scream oh my to what the prince just said\nAs my energy is drained from being so crushed\nAll of a sudden I get another adrenalin rush\nIt happens each and everytime that my dj spins\nMore commonly known as my second wind\nThe spotlights are beaming\nYou are screaming\nFrom my body all the sweat is streaming\nCommanding the stage\nAnd perpetually frayed\nGiving my all to the pulse of\nOne hundred percent everytime I rhyme\nWhen I step off the stage that's when the stop\nAnd that has been the account of the evenings events\nReporting to you live by me the fresh prince\nI'm the latest that you heard so you may seem shockin\n(what does it all mean)\nI'm just rockin\nRockin rockin rockin\nGo crazy\n\n[Fresh]Embed"

(Yes)\nAre you ready to start things off yet?\n[Scratching] All right, bet\nClap your hands and dance, come on, let's do this\nHere is a hip-hop track with a new twist\nDesigned to ignite your subliminal dance fuse\nAnd even if you can't dance, you can't lose\nIt's for everybody, you included\nWe hooked up a beat and a rhyme and EQ'd it\nWe put it on a tape and took it to wax\nAnd then we-- yo Jeff, where's my beat at?\nOh, there it is, back to the storyline\nThe music and rhyme are designed to make you have a [good time]\nAt the party, or wherever you hear it pumpin'\nGet up and twist or breakdance or shake somethin'\nYo man, this groove is all o'that\nAnd it's different from anything we've done, in fact\nI might even go as far as to say\nThis cut shines bright on the darkest day\nAnd sometimes you really need some light\nLike when your teacher or boss ain't actin' right\nThis will quench your thirst to chill, it hits the spot\nGive em a taste, yo Jeff, let the beat rock\n\n[Break: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend']\nNow Brother Jazzy\nPlease enlighten us with a bassline\n( *Jazzy Jeff lets the bassline play* )\nAnd for all the people assembled before us\nBrother Jazzy, scratch\n( *Jazzy Jeff cuts* )\n\n[ The Fresh Prince ]\nWe're at the top, not the bottom or the middle\nWe're the freshest, the deffest, the best\nJeff, cut it up a little\n\n(Oh, I getcha, you wanna dance!)\n\n[Verse 3: The Fresh Prince]\nAhhhh... The time is now to get up and dance and move\nAnd clap and jump and jam and feel the groove\nI want you wigglin' and jigglin' and stompin' and shakin'\nAnd showin' your approval for the records me and Jeff are makin'\nWe got a brand new album out\nAnd dancin' and shakin' and movin' is what it's all about\nWe want everybody to get busy\nYou're not down with rap? Then get with it\nThis is a new age, history turned a new page\nThey said that we would decay and I say who do they\nThink they're dealing with, a couple of amateurs?\nI'm willin' to bet\nYou'll hear this jam at your job\nAnd at your school dance and also on the radio\nWinter inside the house, summer on the patio\nLet me get out of here before I lose it\nBut remember the motto, y'all: dance to the music\n[Outro: The Fresh Prince acting as 'The Reverend']\nNow now, ladies and gentlemen of the congregation\nWe realize you may not be in a position to get up and dance right now\nSo we'd like to ask of you, if you're in your car, honk your horn\nHonk your horn to the rhythm\nWe'd like to ask, if you're behind a desk at your job\nWe'd like you to tap your pen and pencil to the rhythm\nIf you're walkin' down the street\nYou can be a little discreet\nAnd snap your fingers to the beat\nBut if you are in a position\nTo get up and dance\nWe'd like to ask you to wiggle and jiggle everything you got\nAnd get involved with it\nThis has been the Reverend signin' off\nSignin' off\nSignin' offEmbed"

That means\nThat there's three of us, one for all and all for one\nAnd we're takin it to the top before we get done\nI'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find\nIt ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine\nI insist on a rise and I despise a decline\nOn the day I descend, that's the day I resign\nI'm creatin my trends and innovatin my rap\nWhy is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!\nMy personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre\nMy advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it\nCause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp\nJust set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have\nAnything that you want, the sky is the limit\nStop lunchin around, get up and go get it\nCause I came a long way from the past till today\nNow I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way!\nI came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot\nAnd no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the topEmbed"

Who? What? Why? When?\nDon't be looking around clown, that's right, I'm back again\nWith the dopeness, you're head is bopping isn't it?\nYeah I thought so. Yo, I'm just kickin' it\n[Chorus]\n(Yeah...)\n(Just kickin' it)\nYeah, Yeah\nI'm just kickin' it!\n(Just kickin' it)\nJust watch me, y'all\nI'm jus kickin it\n(Just kickin' it)\nUh, yeah, yo, I'm just kickin it\n\n[Verse 2]\nPrepare for a voyage, just close your eyes\nWho ain't ready, holler out; I\nWell ain't nobody hollering, \u2018cause all is perfect\nThe groove is a wave, and my rhyme's a surfing\nThe track design with a rhyme in mind\nBidi budup up up, the charts we'll climb\nEvery other rapper trying to get you to jump\nBut when you're all done jumpin', I'mma get you what you really want\nTrack by track displaying my ability\nThe man, FP, showing true dexterity\nOn the mic, no rules, I'm lawless\nWicked when I kick it and my rhymes are flawless\nSo sit back, relax and allow me to rock ya\nWith a hit that you're gonna get mentally locked to\nA hip hop solid, an all pro flower\nI throw stuff together better than Noah\nA cut, to kick it to, kind to the ear drum\nAll true poetry, from me you'll be hearin' some\nSo extra, extra, read all about it\nI'm slapping the hell out of those that doubt it\nI'm rippin' every city I been in\nCoast to coast, not to boast, but I'm winning\nMy fans are powerful, and that's the way I'm living\nAll without effort y'all\nYo, I'm just kickin' it!\n[Chorus]\nUh (Just kickin' it)\nYeah, yeah, I'm just kickin' it\n(Just kickin' it)\nCome on! Come on, I'm just kickin' it\n(Just kickin' it)\nYo, I'm just kickin it'\n(Just kickin' it)\n\n[Verse 3]\nLet's take a trip, mellow out while I'm rappin'\nYour mind is the boat and my rhyme's the captain\nSo hoist a sail, and it's time to flow\nTo a place that other rap boats don't go\nWelcome, welcome, into my territory\nEverybody get on up, and get busy for me\nHeads are boppin hard and fast\nAnd now I'm getting' sued \u2018cause my groove caused whiplash\nEvery time I rhyme I try to\nSay something smooth, that'll move inside you\nThe way that you should feel when you hear a real rap\nIs trapped in the rhyme and your climbing to the climax\nA lyrical painter, the Fresh Prince\nAnd y'all in awe of my Picasso essence\nMusical passion, lovely isn't?\nBut it ain't nothing to it\nYo, I'm just kickin it\n[Chorus]\n(Just kickin' it)\nJust check me, check me, just kickin it\n(Just kickin' it)\nLike Pronto y'all, I'm just kickin' it\n(Just kickin' it)\nUh, uh, I'm just kickin' it\n(Just kickin' it)\nYo, I'm out\n\n(Just kickin' it)\n(Laa-aha)\n(Just kickin' it)\n(He-he-he-ha)\n(Just kickin' it)Embed"

   "lyrics": "Parents Just Don\u2019t Understand - Single Edit Lyrics[Intro]\nYou know parents are the same no matter time nor place\nThey don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue, parents just don't understand\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remember one year\nMy mom took me school shopping\nIt was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister\nAll hopped in the car\nWe headed downtown to the Gallery Mall\nMy mom started bugging with the clothes she chose\nI didn't say nothing at first\nI just turned up my nose\nShe said, \u201cWhat's wrong? This shirt cost $20\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!\u201d\nThe next half hour was the same old thing\nMy mother buying me clothes from 1963\nAnd then she lost her mind and did the ultimate\nI asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!\nI said, \u201cMom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep\u201d\nShe said, \u201cYou're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, let's put these clothes back, please\u201d\nShe said \u201cNo, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show\u201d\nI said, \u201cThis isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer\nMom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers\nBut if you don't want to I can live with that but\nYou gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks\u201d\nShe wasn't moved - everything stayed the same\nInevitably the first day of school came\nI thought I could get over, I tried to play sick\nBut my mom said, \u201cNo, no way, uh-uh, forget it\u201d\nThere was nothing I could do, I tried to relax\nI got dressed up in those ancient artifacts\nAnd when I walked into school, it was just as I thought\nThe kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought\nAnd those who weren't laughing still had a ball\nBecause they were pointing and whispering\nAs I walked down the hall\nI got home and told my Mom how my day went\nShe said, \u201cIf they were laughing you don't need them\n'Cause they're not good friends\u201d\nFor the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom\nThat I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times\nSo to you all the kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue\nParents just don't understand\n[Verse 2]\nOh-kay, here's the situation\nMy parents went away on a week's vacation and\nThey left the keys to the brand new Porsche\nWould they mind?\nUmm, well, of course not\nI'll just take it for a little spin\nAnd maybe show it off to a couple of friends\nI'll just cruise it around the neighborhood\nWell, maybe I shouldn't...\nYeah, of course, I should\nPay attention, here's the thick of the plot\nI pulled up to the corner at the end of my block\nThat's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking\nI picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking\nYou should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions\nI honked my horn just to get her attention\nShe said, \u201cWas that for me?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYeah\u201d\nShe said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nI said, \u201cCome on and take a ride with a helluva guy\u201d\nShe said, \u201cHow do I know you're not sick?\nYou could be some deranged lunatic\u201d\nI said, \u201cC'mon, toots, my name is the Prince\nBesides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?\u201d\nShe agreed and we were on our way\nShe was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word\nWe hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive\nWe ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes\nShe kicked her shoes off onto the floor\nShe said, \u201cDrive fast, speed turns me on\u201d\nShe put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas\nWe almost got whiplash, I took off so fast\nThe sunroof was open, the music was high\nAnd this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh\nShe had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far\nI guess that's why I didn't notice that police car\nWe're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche\nAnd to make this long story short - short\nWhen the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell\nI said, \u201cI don't have a license but I drive very well, officer\u201d\nI almost had a heart attack that day\nCome to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway\nI was arrested, the car was impounded\nThere was no way for me to avoid being grounded\nMy parents had to come off from vacation to get me\nI'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me\nMy parents walked in\nI got my grip, I said, \u201cAh, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?\u201d\nThey didn't speak - I said, \u201cI want to plead my case\u201d\nBut my father just shoved me in the car by my face\nThat was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived\nThey took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving\nI can't believe it, I just made a mistake\nWell parents are the same no matter time nor place\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nTake it from me, parents just don't understandEmbed"

I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya\nWe're your first, last and only line of defense\nAgainst the worst scum of the universe\nSo don't fear us, cheer us\nIf you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless\nM.I.B.s, freezin' up all the flack\n(What's that stand for?) Men in black\n\nUhh M\nThe Men in black\nThe Men in black\nLet me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me\nJust bounce it with me, c'mon\nLet me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me\nJust slide with me, c'mon\nLet me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me\nTake a walk with me, c'mon\nAnd make your neck work\nNow freeze\n\nOoaaoo\n\nHere come the men in black (men in black)\nThe galaxy defenders\nRight on, right on\nHere come the men in black (men in black)\nThey won't let you remember (ohh no)\n\nAlright check it, let me tell you this in closin'\nI know we might seem imposin'\nBut trust me, if we ever show in your section\nBelieve me, it's for your own protection\n'Cause we see things that you need not see\nAnd we be places that you need not be\nSo go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap\nShow love to the black suit, 'cause that's the men in\nThat's the men in\nHere come the men in black (here they come)\nThe galaxy defenders (galaxy defenders)\nHere come the men in black (oh, here they come)\nThey won't let you remember (won't, let you, remember)\nHere come the men in black (oh, here they come)\nGalaxy defenders (oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)\nHere come the men in black\nThey won't let you rememberEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Girls Ain\u2019t Nothing But Trouble - Single Version Lyrics[Intro]\nListen homeboys, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Verse 1]\nJust last week when I was walking down the street\nI observed this lovely lady that I wanted to meet\nI walked up to her I said hello\nShe said: \"Hey, you're kind of cute\" I said: \"Yes, I know, but...\nBy the way, sweetheart, what's your name?\"\nShe said: \"My friends like to call me Exotic Elaine\"\nI said: \"My name is the Prince\" and sh\u0435 said: \"Why?\"\nI said: \"Well, I don't know, I'm just a hell of a guy!\nBut enough about m\u0435, yo, let's talk about you\nAnd all the wonderful things that you and I can do\"\nI popped some trash and in a little bit of time\nI showed some cash and the girl was mine\nI took her over town, I wined her and dined her\nShe asked me 'did I like her?' I said: \"Well... kinda\"\nAll of a sudden, she jumped out her seat\nSnatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street\nShe started grabbin all over me, kissin' and huggin'\nSo I shoved her away, I said: \"You better stop buggin'!\"\nShe got mad, looked me dead in my face\nThrew her hands in the air and yelled out: \"Rape!\"\nI got scared when she started to yell\nSo I handed her my wallet and ran like hell\nI was duckin' through alleys right and left\nBut when the cops caught up, they almost beat me to death\nI was arrested, charged with aggravated assault\n(Hey, yo Clancy, we got him!) But it wasn't my fault!\n[Chorus]\nNevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was in a bar one Friday night\nCoolin', watchin' a Mike Tyson fight\nI was maxin' and relaxin', sippin' on tequila\nWhen this girl walked up, she said: \"Hi, my name is Sheila\"\nI responded by saying hello\nShe paid for my drink and then said: \"Let's go\"\n20 minutes later, things were starting to cook\nAs we pulled up into her house, I said: \"I'm with you, toots\"\nThe music was soft and there was wine in the glasses\nShe started winking and making little passes\nAt me, she grabbed me close and that's when she got bold\nShe started feeling up my back, I said: \"Oh, your hands are cold!\"\nWe went into her bedroom thinking of one thing\nTook the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring\nI caressed her body and I kissed her cheek\nAnd that's when I observed those satin bed sheets\nI felt that it was time for me to make my move\nI thought I better hurry up before I busted the groove\nI leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue\nA door slammed and a voice said \"Baby, where are you?\"\nHer boyfriend busted in, he grinned an evil grin\nAnd said: \"Boy, I'ma tear your butt limb from limb!\"\nI was scared as hell, where was I supposed to go?\nI just yelled: \"Geronimo!\" and jumped out the window\nJust my luck we were in a snow storm\nAnd all I had was my underwear on to keep my warm\nAnd to top the night off, I had to break in my place\nBecause my keys were in my pants back on Sheila's book case\nI was done, sneezin' and coughin'... (Aaa-choo!)\nI hope this doesn't happen too often, but\n[Chorus]\nNevertheless, don't mean to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme and get the hell away\n\n[Spoken Interlude: DJ Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince]\nYo man, you think they see your point?\nI don't know, I don't think they really get it, man...\nI think you should give 'em another example!\nAight, give me a scratch, let's make it funky right here...\n\n[Verse 3]\nI got a ring on my phone, May 5th last year\nIt was my girlfriend Betty, I said: \"Hello dear!\nI was just about to call you\nI got a couple tickets to the Run-D.M.C. concert\" (I'm wit' it)\n\"It's six o'clock now, at eight will you be ready?\" (Yeah)\n\"Aight, fine, see you then, Betty\"\nI combed my hair, washed, and brushed my teeth\nGot funky fresh dressed in my Le Coq Sportif\nGot to Betty's at eight, I was ready to jet\nUntil Betty's mom said: \"Betty's not ready yet!\"\nI sat there for at least an hour\nIt was ten after nine before she got in the shower\n9:35, she comes downstairs\nAnd said: \"I need a little longer to finish my hair\"\nAt ten o'clock, we had been missed the show\nShe comes downstairs and says 'let's go'!?\n\"Go where? Go to sleep, I'm gone!\"\nI was steamin' like a demon as I drove home\n[Chorus]\nBut it just goes to show not trying to bust your bubble\nBut girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble\nSo next time a girl gives you the play\nJust remember my rhyme\nJust remember my rhymes\nTake heed to my rhymes and get the hell away!\n\n[Outro: DJ Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince]\nMan, first your parents just don't understand...\nI know, right, man...\nThen you have these crazy nightmares...\nLook, why me? Why me?...\nWhat's next?\nNot these girls man, but... you know how it is... can't live wit' 'em..\nCan't live without 'emEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Parents Just Don\u2019t Understand - Edit Lyrics[Intro]\nYou know parents are the same no matter time nor place\nThey don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue, parents just don't understand\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remember one year\nMy mom took me school shopping\nIt was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister\nAll hopped in the car\nWe headed downtown to the Gallery Mall\nMy mom started bugging with the clothes she chose\nI didn't say nothing at first\nI just turn\u0435d up my nose\nShe said, \u201cWhat's wrong? This shirt cost $20\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!\u201d\nTh\u0435 next half hour was the same old thing\nMy mother buying me clothes from 1963\nAnd then she lost her mind and did the ultimate\nI asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!\nI said, \u201cMom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep\u201d\nShe said, \u201cYou're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, let's put these clothes back, please\u201d\nShe said \u201cNo, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show\u201d\nI said, \u201cThis isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer\nMom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers\nBut if you don't want to I can live with that but\nYou gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks\u201d\nShe wasn't moved - everything stayed the same\nInevitably the first day of school came\nI thought I could get over, I tried to play sick\nBut my mom said, \u201cNo, no way, uh-uh, forget it\u201d\nThere was nothing I could do, I tried to relax\nI got dressed up in those ancient artifacts\nAnd when I walked into school, it was just as I thought\nThe kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought\nAnd those who weren't laughing still had a ball\nBecause they were pointing and whispering\nAs I walked down the hall\nI got home and told my Mom how my day went\nShe said, \u201cIf they were laughing you don't need them\n'Cause they're not good friends\u201d\nFor the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom\nThat I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times\nSo to you all the kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue\nParents just don't understand\n[Verse 2]\nOh-kay, here's the situation\nMy parents went away on a week's vacation and\nThey left the keys to the brand new Porsche\nWould they mind?\nUmm, well, of course not\nI'll just take it for a little spin\nAnd maybe show it off to a couple of friends\nI'll just cruise it around the neighborhood\nWell, maybe I shouldn't...\nYeah, of course, I should\nPay attention, here's the thick of the plot\nI pulled up to the corner at the end of my block\nThat's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking\nI picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking\nYou should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions\nI honked my horn just to get her attention\nShe said, \u201cWas that for me?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYeah\u201d\nShe said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nI said, \u201cCome on and take a ride with a helluva guy\u201d\nShe said, \u201cHow do I know you're not sick?\nYou could be some deranged lunatic\u201d\nI said, \u201cC'mon, toots, my name is the Prince\nBesides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?\u201d\nShe agreed and we were on our way\nShe was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word\nWe hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive\nWe ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes\nShe kicked her shoes off onto the floor\nShe said, \u201cDrive fast, speed turns me on\u201d\nShe put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas\nWe almost got whiplash, I took off so fast\nThe sunroof was open, the music was high\nAnd this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh\nShe had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far\nI guess that's why I didn't notice that police car\nWe're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche\nAnd to make this long story short - short\nWhen the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell\nI said, \u201cI don't have a license but I drive very well, officer\u201d\nI almost had a heart attack that day\nCome to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway\nI was arrested, the car was impounded\nThere was no way for me to avoid being grounded\nMy parents had to come off from vacation to get me\nI'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me\nMy parents walked in\nI got my grip, I said, \u201cAh, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?\u201d\nThey didn't speak - I said, \u201cI want to plead my case\u201d\nBut my father just shoved me in the car by my face\nThat was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived\nThey took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving\nI can't believe it, I just made a mistake\nWell parents are the same no matter time nor place\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nTake it from me, parents just don't understandEmbed"

   "lyrics": "I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson - Radio Mix Lyrics[Intro: Prince and Jeff imitate two old black men]\nHey...hey Leroy...Leroy\nYeah\nDid you hear about that boy Mike Tyson?\nMike...Mike Tyson he's the boy\nThat played football from Montreal ain't he?\nNo no you old coot, he a...he a boxer man\nYeah\nLet me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago\nI seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard\nHis head flew off into the eigtheenth row\n(laughing) They had to get his head out of the eighteenth row\n\n[Verse One: Prince & Jeff]\nI was in Jeff's crib one night about eight\nAnd we were watchin' a couple of Mike Tyson fight tap\u0435s\nJeff was like...\nMan, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?\nCom\u0435 on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'\nLeft, right, left, right, another K.O\nIf that was me I'd a been okay though\nThe very next day I gave Russell a ring\nWith J.L. and Lyor we all called Don King\nI said \"Yeah, Don I got a problem\nTell 'em Prince\nYeah what's up? what you sayin? You tryin' to solve 'em?\nForget the small talk, let's get to the nitty gritty'\nMe and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City.\"\nYo, you got this you gonna bust dude up\nYeah, you can be my trainer\nWord up?\nI'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice\nAnd yo Jeff, straight up, I think I can beat Mike Tyson\n[Break]\nMan, you can beat him, you can beat him\nYo man, word up\nYou know I put on a couple pounds man we can do this, man\nYou can do it\n\n[Newspaper boy]\nExtra, extra read all about it. Get this...\nFresh Prince challenges 'Iron Mike' Tyson to a fight\n[Laughing] He's crazy\n\n[Old men]\nAin't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifteenth row?\nHey Leroy, you read the paper?\nThat boy done lost his mind\n\n[Verse Two: Fresh Prince & Lawrence the Barber]\nThere was press conference to see what trainin' I was doing\nBefore then I had never heard reporters booing\nCameras flashing, I was in the middle\nI didn't wanna look dumb so I exaggerated a little\nI said, \"Uh, I been trainin' twenty hours a day\nLiftin' big old cars and big bales of hay\n(That's what you're doing)\nAnd I jog 10,000 miles every morning\nThinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory\n(Tell 'em more)\nI drink water, 20 gallons a pop\nAnd I can throw a Volkswagen a whole half block\n(He can do it too)\nAnd 4 million sit ups... in a minute...\nI ain't lyin' I did it!\"\nThe general public thought I was a fool\nI was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool\nWell gettin' dissed is never good\nBut I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood\nI was at the corner at the top of my block\nThere was a couple of people standing outside of the barber shop\nIt was Lawrence, my barber and friend\nAnd he yelled out:\nHey, Prince, you can win!\nI said 'really?' and I stopped to chat\nYou could beat him man, if you hit him with a bat\nHa ha...you gon' get wrecked\nBut can I have your shoes when he break your neck?\nEverybody was laughin' out loud\nI thought at least my own Grandma would be proud\nI went to her house and snuck in to surprise her\nI heard her on the phone\n\"A thousand bucks on Tyson!\"\n\n[Old men]\nHey, Leroy, i thought that boy was joking, [?] he really gon' get in the ring!\nMan, i don't think that boy can beat that big football player\nMan, i keep tellin', ya, he ain't no football player, he a boxer\nHey, Leroy, we gotta do something, that boy gon' kill himself!\n\n[Verse Three: Prince, Ring Announcer]\nIt's fight day and man am I hyped\nWoah, I can't wait to see Mike\nBoy I'm hyped, ready to do my thing\nTrump Castle Casino [bell rings]\nIn this corner, weighing a mere 165 pounds\nThe Lightin' Rodent, the Fresh Prince! (crowd boos)\nAnd in this corner\nThe heavyweight champion of the world\n'Iron Mike' Tyson! (crowd cheers)\nI came out hustling, slidin' and grabbing\nSlippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'\nFor a second I looked good out there (yep)\nBut then Mike brought to reality (look out) my worst nightmare\nOne punch, that's all it took (oooh)\nHe hit me in my ribs and my insides shook\nNow how can I say this and be a little discreet?\nLet's just say that my bowels released\nI called timeout and went back to my corner\nSaid to my coach, \"Ain't no way I'm goin'\nThe hell back out there, man you can forget it\nMy body's like a punching bag and Mike is gonna (Hit it)\"\nThey tried to make me go meet my doom\nBut I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressin' room\nThe next day the headline in the town\n\"Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins, first round\"\nSome fool asked why I ran away\nI said, \"A good run is better than a bad stand any day\"\nMy career is over as far as fightin'\nBut I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson\n\n[Outro: Prince and Jeff as old men]\nHey Leroy!\nYeah\nDid you see the fight? did you see the fight?\nThe..the..the football player?\nNo the boxer, come on man\nI was at the fight last night\nI paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars\nFor my ticket right...\nAh, you weren't at no fight\nI seen you around here last night\n..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring\nYou always lying\nI ain't lying...\nYou lie to your grandkids..\n..I seen it...\n...you been lyin' ever since you was a little kid\n...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off\nHis leg fell off and it fell over...\n...you always lying\n...and it knocked the HBO camerman's camera fell out his hand\nI said, god damn, I couldn't believe it Leroy\nYou shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there\n...I was right next to you playin' checkersEmbed"

Grover Washington, Jr.) - Single Version Lyrics(This is how it goes)\n\nGive me your attention, stop what you're doing and listen up\nBecause my partner in rhyme is about to tear it up\nJeff, if someone said that your beats don't excite\nAnd that your cuts were wack, what would you say? (Yeah, right!)\nJeff's about to give an incredible display\nAnd unequivocally prove that he's the best deejay\nHis name is Jazzy Jeff and he's preparing to shake and make you move\nTo this long and strong theme song, Jazzy's Groove\n\nAnd it'll (make em clap to this)\n(Make em clap to this)\nHey yo, Jeff\n(Come on, yeah)\nAnd it'll (make em clap to this)\nAnd it'll (make em clap to this)\n(Come on, yeah)\nYou know, a lot of deejays, they're just show pieces or statues\nMy deejay's swift and exciting and coming at you\nTo other deejays Jeff is just too much\nHe doesn't use the line switch as a transform crutch\nNever missing beats, always on time with the rhyme\nYou know the scratches are fine when intertwined with a bass line\nLive in concert, Jeff is never Memorex\nYou don't believe he's def? Check the flex\n\n[ Jeff cuts up ]\n(Don't stop to the rhythm, cause I..)\n\nI could talk forever, but still never explain\nWhy deejays flee when they hear Jeff's name\nJeff is number one, even though he just begun\nRuling hip-hop as if he was Attila the Hun\nWe make records, it all adds up a kaleidoscope\nWe work hard, so people can't deny that it's dope\nSome music makes you shake, some makes you move\n(Now here's what I want y'all to do...)\nThis beat is dope and it's called Jazzy's Groove\n\n(Come on, yeah)\n(Na-na-na-na)\n(Come on, yeah)\n(Now here's what I want y'all to do)\n(Na-na-na-na)\n(Break)\n\n(The uncannible) (3x)\n\n(Break)\n(Break)\n(Break)\n(Breakdown)\n\nMusic has a tendency, a way of making you feel it\nIt's been a secret and Jeff is about to reveal it\nHe'll get you hype, no deejay is def as Jeff is\nHe makes you smile and bow while he's flexin\nHe's a magician of sorts, it's kind of a sport\nJeff houses the wheels like Michael Jordan the courts\nAsk who's the best and people'll say that Jeffrey is\nHere's a math lesson, so you can all see how def he is\n(1) plus (1) is (2)\n(Once again back is the incredible)\nAnd (2) plus (1) is (3)\n(The music just turns me on)\nAnd (2) plus (2) is (4)\n(Play it on the radio)\nAnd (1) plus (2) is (3\n4\nHit it!)\n(Breakdown)\n\nLook, it's simple, just admit it\nJeff is the deffest, you wanted a battle, forget it\nYou're a fool, you're slippin, you're looney, you're crazy\nNo ifs, no ands if he tests your butt, baby\nThe music is dope, don't fight it, just give in\nHey yo Jeff, man, tell 'em why you did it\n(I made the beat hype, but still kinda smooth)\nAnd it's dope, right? (For sure) Jazzy's Groove\n\n(It goes 'Oooh' (Oooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt goes 'Oooooh' (Oooooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt goes 'Oooh' (Oooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt'll make you go 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'\n(Na-na-na-na)\nHere we go\n'Oooh' (Oooh)\n'Na-na-na-na' (Na-na-na-na)\nIt'll make you go 'Ooh' (Ooh)\nNa-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)\nMake you go 'Ooh' (Ooh)\nNa-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)\nIt'll make you go 'Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh'\n(Na-na-na-na)\nHere we go)\n\nJazzy's GrooveEmbed"
