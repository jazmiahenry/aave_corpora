 good mornin bob hows butter dis mornin  

 fresh just as fresh as fresh can be

 oh glory   said the questioner whom we shall call thomas anderson although he was known among his acquaintances as marster andersons tom

his informant regarding the condition of the market was robert johnson who had been separated from his mother in his childhood and reared by his mistress as a favorite slave she had fondled him as a pet animal and even taught him to read notwithstanding their relation as mistress and slave they had strong personal likings for each other

tom anderson was the servant of a wealthy planter who lived in the city of c  north carolina this planter was quite advanced in life but in his earlier days he had spent much of his time in talking politics in his state and national capitals in winter and in visiting pleasure resorts and watering places in summer his plantations were left to the care of overseers who in their turn employed negro drivers to aid them in the work of cultivation and discipline but as the infirmities of age were pressing upon him he had withdrawn from active life and given the management of his affairs into the hands of his sons as robert johnson and thomas anderson passed homeward from the market having bought provisions for their respective homes they seemed to be very lighthearted and careless chatting and joking with each other but every now and then after looking furtively around one would drop into the ears of the other some news of the battle then raging between the north and south which like two great millstones were grinding slavery to powder as they passed along they were met by another servant who said in hurried tones but with a glad accent in his voice â  did you see de fish in de market dis mornin  oh but dey war splendid jis as fresh as fresh kin be

 thats the ticket said robert as a broad smile overspread his face  ill see you later

 good mornin boys said another servant on his way to market  hows eggs dis mornin  

 fust rate fust rate said tom anderson bobs got it down fine

 i thought so mighty long faces at de posoffice dis mornin but id better move long and with a bright smile lighting up his face he passed on with a quickened tread

there seemed to be an unusual interest manifested by these men in the state of the produce market and a unanimous report of its good condition surely there was nothing in the primeness of the butter or the freshness of the eggs to change careless looking faces into such expressions of gratification or to light dull eyes with such gladness what did it mean 

during the dark days of the rebellion when the bondman was turning his eyes to the american flag and learning to hail it as an ensign of deliverance some of the shrewder slaves coming in contact with their masters and overhearing their conversations invented a phraseology to convey in the most unsuspected manner news to each other from the battlefield fragile women and helpless children were left on the plantations while their natural protectors were at the front and yet these bondmen refrained from violence freedom was coming in the wake of the union army and while numbers deserted to join their forces others remained at home slept in their cabins by night and attended to their work by day but under this apparently careless exterior there was an undercurrent of thought which escaped the cognizance of their masters in conveying tidings of the war if they wished to announce a victory of the union army they said the butter was fresh or that the fish and eggs were in good condition if defeat befell them then the butter and other produce were rancid or stale

entering his home robert set his basket down in one arm he held a bundle of papers which he had obtained from the train to sell to the boarders who were all anxious to hear from the seat of battle he slipped one copy out and looking cautiously around said to linda the cook in a low voiceâ  splendid news in the papers secesh routed yankees whipped em out of their boots papers full of it

i tell you the eggs and the butters mighty fresh this morning

 i hope so said robert  i think that we have a heap of friends up there

well im jis gwine to keep on prayin an blievin just then the bell rang and robert answering found mrs johnson suffering from a severe headache which he thought was occasioned by her worrying over the late defeat of the confederates she sent him on an errand which he executed with his usual dispatch and returned to some work which he had to do in the kitchen robert was quite a favorite with aunt linda and they often had confidential chats together

 bobby she said when he returned  i thinks we ort ter hab a prayermeetin putty soon

 i am in for that where will you have it

now bob you sen word to uncle danel tom anderson an de rest ob dem to come to mc culloughs woods nex sunday night i want to hab a sinkillin an debildribin time but boy youd better git out er yere ole missll be down on yer like a scratch cat

although the slaves were denied unrestricted travel j and the holding of meetings without the surveillance of a white man yet they contrived to meet by stealth and hold gatherings where they could mingle their prayers i and tears and lay plans for escaping to the union army outwitting the vigilance of the patrollers and home guards they established these meetings miles apart extending into several states

sometimes their hope of deliverance was cruelly blighted by hearing of some adventurous soul who having escaped to the union army had been pursued and returned again to bondage yet hope survived all these disasters which gathered around the fate of their unfortunate brethren who were remanded to slaverythrough the undiscerning folly of those who were strengthening the hands which were dealing their deadliest blows at the heart of the nation but slavery had cast such a glamour over the nation and so warped the consciences of men that they failed to read aright the legible transcript of divine retribution which was written upon the shuddering earth where the blood of gods poor children had been as water freely spilled

a few evenings after this conversation between robert and linda a prayermeeting was held under the cover of night a few dusky figures met by stealth in mc culloughs woods

 howdy said robert approaching uncle daniel the leader of the prayermeeting who had preceded him but a few minutes

 thanks and praise ise all right how is you chile

 oh im all right said robert smiling and grasping uncle daniels hand

 whats de news   exclaimed several as they turned their faces eagerly towards robert  i hear said robert  that they are done sending the runaways back to their masters

 is dat so   said a half dozen earnest voices how did you yere it

 i read it in the papers and tom told me he heard them talking about it last night at his house how did you hear it tom  come tell us all about it

tom anderson hesitated a moment and then saidâ  now boys ill tell you all bout it but yous got to be mighty mum bout it it wont do to let de cat outer de bag

dats so but tell us wat you yered we aint gwine to say nuffin to nobody

well said tom las night ole marster had company two big ginerals and dey was hoppin mad one ob dem looked like a turkey gobbler his face war so red an he sed one ob dem yankee ginerals i thinks dey called him beas butler sed dat de slaves dat runned away war some big nameâi dont know what he called it but it meant dat all ob we who comd to de yankees should be free

 contraband of war said robert who enjoyed the distinction of being a good reader and was pretty well posted about the war mrs johnson had taught him to read on the same principle she would have taught a pet animal amusing tricks she had never imagined the time would come when he would use the machinery she had put in his hands to help overthrow the institution to which she was so ardently attached

 what does it mean  is it somethin good for us   i think said robert a little vain of his superior knowledge  it is the best kind of good it means if two armies are fighting and the horses of one run away the other has a right to take them and it is just the same if a slave runs away from the secesh to the union lines he is called a contraband just the same as if he were an ox or a horse they wouldnt send the horses back and they wont send us back

is dat so said uncle daniel a dear old father with a look of saintly patience on his face well chillen what do you mean to do 

 go jis as soon as we kin git to de army said tom anderson

 what else did the generals say  and how did you come to hear them tom   asked robert johnson

well yer see marsters too ole and feeble to go to de war but his hearts in it an it makes him feel good all ober when dem big ginerals comes an tells him all bout it well i war laying out on de porch fas asleep an snorin drefful hard oh i war so soun asleep dat wen marster wanted some icewater he had to shake me drefful hard to wake me up an all de time i war wide wake as he war

 what did they say   asked robert who was always on the lookout for news from the battlefield

 one ob dem said dem yankees war talkin of puttin guns in our hans and settin us all free an de oder said oh sho ef dey puts guns in dere hands deyll soon be in ourn and ef dey sets em free dey wouldnt know how to take keer ob demselves

 only let em try it chorused a half dozen voices an  deyll soon see wholl git de bes ob de guns an as to taking keer ob ourselves i specs we kin take keer ob ourselves as well as take keer ob dem

yes said tom who plants de cotton and raises all de crops  

  they eat the meat and give us the bones eat the cherries and give us the stones and im getting tired of the whole business said robert

but bob said uncle daniel youve got a good owner you dont hab to run away from bad times and wuss a comin

it isnt so good but it might be better i aint got nothing gainst my ole miss except she sold my mother from me and a boy aint nothin without his mother i forgive her but i never forget her and never expect to but if she were the best woman on earth i would rather have my freedom than belong to her well boys heres a chance for us just as soon as the union army gets in sight what will you do

why robbie my whole heart is wid you but when marse robert went to de war he called me into his room and said to me  uncle danel ise gwine to de war an i want you to look arter my wife an chillen an see dat eberything goes right on de place an i promised him id do it an i mus be as good as my word cept de overseer dere isnt a white man on de plantation an i hear he has to report termorrer or be treated as a deserter an ders nobody here to look arter miss mary an de chillen but myself an to see dat eberything goes right i promised marse robert i would do it an i mus be as good as my word

well dats neither yere nor dere marse robert couldnt help what his father did he war an orful mean man but hes dead now and gone to see bout it but his wife war the nicest sweetest lady dat eber i did see she war no more like him dan chalks like cheese she used to visit de cabins an listen to de pore women when de overseer used to cruelize dem so bad anj drive dem to work late and early an she used to sen dem nice things when they war sick and hab der cabins whitewashed an lookin like new pins an look arter dere chillen sometimes shed try to git ole marse to take dere part when de oberseer got too mean but she might as well a sung hymns to a dead horse all her putty talk war like porin water on a gooses back hed jis bluff her off an tell her she didnt run dat plantation and not for her to bring him any nigger news i never thought ole marster war good to her i often ketched her crying an shed say she had de headache but i thought it war de heartache fore ole marster died she got so thin an peaked i war fraid she war gwine to die but she seed him out he war killed by a tree failin on him an ef eber de debil got his own he got him i seed him in a vision arter he war gone he war hangin up in a pit sayin oh oh wid no close on he war allers blusterin cussin and swearin at somebody marse robert aint a bit like him he takes right arter his mother bad as ole marster war i think she jis lobd de groun he walked on well womens mighty curious kind of folks anyhow i sometimes thinks de wuss you treats dem de better dey likes you

well uncle daniel lets hear it said robert

 i was jes gwine to tell yer when tom put me out ole marster died when marse robert war two years ole and his pore mother when he war four when he died miss anna used to keep me bout her jes like i war her shadder i used to nuss marse robert jes de same as ef i were his own fadder i used to fix his milk rock him to sleep ride him on my back an nothin pleased him bettern fer uncle danel to ride him piggyback

well uncle daniel said robert what has that got to do with your going with us and getting your freedom  

now jeswait a bit and dont frustrate my mine i seed day arter day miss anna war gettin weaker and thinner an she looked so sweet and talked so putty i thinks to myself you aint long for dis worl and she said to me one day  uncle danel when ise gone i want you to be good to your marster robert an she looked so pale and weak i war almost ready to cry i couldnt help it she hed allers bin mighty good to me an i beliebs in praisin de bridge dat carries me ober she said  uncle danel i wish you war free ef i had my way you shouldnt serve any one when im gone but mr thurston had eberything in his power when he made his will i war tied hand and foot and i couldnt help it in a little while she war goneâjis faded away like a flower i belieb ef deres a saint in glory miss annas dere

 oh i dont take much stock in white folks religion said robert laughing carelessly

the way said tom anderson dat some of dese folks cut their cards yere i think deyll be as sceece in hebben as hens teeth i think wen some of dem preachers brings de bible round an tells us bout mindin j our marsters and not stealin dere tings dat dey preach

to please de white folks an dey frows coleness ober de meetin

an i said aunt linda  neber did belieb in dem bible preachers i yered one ob dem sayin wen he war dyin it war all dark wid him an de way he treated his housegirl pore thing i dont wonder dat it war dark wid him

o i guess said robert that the bible is all right but some of these church folks dont get the right hang of it

 may be dats so said aunt linda  but i allers wanted to learn how to read i once had a book and tried to make out what war in it but ebery time my mistus caught me wid a book in my hand she used to whip my fingers an i couldnt see ef it war good for white folks why it warnt good for cullud folks

 well said tom anderson  i belieb in de good oletime religion but arter dese white folks is done fussin and beatin de cullud folks i dont want em to come talking religion to me we used to hab on our place a real guinea man an once he made ole marse mad an he had him whipped old marse war trying to break him in but dat fellow war spunk to de backbone an when he gin talkin to him bout savin his soul an gittin to hebbin he tole him ef he went to hebbin an foun he war dare he wouldnt go in he wouldnt stay wid any such rascal as he war

what became of him  asked robert

oh he died but he had some quare notions bout religion he thought dat when he died he would go back to his ole country he allers kep his ole guinea name

 what was it  

 potobombra do you know what he wanted marster to do fore he died continued anderson

no

 he wanted him to gib him his free papers

did he do it 

ob course he did as de poor fellow war dying an he couldnt sell him in de oder world he jis wrote him de papers to yumor him he didnt want to go back to africa a slave he thought if he did his people would look down on him an he wanted to go back a free man he war orful weak when marster brought him de free papers he jis ris up in de bed clutched dem in his hans smiled an gasped out ise free at las an fell back on de pillar an he war gone oh but he war spunky de oberseers arter dey foun out who he war ginrally gabe him a wide birth i specs his father war some ole guinea king

well chillen said uncle daniel wes kept up dis meeting long enough wed better go home and not all go one way cause de patrollers might git us all inter trouble an we must try to slip home by hook or crook an when we meet again uncle daniel can finish his story an be ready to go with us said robert

i wish said tom anderson he would go wid us de wuss kind

the union had snapped asunder because it lacked the cohesion of justice and the nation was destined to pass through the crucible of disaster and defeat till she was ready to clasp hands with the negro and march abreast with him to freedom and victory

the union army was encamping a few miles from c in north carolina robert being well posted on the condition of affairs had stealthily contrived to call a meeting in uncle daniels cabin uncle daniels wife had gone to bed as a sick sister and they held a prayermeeting by her bedside it was a little risky but as mr thurston did not encourage the visits of the patrollers and heartily detested having them prying into his cabins there was not much danger of molestation

well uncle daniel we want to hear your story and see if you have made up your mind to go with us said robert after he had been seated a few minutes in uncle daniels cabin

 no chillen ive no objection to finishin my story but i aint made up my mind to leave the place till marse robert gits back

 arter she war gone ole marsters folks come to look arter things but eberything war lef to marse robert an he wouldnt do widout me dat chile war allers at my heels i couldnt stir widout him an when he missed me hed fret an cry so i had ter stay wid him an wen he went to school i had ter carry him in de mornin and bring him home in de ebenin an i learned him to hunt squirrels an rabbits an ketch fish an set traps for birds i beliebs he lobd me better dan any ob his kin an he showed me how to read well said tom ef he lobd you so much why didnt he set you free

 isnt it funny said robert  how these white folks look down on colored people an then mix up with them 

marster war away when miss liza treated my katie so mean an when i tole him bout it he war tearin mad an went ober an saw ole gundover an foun out he war hard up for money an he bought katie and brought her home to lib wid me and wes been a libin in clover eber sence marster robert has been mighty good to me he stood by me in my troubles an now his troubles come im a gwine to stan by him i used to think gundovers wife war jealous ob my katie she war so much puttier gundovers wife couldnt tech my katie wid a ten foot pole

 but aunt katie you have had your trials said robert now that daniel had finished his story dont you feel bitter towards these people who are fighting to keep you in slavery  

aunt katie turned her face towards the speaker it was a thoughtful intelligent face saintly and calm a face which expressed the idea of a soul which had been fearfully tempest tossed but had passed through suffering into peace very touching was the look of resignation and hope which overspread her features as she replied with the simple childlike faith which she had learned in the darkest hour  the lord says we must forgive and with her that thought as coming from the lips of divine love was enough to settle the whole question of forgiveness of injuries and love to enemies

 well said thomas anderson turning to uncle daniel  we cant count on yer to go wid us  

 boys said uncle daniel and there was grief in his voice  ise mighty glad you hab a chance for your freedom  but ez i tole yer i promised marse robert i would stay an i mus be as good as my word dont you youngsters stay for an ole stager like me im ole an mos worn out freedom wouldnt do much for me but i want you all to be as free as the birds so you chillen take your freedom when you kin get it but uncle danel you wont say nothin bout our going will you  said the youngest of the company

uncle daniel slowly arose there was a mournful flash in his eye a tremor of emotion in his voice as he said  look yere boys de boy dat axed dat question war a new comer on dis plantation but some ob yous bin here all ob your lives did you eber know ob uncle danel gittin any ob you inter trouble  

 no no exclaimed a chorus of voices but manys de time youve held off de blows wen de oberseer got too mean an cruelized us too much wen marse robert war away an wen he got back you made him settle de oberseers hash

 well boys said uncle daniel with an air of mournful dignity  ise de same uncle danel i eber war ef any ob you wants to go i habbent a word to say agin it i specs dem yankees be all right but i knows marse robert an i dont know dem an i aint a gwine ter throw away dirty water til i gits clean well uncle ben said robert addressing a stalwart man whose towering form and darkly flashing eye told that slavery had failed to put the crouch in his shoulders or general abjectness into his demeanor  you will go with us for sure wont you  

yes spoke up tom anderson cause de traders done took your wife an got her for hisn now

as ben tunnel looked at the speaker a spasm of agony and anger darkened his face and distorted his features as if the blood of some strong race were stirring with sudden vigor through his veins he clutched his hands together as if he were struggling with an invisible foe and for a moment he remained silent then suddenly raising his head he exclaimed  boys theres not one of you loves freedom more than i do but

 but what  said tom  do you think white folks is your bes friends  

 ill think so when i lose my senses

well now i dont belieb youre fraid not de way i yeard you talkin to de oberseer wen he war threatnin to hit your mudder he saw you meant business an he let her alone but whats to hinder you from gwine wid us

 my mother he replied in a low firm voice  that is the only thing that keeps me from going if it had not been for her i would have gone long ago shes all ive got an im all shes got

it was touching to see the sorrow on the strong face to detect the pathos and indignation in his voice as he said i used to love mirandy as i love my life i thought the sun rose and set in her i never saw a handsomer woman than she was but she fooled me all over the face and eyes and took up with that hellhound of a trader lukens an he gave her a chance to live easy to wear fine clothes an be waited on like a lady i thought at first i would go crazy but my poor mammy did all she could to comfort me she would tell me there were as good fish in the sea as were ever caught out of it many a time ive laid my poor head on her lap when it seemed as if my brain was on fire and my heart was almost ready to burst but in course of time i got over the worst of it an mirandy is the first an last woman that ever fooled me but that dear old mammy of mine i mean to stick by her as long as there is a piece of her i cant go over to the army an leave her behind for if i did an anything should happen i would never forgive myself

but couldnt you take her with you said robert the soldiers said we could bring our women

it isnt that the union army is several miles from here an my poor mammy is so skeeiy that if i were trying to get her away and any of them secesh would overtake us an begin to question us she would get skeered almost to death an break down an begin to cry an then the fat would be in the fire so while i love freedom more than a child loves its mothers milk ive made up my mind to stay on the plantation i wish from the bottom of my heart i could go but i cant take her along with me an i dont want to be free and leave her behind in slavery i was only five years old when my master and as i believe father sold us both here to this lower country an weve been here ever since its no use talking i wont leave her to be run over by everybody

a few evenings after this interview the union soldiers entered the town of c and established their headquarters near the home of thomas anderson

out of the little company almost every one deserted to the union army leaving uncle daniel faithful to his trust and ben tunnel hushing his hearts deep aspirations for freedom in a passionate devotion to his timid and affectionate mother

a few evenings before the stampede of robert and his friends to the army and as he sat alone in his room reading the latest news from the paper he had secreted he heard a cautious tread and a low tap at his window he opened the door quietly and whispered â anything new tom

yes dats jis what he called it bounty money an i said dat i war in for dat teeth and toenails

robert johnsons heart gave a great bound was that so  had that army with freedom emblazoned on its banners come at last to offer them deliverance if they would accept it  was it a bright beautiful dream or a blessed reality soon to be grasped by his willing hands his heart grew buoyant with hope the lightness of his heart gave elasticity to his step and sent the blood rejoicingly through his veins freedom was almost in his grasp and the future was growing rosetinted and rainbowhued all the ties which bound him to his home were as ropes of sand now that freedom had come so near

when the army was afar off he had appeared to be lighthearted and content with his lot if asked if he desired his freedom he would have answered very naively that he was eating his white bread and believed in letting well enough alone he had no intention of jumping from the fryingpan into the fire but in the depths of his soul the love of freedom was an allabsorbing passion only danger had taught him caution he had heard of terrible vengeance being heaped upon the heads of some who had sought their freedom and failed in the attempt robert knew that he might abandon hope if he incurred the wrath of men whose overthrow was only a question of time it would have been madness and folly for him to have attempted an insurrection against slavery with the words of mc clellan ringing in his ears  if you rise i shall put you down with an iron hand and with the home guards ready to quench his aspirations for freedom with bayonets and blood what could a set of unarmed and undisciplined men do against the fearful odds which beset their path 

robert waited eagerly and hopefully his chance to join the union army and was ready and willing to do anything required of him by which he could earn his freedom and prove his manhood he conducted his plans with the greatest secrecy a few faithful and trusted friends stood ready to desert with him when the union army came within hailing distance when it came there was a stampede to its ranks of men ready to serve in any capacity to labor in the tents fight on the fields or act as scouts it was a strange sight to see these black men rallying around the stars and stripes when white men were trampling them under foot and riddling them with bullets

well boys said robert to his trusted friends as they gathered together at a meeting in gundovers woods almost under the shadow of the union army how many of you are ready to join the army and fight for your freedom

all ob us

 the soldiers continued robert  are camped right at the edge of the town the general has his headquarters in the heart of the town and one of the officers told me yesterday that the president had set us all free and that as many as wanted to join the army could come along to the camp so i thought boys that i would come and tell you now you can take your bag and baggage and get out of here as soon as you choose

we ll be ready by daylight said tom  it wont take me long to pack up looking down at his seedy clothes with a laugh  i specs ole marseil be real lonesome when im gone an wont he be hoppin mad when he finds im a goner  i specs hell hate it like pizen

o well said robert the best of friends must part dont let it grieve you

 ise gwine to take my wife an chillen said one of the company

 ise got nobody but myself said tom but deres a mighty putty young gal dere at marse toms i wish i could git her away dey tells me deys been sellin her all ober de kentry but dat shes a reglar spitfire dey cant lead nor dribe her

 do you think she would go with us  said robert  i think shes jis dying to go dey say dey cant do nuffin wid her marse toms got his match dis time and ise glad ob it i jis glories in her spunk

 how did she come there  

olv marse bought her ob de trader to keep house for him but ef you seed dem putty white hans ob hern youd never tink she kept her own house let lone anybody elses

 do you think you can get her away  

i dont know cause marse tom keeps her mighty close my but shes putty beautiful long hair comes way down her back putty blue eyes an jis ez white ez anybodys in dis place id jis wish you could see her yoresef i heerd marse tom talkin bout her las night to his brudder tellin him she war mighty airish but he meant to break her in

an angry curse rose to the lips of robert but he repressed it and muttered to himself  graceless scamp he ought to have his neck stretched then turning to tom saidâ  get her if you possibly can but you must be mighty mum about it

 trus me for dat said tom

tom was very anxious to get word to the beautiful but intractable girl who was held in durance vile by her reckless and selfish master who had tried in vain to drag her down to his own low level of sin and shame but all toms efforts were in vain finally he applied to the commander of the post who immediately gave orders for her release the next day tom had the satisfaction of knowing that iola leroy had been taken as a trembling dove from the gory vultures nest and given a place of security she was taken immediately to the generals headquarters the general was much impressed by her modest demeanor and surprised to see the refinement and beauty she possessed could it be possible that this young and beautiful girl had been a chattel with no power to protect herself from the highest insults that lawless brutality could inflict upon innocent and defenseless womanhood  could he ever again glory in his american citizenship when any white man no matter how coarse cruel or brutal could buy or sell her for the basest purposes  was it not true that the cause of a hapless people had become entangled with the lightnings of heaven and dragged down retribution upon the land 

the field hospital was needing gentle womanly ministrations and iola leroy released from the hands of her tormentors was given a place as nurse a position to which she adapted herself with a deep sense of relief tom was doubly gratified at the success of his endeavors which had resulted in the rescue of the beautiful young girl and the discomfiture of his young master who in the words of tom was mad enough to bite his head off a rather difficult physical feat

iola freed from her masters clutches applied herself readily to her appointed tasks the beautiful girlish face was full of tender earnestness the fresh young voice was strangely sympathetic as if some great sorrow had bound her heart in loving compassion to every sufferer who needed her gentle ministrations

tom anderson was a man of herculean strength and remarkable courage but on account of physical defects instead of enlisting as a soldier he was forced to remain a servant although he felt as if every nerve in his right arm was tingling to strike a blow for freedom he was well versed in the lay of the country having often driven his masters cotton to market when he was a field hand after he became a coachman he had become acquainted with the different roads and localities of the country besides he had often accompanied his young masters on their hunting and fishing expeditions although he could not fight in the army he proved an invaluable helper when tents were to be pitched none were more ready to help than he when burdens were to be borne none were more willing to bend beneath them than thomas anderson when the battlefield was to be searched for the wounded and dying no hand was more tender in its ministrations of kindness than his as a general factotum in the army he was ever ready and willing to serve anywhere and at any time and to gather information from every possible source which could be of any service to the union army as a pagan might worship a distant star and wish to call it his own so he loved iola and he never thought he could do too much for the soldiers who had rescued her and were bringing deliverance to his race

what do you think of miss iola robert asked him one day as they were talking together

i jis think dat shes splendid las week i had to take some of our pore boys to de hospital an she war dere lookin sweet an putty ez an angel a nussin dem pore boys an ez good to one ez de oder it looks to me ez ef dey ralely lobd her shadder she sits by em so patient an writes em sech nice letters to der frens an yit she looks so heartbroke an pitiful it jis gits to me an makes me mos ready to cry im so glad dat marse tom had to gib her up he war too mean to eat good victuals

 he ought said robert  to be made to live on herrings heads and cold potatoes it makes my blood boil just to think that he was going to have that lovely looking young girl whipped for his devilment he ought to be ashamed to hold up his head among respectable people

 i tell you bob de debil will neber git his own till he gits him when i seed how he war treating her i neber rested till i got her away he buyed her he said for his housekeeper as many gals as dere war on de plantation why didnt he git one ob dem to keep house an not dat nice lookin young lady  her hans look ez ef she neber did a days work in her life one day when he comd down to breakfas he chucked her under de chin an tried to put his arm roun her waist but she jis frew it off like a chunk ob fire she looked like a snake had bit her her eyes fairly spit fire her face got red ez blood an den she turned so pale i thought she war gwine to faint but she didnt an i yered her say  ill die fust i war mad nough to stan on my head i could hab tored him all to pieces wen he said hed hab her whipped

 did he do it 

 i dont know but hes mean nough to do enythin why dey say she war sole seben times in six weeks cause shes so putty but dat she war game to de las

well tom said robert getting that girl away was one of the best things you ever did in your life

i think so too not dat i specs enytin ob it i dont spose she would think ob an ugly chap like me but it does me good to know dat marse tom aint got her

robert johnson being able to meet the army requirements was enlisted as a substitute to help fill out the quota of a northern regiment with his intelligence courage and prompt obedience he rose from the ranks and became lieutenant of a colored company he was daring without being rash prompt but not thoughtless firm without being harsh kind and devoted to the company he drilled he soon won the respect of his superior officers and the love of his comrades

 johnson said a young officer captain sybil of maine who had become attached to robert  what is the use of your saying youre a colored man when you are as white as i am and as brave a man as there is among us why not quit this company and take your place in the army just the same as a white man  i know your chances for promotion would be better

 captain you may doubt my word but today i would rather be a lieutenant in my company than a captain in yours

 i dont understand you

well captain when a mans been colored all his life it comes a little hard for him to get white all at once  were i to try it i would feel like a cat in a strange garret captain i think my place is where i am most needed you do not need me in your ranks and my company does they are excellent fighters but they need a leader to silence a battery to capture a flag to take a fortification they will rush into the jaws of death

 yes i have often wondered at their bravery

 captain these battles put them on their mettle they have been so long taught that they are nothing and nobody that they seem glad to prove they are something and somebody

 but johnson you do not look like them you do not talk like them it is a burning shame to have held such a man as you in slavery

 i dont think it was any worse to have held me in slavery than the blackest man in the south

you are right johnson the color of a mans skin has nothing to do with the possession of his rights now there is tom anderson said robert he is just as black as black can be he has been bought and sold like a beast and yet there is not a braver man in all the company i know him well he is a noblehearted fellow true as steel i love him like a brother and i believe tom would risk his life for me any day he dont know anything about his father or mother he was sold from them before he could remember he can read a little he used to take lessons from a white gardener in virginia he would go between the hours of  p m and  a m he got a book of his own tore it up greased the pages and hid them in his hat then if his master had ever knocked his hat off he would have thought them greasy papers and not that tom was carrying his library on his head i had another friend who lived near us when he was nineteen years old he did not know how many letters there were in the a b cs one night when his work was done his boss came into his cabin and saw him with a book in his hand he threatened to give him five hundred lashes if he caught him again with a book and said he hadnt work enough to do he was getting out logs and his task was ten logs a day his employer threatened to increase it to twelve he said it just harassed him it set him on fire he thought there must be something good in that book if the white man didnt want him to learn one day he had an errand in the kitchen and he heard one of the colored girls going over the a b cs here was the key to the forbidden knowledge she had heard the white children saying them and picked them up by heart but did not know them by sight he was not content with that but sold his cap for a book and wore a cloth on his head instead he got the sounds of the letters by heart then cut off the bark of a tree carved the letters on the smooth inside and learned them he wanted to learn how to write he had charge of a warehouse where he had a chance to see the size and form of letters he made the beach of the river his copybook and thus he learned to write tom never got very far with his learning but i used to get the papers and tell him all i knew about the war

 how did you get the papers 

 i used to have very good privileges for a slave all of our owners were not alike some of them were quite clever and others were worse than git out i used to get the morning papers to sell to the boarders and others and when i got them i would contrive to hide a paper and let some of the fellowservants know how things were going on and our owners thought we cared nothing about what was going on

 how was that  i thought you were not allowed to hold meetings unless a white man were present

 that was so but we contrived to hold secret meetings in spite of their caution we knew whom we could trust my ole miss wasnt mean like some of them she never wanted the patrollers around prowling in our cabins and poking their noses into our business her husband was an awful drunkard he ran through every cent he could lay his hands on and she was forced to do something to keep the wolf from the door so she set up a boardinghouse but she didnt take in tom dick and harry nobody but the big bugs stopped with her she taught me to read and write and to cast up accounts it was so handy for her to have some one who could figure up her accounts and read or write a note if she were from home and wanted the like done she once told her cousin how i could write and figure up and what do you think her cousin said

pleased i suppose to hear it

not a bit of it she said if i belonged to her she would cut off my thumbs her husband said oh then he couldnt pick cotton as to my poor thumbs it did not seem to be taken into account what it would cost me to lose them my ole miss used to have a lot of books she would let me read anyone of them except a novel she wanted to take care of my soul but she wasnt taking care of her own

wasnt she religious

 she went for it i suppose she was as good as most of them she said her prayers and went to church but i dont know that that made her any better i never did take much stock in white folks religion

why robert im afraid you are something of an infidel

no captain i believe in the real genuine religion i aint got much myself but i respect them that have we had on our place a dear old saint named aunt kizzy she was a happy soul she had seen hard times but was what i call a living epistle ive heard her tell how her only child had been sold from her when the man who bought herself did not want to buy her child poor little fellow he was only two years old i asked her one day how she felt when her child was taken away i felt she said as if i was going to my grave but i knew if i couldnt get justice here i could get it in another world that was faith said captain sybil as if speaking to himself a patient waiting for death to redress the wrongs of life

many a time continued robert have i heard her humming to herself in the kitchen and saying i has my trials ups and downs but it wont allers be so i specs one day to wing and wing wid de angels hallelujah den i specs to hear a voice sayin poor ole kizzy shes done de bes she kin go down gabriel an tote her in den i specs to put on my golden slippers my long white robe an my starry crown an walk dem golden streets hallelujah iye known that dear old soul to travel going on two miles after her work was done to have some one read to her her favorite chapter began with let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me

 i have been deeply impressed said captain sybil with the childlike faith of some of these people i do not mean to say that they are consistent christians but i do think that this faith has in a measure underlain the life of the race it has been a golden thread woven amid the sombre tissues of their lives a ray of light shimmering amid the gloom of their condition and what would they have been without it 

i dont know but i know what she was with it and i believe if there are any saints in glory aunt kizzy is one of them

 she is dead then  

yes went all right singing and rejoicing until the the last troubles over troubles over and den my troubles will be over well walk de golden streets all roun in de new jerusalem now captain thats the kind of religion that i want not that kind which could ride to church on sundays and talk so solemn with the minister about heaven and good things then come home and light down on the servants like a thousand of bricks i have no use for it i dont believe in it i never did and i never will if any man wants to save my soul he aint got to beat my body that aint the kind of religion im looking for i aint got a bit of use for it now captain aint i right

well yes robert i think you are more than half right you ought to know my dear old mother who lives in maine we have had colored company at our house and i never saw her show the least difference between her colored and white guests she is a quaker preacher and dont believe in war but when the rest of the young men went to the front i wanted to go also so i thought it all over and there seemed to be no way out of slavery except through the war i had been taught to hate war and detest slavery now the time had come when i could not help the war but i could strike a blow for freedom so i told my mother i was going to the front that i expected to be killed but i went to free the slave it went hard with her but i thought that i ought to come and i believe my mothers prayers are following me

 captain said robert rising  i am glad that i have heard your story i think that some of these northern soldiers do two thingsâhate slavery and hate niggers

i am afraid that is so with some of them they would rather be whipped by rebels than conquer with negroes oh i heard a soldier said captain sybil say when the colored men were being enlisted that he would break his sword and resign but he didnt do either after colonel shaw led his charge at fort wagner and died in the conflict he got bravely over his prejudices the conduct of the colored troops there and elsewhere has done much to turn public opinion in their favor i suppose any white soldier would rather have his black substitute receive the bullets than himself

where is tom asked captain sybil i have not seen him for several hours

 hes gone down the sound with some of the soldiers replied robert they wanted tom to row them

 i am afraid those boys will get into trouble and the rebs will pick them off responded sybil

 o i hope not answered robert

 i hope not too but those boys are too venturesome

 tom knows the lay of the land better than any of us said robert  he is the most wideawake and gamiest man i know i reckon when the war is over tom will be a preacher did you ever hear him pray

 no is he good at that  

 firstrate continued robert  it would do you good to hear him he dont allow any cursing and swearing when hes around and what he says is law and gospel with the boys but hes so goodnatured and they cant get mad at him

yes robert there is not a man in our regiment i would sooner trust than tom last night when he brought in that wounded scout he couldnt have been more tender if he had been a woman how gratefully the poor fellow looked in toms face as he laid him down so carefully and staunched the blood which had been spurting out of him tom seemed to know it was an artery which had been cut and he did just the right thing to stop the bleeding he knew there wasnt a moment to be lost he wasnt going to wait for the doctor i have often heard that colored people are ungrateful but i dont think toms worst enemy would say that about him

 captain said robert with a tone of bitterness in his voice  what had we to be grateful for  for ages of poverty ignorance and slavery  i think if anybody should be grateful it is the people who have enslaved us and lived off our labor for generations captain i used to know a poor old woman who couldnt bear to hear any one play on the piano

 is that so  why i always heard that colored people were a musical race

 so we are but that poor womans daughter was sold and her mistress took the money to buy a piano her mother could never bear to hear a sound from it

 poor woman i  exclaimed captain sybil sympathetically   i suppose it seemed as if the wail of her daughter was blending with the tones of the instrument i think robert there is a great deal more in the colored people than we give them credit for did you know captain sellers  

the officer who escaped from prison and got back to our lines   asked robert

yes well he had quite an experience in trying to escape he came to an aged couple who hid him in their cabin and shared their humble food with him they gave him some cornbread bacon and coffee which he thought was made of scorched bran but he said that he never ate a meal that he relished more than the one he took with them just before he went they knelt down and prayed with him it seemed as if his very hair stood on his head their prayer was so solemn as he was going away the man took some shingles and nailed them on his shoes to throw the bloodhounds off his track i dont think he will ever cease to feel kindly towards colored people i do wonder what has become of the boys  what can keep them so long  

just as captain sybil and robert were wondering at the delay of tom and the soldiers they heard the measured tread of men who were slowly bearing a burden they were carrying tom anderson to the hospital fearfully wounded and nigh to death his face was distorted and the blood was streaming from his wounds his respiration was faint his pulse hurried as if life were trembling on its frailest cords

robert and captain sybil hastened at once towards the wounded man on roberts face was a look of intense anguish as he bent pityingly over his friend

 o this is dreadful how did it happen   cried robert

captain sybil pressing anxiously forward repeated roberts question

 captain said one of the young soldiers advancing and saluting his superior officer we were all in the boat when it struck against a mud bank and there was not strength enough among us to shove her back into the water just then the rebels opened fire upon us for awhile we lay down in the boat but still they kept firing tom took in the whole situation and said  some one must die to get us out of this i moughts well be him as any you are soldiers and can fight if they kill me it is nuthin so tom leaped out to shove the boat into the water just then the rebel bullets began to rain around him he received seven or eight of them and im afraid there is no hope for him  o tom i wish you hadnt gone o tom tom cried robert in tones of agony

a gleam of grateful recognition passed over the drawn features of tom as the wail of his friend fell on his ear he attempted to speak but the words died upon his lips and he became unconscious

well said captain sybil put him in one of the best wards give him into miss leroys care if good nursing can win him back to life he shall not want for any care or pains that she can bestow send immediately for dr gresham

robert followed his friend into the hospital tenderly and carefully helped to lay him down and remained awhile gazing in silent grief upon the sufferer then he turned to go leaving him in the hands of iola but hoping against hope that his wounds would not be fatal

with tender devotion iola watched her faithful friend he recognized her when restored to consciousness and her presence was as balm to his wounds he smiled faintly took her hand in his stroked it tenderly looked wistfully into her face and said  miss iola i aint long fer dis ise most home 

 oh no said iola  i hope that you will soon get over this trouble and live many long and happy days no miss iola its all ober wid me ise gwine to glory gwine to glory gwine to ring dem charmin bells tell all de boys to meet me in heben dat dey mus list in de hebenly war

o mr tom said iola tenderly do not talk of leaving me you are the best friend i have had since i was torn from my mother i should be so lonely without you

deres a frien dat sticks closer dan a brudder he will be wid yer in de sixt trial an in de sebbent hell not fosake yer

yes answered iola  i know that he is all our dependence but i cant help grieving when i see you suffering so but dear friend be quiet and try to go to sleep

ill do enythin fer yer miss iola

tom closed his eyes and lay quiet tenderly and anxiously iola watched over him as the hours waned away the doctor came shook his head gravely and turning to iola said  there is no hope but do what you can to alleviate his sufferings

as iola gazed upon the kind but homely features of tom she saw his eyes open and an unexpressed desire upon his face

tenderly and sadly bending over him with tears in her dark luminous eyes she said  is there anything i can do for you 

 yes said tom with laboring breath   let me hole yore han an sing ober jordan inter glory an well anchor bye and bye 

iola laid her hand gently in the rough palm of the dying man and with a tremulous voice sang the parting hymns

tenderly she wiped the death damps from his dusky brow and imprinted upon it a farewell kiss gratitude and affection lit up the dying eye which seemed to be gazing into the eternities just then robert entered the room and seating himself quietly by toms bedside read the death signs in his face

 goodbye robert said tom meet me in de kingdom suddenly a look of recognition and rapture lit up his face and he murmured angels bright angels alls well alls well 

slowly his hand released its pressure a peaceful calm overspread his countenance and without a sigh or murmur thomas anderson iolas faithful and devoted friend passed away leaving the world so much poorer for her than it was before just then dr gresham the hospital physician came to the bedside felt for the pulse which would never throb again and sat down in silence by the cot

what do you think doctor said iola has he fainted  

no said the doctor poor fellow  he is dead

iola bowed her head in silent sorrow and then relieved the anguish of her heart by a flood of tears robert rose and sorrowfully left the room

iola with tearful eyes and aching heart clasped the cold hands over the still breast closed the waxen lid over the eye which had once beamed with kindness or flashed with courage and then went back after the burial to her daily round of duties feeling the sad missing of something from her life

 colonel said dr gresham to col robinson the commander of the post  i am perfectly mystified by miss leroy

what is the matter with her asked col robinson  is she not faithful to her duties and obedient to your directions  

 faithful is not the word to express her tireless energy and devotion to her work responded dr gresham  she must have been a born nurse to put such enthusiasm into her work

why doctor what is the matter with you you talk like a lover

a faint flush rose to the cheek of dr gresham as he smiled and said  oh come now colonel cant a man praise a woman without being in love with her

of course he can said col robinson but i know where such admiration is apt to lead ive been there myself but doctor had you not better defer your lovemaking till youre out of the woods

 i assure you colonel i am not thinking of love or courtship that is the business of the drawingroom and not of the camp but she did mystify me last night

how so asked col robinson

when tom was dying responded the doctor i saw that beautiful and refined young lady bend over and kiss him when she found that he was dead she just cried as if her heart was breaking well that was a new thing to me i can eat with colored people walk talk and fight with them but kissing them is something i dont hanker after

and yet you saw miss leroy do it 

yes and that puzzles me she is one of the most refined and ladylike women i ever saw i hear she is a refugee but she does not look like the other refugees who have come to our camp her accent is slightly southern but her manner is northern she is selfrespecting without being supercilious quiet without being dull her voice is low and sweet yet at times there are tones of such passionate tenderness in it that you would think some great sorrow has darkened and overshadowed her life without being the least gloomy her face at times is pervaded by an air of inexpressible sadness i sometimes watch her when she is not aware that i am looking at her and it seems as if a whole volume was depicted on her countenance when she smiles there is a longing in her eyes which is never satisfied i cannot understand how a southern lady whose education and manners stamp her as a woman of fine culture and good breeding could consent to occupy the position she so faithfully holds it is a mystery i cannot solve can you 

 i think i can answered col robinson

 will you tell me   queried the doctor

 yes on one condition

what is it 

 everlasting silence

 i promise said the doctor  the secret between us shall be as deep as the sea

 she has not requested secrecy but at present for her sake i do not wish the secret revealed miss leroy was a slave

oh no said dr gresham starting to his feet it cant be so  a woman as white as she a slave 

yes it is so continued the colonel in these states the child follows the condition of its mother this beautiful and accomplished girl was held by one of the worst rebels in town tom told me of it and i issued orders for her release

 well well is that so   said dr gresham thoughtfully stroking his beard wonders will never cease why i was just beginning to think seriously of her

whats to hinder your continuing to think asked col robinson

 what you tell me changes the whole complexion of affairs replied the doctor

if that be so i am glad i told you before you got head over heels in love

yes said dr gresham absently

dr gresham was a member of a wealthy and aristocratic family proud of its lineage which it could trace through generations of good blood to its ancestral isle he had become deeply interested in iola before he had heard her story but after it had been revealed to him he tried to banish her from his mind but his constant observation of her only increased his interest and admiration the deep pathos of her story the tenderness of her ministrations bestowed alike on black and white and the sad loneliness of her condition awakened within him a desire to defend and protect her all through her future life the fierce clashing of war had not taken all the romance out of his nature in iola he saw realized his ideal of the woman whom he was willing to marry a woman tender strong and courageous and rescued only by the strong arm of his government from a fate worse than death she was young in years but old in sorrow one whom a sad destiny had changed from a lighthearted girl to a heroic woman as he observed her he detected an undertone of sorrow in her most cheerful words and observed a quick flushing and sudden paling of her cheek as if she were living over scenes that were thrilling her soul with indignation or chilling her heart with horror as nurse and physician iola and dr gresham were constantly thrown together his friends sent him magazines and books which he gladly shared with her the hospital was a sad place mangled forms stricken down in the flush of their prime and energy pale young corpses sacrificed on the altar of slavery constantly drained on her sympathies dr gresham was glad to have some reading matter which might divert her mind from the memories of her mournful past and also furnish them both with interesting themes of conversation in their moments of relaxation from the harrowing scenes through which they were constantly passing without any effort or consciousness on her part his friendship ripened into love to him her presence was a pleasure her absence a privation and her loneliness drew deeply upon his sympathy he would have merited his own selfcontempt if by word or deed he had done anything to take advantage of her situation all the manhood and chivalry of his nature rose in her behalf and after carefully revolving the matter he resolved to win her for his bride bury her secret in his northern home and hide from his aristocratic relations all knowledge of her mournful past one day he said to iolaâ  this hospital life is telling on you your strength is failing and although you possess a wonderful amount of physical endurance you must not forget that saints have bodies and dwell in tabernacles of clay just the same as we common mortals

 compliments aside she said smiling  what are you driving at doctor

 i mean he replied  that you are running down and if you do not quit and take some rest you will be our patient instead of our nurse youd better take a furlough go north and return after the first frost

 doctor if that is your only remedy replied iola  i am afraid that i am destined to die at my post i have no special friends in the north and no home but this in the south i am homeless and alone

there was something so sad almost despairing in her tones in the drooping of her head and the quivering of her lip that they stirred dr greshams heart with sudden pity and drawing nearer to her he said  miss leroy you need not be all alone let me claim the privilege of making your life bright and happy iola i have loved you ever since i have seen your devotion to our poor sick boys how faithfully you a young and gracious girl have stood at your post and performed your duties and now i ask will you not permit me to clasp hands with you for life  i do not ask for a hasty reply give yourself time to think over what i have proposed

nearly twenty years before the war two young men of french and spanish descent sat conversing on a large verandah which surrounded an ancient home on the mississippi river it was french in its style of architecture large and rambling with no hint of modern improvements

the owner of the house was the only heir of a creole planter he had come into possession of an inheritance consisting of vast baronial estates bank stock and a large number of slaves eugene leroy being deprived of his parents was left at an early age to the care of a distant relative who had sent him to school and college and who occasionally invited him to spend his vacations at his home but eugene generally declined his invitations as he preferred spending his vacations at the watering places in the north with their fashionable and not always innocent gayeties young vivacious impulsive and undisciplined without the restraining influence of a mothers love or the guidance of a fathers hand leroy found himself when his college days were over in the dangerous position of a young man with vast possessions abundant leisure unsettled principles and uncontrolled desires he had no other object than to extract from life its most seductive draughts of ease and pleasure his companion who sat opposite him on the verandah quietly smoking a cigar was a remote cousin a few years older than himself the warmth of whose southern temperament had been modified by an infusion of northern blood

eugene was careless liberal and impatient of details while his companion and cousin alfred lorraine was selfish eager keen and alert also hard cold methodical and ever ready to grasp the main chance yet notwithstanding the difference between them they had formed a warm friendship for each other

alfred said eugene  i am going to be married lorraine opened his eyes with sudden wonder and exclaimed well thats the latest thing out i who is the fortunate lady who has bound you with her silken fetters  is it one of those beautiful creole girls who were visiting augustines plantation last winter i watched you during our visit there and thought that you could not be proof against their attractions which is your choice  it would puzzle me to judge between the two they had splendid eyes dark luminous and languishing lovely complexions and magnificent hair both were delightful in their manners refined and cultured with an air of vivacity mingled with their repose of manner which was perfectly charming as the law only allows us one which is your choice  miss annette has more force than her sister and if i could afford the luxury of a wife she would be my choice ah alf said eugene i see that you are a practical business man in marrying you want a wife to assist you as an efficient plantation mistress one who would tolerate no waste in the kitchen and no disorder in the parlor

 exactly so responded lorraine  i am too pool to marry a mere parlor ornament you can afford to do it i cannot

nonsense if i were as poor as a church mouse i would marry the woman i love

very fine sentiments said lorraine and were i as rich as you i would indulge in them also you know when my father died i had great expectations we had always lived in good style and i never thought for a moment he was not a rich man but when his estate was settled i found it was greatly involved and i was forced to face an uncertain future with scarcely a dollar to call my own land negroes cattle and horses all went under the hammer the only thing i retained was the education i received at the north that was my fathers best investment and all my stock in trade with that only as an outfit it would be madness for me to think of marrying one of those lovely girls they remind me of beautiful canary birds charming and pretty but not fitted for the wear and tear of plantation life well which is your choice neither replied eugene

then is it that magnificent looking widow from new orleans whom we met before you had that terrible spell of sickness and to whom you appeared so devoted  

not at all i have not heard from her since that summer she was fascinating and handsome but fearfully high strung

were you afraid of her

no but i valued my happiness too much to trust it in her hands

 sour grapes  said lorraine

no but i think that slavery and the lack of outside interests are beginning to tell on the lives of our  women they lean too much on their slaves have too much irresponsible power in their hands are narrowed and compressed by the routine of plantation life and the lack of intellectual stimulus

yes eugene when i see what other women are doing in the fields of literature and art i cannot help thinking an amount of brain power has been held in check among us yet i cannot abide those northern women with their suffrage views and abolition cant they just shock me

 but your mother was a northern woman said eugene

yes but she got bravely over her northern ideas as i remember her she was just as much a southerner as if she had been to the manor born she came here as a schoolteacher but soon after she came she married my father he was easy and indulgent with his servants and held them with a very loose rein but my mother was firm and energetic she made the niggers move around no shirking nor dawdling with her when my father died she took matters in hand but she only outlived him a few months if she had lived i believe that she would have retrieved our fortune i know that she had more executive ability than my father he was very squeamish about selling his servants but she would have put every one of them in her pocket before permitting them to eat her out of house and home but whom are you going to marry  

a young lady who graduates from a northern seminary next week responded eugene

i think you are very selfish said lorraine you might have invited a fellow to go with you to be your best man

the wedding is to be strictly private the lady whom i am to marry has negro blood in her veins the devil she has exclaimed lorraine starting to his feet and looking incredulously on the face of leroy are you in earnest  surely you must be jesting

 i am certainly in earnest answered eugene leroy  i mean every word i say

 oh it cant be possible are you mad   exclaimed lorraine

 never was saner in my life

what under heaven could have possessed you to do such a foolish thing  where did she come from right here on this plantation but i have educated and manumitted her and i intend marrying her

 why eugene it is impossible that you can have an idea of marrying one of your slaves why man she is your property to have and to hold to all intents and purposes are you not satisfied with the power and possession the law gives you 

no although the law makes her helpless in my hands to me her defenselessness is her best defense

 eugene we have known each other all of our lives and although i have always regarded you as eccentric i never saw you so completely off your balance before the idea of you with your proud family name your vast wealth in land and negroes intending to marry one of them is a mystery i cannot solve do explain to me why you are going to take this extremely strange and foolish step

 you never saw marie 

no and i dont want to

 she is very beautiful in the north no one would suspect that she has one drop of negro blood in her veins but here where i am known to marry her is to lose caste i could live with her and not incur much if any social opprobrium society would wink at the transgression even if after she had become the mother of my children i should cast her off and send her and them to the auction block

 men replied lorraine  would merely shrug their shoulders women would say you had been sowing your wild oats your money like charity would cover a multitude of faults

 but if i make her my lawful wife and recognize her children as my legitimate heirs i subject myself to social ostracism and a senseless persecution we americans boast of freedom and yet here is a woman whom i love as i never loved any other human being but both law and public opinion debar me from following the inclination of my heart she is beautiful faithful and pure and yet all that society will tolerate is what i would scorn to do

 but has not society the right to guard the purity of its blood by the rigidexclusion of an alien race  

 excluding it how asked eugene

 by debarring it from social intercourse

 perhaps it has continued eugene but should not society have a greater ban for those who by consorting with an alien race rob their offspring of a right to their names and to an inheritance in their property and who fix their social status among an enslaved and outcast race  dont eye me so curiously i am not losing my senses

 i think you have done that already said lorraine  dont you know that if she is as fair as a lily beautiful as a houri and chaste as ice that still she is a negro  

 oh come now she isnt much of a negro

 it doesnt matter however one drop of negro blood in her veins curses all the rest

 i know it said eugene sadly  but i have weighed the consequences and am prepared to take them

well eugene your course is so singular i do wish that you would tell me why you take this unprecedented step  

eugene laid aside his cigar looked thoughtfully at lorraine and said well alfred as we are kinsmen and lifelong friends i will not resent your asking my reason for doing that which seems to you the climax of absurdity and if you will have the patience to listen i will tell you

 proceed i am all attention

 my father died said eugene  as you know when i was too young to know his loss or feel his care and being an only child i was petted and spoiled i grew up to be wayward selfindulgent proud and imperious i went from home and made many friends both at college and in foreign lands i was well supplied with money and never having been forced to earn it was ignorant of its value and careless of its use my lavish expenditures and liberal benefactions attracted to me a number of parasites and men older than myself led me into the paths of vice and taught me how to gather the flowers of sin which blossom around the borders of hell in a word i left my home unwarned and unarmed against the seductions of vice i returned an initiated devotee to debasing pleasures years of my life were passed in foreign lands years in which my soul slumbered and seemed pervaded with a moral paralysis years the memory of which fills my soul with sorrow and shame i went to the capitals of the old world to see life but in seeing life i became acquainted with death the death of true manliness and selfrespect you look astonished but i tell you alf there is many a poor clodhopper on whom are the dust and grime of unremitting toil who feels more selfrespect and true manliness than many of us with our family prestige social position and proud ancestral halls after i had lived abroad for years i returned a brokendown young man prematurely old my constitution a perfect wreck a life of folly and dissipation was telling fearfully upon me my friends shrank from me in dismay i was sick nigh unto death and had it not been for maries care i am certain that i should have died she followed me down to the borders of the grave and won me back to life and health i was slow in recovering and during the time i had ample space for reflection and the past unrolled itself before me i resolved over the wreck and ruin of my past life to build a better and brighter future marie had a voice of remarkable sweetness although it lacked culture often when i was nervous and restless i would have her sing some of those weird and plaintive melodies which she had learned from the plantation negroes sometimes i encouraged her to talk and i was surprised at the native vigor of her intellect by degrees i became acquainted with her history she was all alone in the world she had no recollection of her father but remembered being torn from her mother while clinging to her dress the trader who bought her mother did not wish to buy her she remembered having a brother with whom she used to play but she had been separated from him also and since then had lost all trace of them after she was sold from her mother she became the property of an excellent old lady who seems to have been very careful to imbue her mind with good principles a woman who loved purity not only for her own daughters but also for the defenseless girls in her home i believe it was the ladys intention to have freed marie at her death but she died suddenly and the estate being involved she was sold with it and fell into the hands of my agent i became deeply interested in her when i heard her story and began to pity her

 and i suppose love sprang from pity

 i not only pitied her but i learned to respect her i had met with beautiful women in the halls of wealth and fashion both at home and abroad but there was something in her different from all my experience of womanhood

 i should think so said lorraine with a sneer  but i should like to know what it was

 it was something such as i have seen in old cathedrals lighting up the beauty of a saintly face a light which the poet tells was never seen on land or sea i thought of this beautiful and defenseless girl adrift in the power of a reckless man who with all the advantages of wealth and education had trailed his manhood in the dust and she with simple childlike faith in the unseen seemed to be so good and pure that she commanded my respect and won my heart in her presence every base and unholy passion died subdued by the supremacy of her virtue

 why eugene what has come over you  talking of the virtue of these quadroon girls you have lived so long in the north and abroad that you seem to have lost the cue of our southern life dont you know that these beautiful girls have been the curse of our homes  you have no idea of the hearts which are wrung by their presence

but alfred suppose it is so are they to blame for it  what can any woman do when she is placed in the hands of an irresponsible master when she knows that resistance is vain yes alfred i agree with you these women are the bane of our southern civilization but they are the victims and we are the criminals

 i think from the airs that some of them put on when they get a chance that they are very willing victims

 so much the worse for our institution if it is cruel to debase a hapless victim it is an increase of cruelty to make her contented with her degradation let me tell you alf you cannot wrong or degrade a woman without wronging or degrading yourself

 what is the matter with you eugene  are you thinking of taking priests orders 

 no alf said eugene rising and rapidly pacing the floor you may defend the system as much as you please but you cannot deny that the circumstances it creates and the temptations it affords are sapping our strength and undermining our character

 that may be true said lorraine somewhat irritably but you had better be careful how you air your northern notions in public

why so  

 because public opinion is too sensitive to tolerate any such discussions

and is not that a proof that we are at fault with respect to our institutions

i dont know i only know we are living in the midst of a magazine of powder and it is not safe to enter it with a lighted candle

 let me proceed with my story continued eugene during the long months in which i was convalescing i was left almost entirely to the companionship of marie in my library i found a bible which i began to read from curiosity but my curiosity deepened into interest when i saw the rapt expression on maries face i saw in it a loving response to sentiments to which i was a stranger in the meantime my conscience was awakened and i scorned to take advantage of her defenselessness i felt that i owed my life to her faithful care and i resolved to take her north manumit educate and marry her i sent her to a northern academy but as soon as some of the pupils found that she was colored objections were raised and the principal was compelled to dismiss her during my search for a school i heard of one where three girls of mixed blood were pursuing their studies every one of whom would have been ignominiously dismissed had their connection with the negro race been known but i determined to run no risks i found a school where her connection with the negro race would be no bar to her advancement she graduates next week and i intend to marry her before i return home she was faithful when others were faithless stood by me when others deserted me to die in loneliness and neglect and now i am about to reward her care with all the love and devotion it is in my power to bestow that is why i am about to marry my faithful and devoted nurse who snatched me from the jaws of death now that i have told you my story what say you  

 madness and folly inconceivable   exclaimed lorraine

 what to you is madness and folly is perfect sanity with me after all alf is there not an amount of unreason in our prejudices 

 that may be true but i wasnt reasoned into it and i do not expect to be reasoned out of it

 will you accompany me north 

no except to put you in an insane asylum you are the greatest crank out said lorraine thoroughly disgusted

 no thank you  im all right i expect to start north tomorrow you had better come and go

 i would rather follow you to your grave replied lorraine hotly while an expression of ineffable scorn passed over his cold proud face

on the next morning after this conversation leroy left for the north to attend the commencement and witness the graduation of his ward arriving in ohio he immediately repaired to the academy and inquired for the principal he was shown into the receptionroom and in a few moments the principal entered

 good morning said leroy rising and advancing towards him   how is my ward this morning  

she is well and has been expecting you i am glad you came in time for the commencement she stands among the foremost in her class

 i am glad to hear it will you send her this   said leroy handing the principal a card the principal took the card and immediately left the room

very soon leroy heard a light step and looking up he saw a radiantly beautiful woman approaching him

good morning marie he said greeting her cordially and gazing upon her with unfeigned admiration  you are looking very handsome this morning

 do you think so  she asked smiling and blushing  i am glad you are not disappointed  that you do not feel your money has been spent in vain

 oh no what i have spent on your education has been the best investment i ever made

i hope said marie you may always find it so but mas

 hush   said leroy laying his hand playfully on her lips you are free i dont want the dialect of slavery to linger on your lips you must not call me that name again

 why not  

 because i have a nearer and dearer one by which i wish to be called

leroy drew her nearer and whispered in her ear a single word she started trembled with emotion grew pale and blushed painfully an awkward silence ensued when leroy pressing her hand exclaimed   this is the hand that plucked me from the grave and i am going to retain it as mine  mine to guard with my care until death us do part

leroy looked earnestly into her eyes which fell beneath his ardent gaze with admirable selfcontrol while a great joy was thrilling her heart she bowed her beautiful head and softly repeated  until death us do part

leroy knew southern society too well to expect it to condone his offense against its social customs or give the least recognition to his wife however cultured refined and charming she might be if it were known that she had the least infusion of negro blood in her veins but he was brave enough to face the consequences of his alliance and marry the woman who was the choice of his heart and on whom his affections were centred

after leroy had left the room marie sat awhile thinking of the wonderful change that had come over her instead of being a lonely slave girl with the fatal dower of beauty liable to be bought and sold exchanged and bartered she was to be the wife of a wealthy planter a man in whose honor she could confide and on whose love she could lean

very interesting and pleasant were the commencement exercises in which marie bore an important part to enlist sympathy for her enslaved race and appear to advantage before leroy had aroused all of her energies the stimulus of hope the manly love which was environing her life brightened her eye and lit up the wonderful beauty of her countenance during her stay in the north she had constantly been brought in contact with antislavery people she was not aware that there was so much kindness among the white people of the country until she had tested it in the north from the antislavery people in private life she had learned some of the noblest lessons of freedom and justice and had become imbued with their sentiments her theme was american civilization its lights and shadows

graphically she portrayed the lights faithfully she showed the shadows of our american civilization earnestly and feelingly she spoke of the blind sampson in our land who might yet shake the pillars of our great commonwealth leroy listened attentively at times a shadow of annoyance would overspread his face but it was soon lost in the admiration her earnestness and zeal inspired like esther pleading for the lives of her people in the oriental courts of a despotic king she stood before the audience pleading for those whose lips were sealed but whose condition appealed to the mercy and justice of the nation strong men wiped the moisture from their eyes and womens hearts throbbed in unison with the strong brave words that were uttered in behalf of freedom for all and chains for none generous applause was freely bestowed and beautiful bouquets were showered upon her when it was known that she was to be the wife of her guardian warm congratulations were given and earnest hopes expressed for the welfare of the lonely girl who nearly all her life had been deprived of a parents love and care on the eve of starting south leroy procured a license and united his destiny with the young lady whose devotion in the darkest hour had won his love and gratitude

in a few days marie returned as mistress to the plantation from which she had gone as a slave but as unholy alliances were common in those days between masters and slaves no one took especial notice that marie shared leroys life as mistress of his home and that the family silver and jewelry were in her possession but leroy happy in his choice attended to the interests of his plantation and found companionship in his books and in the society of his wife a few male companions visited him occasionally admired the magnificent beauty of his wife shook their heads and spoke of him as being very eccentric but thought his marriage the great mistake of his life but none of his female friends ever entered his doors when it became known that marie held the position of mistress of his mansion and presided at his table but she sheltered in the warm clasp of loving arms found her life like a joyous dream

into that quiet and beautiful home three children were born unconscious of the doom suspended over their heads

oh how glad i am marie would often say that these children are free i could never understand how a cultured white man could have his own children enslaved i can understand how savages fighting with each other could doom their vanquished foes to slavery but it has always been a puzzle to me how a civilized man could drag his own children bone of his bone flesh of his flesh down to the position of social outcasts abject slaves and political pariahs

but marie said eugene all men do not treat their illegitimate children in the manner you describe the last time i was in new orleans i met henri augustine at the depot with two beautiful young girls at first i thought that they were his own children they resembled him so closely but afterwards i noticed that they addressed him as mister before we parted he told me that his wife had taken such a dislike to their mother that she could not bear to see them on the place at last weary of her dissatisfaction he had promised to bring them to new orleans and sell them instead he was going to ohio to give them their freedom and make provision for their future

what a wrong   said marie

 who was wronged   said leroy in astonishment

 everyone in the whole transaction answered marie your friend wronged himself by sinning against his own soul he wronged his wife by arousing her hatred and jealousy through his unfaithfulness he wronged those children by giving them the status of slaves and outcasts he wronged their mother by imposing upon her the burdens and cares of maternity without the rights and privileges of a wife he made her crown of motherhood a circlet of shame under other circumstances she might have been an honored wife and happy mother

and i do think such men wrong their own legitimate children by transmitting to them a weakened moral fibre

 oh marie you have such an uncomfortable way of putting things you make me feel that we have done those things which we ought not to have done and have left undone those things which we ought to have done if it annoys you said marie  i will stop talking oh no go on said leroy carelessly and then he continued more thoughtfully  i know a number of men who have sent such children north and manumitted educated and left them valuable legacies we are all liable to err and having done wrong all we can do is to make reparation

 my dear husband this is a wrong where reparation is impossible neither wealth nor education can repair the wrong of a dishonored birth there are a number of slaves in this section who are servants to their own brothers and sisters whose fathers have robbed them not simply of liberty but of the right of being well born do you think these things will last forever

 i suppose not there are some prophets of evil who tell us that the union is going to dissolve but i know it would puzzle their brains to tell where the crack will begin i reckon well continue to jog along as usual  cotton fights and cotton conquers for american slavery

even while leroy dreamed of safety the earthquake was cradling its fire the ground was growing hollow beneath his tread but his ear was too dull to catch the sound his vision too blurred to read the signs of the times

 marie said leroy taking up the thread of the discourse slavery is a sword that cuts both ways if it wrongs the negro it also curses the white man but we are in it and what can we do  

get out of it as quickly as possible

that is easier said than done i would willingly free every slave on my plantation if i could do so without expatriating them some of them have wives and children on other plantations and to free them is to separate them from their kith and kin to let them remain here as a free people is out of the question my hands are tied by law and custom

who tied them asked marie

a public opinion whose meshes i cannot break if the negro is the thrall of his master we are just as much the thralls of public opinion

why do you not battle against public opinion if you think it is wrong  

 because i have neither the courage of a martyr nor the faith of a saint and so i drift along trying to make the condition of our slaves as comfortable as i possibly can i believe there are slaves on this plantation whom the most flattering offers of freedom would not entice away

i do not think said marie that some of you planters understand your own slaves lying is said to be the vice of slaves the more intelligent of them have so learned to veil their feelings that you do not see the undercurrent of discontent beneath their apparent good humor and jollity the more discontented they are the more i respect them to me a contented slave is an abject creature i hope that i shall see the day when there will not be a slave in the land i hate the whole thing from the bottom of my heart

 marie your northern education has unfitted you for southern life you are free yourself and so are our children why not let well enough alone

because i love liberty not only for myself but for every human being think how dear these children are to me and then for the thought to be forever haunting me that if you were dead they could be turned out of doors and divided among your relatives i sometimes lie awake at night thinking of how there might be a screw loose somewhere and after all the children and i might be reduced to slavery

 marie what in the world is the matter with you  have you had a presentiment of my death or as uncle jack says  hab you seed it in a vision  

no but i have had such sad forebodings that they almost set me wild one night i dreamt that you were dead that the lawyers entered the house seized our property and remanded us to slavery i never can be satisfied in the south with such a possibility hanging over my head

 marie dear you are growing nervous your imagination is too active you are left too much alone on this plantation i hope that for your own and the childrens sake i will be enabled to arrange our affairs so as to find a home for you where you will not be doomed to the social isolation and ostracism that surround you here  i dont mind the isolation for myself but the children you have enjoined silence on me with respect to their connection with the negro race but i do not think we can conceal it from them very long it will not be long before iola will notice the offishness of girls of her own age and the scornful glances which even now i think are leveled at her yesterday harry came crying to me and told me that one of the neighbors boys had called him nigger

a shadow flitted over leroys face as he answered somewhat soberly oh marie do not meet trouble half way i have manumitted you and the children will follow your condition i have made you all legatees of my will except my cousin alfred lorraine i have only distant relatives whom i scarcely know and who hardly know me

 your cousin lorraine  are you sure our interests would be safe in his hands 

 i think so  i dont think alfred would do anything dishonorable

 he might not with his equals but how many men would be bound by a sense of honor where the rights of a colored woman are in question  your cousin was bitterly opposed to our marriage and i would not trust any important interests in his hands i do hope that in providing for our future you will make assurance doubly sure

 i certainly will and all that human foresight can do shall be done for you and our children

 oh said marie pressing to her heart a beautiful child of six summers  i think it would almost make me turn over in my grave to know that every grace and charm which this child possesses would only be so much added to her value as an article of merchandise

as marie released the child from her arms she looked wonderingly into her mothers face and clung closely to her as if to find refuge from some unseen evil leroy noticed this and sighed unconsciously as an expression of pain flitted over his face

 now marie he continued stop tormenting yourself with useless fears although with all her faults i still love the south i will make arrangements either to live north or go to france there life will be brighter for us all now marie seat yourself at the piano and singâ  sing me the songs that to me were so dear long long ago

sing me the songs i delighted to hear long long ago

as marie sang the anxiety faded from her face a sense of security stole over her and she sat among her loved ones a happy wife and mother what if no one recognized her on that lonely plantation her world was nevertheless there the love and devotion of her husband brightened every avenue of her life while her children filled her home with music mirth and sunshine

marie had undertaken their education but she could not give them the culture which comes from the attrition of thought and from contact with the ideas of others since her schooldays she had read extensively and thought much and in solitude her thoughts had ripened but for her children there were no companions except the young slaves of the plantation and she dreaded the effect of such intercourse upon their lives and characters

leroy had always been especially careful to conceal from his children the knowledge of their connection with the negro race to marie this silence was oppressive

one day she said to him  i see no other way of finishing the education of these children than by sending them to some northern school

 i have come said leroy to the same conclusion we had better take iola and harry north and make arrangements for them to spend several years in being educated riches take wings to themselves and fly away but a good education is an investment on which the law can place no attachment as there is a possibility of their origin being discovered i will find a teacher to whom i can confide our story and upon whom i can enjoin secrecy i want them well fitted for any emergency in life when i discover for what they have the most aptitude i will give them especial training in that direction

a troubled look passed over the face of marie as she hesitatingly said   i am so afraid that you will regret our marriage when you fully realize the complications it brings

no no said leroy tenderly it is not that i regret our marriage or feel the least disdain for our children on account of the blood in their veins but i do not wish them to grow up under the contracting influence of this race prejudice i do not wish them to feel that they have been born under a proscription from which no valor can redeem them nor that any social advancement or individual development can wipe off the ban which clings to them no marie let them go north learn all they can aspire all they may the painful knowledge will come all too soon do not forestall it i want them simply to grow up as other children not being patronized by friends nor disdained by foes

my dear husband you may be perfectly right but are you not preparing our children for a fearful awakening  are you not acting on the plan  after me the deluge 

 not at all marie i want our children to grow up without having their selfrespect crushed in the bud you know that the north is not free from racial prejudice

i know it said marie sadly and i think one of the great mistakes of our civilization is that which makes color and not character a social test

 i think so too said leroy  the strongest men and women of a downtrodden race may bare their bosoms to an adverse fate and develop courage in the midst of opposition but we have no right to subject our children to such crucial tests before their characters are formed for years when i lived abroad i had an opportunity to see and hear of men of african descent who had distinguished themselves and obtained a recognition in european circles which they never could have gained in this country i now recall the name of ira aldridge a colored man from new york city who was covered with princely honors as a successful tragedian alexander dumas was not forced to conceal his origin to succeed as a novelist when i was in st petersburg i was shown the works of alexander sergevitch a russian poet who was spoken of as the byron of russian literature and reckoned one of the finest poets that russia has produced in this century he was also a prominent figure in fashionable society and yet he was of african lineage one of his paternal ancestors was a negro who had been ennobled by peter the great i cant help contrasting the recognition which these men had received with the treatment which has been given to frederick douglass and other intelligent colored men in this country with me the wonder is not that they have achieved so little but that they have accomplished so much no marie we will have j our children educated without being subjected to the j depressing influences of caste feeling perhaps by the time their education is finished i will be ready to wind up my affairs and take them abroad where merit and ability will give them entrance into the best circles of art literature and science

after this conversation leroy and his wife went north and succeeded in finding a good school for their children in a private interview he confided to the principal the story of the cross in their blood and finding him apparently free from racial prejudice he gladly left the children in his care gracie the youngest child remained at home and her mother spared no pains to fit her for the seminary against the time her sister should have finished her education

years passed bringing no special change to the life of leroy and his wife shut out from the busy world its social cares and anxieties maries life flowed peacefully on although removed by the protecting care of leroy from the condition of servitude she still retained a deep sympathy for the enslaved and was ever ready to devise plans to ameliorate their condition

leroy although in the midst of slavery did not believe in the rightfulness of the institution he was in favor of gradual emancipation which would prepare both master and slave for a moral adaptation to the new conditions of freedom while he was willing to have the old rivets taken out of slavery politicians and planters were devising plans to put in new screws he was desirous of having it ended in the states they were clamorous to have it established in the territories

but so strong was the force of habit combined with the feebleness of his moral resistance and the nature of his environment that instead of being an athlete armed for a glorious strife he had learned to drift where he should have steered to float with the current instead of nobly breasting the tide he conducted his plantation with as much lenity as it was possible to infuse into a system darkened with the shadow of a million crimes

leroy had always been especially careful not to allow his children to spend their vacations at home he and marie generally spent that time with them at some summer resort

 i would like said marie one day  to have our children spend their vacations at home those summer resorts are pleasant yet after all there is no place like home but and her voice became tremulous our children would now notice their social isolation and inquire the cause a faint sigh arose to the lips of leroy as she added man is a social being ive known it to my sorrow

there was a tone of sadness in leroys voice as he replied  yes marie let them stay north we seem to be entering on a period fraught with great danger i cannot help thinking and fearing that we are on the eve of a civil war

a civil war  exclaimed marie with an air of astonishment a civil war about what 

why marie the thing looks to me so wild and foolish i hardly know how to explain but some of our leading men have come to the conclusion that north and south had better separate and instead of having one to have two independent governments the spirit of secession is rampant in the land i do not know what the result will be and i fear it will bode no good to the country between the fireeating southerners and the meddling abolitionists we are about to be plunged into a great deal of trouble i fear there are breakers ahead the south is dissatisfied with the state of public opinion in the north we are realizing that we are two peoples in the midst of one nation william h seward has proclaimed that the conflict between freedom and slavery is irrepressible and that the country cannot remain half free and half slave

 how willow go  asked marie

 my heart is with the union i dont believe in secession there has been no cause sufficient to justify a rupture the north has met us time and again in the spirit of concession and compromise when we wanted the continuance of the african slave trade the north conceded that we should have twenty years of slavetrading for the benefit of our plantations when we wanted more territory she conceded to our desires and gave us land enough to carve out four states and there yet remains enough for four more when we wanted power to recapture our slaves when they fled north for refuge daniel webster told northerners to conquer their prejudices and they gave us the whole northern states as a hunting ground for our slaves the presidential chair has been filled the greater number of years by southerners and the majority of offices has been shared by our men we wanted representation in congress on a basis which would include our slaves and the north whose suffrage represents only men gave us a threefifths representation for our slaves whom we count as property i think the step will be suicidal there are extremists in both sections but i hope between them both wise counsels and measures will prevail

just then alfred lorraine was ushered into the room occasionally he visited leroy but he always came alone his wife was the only daughter of an enterprising slavetrader who had left her a large amount of property

her social training was deficient her education limited but she was too proud of being a pure white woman to enter the home of leroy with marie as its presiding genius lorraine tolerated maries presence as a necessary evil while to her he always seemed like a presentiment of trouble with his coming a shadow fell upon her home hushing its music and darkening its sunshine a sense of dread oppressed her there came into her soul an intuitive feeling that somehow his coming was fraught with danger when not peering around she would often catch his eyes bent on her with a baleful expression

leroy and his cousin immediately fell into a discussion on the condition of the country lorraine was a rank secessionist ready to adopt the most extreme measures of the leaders of the movement even to the reopening of the slave trade leroy thought a dissolution of the union would involve a fearful expenditure of blood and treasure for which before the eyes of the world there could be no justification the debate lasted late into the night leaving both lorraine and leroy just as set in their opinions as they were before they began marie listened attentively awhile then excused herself and withdrew

after lorraine had gone marie said   there is something about your cousin that fills me with nameless dread i always feel when he enters the room as if some one were walking over my grave i do wish he would stay at home

i wish so too since he disturbs you but marie you are growing nervous how cold your hands are dont you feel well  

 oh yes  i am only a little faint i wish he would never come but as he does i must make the best of it

 yes marie treat him well for my sake he is the only relative i have who ever darkens our doors

 i have no faith in his friendship for either myself or my children i feel that while he makes himself agreeable to you he hates me from the bottom of his heart and would do anything to get me out of the way oh i am so glad i am your lawful wife and that you married me before you brought me back to this state i believe that if you were gone he wouldnt have the least scruple against trying to prove our marriage invalid and remanding us to slavery

leroy looked anxiously and soberly at his wife and said   marie i do not think so your life is too lonely here write your orders to new orleans get what you need for the journey and let us spend the summer somewhere in the north

just then maries attention was drawn to some household matters and it was a short time before she returned

 tom continued leroy  has just brought the mail and here is a letter from iola

marie noticed that he looked quite sober as he read and that an expression of vexation was lingering on his lips

what is the matter  asked marie

nothing much only a tempest in a teapot the presence of a colored girl in mr galens school has caused a breeze of excitement you know mr galen is quite an abolitionist and being true to his principles he could not consistently refuse when a colored woman applied for her daughters admission of course when he took her he was compelled to treat her as any other pupil in so doing he has given mortal offense to the mother of two southern boys she has threatened to take them away if the colored girl remains

what will he do about it asked marie thoughtfully

 oh it is a bitter pill but i think he will have to swallow it he is between two fires he cannot dismiss her from the school and be true to his abolition principles yet if he retains her he will lose his southern customers and i know he cannot afford to do that

 what does iola say 

 he has found another boarding place for her but she is to remain in the school he had to throw that sop to the whale

 does she take sides against the girl 

no i dont think she does she says she feels sorry for her and that she would hate to be colored  it is so hard to be looked down on for what one cant help poor child i wish we could leave the country i never would consent to her marrying any one without first revealing to him her connection with the negro race this is a subject on which i am not willing to run any risks

 my dear marie when you shall have read iolas letter you will see it is more than a figment of my imagination that has made me so loth to have our children know the paralyzing power of caste

leroy always liberal with his wife and children spared neither pains nor expense to have them prepared for their summer outing iola was to graduate in a few days harry was attending a school in the state of maine and his father had written to him apprising him of his intention to come north that season in a few days leroy and his wife started north but before they reached vicksburg they were met by the intelligence that the yellow fever was spreading in the delta and that pestilence was breathing its bane upon the morning air and distilling its poison upon the midnight dews

let us return home said marie

 it is useless answered leroy  it is nearly two days since we left home the fever is spreading south of us with fearful rapidity to return home is to walk into the jaws of death it was my intention to have stopped at vicksburg but now i will go on as soon as i can make the connections

early next morning leroy and his wife started again on their journey the cars were filled with terrorstricken people who were fleeing from death when death was everywhere they fled from the city only to meet the dreaded apparition in the country as they journeyed on leroy grew restless and feverish he tried to brace himself against the infection which was creeping slowly but insidiously into his life dulling his brain fevering his blood and prostrating his strength but vain were all his efforts he had no armor strong enough to repel the invasion of death they stopped at a small town on the way and obtained the best medical skill and most careful nursing but neither skill nor art availed on the third day death claimed leroy as a victim and marie wept in hopeless agony over the grave of her devoted husband whose sad lot it was to die from home and be buried among strangers

but before he died he placed his will in maries hands saying  i have left you well provided for kiss the children for me and bid them goodbye

he tried to say a parting word to gracie but his voice failed and he fainted into the stillness of death a mortal paleness overspread his countenance on which had already gathered the shadows that never deceive in speechless agony marie held his hand until it released its pressure in death and then she stood alone beside her dead with all the bright sunshine of her life fading into the shadows of the grave heartbroken and full of fearful forebodings marie left her cherished dead in the quiet village of hand returned to her deathdarkened home

it was a lovely day in june birds were singing their sweetest songs flowers were breathing their fragrance on the air when mam liza sitting at her cabindoor talking with some of the house servants saw a carriage approaching and wondered who was coming

 i wonder she said excitedly whose comin to de house when de folks is done gone

but her surprise was soon changed to painful amazement when she saw marie robed in black alighting from the carriage and holding gracie by the hand she caught sight of the drooping head and griefstricken face and rushed to her exclaimingâ  whars marse eugene  

 dead said marie falling into mammy lizas arms sobbing out  dead  he died of yellow fever

a wild burst of sorrow came from the lips of the servants who had drawn near

where is he said mam liza speaking like one suddenly bewildered

 he is buried in h i could not bring him home said marie

 my pore baby said mam liza with broken sobs  ise drefful sorry my hearts most broke into two then controlling herself she dismissed the servants who stood around weeping and led marie to her room

come honey lie down an lemme git yer a cup ob tea

 oh no i dont want anything said marie wringing her hands in bitter agony

oh honey said mam liza yer musnt gib up yer knows whar to put yer trus yer cant lean on de arm of flesh in dis tryin time kneeling by the side of her mistress she breathed out a prayer full of tenderness hope and trust

marie grew calmer it seemed as if that earnest trustful prayer had breathed into her soul a feeling of resignation

gracie stood wonderingly by vainly trying to comprehend the great sorrow which was overwhelming the life of her mother

after the first great burst of sorrow was over marie sat down to her desk and wrote a letter to iola informing her of her fathers death by the time she had finished it she grew dizzy and faint and fell into a swoon mammy liza tenderly laid her on the bed and helped restore her to consciousness

lorraine having heard of his cousins death came immediately to see marie she was too ill to have an interview with him but he picked up the letter she had written and obtained iolas address

lorraine made a careful investigation of the case to ascertain whether maries marriage was valid to his delight he found there was a flaw in the marriage and an informality in the manumission he then determined to invalidate maries claim and divide the inheritance among leroys white relations in a short time strangers distant relatives of her husband became frequent visitors at the plantation and made themselves offensively familiar at length the dreadful storm burst

alfred lorraine entered suit for his cousins estate and for the remanding of his wife and children to slavery in a short time he came armed with legal authority and said to marieâ  i have come to take possession of these premises

by what authority she gasped turning deathly pale he hesitated a moment as if his words were arrested by a sense of shame

 by what authority   she again demanded

 by the authority of the law answered lorraine which has decided that leroys legal heirs are his white blood relations and that your marriage is null and void

 but exclaimed marie  i have our marriage certificate i was leroys lawful wife

 your marriage certificate is not worth the paper it is written on

oh you must be jesting cruelly jesting it cant be so

yes it is so judge starkins has decided that your manumission is unlawful your marriage a bad precedent and inimical to the welfare of society and that you and your children are remanded to slavery

marie stood as one petrified she seemed a statue of fear and despair she tried to speak reached out her hand as if she were groping in the dark turned pale as death as if all the blood in her veins had receded to her heart and with one heartrending cry of bitter agony she fell senseless to the floor her servants to whom she had been so kind in her days of prosperity bent pityingly over her chafed her cold hands and did what they could to restore her to consciousness for awhile she was stricken with brain fever and her life seemed trembling on its frailest cord

gracie was like one perfectly dazed when not watching by her mothers bedside she wandered aimlessly about the house growing thinner day by day a slow fever was consuming her life faithfully and carefully mammy liza watched over her and did all she could to bring smiles to her lips and light to her fading eyes but all in vain her only interest in life was to sit where she could watch her mother as she tossed to and fro in delirium and to wonder what had brought the change in her once happy home finally she too was stricken with brain fever which intervened as a mercy between her and the great sorrow that was overshadowing her young life tears would fill the servants eyes as they saw the dear child drifting from them like a lovely vision too bright for earths dull cares and weary wasting pain

during iolas stay in the north she found a strong tide of opposition against slavery arguments against the institution had entered the church and made legislative halls the arenas of fierce debate the subject had become part of the social converse of the fireside and had enlisted the best brain and heart of the country antislavery discussions were pervading the strongest literature and claiming a place on the most popular platforms

iola being a southern girl and a slaveholders daughter always defended slavery when it was under discussion

 slavery cant be wrong she would say  for my father is a slaveholder and my mother is as good to our servants as she can be my father often tells her that she spoils them and lets them run over her i never saw my father strike one of them i love my mammy as much as i do my own mother and i believe she loves us just as if we were her own children when we are sick i am sure that she could not do anything more for us than she does

 but iola responded one of her school friends after all they are not free would you be satisfied to have the most beautiful home the costliest jewels or the most elegant wardrobe if you were a slave 

 oh the cases are not parallel our slaves do not want their freedom they would not take it if we gave it to them

 that is not the case with them all my father has seen men who have encountered almost incredible hardships to get their freedom iola did you ever attend an antislavery meeting

 no  i dont think these abolitionists have any right to meddle in our affairs i believe they are prejudiced against us and want to get our property i read about them in the papers when i was at home i dont want to hear my part of the country run down my father says the slaves would be very well contented if no one put wrong notions in their heads

 i dont know was the response of her friend  but i do not think that that slave mother who took her four children crossed the ohio river on the ice killed one of the children and attempted the lives of the other two was a contented slave and that other one who running away and finding herself pursued threw herself over the long bridge into the potomac was evidently not satisfied i do not think the numbers who are coming north on the underground railroad can be very contented it is not natural for people to run away from happiness and if they are so happy and contented why did congress pass the fugitive slave bill 

well i dont think answered iola any of our slaves would run away i know mamma dont like slavery very much i have often heard her say that she hoped the time would come when there would not be a slave in the land my father does not think as she does he thinks slavery is not wrong if you treat them well and dont sell them from their families i intend after i have graduated to persuade pa to buy a house in new orleans and spend the winter there you know this will be my first season out and i hope that you will come and spend the winter with me we will have such gay times and you will so fall in love with our sunny south that you will never want to come back to shiver amid the snows and cold of the north i think one winter in the south would cure you of your abolitionism

 have you seen her yet  

this question was asked by louis bastine an attorney who had come north in the interests of lorraine the scene was the new england village where mr galens academy was located and which iola was attending this question was addressed to camille lecroix bastines intimate friend who had lately come north he was the son of a planter who lived near leroys plantation and was familiar with iolas family history since his arrival north bastine had met him and communicated to him his intentions

yes just caught a glimpse of her this morning as she was going down the street was camilles reply

 she is a most beautiful creature said louis bastine  she has the proud poise of leroy the most splendid eyes i ever saw in a womans head lovely complexion and a glorious wealth of hair she would bring  any day in a new orleans market

 i always feel sorry said camille  when i see one of those creole girls brought to the auction block i have known fathers who were deeply devoted to their daughters but who through some reverse of fortune were forced to part with them and i always think the blow has been equally terrible on both sides i had a friend who had two beautiful daughters whom he had educated in the north they were cultured and really belles in society they were entirely ignorant of their lineage but when their father died it was discovered that their mother had been a slave it was a fearful blow they would have faced poverty but the knowledge of their tainted blood was more than they could bear

 what became of them  

 they both died poor girls i believe they were as much killed by the blow as if they had been shot to tell you the truth bastine i feel sorry for this girl i dont believe she has the least idea of her negro blood

no leroy has been careful to conceal it from her replied bastine

 is that so  queried camille then he has made a great mistake

i cant help that said bastine business is business

 how can you get her away asked camille you will have to be very cautious because if these pesky abolitionists get an inkling of what youre doing they will balk your game double quick and when you come to look at it isnt it a shame to attempt to reduce that girl to slavery  she is just as white as we are as good as any girl in the land and better educated than thousands of white girls a girl with her apparent refinement and magnificent beauty were it not for the cross in her blood i would be proud to introduce to our set she would be the sensation of the season i believe today it would be easier for me to go to the slums and take a young girl from there and have her introduced as my wife than to have society condone the offense if i married that lovely girl there is not a social circle in the south that would not take it as a gross insult to have her introduced into it

well said bastine my plan is settled leroy has never allowed her to spend her vacations at home i understand she is now very anxious to get home and as lorraines attorney i have come on his account to take her home

 how will you do it  

 i shall tell her her father is dangerously ill and desires her to come as quickly as possible

 and what then  

 have her inventoried with the rest of the property  dont she know that her father is dead  

 i think not said bastine  she is not in mourning but appeared very lighthearted this morning laughing and talking with two other girls i was struck with her great beauty and asked a gentleman who she was he said miss leroy of mississippi i think lorraine has managed the affair so as to keep her in perfect ignorance of her fathers death i dont like the job but i never let sentiment interfere with my work poor iola when she said slavery was not a bad thing little did she think that she was destined to drink to its bitter dregs the cup she was so ready to press to the lips of others

 how do you think she will take to her situation   asked camille

o i guess said bastine she will sulk and take it pretty hard at first but if she is managed right she will soon get over it give her plenty of jewelry fine clothes and an easy time

 all this business must be conducted with the utmost secrecy and speed her mother could not have written to her for she has been suffering with brain fever and nervous prostration since leroys death lorraine knows her market value too well and is too shrewd to let so much property pass out of his hands without making an effort to retain it

 has she any brothers or sisters  

yes a brother replied bastine   but he is at another school and i have no orders from lorraine in reference to him if i can get the girl i am willing to let well enough alone i dread the interview with the principal more than anything else i am afraid he will hem and haw and have his doubts perhaps when he sees my letters and hears my story i can pull the wool over his eyes

 but louis this is a pitiful piece of business i should hate to be engaged in it

a deep flush of shame overspread for a moment the face of lorraines attorney as he replied   i dont like the job but i have undertaken it and must go through with it

i see no must about it were i in your place i would wash my hands of the whole business

 i cant afford it was bastines hard businesslike reply on the next morning after this conversation between these two young men louis bastine presented himself to the principal of the academy with the request that iola be permitted to leave immediately to attend the sickbed of her father who was dangerously ill the principal hesitated but while he was deliberating a telegram purporting to come from iolas mother summoned iola to her fathers bedside without delay the principal set at rest in regard to the truthfulness of the dispatch not only permitted but expedited her departure

iola and bastine took the earliest train and traveled without pausing until they reached a large hotel in a southern city there they were obliged to wait a few hours until they could resume their journey the train having failed to make connection iola sat in a large lonely parlor waiting for the servant to show her to a private room she had never known a great sorrow never before had the shadows of death mingled with the sunshine of her life

anxious travelworn and heavyhearted she sat in an easy chair with nothing to divert her from the grief and anxiety which rendered every delay a source of painful anxiety

 oh i hope that he will be alive and growing better was the thought which kept constantly revolving in her mind until she fell asleep in her dreams she was at home encircled in the warm clasp of her fathers arms feeling her mothers kisses lingering on her lips and hearing the joyous greetings of the servants and mammy lizas glad welcome as she folded her to her heart from this dream of bliss she was awakened by a burning kiss pressed on her lips and a strong arm encircling her gazing around and taking in the whole situation she sprang from her seat her eyes flashing with rage and scorn her face flushed to the roots of her hair her voice shaken with excitement and every nerve trembling with angry emotion

 how dare you do such a thing dont you know if my father were here he would crush you to the earth 

 not so fast my lovely tigress said bastine  your father knew what he was doing when he placed you in my charge

 my father made a great mistake if he thought he had put me in charge of a gentleman

 i am your guardian for the present replied bastine  i am to see you safe home and then my commission ends

 i wish it were ended now she exclaimed trembling with anger and mortification her voice was choked by emotion and broken by smothered sobs louis bastine thought to himself she is a real spitfire but beautiful even in her wrath

during the rest of her journey iola preserved a most freezing reserve towards bastine at length the journey was ended pale and anxious she rode up the avenue which led to her home

a strange silence pervaded the place the servants moved sadly from place to place and spoke in subdued tones the windows were heavily draped with crape and a funeral air pervaded the house

mammy liza met her at the door and with streaming eyes and convulsive sobs folded her to her heart as iola exclaimed in tones of hopeless anguish â  oh papas dead  

oh my pore baby said mammy aint you hearn tell bout it yore pars dead an your mars bin drefful sick shes better now

mam liza stepped lightly into mrs leroys room and gently apprised her of iolas arrival in a darkened room lay the stricken mother almost distracted by her late bereavement

 oh iola she exclaimed as her daughter entered is this you  i am so sorry you came

then burying her head in iolas bosom she wept convulsively much as i love you she continued between her sobs  and much as i longed to see you i am sorry you came

 why mother replied iola astonished  i received your telegram last wednesday and i took the earliest train i could get

 my dear child i never sent you a telegram it was a trick to bring you down south and reduce you to slavery

iola eyed her mother curiously what did she mean  had grief dethroned her reason  yet her eye was clear her manner perfectly rational

marie saw the astounded look on iolas face and nerving herself to the task said  iola i must tell you what your father always enjoined me to be silent about i did not think it was the wisest thing but i yielded to his desires i have negro blood in my veins i was your fathers slave before i married him his relatives have set aside his will the courts have declared our marriage null and void and my manumission illegal and we are all to be remanded to slaveiy

an expression of horror and anguish swept over iolas face and turning deathly pale she exclaimed  oh mother it cant be so you must be dreaming 

 no my child  it is a terrible reality

almost wild with agony iola paced the floor as the fearful truth broke in crushing anguish upon her mind

then bursting into a paroxysm of tears succeeded by peals of hysterical laughter said â  i used to say that slavery is right i didnt know what i was talking about then growing calmer she said mother who is at the bottom of this downright robbery  

alfred lorraine  i have always dreaded that man and what i feared has come to pass your father had faith in him  i never had

but mother could we not contest his claim you have your marriage certificate and papas will

yes my dear child but judge starkins has decided that we have no standing in the court and no testimony according to law

 oh mother what can i do  

nothing my child unless you can escape to the north

and leave you  

 yes

 mother i will never desert you in your hour of trial but can nothing be done had father no friends who would assist us  

none that i know of i do not think he had an acquaintance who approved of our marriage the neighboring planters have stood so aloof from me that i do not know where to turn for either help or sympathy i believe it was lorraine who sent the telegram i wrote to you as soon as i could after your fathers death but fainted just as i finished directing the letter i do not think he knows where your brother is and if possible he must not know if you can by any means do send a letter to harry and warn him not to attempt to come home i dont know how you will succeed for lorraine has us all under surveillance but it is according to law

 what law mother  

 the law of the strong against the weak

 oh mother it seems like a dreadful dream a fearful nightmare but i cannot shake it off where is gracie  

 the dear child has been running down ever since her papas death she clung to me night and day while i had the brain fever and could not be persuaded to leave me she hardly ate anything for more than a week she has been dangerously ill for several days and the doctor says she cannot live the fever has exhausted all her rallying power and yet dear as she is to me i would rather consign her to the deepest grave than see her forced to be a slave

 so would i i wish i could die myself

 oh iola do not talk so strive to be a christian to have faith in the darkest hour were it not for my hope of heaven i couldnt stand all this trouble

 mother are these people christians who made these laws which are robbing us of our inheritance and reducing us to slavery  if this is christianity i hate and despise it would the most cruel heathen do worse  

 my dear child i have not learned my christianity from them i have learned it at the foot of the cross and from this book she said placing a new testament in iolas hands  some of the most beautiful lessons of faith and trust i have ever learned were from among our lowly people in their humble cabins

mamma called a faint voice from the adjoining room marie immediately arose and went to the bedside of her sick child where mammy liza was holding her faithful vigils the child had just awakened from a fitful sleep

 i thought she said  that i heard iolas voice has she come 

 yes darling  do you want to see her  

 oh yes she said as a bright smile broke over her dying features

iola passed quickly into the room gracie reached out her thin bloodless hand clasped iolas palm in hers and said   i am so glad you have come dear iola stand by mother you and harry are all she has it is not hard to die you and mother and harry must meet me in heaven

swiftly the tidings went through the house that gracie was dying the servants gathered around her with tearful eyes as she bade them all goodbye when she had finished and mammy had lowered the pillow an unwonted radiance lit up her eye and an expression of ineffable gladness overspread her face as she murmured   it is beautiful so beautiful  fainter and fainter grew her voice until without a struggle or sigh she passed away beyond the oower of oppression and prejudice

very unexpected was dr greshams proposal to iola she had heartily enjoyed his society and highly valued his friendship but he had never been associated in her mind with either love or marriage as he held her hand in his a telltale flush rose to her cheek a look of grateful surprise beamed from her eye but it was almost immediately succeeded by an air of inexpressible sadness a drooping of her eyelids and an increasing pallor of her cheek she withdrew her hand from his shook her head sadly and saidâ no doctor that can never be i am very grateful to you for your kindness i value your friendship but neither gratitude nor friendship is love and i have nothing more than those to give

not at presentsaid dr gresham but may i not hope your friendship will ripen into love

 doctor i could not promise i do not think that i should there arc barriers between us that i cannot pass were you to know them i think you would say the same just then the ambulance brought in a wounded scout and iola found relief from the wounds of her own heart in attending to his

dr gresham knew the barrier that lay between them it was one which his love had surmounted but he was too noble and generous to take advantage of her loneliness to press his suit he had lived in a part of the country where he had scarcely ever seen a colored person and around the race their misfortunes had thrown a halo of romance to him the negro was a picturesque being over whose woes he had wept when a child and whose wrongs he was ready to redress when a man but when he saw the lovely girl who had been rescued by the commander of the post from the clutches of slavery all the manhood and chivalry in his nature arose in her behalf and he was ready to lay on the altar of her heart his first grand and overmastering love not discouraged by her refusal but determined to overcome her objections dr gresham resolved that he would abide his time

iola was not indifferent to dr gresham she admired his manliness and respected his character he was tall and handsome a fine specimen of the best brain and heart of new england he had been nurtured under grand and ennobling influences his father was a devoted abolitionist his mother was kindhearted but somewhat exclusive and aristocratic she would have looked upon his marriage with iola as a mistake and feared that such an alliance would hurt the prospects of her daughters

during iolas stay in the north she had learned enough of the racial feeling to influence her decision in reference to dr greshams offer iola like other girls had had her beautiful daydreams before she was rudely awakened by the fate which had dragged her into the depths of slavery in the chambers of her imagery were pictures of noble deeds of high heroic men knightly tender true and brave in dr gresham she saw the ideal of her soul exemplified but in her lonely condition with all its background of terrible sorrow and deep abasement she had never for a moment thought of giving or receiving love from one of that race who had been so lately associated in her mind with horror aversion and disgust his kindness to her had been a new experience his companionship was an unexpected pleasure she had learned to enjoy his presence and to miss him when absent and when she began to question her heart she found that unconsciously it was entwining around him

 yes she said to herself i do like him but i can never marry him to the man i marry my heart must be as open as the flowers to the sun i could not accept his hand and hide from him the secret of my birth and i could not consent to choose the happiest lot on earth without first finding my poor heartstricken and desolate mother perhaps some day i may have the courage to tell him my sad story and then make my heart the sepulchre in which to bury all the love which might have gladdened and brightened my whole life

during the sad and weary months which ensued while the war dragged its slow length along dr gresham and iola often met by the bedsides of the wounded and dying and sometimes he would drop a few words at which her heart would beat quicker and her cheek flush more vividly but he was so kind tender and respectful that iola had no idea he knew her race affiliations she knew from unmistakable signs that dr gresham had learned to love her and that he had power to call forth the warmest affection of her soul but she fought with her own heart and repressed its rising love she felt that it was best for his sake that they should not marry when she saw the evidences of his increasing love she regretted that she had not informed him at the first of the barrier that lay between them  it might have saved him unnecessary suffering thinking thus iola resolved at whatever cost of pain it might be to herself to explain to dr gresham what she meant by the insurmountable barrier iola after a continuous strain upon her nervous system for months began to suffer from general debility and nervous depression dr gresham saw the increasing pallor on iolas cheek and the loss of buoyancy in her step one morning as she turned from the bed of a young soldier for whom she had just written a letter to his mother there was such a look of pity and sorrow on her face that dr greshams whole heart went out in sympathy for her and he resolved to break the silence he had imposed upon himself

 iola he said and there was a depth of passionate tenderness in his voice a volume of unexpressed affection in his face you are wronging yourself you are sinking beneath burdens too heavy for you to bear it seems to me that besides the constant drain upon your sympathies there is some great sorrow preying upon your life some burden that ought to be shared he gazed upon her so ardently that each cord of her heart seemed to vibrate and unbidden tears sprang to her lustrous eyes as she said sadly doctor you are right

iola my heart is longing to lift those burdens from your life love like faith laughs at impossibilities i can conceive of no barrier too high for my love to surmount consent to be mine as nothing else on earth is mine

 doctor you know not what you ask replied iola  instead of coming into this hospital a selfsacrificing woman laying her every gift and advantage upon the altar of her country i came as a rescued slave glad to find a refuge from a fate more cruel than death a fate from which i was rescued by the intervention of my dear dead friend thomas anderson i was born on a lonely plantation on the mississippi river where the white population was very sparse we had no neighbors who ever visited us no young white girls with whom i ever played in my childhood but never having enjoyed such companionship i was unconscious of any sense of privation our parents spared no pains to make the lives of their children we were three as bright and pleasant as they could our home was so happy we had a large number of servants who were devoted to us i never had the faintest suspicion that there was any wrongfulness in slavery and i never dreamed of the dreadful fate which broke in a storm of fearful anguish over cur devoted heads papa used to take us to new orleans to see the mardi gras and while there we visited the theatres and other places of amusement and interest at home we had books papers and magazines to beguile our time perfectly ignorant of my racial connection i was sent to a northern academy and soon made many friends among my fellowstudents companionship with girls of my own age was a new experience which i thoroughly enjoyed i spent several years in new england and was busily preparing for my commencement exercises when my father was snatched awayâdied of yellow fever on his way north to witness my graduation through a stratagem i was brought hurriedly from the north and found that my father was dead  that his nearest kinsman had taken possession of our property that my mothers marriage had been declared illegal because of an imperceptible infusion of negro blood in her veins and that she and her children had been remanded to slavery i was tom from my mother sold as a slave and subjected to cruel indignities from which i was rescued and a place given to me in this hospital doctor i did not choose my lot in life but i have no other alternative than to accept it the intense horror and agony i felt when i was first told the story are over thoughts and purposes have come to me in the shadow i should never have learned in the sunshine i am constantly rousing myself up to suffer and be strong i intend when this conflict is over to cast my lot with the freed people as a helper teacher and friend i have passed through a fiery ordeal but this ministry of suffering will not be in vain i feel that my mind has matured beyond my years i am a wonder to myself it seems as if years had been compressed into a few short months in telling you this do you not can you not see that there is an insurmountable barrier between us

no i do not replied dr gresham i love you for your own sake and with this the disadvantages of birth have nothing to do

you say so now and i believe that you are perfectly sincere today your friendship springs from compassion but when that subsides might you not look on me as an inferior  

iola you do not understand me you think too meanly of me you must not judge me by the worst of my race surely our country has produced a higher type of manhood than the men by whom you were tried and tempted

tried but not tempted said iola as a deep flush overspread her face  i was never tempted i was sold from state to state as an article of merchandise i had outrages heaped on me which might well crimson the cheek of honest womanhood with shame but i never fell into the clutches of an owner for whom i did not feel the utmost loathing and intensest horror i have heard men talk glibly of the degradation of the negro but there is a vast difference between abasement of condition and degradation of character i was abased but the men who trampled on me were the degraded ones

but iola you must not blame all for what a few have done

a few have done  did not the whole nation consent to our abasement   asked iola bitterly

 no miss iola we did not all consent to it slavery drew a line of cleavage in this country although we were under one government we were farther apart in our sentiments than if we had been divided by lofty mountains and separated by wide seas and had not northern sentiment been brought to bear against the institution slavery would have been intact until today

but doctor the negro is under a social ban both north and south our enemies have the ear of the world and they can depict us just as they please

that is true  but the negro has no other alternative than to make friends of his calamities other men have plead his cause but out of the race must come its own defenders with them the pen must be mightier than the sword it is the weapon of civilization and they must use it in their own defense we cannot tell what is in them until they express themselves

yes and i think there is a large amount of latent and undeveloped ability in the race which they will learn to use for their own benefit this my hospital experience has taught me

but said dr gresham they must learn to struggle labor and achieve by facts not theories they will be judged in the future the anglosaxon race is proud domineering aggressive and impatient of a rival and as i think has more capacity for dragging down a weaker race than uplifting it they have been a conquering and achieving people marvelous in their triumphs of mind over matter they have manifested the traits of character which are developed by success and victory

and yet said iola earnestly i believe the time will come when the civilization of the negro will assume a better phase than you anglosaxons possess you will prove unworthy of your high vantage ground if you only use your superior ability to victimize feebler races and minister to a selfish greed of gold and a love of domination

but iola said dr gresham a little impatiently  what has all this to do with our marriage  your complexion is as fair as mine what is to hinder you from sharing my northern home from having my mother to be your mother   the tones of his voice grew tender as he raised his eyes to iolas face and anxiously awaited her reply

dr gresham said iola sadly should the story of my life be revealed to your family would they be willing to ignore all the traditions of my blood forget all the terrible humiliations through which i have passed  i have too much selfrespect to enter your home under a veil of concealment i have lived in new england i love the sunshine of her homes and the freedom of her institutions but new england is not free from racial prejudice and i would never enter a family where i would be an unwelcome member

 iola dear you have nothing to fear in that direction

 doctor she said and a faint flush rose to her cheek suppose we should marry and little children in after years should nestle in our arms and one of them show unmistakable signs of color would you be satisfied  

she looked steadfastly into his eyes which fell beneath her truthseeking gaze his face flushed as if the question had suddenly perplexed him iola saw the irresolution on his face and framed her answer accordingly

ah i see she said that you are puzzled you had not taken into account what might result from such a marriage i will relieve you from all embarrassment by simply saying i cannot be your wife when the war is over i intend to search the country for my mother doctor were you to give me a palacelike home with velvet carpets to hush my tread and magnificence to surround my way i should miss her voice amid all other tones her presence amid every scene oh you do not know how hungry my heart is for my mother were i to marry you i would carry an aching heart into your home and dim its brightness i have resolved never to marry until i have found my mother the hope of finding her has colored all my life since i regained my freedom it has helped sustain me in the hour of fearful trial when i see her i want to have the proud consciousness that i bring her back a heart just as loving faithful and devoted as the last hour we parted and is this your final answer

 it is i have pledged my life to that resolve and i believe time and patience will reward me

there was a deep shadow of sorrow and disappointment on the face of dr gresham as he rose to leave for a moment he held her hand as it lay limp in his own if she wavered in her determination it was only for a moment no quivering of her lip or paling of her cheek betrayed any struggle of her heart her resolve was made and his words were powerless to swerve her from the purpose of her soul

after dr gresham had gone iola went to her room and sat buried in thought it seemed as if the fate of tantalus was hers without his crimes here she was lonely and heartstricken and unto her was presented the offer of love home happiness and social position the heart and hand of a man too noble and generous to refuse her companionship for life on account of the blood in her veins why should she refuse these desirable boons but mingling with these beautiful visions of manly love and protecting care she saw the anguish of her heartstricken mother and the pale sweet face of her dying sister as with her latest breath she had said  iola stand by mamma 

no no she said to herself  i was right to refuse dr gresham how dare i dream of happiness when my poor mammas heart may be slowly breaking  i should be ashamed to live and ashamed to die were i to choose a happy lot for myself and leave poor mamma to struggle alone i will never be satisfied till i get tidings of her and when i have found her i will do all i can to cheer and brighten the remnant of her life

it was several weeks after iola had written to her brother that her letter reached him the trusty servant to whom she delivered it watched his opportunity to mail it at last he succeeded in slipping it into lorraines mail and dropping them all into the postoffice together harry was studying at a boys academy in maine his father had given that state the preference because while on a visit there he had been favorably impressed with the kindness and hospitality of the people he had sent his son a large sum of money and given him permission to spend awhile with some schoolchums till he was ready to bring the family north where they could all spend the summer together harry had returned from his visit and was looking for letters and remittances from home when a letter all crumpled was handed him  by the principal of the academy he recognized his sisters handwriting and eagerly opened the letter as he read he turned very pale then a deep flush overspread his face and an angry light flashed from his eyes as he read on his face became still paler he gasped for breath and fell into a swoon appalled at the sudden change which had swept over him like a deadly sirocco the principal rushed to the fallen boy picked up the missive that lay beside him and immediately rang for help and dispatched for the doctor the doctor came at once and was greatly puzzled less than an hour before he had seen him with a crowd of merry laughterloving boys apparently as lighthearted and joyous as any of them now he lay with features drawn and pinched his face deadly pale as if some terrible suffering had sent all the blood in his veins to stagnate around his heart harry opened his eyes shuddered and relapsed into silence the doctor all at sea in regard to the cause of the sudden attack did all that he could to restore him to consciousness and quiet the perturbation of his spirit he succeeded but found he was strangely silent a terrible shock had sent a tremor through every nerve and the doctor watched with painful apprehension its effect upon his reason giving him an opiate and enjoining that he should be kept perfectly quiet the doctor left the room sought the principal and said â  mr bascom here is a case that baffles my skill i saw that boy pass by my window not more than half an hour ago full of animation and now he lies hovering between life and death i have great apprehension for his reason can you throw any light on the subject 

mr bascom hesitated

 i am not asking you as a matter of idle curiosity but as a physician i must have all the light i can get in making my diagnosis of the case

the principal arose went to his desk took out the letter which he had picked up from the floor and laid it in the physicians hand as the doctor read a look of indignant horror swept over his face then he said  can it be possible i never suspected such a thing it must be a cruel senseless hoax

doctor said mr bascom i have been a lifelong abolitionist and have often read of the cruelties and crimes of american slavery but never before did i realize the low moral tone of the social life under which such shameless cruelties could be practiced on a defenseless widow and her orphaned children let me read the letter again just look at it all tearblotted and written with a trembling handâ dear brotherâi have dreadful news for you and i hardly know how to tell it papa and grade are both dead he died of yellow fever mamma is almost distracted papas cousin has taken possession of our property and instead of heirs we are chattels mamma has explained the whole situation to me she was papas slave before she married he loved her manumitted educated and married her when he died mr lorraine entered suit for his property and judge starkins has decided in his favor the decree of the court has made their marriage invalid robbed us of our inheritance and remanded us all to slavery mamma is too wretched to attempt to write herself but told me to entreat you not to attempt to come home you can do us no good and that mean cruel lorraine may do you much harm dont attempt i beseech you to come home show this letter to mr bascom and let him advise you what to do but dont for our sake attempt to come home

your heartbroken sister  iola leroy

 this said the doctor  is a very awkward affair the boy is too ill to be removed it is doubtful if the nerves which have trembled with such fearful excitement will ever recover their normal condition it is simply a work of mercy to watch over him with the tenderest care

fortunately for harry he had fallen into good hands and the most tender care and nursing were bestowed upon him for awhile harry was strangely silent never referring to the terrible misfortune which had so suddenly overshadowed his life it seemed as if the past were suddenly blotted out of his memory but he was young and of an excellent constitution and in a few months he was slowly recovering

 doctor said he one day as the physician sat at his bedside  i seem to have had a dreadful dream and to have dreamt that my father was dead and my mother and sister were in terrible trouble but i could not help them doctor was it a dream or was it a reality  it could not have been a dream for when i fell asleep the grass was green and the birds were singing but now the winds are howling and the frost is on the ground doctor tell me how it is  how long have i been here  

sitting by his bedside and taking his emaciated hand in his the doctor said in a kind fatherly tone  my dear boy you have been very ill and everything depends on your keeping quiet very quiet

as soon as he was strong enough the principal gave him his letter to read

 but mr bascom harry said  i do not understand this it says my mother and father were legally married how could her marriage be set aside and her children robbed of their inheritance  this is not a heathen country i hardly think barbarians would have done any worse yet this is called a christian country

 christian in name answered the principal  when your father left you in my care knowing that i was an abolitionist he confided his secret to me he said that life was full of vicissitudes and he wished you to have a good education he wanted you and your sister to be prepared for any emergency he did not wish you to know that you had negro blood in your veins he knew that the spirit of caste pervaded the nation north and south and he was very anxious to have his children freed from its depressing influences he did not intend to stay south after you had finished your education

 but said harry  i cannot understand if my mother was lawfully married how could they deprive her of her marital rights  

when lorraine continued mr bascom knew your father was dead all he had to do was to find a flaw in her manumission and of course the marriage became illegal she could not then inherit property nor maintain her freedom  and her children followed her condition

harry listened attentively things which had puzzled him once now became perfectly clear he sighed heavily and turning to the principal said  i see things in a new light now i remember that none of the planters wives ever visited my mother and we never went to church except when my father took us to the cathedral in new orleans my father was a catholic but i dont think mamma is

 now harry said the principal  life is before you if you wish to stay north i will interest friends in your behalf and try to get you a situation going south is out of the question it is probable that by this time your mother and sister are removed from their home you are powerless to fight against the law that enslaved them should you fall into the clutches of lorraine he might give you a great deal of trouble you would be pressed into the confederate service to help them throw up barricades dig trenches and add to the strength of those who enslaved your mother and sister

never never cried harry  i would rather die than do it i should despise myself forever if i did numbers of our young men said mr bascom  have gone to the war which is now raging between north and south you have been sick for several months and much has taken place of which you are unaware would you like to enlist

 i certainly would  not so much for the sake of fighting for the government as with the hope of finding my mother and sister and avenging their wrongs i should like to meet lorraine on the battlefield

what kind of a regiment would you prefer white or colored  

harry winced when the question was asked he felt the reality of his situation as he had not done before it was as if two paths had suddenly opened before him and he was forced to choose between them on one side were strength courage enterprise power of achievement and memories of a wonderful past on the other side were weakness ignorance poverty and the proud worlds social scorn he knew nothing of colored people except as slaves and his whole soul shrank from equalizing himself with them he was fair enough to pass unchallenged among the fairest in the land and yet a christless prejudice had decreed that he should be a social pariah he sat thoughtful and undecided as if a great struggle were going on in his mind finally the principal said i do not think that you should be assigned to a colored regiment because of the blood in your veins but you will have in such a regiment better facilities for finding your mother and sister

you are right mr bascom to find my mother and sister i call no task too heavy no sacrifice too great

since harry had come north he had learned to feel profound pity for the slave but there is a difference between looking on a man as an object of pity and pro tecting him as such and being identified with him and i forced to share his lot to take his place with them on the arena of life was the test of his life but love was stronger than pride

his father was dead his mother and sister were enslaved by a mockery of justice it was more than a matter of choice where he should stand on the racial question he felt that he must stand where he could strike the most effective blow for their freedom with that thought strong in his mind and as soon as he recovered he went westward to find a colored regiment he told the recruiting officer that he wished to be assigned to a colored regiment

 why do you wish that said the officer looking at harry with an air of astonishment

 because i am a colored man

the officer look puzzled it was a new experience he had seen colored men with fair complexions anxious to lose their identity with the colored race and pose as white men but here was a man in the flush of his early manhood to whom could come dreams of promotion from a simple private to a successful general deliberately turning his back upon every gilded hope and dazzling opportunity to cast his lot with the despised and hated negro

 i do not understand you said the officer  surely you are a white man and as such i will enlist you in a white regiment

no said harry firmly i am a colored man and unless i can be assigned to a colored regiment i am not willing to enter the army

well said the officer you are the dâdst fool i ever sawâa man as white as you are turning his back upon his chances of promotion  but you can take your choice

so harry was permitted to enter the army by his promptness and valor he soon won the hearts of his superior officers and was made drill sergeant having nearly all of his life been used to colored people and being taught by his mother to be kind and respectful to them he was soon able to gain their esteem he continued in the regiment until grant began the task of opening the mississippi after weeks of fruitless effort grant marched his army down the west side of the river while the gunboats undertook the perilous task of running the batteries men were found for the hour the volunteers offered themselves in such numbers that lots were cast to determine who should have the opportunity to enlist in an enterprise so fraught with danger harry was one on whom the lot fell

grant crossed the river below coiled his forces around vicksburg like a boaconstrictor and held it in his grasp after fortyseven days of endurance the city surrendered to him port hudson after the surrender of vicksburg gave up the unequal contest and the mississippi was open to the gulf

 good morning gentlemen said robert johnson as he approached colonel robinson the commander of the post who was standing at the door of his tent talking with captain sybil

 good morning responded colonel robinson  i am glad you have come i was just about to send for you how is your company getting on  

  first rate sir replied robert

 in good health 

excellent they are all in good health and spirits our boys are used to hardship and exposure and the hope of getting their freedom puts new snap into them

 i am glad of it said colonel robinson  they make good fighters and very useful allies last night we received very valuable intelligence from some fugitives who had escaped through the rebel lines i do not think many of the northern people realize the service they have been to us in bringing information and helping our boys when escaping from rebel prisons i never knew a fullblooded negro to betray us a month ago when we were encamped near the rebel lines a colored woman managed admirably to keep us posted as to the intended movements of the enemy she was engaged in laundry work and by means of hanging her sheets in different ways gave us the right signals

 i hope said captain sybil  that the time will come when some faithful historian will chronicle all the deeds of daring and service these people have performed during this struggle and give them due credit therefor

our great mistake said colonel robinson was our long delay in granting them their freedom and even what we have done is only partial the border states still retain their slaves we ought to have made a clean sweep of the whole affair slavery is a serpent which we nourished in its weakness and now it is stinging us in its strength

 i think so too said captain sybil  but in making his proclamation of freedom perhaps mr lincoln went as far as he thought public opinion would let him

 it is remarkable said colonel robinson  how these secesh hold out it surprises me to see how poor white men who like the negroes are victims of slavery rally around the stripes and bars these men i believe have been looked down on by the aristocratic slaveholders and despised by the wellfed and comfortable slaves yet they follow their leaders into the very jaws of death face hunger cold disease and danger and all for what what under heaven are they fighting for now the negro ignorant as he is has learned to regard our flag as a banner of freedom and to look forward to his deliverance as a consequence of the overthrow of the rebellion

 i think said captain sybil  that these ignorant white men have been awfully deceived they have had presented to their imaginations utterly false ideas of the results of secession and have been taught that its success would bring them advantages which they had never enjoyed in the union

 and i think said colonel robinson  that the women and ministers have largely fed and fanned the fires of this rebellion and have helped to create a public opinion which has swept numbers of benighted men into the conflict well might one of their own men say this is a rich mans war and a poor mans fight they were led into it through their ignorance and held in it by their fears

 i think said captain sybil  that if the public school had been common through the south this war would never have occurred now things have reached such a pass that ablebodied men must report at headquarters or be treated as deserters their leaders are desperate men of whom it has been said   they have robbed the cradle and the grave

they are fighting against fearful oddssaid colonel robinson and their defeat is only a question of time

as soon said robert as they fired on fort sumter uncle daniel a dear old father who had been praying and hoping for freedom said to me  deys fired on fort sumter an mark my words bob de norfs boun ter whip

 had we freed the slaves at the outset said captain sybil  we wouldnt have given the rebels so much opportunity to strengthen themselves by means of slave labor in raising their crops throwing up their entrenchments and building their fortifications slavery was a deadly cancer eating into the life of the nation but somehow it had cast such a glamour over us that we have acted somewhat as if our national safety were better preserved by sparing the cancer than by cutting it out

 political and racial questions have sadly complicated this matter said colonel robinson  the north is not wholly made up of antislavery people at the beginning of this war we were not permeated with justice and so were not ripe for victory the battle of bull run inaugurated the war by a failure instead of glory we gathered shame and defeat in place of victory

we have been slow said captain sybil to see our danger and to do our duty our delay has cost us thousands of lives and millions of dollars yet it may be it is all for the best our national wound was too deep to be lightly healed when the president issued his emancipation proclamation my heart overflowed with joy and i said  this is the first bright rift in the war cloud 

and did you really think that they would accept the terms of freedom and lay down their arms   asked robert

 i hardly thought they would continued captain sybil  i did not think that their leaders would permit it i believe the rank and file of their army are largely composed of a mass of ignorance led manipulated and moulded by educated and ambitious wickedness in attempting to overthrow the union a despotism and reign of terror were created which encompassed them as fetters of iron and they will not accept the conditions until they have reached the last extremity i hardly think they are yet willing to confess that such extremity has been reached

 captain said robert as they left colonel robinsons tent  i have lived all my life where i have had a chance to hear the  secesh  talk and when they left their papers around i used to read everything i could lay my hands on it seemed to me that the big white men not only ruled over the poor whites and made laws for them but over the whole nation

 that was so replied captain sybil the north was strong but forbearing it was busy in trade and commerce and permitted them to make the northern states huntinggrounds for their slaves when we sent back simms and bums from beneath the shadow of bunker hill monument and faneuil hall they mistook us looked upon us as a lot of moneygrabbers who would be willing to purchase peace at any price i do not believe when they fired on the star of the west that they had the least apprehension of the fearful results which were to follow their madness and folly

well captain asked robert if the free north would submit to be called on to help them catch their slaves what could be expected of us who all our lives had known no other condition than that of slavery  how much braver would you have been if your first recollections had been those of seeing your mother maltreated your father cruelly beaten or your fellowservants brutally murdered  i wonder why they never enslaved the indians 

 you are mistaken robert if you think the indians were never enslaved i have read that the spaniards who visited the coasts of america kidnapped thousands of indians whom they sent to europe and the west indies as slaves columbus himself we are informed captured five hundred natives and sent them to spain the indian had the lesser power of endurance and las cassas suggested the enslavement of the negro because he seemed to possess greater breadth of physical organization and stronger power of endurance slavery was an old worlds crime which i have heard the indians never practiced among themselves perhaps it would have been harder to reduce them to slavery and hold them in bondage when they had avast continent before them where they could hide in the fastnesses of its mountains or the seclusion of its forests than it was for white men to visit the coasts of africa and with their superior knowledge obtain cargoes of slaves bring them across the ocean hem them in on the plantations and surround them with a pall of dense ignorance

 i remember said robert  in reading a history i once came across at our house that when the africans first came to this country they did not all speak one language some had only met as mutual enemies they were not all one color their complexions ranging from tawny yellow to deep black

yes said captain sybil and in dealing with the negro we wanted his labor in dealing with the indian we wanted his lands for one we had weapons of war for the other we had real and invisible chains the coercion of force and the terror of the unseen world

 thats exactly so captain when i was a boy i used to hear the old folks tell what would happen to bad people in another world about the devil pouring hot lead down peoples throats and stirring them up with a pitchfork and i used to get so scared that i would be afraid to go to bed at night i dont suppose the indians ever heard of such things or if they had i never heard of them being willing to give away all their lands on earth and quietly wait for a home in heaven

 but surely robert you do not think religion has degraded the negro  

 oh i wouldnt say that but a man is in a tight fix when he takes his part like nat turner or denmark veasy and is made to fear that he will be hanged in this world and be burned in the next and since i come to think of it we colored folks used to get mightily mixed up about our religion mr gundover had on his plantation a real smart man he was religious but he would steal

 oh robert queried sybil  how could he be religious and steal  

 he didnt think retorted robert  it was any harm to steal from his master i guess he thought it was right to get from his master all he could he would have thought it wrong to steal from his fellowservants he thought that downright mean but i wouldnt have insured the lives of gundovers pigs and chickens if uncle jack got them in a tight place one day there was a minister stopping with mr gundover as a matter of course in speaking of his servants he gave jacks sins an airing he would much rather confess jacks sins than his own now gundover wanted to do two things save his pigs and poultry and save jacks soul he told the minister that jack was a liar and a thief and gave the minister a chance to talk with uncle jack about the state of his soul uncle jack listened very quietly and when taxed with stealing his masters wheat he was ready with an answer  now massa parker said jack  lemme tell yer jis how it war bout dat wheat wen ole jack comd down yere dis place war all growed up in woods he go ter work dared up de groun an plowed an planted an riz a crap an den wen it war all done he hadnt a dollar to buy his ole woman a gown an he jis took a bag ob wheat 

what did mr parker say asked sybil

 i dont know though i reckon he didnt think it was a bad steal after all but i dont suppose he told jack so when he came to the next point about jacks lying i suppose he thought he had a clear case but jack was equal to the occasion

 how did he clear up that charge   interrogated captain sybil

 finely i think if he had been educated he would have made a firstrate lawyer he said  marse parker deres old joe his wife dont lib on dis plantation old joe go ober ter see her but he stayed too long an didnt git back in time fer his work massas oberseer kotched him an cut him all up when de oberseer went inter de house pore old joe war all tired an beat up an so he lay down by de fence corner and go ter sleep bimeby massa oberseer comd an axed all bin a workin libely   i say  yes massa then said mr parker  you were lying joe had been sleeping not working  i knows dat but ef i tole on joe massa oberseer cut him all up again and massa jesus says  blessed am de peacemaker i heard continued robert that mr parker said to gundover you seem to me like a man standing in a stream where the blood of jesus can reach you but you are standing between it and your slaves how will you answer that in the day of judgment  

 what did gundover say   asked captain sybil

 he turned pale and said  for gods sake dont speak of the day of judgment in connection with slavery 

just then a messenger brought a communication to captain sybil he read it attentively and turning to robert said  here are orders for an engagement at five forks tomorrow oh this wasting of life and scattering of treasure might have been saved had we only been wiser but the time is passing look after your company and see that everything is in readiness as soon as possible

carefully robert superintended the arrangements for the coming battle of a strife which for years had thrown its crimson shadows over the land the rebels fought with a valor worthy of a better cause the disaster of bull run had been retrieved sherman had made his famous march to the sea fighting joe hooker had scaled the stronghold of the storm king and won a victory in the palace chamber of the clouds the union soldiers had captured columbia replanted the stars and stripes in charleston and changed that old sepulchre of slavery into the cradle of a newborn freedom farragut had been as triumphant on water as the other generals had been victorious on land and new orleans had been wrenched from the hands of the confederacy the rebel leaders were obstinate misguided hordes had followed them to defeat and death grant was firm and determined to fight it out if it took all summer the closing battles were fought with desperate courage and firm resistance but at last the south was forced to succumb on the ninth day of april  general lee surrendered to general grant the lost cause went down in blood and tears and on the brows of a ransomed people god poured the chrism of a new era and they stood a race newly anointed with freedom

very sad and heartrending were the scenes with which iola came in constant contact well may christian men and women labor and pray for the time when nations shall learn war no more  when instead of bloody conflicts there shall be peaceful arbitration the battle in which robert fought after his last conversation with captain sybil was one of the decisive struggles of the closing conflict the mills of doom and fate had ground out a fearful grist of agony and death and lives of men and souls of states were thrown like chaff beyond the gates

numbers were taken prisoners pale young corpses strewed the earth manhood was stricken down in the flush of its energy and prime the ambulances brought in the wounded and dying captain sybil laid down his life on the altar of freedom his prediction was fulfilled robert was brought into the hospital wounded but not dangerously iola remembered him as being the friend of tom anderson and her heart was drawn instinctively towards him for awhile he was delirious but her presence had a soothing effect upon him he sometimes imagined that she was his mother and he would tell her how he had missed her and then at times he would call her sister iola tender and compassionate humored his fancies and would sing to him in low sweet tones some of the hymns she had learned in her old home in mississippi one day she sang a few verses of the hymn beginning with the wordsâ  drooping souls no longer grieve heaven is propitious if on christ you do believe you will find him precious

 that said he looking earnestly into iolas face  was my mothers hymn i have not heard it for years where did you learn it  

iola gazed inquiringly upon the face of her patient and saw by his clear gaze and the expression of his face that his reason had returned

in my home in mississippi from my own dear mother was iolas reply

 do you know where she learned it   asked robert

when she was a little girl she heard her mother sing it years after a methodist preacher came to our house sang this hymn and left the book behind him my father was a catholic but my mother never went to any church i did not understand it then but i do now we used to sing together and read the bible when we were alone

 do you remember where she came from and who was her mother asked robert anxiously

 my dear friend you must be quiet the fever has left you but i will not answer for the consequences if you get excited

robert lay quiet and thoughtful for awhile and seeing he was wakeful iola said  have you any friends to whom you would like to send a letter  

a pathetic expression flitted over his face as he sadly replied  i havent to my knowledge a single relation in the world when i was about ten years old my mother and sister were sold from me it is more than twenty years since i have heard from them but that hymn which you were singing reminded me so much of my mother she used to sing it when i was a child please sing it again

iolas voice rose soft and clear by his bedside till he fell into a quiet slumber she remembered that her mother had spoken of her brother before they had parted and her interest and curiosity were awakened by roberts story while he slept she closely scrutinized roberts features and detected a striking resemblance between him and her mother

 oh i do wonder if he can be my mothers brother from whom she has been separated so many years anxious as she was to ascertain if there was any relationship between robert and her mother she forebore to question him on the subject which lay so near her heart but one day when he was so far recovered as to be able to walk around he met iola on the hospital grounds and said to herâ miss iola you remind me so much of my mother and sister that i cannot help wondering if you are the daughter of my longlost sister

do you think asked iola if you saw the likeness of your sister you would recognize her  

 i am afraid not but there is one thing i can remember about her she used to have a mole on her cheek which mother used to tell her was her beauty spot

 look at this said iola handing him a locket which contained her mothers picture

robert grasped the locket eagerly scanned the features attentively then handing it back said  i have only a faint remembrance of my sisters features but i never could recognize in that beautiful woman the dear little sister with whom i used to play oh the cruelty of slavery how it wrenched and tore us apart where is your mother now  

 oh i cannot tell answered iola  i left her in mississippi my father was a wealthy creole planter who fell in love with my mother she was his slave but he educated her in the north freed and married her my father was very careful to have the fact of our negro blood concealed from us i had not the slightest suspicion of it when he was dead the secret was revealed his white relations set aside my fathers will had his marriage declared invalid and my mother and her children were remanded to slavery iola shuddered as she pronounced the horrid word and grew deadly pale but regaining her selfpossession continued now that freedom has come i intend to search for my mother until i find her

 i do not wonder said robert  that we had this war the nation had sinned enough to suffer

yessaid iola if national sins bring down national judgments then the nation is only reaping what it sowed

 what are your plans for the future or have you any asked robert

 i intend offering myself as a teacher in one of the schools which are being opened in different parts of the country replied iola  as soon as i am able i will begin my search for my dear mother i will advertise for her in the papers hunt for her in the churches and use all the means in my power to get some tidings of her and my brother harry what a cruel thing it was to separate us 

 good morning said dr gresham approaching robert and iola how are you both you have mended rapidly turning to robert  but then it was only a flesh wound your general health being good and your blood in excellent condition it was not hard for you to rally

 where have you been doctor  i have a faint recollection of having seen you on the morning i was brought in from the field but not since

 i have been on a furlough i was running down through exhaustion and overwork and i was compelled to go home for a few weeks rest but now as they are about to close the hospital i shall be permanently relieved i am glad that this cruel strife is over it seemed as if i had lived through ages during these last few years in the early part of the war i lost my arm by a stray shot and my armless sleeve is one of the mementos of battle i shall carry with me through life miss leroy he continued turning respectfully to iola  would you permit me to ask you as i would have some one ask my sister under the same circumstances if you have matured any plans for the future or if i can be of the least service to you  if so i would be pleased to render you any service in my power

 my purpose replied iola  is to hunt for my mother and to find her if she is alive i am willing to go anywhere and do anything to find her but i will need a standpoint from whence i can send out lines of inquiry it must take time in the disordered state of affairs even to get a clue by which i may discover her whereabouts

 how would you like to teach   asked the doctor  schools are being opened all around us numbers of excellent and superior women are coming from the north to engage as teachers of the freed people would you be willing to take a school among these people  i think it will be uphill work i believe it will take generations to get over the duncery of slavery some of these poor fellows who came into our camp did not know their right hands from their left nor their ages nor even the days of the month it took me some time in a number of cases to understand their language it saddened my heart to see such ignorance one day i asked one a question and he answered  i no shum

what did he mean  asked iola

 that he did not see it replied the doctor  of course this does not apply to all of them some of them are wideawake and sharp as steel traps i think some of that class may be used in helping others

i should be very glad to have an opportunity to teach said iola  i used to be a great favorite among the colored children on my fathers plantation

in a few days after this conversation the hospital was closed the sick and convalescent were removed and iola obtained a position as a teacher very soon iola realized that while she was heartily appreciated by the freedmen she was an object of suspicion and dislike to their former owners the north had conquered by the supremacy of the sword and the south had bowed to the inevitable but here was a new army that had come with an invasion of ideas that had come to supplant ignorance with knowledge and it was natural that its members should be unwelcome to those who had made it a crime to teach their slaves to read the name of the ever blessed christ but iola had found her work and the freedmen their friend

when iola opened her school she took pains to get acquainted with the parents of the children and she gained their confidence and cooperation her face was a passport to their hearts ignorant of books human faces were the scrolls from which they had been reading for ages they had been the sunshine and shadow of their lives

iola had found a schoolroom in the basement of a colored church where the doors were willingly opened to her her pupils came from miles around ready and anxious to get some  book larnin some of the old folks were eager to learn and it was touching to see the eyes which had grown dim under the shadows of slavery donning spectacles and trying to make out the words as iola had nearly all of her life been accustomed to colored children she had no physical repulsions to overcome no prejudices to conquer in dealing with parents and children in their simple childish fashion they would bring her fruits and flowers and gladden her lonely heart with little tokens of affection

one day a gentleman came to the school and wished to address the children iola suspended the regular order of the school and the gentleman essayed to talk to them on the achievements of the white race such as building steamboats and carrying on business finally he asked how they did it 

 theyve got money chorused the children

 but how did they get it  

 they took it from us chimed the youngsters iola smiled and the gentleman was nonplussed but he could not deny that one of the powers of knowledge is the power of the strong to oppress the weak

the school was soon overcrowded with applicants and iola was forced to refuse numbers because their quarters were too cramped the school was beginning to lift up the home for iola was not satisfied to teach her children only the rudiments of knowledge she had tried to lay the foundation of good character but the elements of evil burst upon her loved and cherished work one night the heavens were lighted with lurid flames and iola beheld the school the pride and joy of her pupils and their parents a smouldering ruin iola gazed with sorrowful dismay on what seemed the cruel work of an incendiarys torch while she sat mournfully contemplating the work of destruction her children formed a procession and passing by the wreck of their school sangâ oh do not be discouraged for jesus is your friend

as they sang the tears sprang to iolas eyes and she said to herself i am not despondent of the future of my people there is too much elasticity in their spirits too much hope in their hearts to be crushed out by unreasoning malice

to bind anew the ties which slavery had broken and gather together the remnants of his scattered family became the earnest purpose of roberts life iola hopeful that in robert she had found her mothers brother was glad to know she was not alone in her search having sent out lines of inquiry in different directions she was led to hope from some of the replies she had received that her mother was living somewhere in georgia

hearing that a methodist conference was to convene in that state and being acquainted with the bishop of that district she made arrangements toaccompany him thither she hoped to gather some tidings of her mother through the ministers gathered from different parts of that state

from her brother she had heard nothing since her fathers death on his way to the conference the bishop had an engagement to dedicate a church near the city of c in north carolina iola was quite willing to stop there a few days hoping to hear something of robert johnsons mother soon after she had seated herself in the cars she was approached by a gentleman who reached out his hand to her and greeted her with great cordiality iola looked up and recognized him immediately as one of her last patients at the hospital it was none other than robert johnson

 i am so glad to meet you he said  i am on my way to c in search of my mother i want to see the person who sold her last and if possible get some clew to the direction in which she went

 and i said iola  am in search of my mother i am convinced that when we find those for whom we are searching they will prove to be very nearly related mamma said before we were parted that her brother had a red spot on his temple if i could see that spot i should rest assured that my mother is your sister

 then said robert  i can give you that assurance and smilingly he lifted his hair from his temple on which was a large red spot

 i am satisfied exclaimed iola fixing her eyes beaming with hope and confidence on robert oh i am so glad that i can without the least hesitation accept your services to join with me in the further search what are your plans  

to stop for awhile in c said robert and gather all the information possible from those who sold and bought my mother i intend to leave no stone unturned in searching for her

 oh i do hope that you will succeed i expect to stop over there a few days and i shall be so glad if before i leave i hear your search has been crowned with success or a least that you have been put on the right track although i was born and raised in the midst of slavery i had not the least idea of its barbarous selfishness till i was forced to pass through it but we lived so much alone i had no opportunity to study it except on our own plantation my father and mother were very kind to their slaves but it was slavery all the same and i hate it root and branch

just then the conductor called out the station

we stop here said robert i am going to see mrs johnson and hunt up some of my old acquaintances where do you stop  

 i dont know replied iola  i expect that friends will be here to meet us bishop b permit me to introduce you to mr robert johnson whom i have every reason to believe is my mothers brother like myself he is engaged in hunting up his lost relatives

 and i said robert  am very much pleased to know that we are not without favorable clues

 bishop said iola  mr johnson wishes to know where i am to stop he is going on an exploring expedition and wishes to let me know the result

 we stop at mrs allstons  new street said the bishop  if i can be of any use to you i am at your service

 thank you said robert lifting his hat as he left them to pursue his inquiries about his longlost mother

quickly he trod the old familiar streets which led to his former home he found mrs johnson but she had aged very fast since the war she was no longer the lithe active woman with her proud manner and resolute bearing her eye had lost its brightness her step its elasticity and her whole appearance indicated that she was slowly sinking beneath a weight of sorrow which was heavier far than her weight of years when she heard that robert had called to see her she was going to receive him in the hall as she would have done any of her former slaves but her mind immediately changed when she saw him he was not the lighthearted careless mischiefloving robby of former days but a handsome man with heavy moustache dark earnest eyes and proud military bearing he smiled and reached out his hand to her she hardly knew how to address him to her colored people were either boys and girls or  aunties and uncles she had never in her life addressed a colored person as  mr or mrs to do so now was to violate the social customs of the place it would be like learning a new language in her old age robert immediately set her at ease by addressing her under the old familiar name of  miss nancy this immediately relieved her of all embarrassment she invited him into the sittingroom and gave him a warm welcome

 well robby she said  i once thought that you would have been the last one to leave me you know i never illtreated you and i gave you everything you needed people said that i was spoiling you i thought you were as happy as the days were long when i heard of other peoples servants leaving them i used to say to myself  i can trust my bobby he will stick to me to the last but i fooled myself that time soon as the yankee soldiers got in sight you left me without saying a word that morning i came down into the kitchen and asked linda  wheres robert  why hasnt he set the table she said she hadnt seen you since the night before i thought maybe you were sick and i went to see but you were not in your room i couldnt believe at first that you were gone wasnt i always good to you  

 oh miss nancy replied robert  you were good but freedom was better

 yes she said musingly i suppose i would have done the same but robby it did go hard with me at first however i soon found out that my neighbors had been going through the same thing but its all over now let bygones be bygones what are you doing now and where are you living 

 i am living in the city of p i have opened a hardware store there but just now i am in search of my mother and sister

 i hope that you may find them

how long asked robert do you think it has been since they left here  

 let me see it must have been nearly thirty years you got my letter  

yes maam thank you

 there have been great changes since you left here mrs johnson said  gundover died and a number of colored men have banded together bought his plantation and divided it among themselves and i hear they have a very nice settlement out there i hope since the government has set them free that they will succeed after roberts interview with mrs johnson he thought he would visit the settlement and hunt up his old friends he easily found the place it was on a clearing in gundovers woods where robert and uncle daniel had held their last prayermeeting now the gloomy silence of those woods was broken by the hum of industry the murmur of cheerful voices and the merry laughter of happy children where they had trodden with fear and misgiving freedmen walked with light and bounding hearts the schoolhouse had taken the place of the slavepen and auctionblock

 how is yer ole boy asked one laborer of another

 everything is lobly replied the other the blue sky arching overhead and the beauty of the scenery justified the expression

gundover had died soon after the surrender frank anderson had grown reckless and drank himself to death his brother tom had been killed in battle their mother who was gundovers daughter had died insane their father had also passed away the defeat of the confederates the loss of his sons and the emancipation of his slaves were blows from which he never recovered as robert passed leisurely along delighted with the evidences of thrift and industry which constantly met his eye he stopped to admire a garden filled with beautiful flowers clambering vines and rustic adornments

on the porch sat an elderly woman darning stockings the very embodiment of content and good humor robert looked inquiringly at her on seeing him she almost immediately exclaimed shore as ise born dats robert look yere honey whar did yer come from  ill gib my head fer a choppin block ef dat aint miss nancys bob aint yer our bobby shore yer is

dear uncle daniel said iola the moral aspect of the nation would be changed if it would learn at the same cross to subordinate the spirit of caste to the spirit of christ

 i said iola  am on my way south seeking for my mother and i shall not give up until i find her

come said aunt linda we mustnt stan yer talkin or de grubll git cole come frens sit down an eat some ob my pore supper

aunt linda sat at the table in such a flutter of excitement that she could hardly eat but she gazed with intense satisfaction on her guests robert sat on her right hand contrasting aunt lindas pleasant situation with the old days in mrs johnsons kitchen where he had played his pranks upon her and told her the news of the war

over iola there stole a spirit of restfulness there was something so motherly in aunt lindas manner that it seemed to recall the bright sunshiny days when she used to nestle in mam lizas arms in her own happy home the conversation was full of army reminiscences and recollections of the days of slavery uncle daniel was much interested and as they rose from the table exclaimed â  robby seein yer an hearin yer talk almos puts new springs inter me i feel mos like i war gittin younger

after the supper salters and his guests returned to the front room which aunt linda regarded with so much pride and on which she bestowed so much care

well captin said salters i neber spected ter see you agin do you know de las time i seed yer well you war on a stretcher an four ob us war carryin you ter de hospital war you much hurt 

no replied robert it was only a flesh wound and this young lady nursed me so carefully that i soon got over it

 is dat de way you foun her  

yes andrews salters ef you please interrupted salters ise only andrews wen i gits my money

well salters continued robert  our freedom was a costly thing did you know that captain sybil was killed in one of the last battles of the war  these young chaps who are taking it so easy dont know the hardships through which we older ones passed but all the battles are not fought nor all the victories won the colored man has escaped from one slavery and i dont want him to fall into another i want the young folks to keep their brains clear and their right arms strong to fight the battles of life manfully and take their places alongside of every other people in this country and i cannot see what is to hinder them if they get a chance

 i dont nuther said salters  i dont see dat dey drinks any more dan anybody else nor dat dere is any meanness or debilment dat a black man kin do dat a white man cant keep step wid him

 yes assented robert but while a white man is stealing a thousand dollars a black man is getting into trouble taking a few chickens

all that may be true said iola but there are some things a white man can do that we cannot afford to do

 i beliebs eberybody norf and souf is lookin at us an some ob dem aint got no good blood fer us nohow you fix it said salters

 i specs cullud folks mus hab done somethin interposed aunt linda

 o nonsense said robert  i dont think they are any worse than the white people i dont believe if we had the power we would do any more lynching burning and murdering than they do

 dats so said aunt linda  its ralely orful how our folks hab been murdered sence de war but i dont think dese young folks is goin ter take things as wes allers done

 we war cowed down from the beginning said uncle daniel  but dese young folks aint comin up dat way no said salters  fer one night arter some ob our pore people had been killed an some ob our women had rund away bout seventeen miles my granson looking me squar in de face said   aint you got five fingers  cant you pull a trigger as well as a white man   i tell yer cap dat jis got to me an i made up my mine dat my boy should neber call me a coward

it is not to be expected said robert that these young people are going to put up with things as we did when we werent permitted to hold a meeting by ourselves or to own a club or learn to read

 i tried said salters  to git a little outer de book wen i war in de army on sundays i sometimes takes a book an tries to make out de words but my eyes is gittin dim an de letters all run togedder an i gits sleepy an ef yer wants to put me to sleep jis put a book in my hank but wen it comes to gittin out a stan ob cotton an plantin com ise dere all de time but dat granson ob mine is smart as a steel trap i specs hell be a preacher

salters looked admiringly at his grandson who sat grinning in the corner munching a pear he had brought from the table

yes said aunt linda his fadder war killed by the secesh one night comin home from a politic meetin an his pore mudder died a few weeks arter an we mean to make a man ob him

 oh his heads level answered robert  at least it was in the army

 dats jis de way you see dat miss iola one man takin up for de oder but ill be eben wid you bof i must go now an git ready

iola laughed the homely enjoyment of that evening was very welcome to her after the trying scenes through which she had passed further conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the wagon drawn by two fine mules john salters stopped joking his wife to admire his mules

 jis look at dem he said  aint dey beauties  i bought em out ob my bountymoney arter de war war ober i had a little money an i war gwine ter rent a plantation on sheers an git out a good stan ob cotton cotton war bringin orful high prices den but lindy said to me  now john youse got a lot ob money an youd better salt it down id ruther lib on a little piece ob lan ob my own dan a big piece ob somebody elses well i says to lindy i dun know nuthin bout buyin lan an ise fraid arter ise done buyed it an put all de marrer ob dese bonesin it dat somebodys faroff cousin will come an say de title aint good an ill lose it all

it was a lovely evening for the journey the air was soft and balmy the fields and hedges were redolent with flowers not a single cloud obscured the brightness of the moon or the splendor of the stars the ancient trees were festooned with moss which hung like graceful draperies ever and anon a startled hare glided over the path and whippoorwills and crickets broke the restful silence of the night robert rode quietly along quaffing the beauty of the scene and thinking of his boyish days when he gathered nuts and wild plums in those woods he also indulged pleasant reminiscences of later years when with uncle daniel and tom anderson he attended the secret prayermeetings iola rode along conversing with aunt linda amused and interested at the quaintness of her speech and the shrewdness of her intellect to her the ride was delightful

does yer know dis place robby asked aunt linda as they passed an old resort

 i should think i did replied robert  it is the place where we held our last prayermeeting

an what would i be a doin queried john suddenly rousing up at the mention of his name

yes an id ketch myself stanin still an takin it was johns plucky response

well you oughter ef yous mean enough to wote dat ticket ter put me back inter slavery was aunt lindas parting shot robby she continued you member miss nancys jinnie

what did uncle job do

 he jis stood dere an cried

 and didnt you feel sorry for him  asked iola

 not a bit he hednt no business ter be so shabby but aunt linda pursued iola if it were shabby for an ignorant colored man to sell his vote wasnt it shabbier for an intelligent white man to buy it

you see added robert all the shabbiness is not on our side

 i knows dat said aunt linda  but i cant help it i wants my people to wote right an to think somethin ob demselves

well aunt linda they say in every flock of sheep there will be one thats scabby observed iola

 dats so but i aint got no use fer scabby sheep

lindy cried john wes most dar dont you yere dat singin  deys begun aready

neber mine said aunt linda sometimes de las ob de wine is de bes

thus discoursing they had beguiled the long hours of the night and made their long journey appear short

very soon they reached the church a neat commodious frame building with a blue ceiling white walls within and without and large windows with mahoganycolored facings it was a sight full of pathetic interest to see that group which gathered from miles around they had come to break bread with each other relate their experiences and tell of their hopes of heaven in that meeting were remnants of broken familiesâmothers who had been separated from their children before the war husbands who had not met their wives for years after the bread had been distributed and the handshaking was nearly over robert raised the hymn which iola had sung for him when he was recovering from his wounds and iola with her clearsweet tones caught up the words and joined him in the strain when the hymn was finished a dear old mother rose from her seat her voice was quite strong with still a lingering light and fire in her eye she saidâ  i rise bredren an sisters to say im on my solemn march to glory

amen glory came from a number of voices

 ise had my trials an temptations my ups an downs but i feels ill soon be in one ob de many mansions if it hadnt been for dat hope i spects i would have broken down long ago ise bin through de deep waters but dey didnt overflow me ise bin in de fire but de smell ob it isnt on my garments bredren an sisters it war a drefful time when i war tored away from my pore little chillen

datsso exclaimed a chorus of voices some of her hearers moaned others rocked to and fro as thoughts of similar scenes in their own lives arose before them

when my little girl continued the speaker took hole ob my dress an begged me ter let her go wid me an i couldnt do it it mos broke my heart i had a little boy anwen my mistus sole me she kep him she carried on a boardin house manys the time i hab stole out at night an seen dat chile an sleepd wid him in my arms tell mos day bimeby de people i libed wid got hard up fer money an dey sole me one way an my pore little gal de oder an i neber laid my eyes on my pore chillen sence den but honeys let de wind blow high or low i spects to outwedder de storm an anchor bym bye in bright glory but ise bin a prayin fer one thing an i beliebs ill git it an dat is dat i may see my chillen fore i die pray fer me dat i may hole out an hole on an neber make a shipwrack ob faith an at las fine my way from earth to glory

having finished her speech she sat down and wiped away the tears that flowed all the more copiously as she remembered her lost children when she rose to speak her voice and manner instantly arrested roberts attention he found his mind reverting to the scenes of his childhood as she proceeded his attention became riveted on her unbidden tears filled his eyes and great sobs shook his frame he trembled in every limb could it be possible that after years of patient search through churches papers and inquiring friends he had accidentally stumbled on his motherâthe mother who long years ago had pillowed his head upon her bosom and left her parting kiss upon his lips how should he reveal himself to her might not sudden joy do what years of sorrow had failed to accomplish controlling his feelings as best he could he rose to tell his experience he referred to the days when they used to hold their meetings in the lonely woods and gloomy swamps how they had prayed for freedom and plotted to desert to the union army and continuing he said   since then brethren and sisters i have had my crosses and trials but i try to look at the mercies just think what it was then and what it is now how many of us since freedom has come have been looking up our scattered relatives i have just been over to visit my old mistress nancy johnson and to see if i could get some clue to my longlost mother who was sold from me nearly thirty years ago

again there was a chorus of moans

on resuming roberts voice was still fuller of pathos

when he said  i heard that dear old mother tell her experience it seemed as if some one had risen from the dead she made me think of my own dear mother who used to steal out at night to see me fold me in her arms and then steal back again to her work after she was sold away i never saw her face again by daylight i have been looking for her ever since the war and i think at last i have got on the right track if mrs

johnson who kept the boardinghouse in c is the one who sold that dear old mother from her son then she is the one i am looking for and i am the son she has been praying for

the dear old mother raised her eyes they were clear and tearless an expression of wonder hope and love flitted over her face it seemed as if her youth were suddenly renewed and bounding from her seat she rushed to the speaker in a paroxysm of joy  oh robby robby is dis you  is dat my pore dear boy ise been prayin bout all dese years  oh glory glory and overflowing with joyous excitement she threw her arms around him looking the very impersonation of rapturous content it was a happy time mothers whose children had been torn from them in the days of slavery knew how to rejoice in her joy the young people caught the infection of the general happiness and rejoiced with them that rejoiced there were songs of rejoicing and shouts of praise the undertone of sadness which had so often mingled with their songs gave place to strains of exultation and tears of tender sympathy flowed from eyes which had often been blurred by anguish the child of many prayers and tears was restored to his mother

iola stood by the mothers side smiling and weeping tears of joy when roberts mother observed iola she said to robert  is dis yore wife  

oh no replied robert but i believe she is your grandchild the daughter of the little girl who was sold away from you so long ago she is on her way to the farther south in search of her mother

 is she  dear chile  i hope shell fine her she puts me in mine ob my pore little marie well ise got one chile an i means to keep on prayin tell i fine my daughter im so happy i feels like a new woman   my dear mother said robert  now that i have found you i mean to hold you fast just as long as you live ever since the war i have been trying to find out if you were living but all efforts failed at last i thought i would come and hunt you myself and now that i have found you i am going to take you home to live with me and to be as happy as the days are long i am living in the north and doing a good business there i want you to see joy according to all the days wherein you have seen sorrow i do hope this young lady will find her ma and that when found she will prove to be your daughter 

yes pore dear chile i specs her mudders hearts mighty hungry fer her i does hope shes my granchile tenderly and caressingly iola bent over the happy mother with her heart filled with mournful memories of her own mother

aunt linda was induced to stay until the next morning and then gladly assisted roberts mother in arranging for her journey northward the friends who had given her a shelter in their hospitable home learned to value her so much that it was with great reluctance they resigned her to the care of her son aunt linda was full of bustling activity and her spirits overflowed with good humor

 now harriet she said as they rode along on their return journey you mus jis thank me fer finin yore chile cause i got him to come to dat big meetin wid me

 oh lindy she cried  ise glad from de bottom ob my heart ter see yous all i comd out dere ter git a blessin an ise got a double potion de frens i war libin wid war mighty good ter me dey libd wid me in de lower kentry an arter de war war ober i stopped wid em and helped take keer ob de chillen an when dey comd up yere dey brought me wid em ise comd a way i didnt know but ise mighty glad ise comd

does you know dis place asked aunt linda as they approached the settlement

non deed i dont its all new ter me

well dis is whar i libs aint you mighty tired  i feels a little stiffish dese bones is gittin ole

 dats so but ise mighty glad fse libd to see my boy fore i crossed ober de riber an now i feel like ole simeon

 but mother said robert  if you are ready to go i am not willing to let you i want you to stay ever so long where i can see you

a bright smile overspread her face roberts words reassured and gladdened her heart she was well satisfied to have a pleasant aftermath from life on this side of the river

after arriving home lindas first thought was to prepare dinner for her guests but before she began her work of preparation she went to the cupboard to get a cup of homemade wine

 here she said filling three glasses  is some wine i made myself from dat grapevine out dere dont it look nice and clar  jist taste it its fusrate

no thank you said robert im a temperance man and never take anything which has alcohol in it  oh dis aint got a bit ob alcohol in it i made it myself

 but aunt linda you didnt make the law which ferments grapejuice and makes it alcohol

but robby ef alcohols so bad wat made de lord put it here  

aunt lindy said iola i heard a lady say that there were two things the lord didnt make one is sin and the other alcohol

why aunt linda said robert there are numbers of things the lord has made that i wouldnt touch with a pair of tongs

 what are they  

 rattlesnakes scorpions and moccasins

 oh sho  

 aunt linda said iola  the bible says that the wine at last will bite like a serpent and sting like an adder and aunt linda added robert as i wouldnt wind a serpent around my throat i dont want to put something inside of it which will bite like a serpent and sting as an adder

i reckon robbys right said his mother setting down her glass and leaving the wine unfinished you young folks knows a heap more dan we ole folks

well declared aunt linda you all is temprence to de backbone but what could i do wid my wine ef we didnt drink it  

let it turn to vinegar and sign the temperance pledge replied robert

 i dont keer bout it myself but i dont spect john would be willin ter let it go cause he likes it a heap

then you must give it up for his sake and jobs said robert  they may learn to like it too well

you know aunt linda said iola people dont get to be drunkards all at once and you wouldnt like to feel if job should learn to drink that you helped form his appetite

 dat so i beliebs ill let dis turn to winegar an not make any more

 thats right aunt linda i hope youll hold to it said robert encouragingly

very soon aunt linda had an excellent dinner prepared after it was over robert went with iola to c where her friend the bishop was awaiting her return she told him the wonderful story of roberts finding his mother and of her sweet childlike faith

the bishop a kindfatherly man said  miss iola i hope that such happiness is in store for you my dear child still continue to pray and trust i am oldfashioned enough to believe in prayer i knew an old lady living in illinois who was a slave her son got a chance to come north and beg money to buy his mother the mother was badly treated and made up her mind to run away but before she started she thought she would kneel down to pray and something she said reasoned within her and whispered  stand still and see what i am going to do for you so real was it to her that she unpacked her bundle and desisted from her flight strange as it may appear to you her son returned bringing with him money enough to purchase her freedom and she was redeemed from bondage had she persisted in running away she might have been lost in the woods and have died exhausted by starvation but she believed she trusted and was delivered her son took her north where she could find a resting place for the soles of her feet

that night iola and the bishop left for the south

after iola had left the settlement accompanied by robert as far as the town it was a pleasant satisfaction for the two old friends to settle themselves down and talk of times past departed friends and longforgotten scenes

what said mrs johnson as we shall call roberts mother hab become ob miss nancys husband  is he still a libin  

oh he drunk hisself to death responded aunt linda

 he used ter be mighty handsome

yes but drink war his ruination

an hows miss nancy

oh shes comd down mighly shes pore as a church mouse i thought twould comd home ter her wen she sole yer way from yore chillen deres nuffin goes ober de debils back dat dont come under his belly do yo member miss nancys fardder

pore miss nancy exclaimed roberts mother  i aint nothin agin her but i wouldnt swap places wid her cause ise got my son an i beliebs hell do a good part by me

mothersaid robert as he entered the room ive brought an old friend to see you do you remember uncle daniel 

uncle daniel threw back his head reached out his hand and manifested his joy with well haryet is dis you  i neber spected to see you in dese lower grouns how does yer do  an whar hab you bin all dis time

 o ise been tossin roun bout but its all comd right at las ise iibd to see my boy fore i died

my wife an boys is in glory said uncle daniel but i spects to seeem fore long cause ise tryin to dig deep build sure an make my way from earth ter glory

 dats de right kine ob talk danel we ole folks aint got long ter stay yere

they chatted together until job and salters came home for supper after they had eaten uncle daniel saidâ well hab a word ob prayer

there in that peaceful habitation they knelt down and mingled their prayers together as they had done in bygone days when they had met by stealth in lonely swamps or silent forests

the next morning robert and his mother started northward they were well supplied with a bountiful luncheon by aunt linda who had so thoroughly enjoyed their sojourn with her on the next day he arrived in the city of p and took his mother to his boardinghouse until he could find a suitable home into which to install her he soon came across one which just suited his taste but when the agent discovered that roberts mother was colored he told him that the house had been previously engaged in company with his mother he looked at several other houses in desirable neighborhoods but they were constantly met with the answer the house is engaged or we do not rent to colored people

at length robert went alone and finding a desirable house engaged it and moved into it in a short time it was discovered that he was colored and at the behest of the local sentiment of the place the landlord used his utmost endeavors to oust him simply because he belonged to an unfashionable and unpopular race at last he came across a landlord who was broad enough to rent him a good house and he found a quiet resting place among a set of welltodo and welldisposed people

in one of those fearful conflicts by which the mississippi was freed from rebel intrusion and opened to commerce harry was severely wounded and forced to leave his place in the ranks for a bed in the hospital

one day as he lay in his bed thinking of his former home in mississippi and wondering if the chances of war would ever restore him to his loved ones he fell into a quiet slumber when he awoke he found a lady bending over him holding in her hands some fruit and flowers as she tenderly bent over harrys bed their eyes met and with a thrill of gladness they recognized each other

 oh my son my son  cried marie trying to repress her emotion as she took his wasted hand in hers and kissed the pale cheeks that sickness and suffering had blanched harry was very weak but her presence was a call to life he returned the pressure of her hand kissed it and his eyes grew full of sudden light as he murmured faintly but joyfullyâ mamma oh mamma have i found you at last

the effort was too much and he immediately became unconscious

anxious yet hopeful marie sat by the bedside of her son till consciousness was restored caressingly she bent over his couch murmuring in her happiness the tenderest sweetest words of motherly love in harrys veins flowed new life and vigor calming the restlessness of his nerves

as soon as possible harry was carried to his mothers home a home brought into the light of freedom by the victories of general grant nursed by his mothers tender loving care he rapidly recovered but being too disabled to reenter the army he was honorably discharged

lorraine had taken marie to vicksburg and there allowed her to engage in confectionery and preserving for the wealthy ladies of the city he had at first attempted to refugee with her in texas but being foiled in the attempt he was compelled to enlist in the confederate army and met his fate by being killed just before the surrender of vicksburg

my dear son marie would say as she bent fondly over him  i am deeply sorry that you are wounded but i am glad that the fortunes of war have brought us together poor iola i do wonder what has become of her just as soon as this war is over i want you to search the country all over poor child how my heart has ached for her

time passed on harry and his mother searched and inquired for iola but no tidings of her reached them

having fully recovered his health and seeing the great need of education for the colored people harry turned his attention toward them and joined the new army of northern teachers

he still continued his inquiries for his sister not knowing whether or not she had succumbed to the cruel change in her life he thought she might have passed into the white basis for the sake of bettering her fortunes hope deferred which had sickened his mothers heart had only roused him to renewed diligence

a school was offered him in georgia and thither he repaired taking his mother with him they were soon established in the city of a in hope of finding iola he visited all the conferences of the methodist church but for a long time his search was in vain

 mamma said harry one day during his vacation there is to be a methodist conference in this state in the city of s about one hundred and fifty miles from here i intend to go and renew my search for iola

 poor child   burst out marie as the tears gathered in her eyes  i wonder if she is living

 i think so said harry kissing the pale cheek of his mother i dont feel that iola is dead i believe we will find her before long

 it seems to me my heart would burst with joy to see my dear child just once more i am glad that you are going when will you leave

tomorrow morning

well my son go and my prayers will go with you was maries tender parting wish

early next morning harry started for the conference and reached the church before the morning session was over near him sat two ladies one fair the other considerably darker there was something in the fairer one that reminded him forcibly of his sister but she was much older and graver than he imagined his sister to be instantly he dismissed the thought that had forced itself into his mind and began to listen attentively to the proceedings of the conference

when the regular business of the morning session was over the bishop arose and said â  i have an interesting duty to perform i wish to introduce a young lady to the conference who was the daughter of a mississippi planter she is now in search of her mother and brother from whom she was sold a few months before the war her father married her mother in ohio where he had taken her to be educated after his death they were robbed of their inheritance and enslaved by a distant relative named lorraine miss iola leroy is the young ladys name if any one can give the least information respecting the objects of her search it will be thankfully received

 i can exclaimed a young man rising in the midst of the audience and pressing eagerly almost impetuously forward i am her brother and i came here to look for her

iola raised her eyes to his face so flushed and bright with the glow of recognition rushed to him threw her arms around his neck kissed him again and again crying o harry then she fainted from excitement the women gathered around her with expressions of tender sympathy and gave her all the care she needed they called her the dear child for without any effort on her part she had slidden into their hearts and found a ready welcome in each sympathizing bosom

harry at once telegraphed the glad tidings to his mother who waited their coming with joyful anticipation long before the cars reached the city mrs leroy was at the depot restlessly walking the platform or eagerly peering into the darkness to catch the first glimpse of the train which was bearing her treasures

at length the cars arrived and as harry and iola alighted marie rushed forward clasped iola in her arms and sobbed out her joy in broken words

very happy was the little family that sat together around the suppertable for the first time for years they partook of that supper with thankful hearts and with eyes overflowing with tears of joy very touching were the prayers the mother uttered when she knelt with her children that night to return thanks for their happy reunion and to seek protection through the slumbers of the night

the next morning as they sat at the breakfasttable marie said â  my dear child you are so changed i do not think i would have known you if i had met you in the street 

 and i said harry  can hardly realize that you are our own iola whom i recognized as sister a half dozen years ago

am i so changed  asked iola as a faint sigh escaped her lips

why iola said harry you used to be the most harumscarum girl i ever knewâlaughing dancing and singing from morning until night

yes i remember said iola it all comes back to me like a dream oh mamma i have passed through a fiery ordeal of suffering since then but it is useless and as she continued her face assumed a brighter look  to brood over the past let us be happy in the present let me tell you something which will please you do you remember telling me about your mother and brother

yes said marie in a questioning tone

well continued iola with eyes full of gladness  i think i have found them

 can it be possible  exclaimed marie in astonishment  it is more than thirty years since we parted i fear you are mistaken

no mamma i have drawn my conclusions from good circumstantial evidence after i was taken from you i passed through a fearful siege of suffering which would only harrow up your soul to hear i often shudder at the remembrance the last man in whose clutches i found myself was mean brutal and cruel i was in his power when the union army came into c where i was living a number of colored men stampeded to the union ranks with a gentleman as a leader whom i think is your brother a friend of his reported my case to the commander of the post who instantly gave orders for my release a place was given me as nurse in the hospital i attended that friend in his last illness poor fellow he was the best friend i had in all the time i have been tossing about the gentleman whom i think is your brother appeared to be very anxious about his friends recovery and was deeply affected by his death in one of the last terrible battles of the war that of five forks he was wounded and put into the hospital ward where i was an attendant for awhile he was delirious and in his delirium he would sometimes think that i was his mother and at other times his sister i humored his fancies would often sing to him when he was restless and my voice almost invariably soothed him to sleep one day i sang to him that old hymn we used to sing on the plantation â  drooping souls no longer grieve heaven is propitious if on christ you do believe you will find him precious

 i remember said marie with a sigh as memories of the past swept over her

after i had finished the hymn continued iola he looked earnestly and inquiringly into my face and asked where did you learn that hymn i have heard my mother sing it when i was a boy but i have never heard it since i think mamma the words  i was lost but now im found glory glory glory had imprinted themselves on his memory and that his mind was assuming a higher state of intellectuality he asked me to sing it again which i did until he fell asleep then i noticed a marked resemblance between him and harry and i thought  suppose he should prove to be your longlost brother during his convalescence we found that we had a common ground of sympathy we were anxious to be reunited to our severed relations we had both been separated from our mothers he told me of his little sister with whom he used to play she had a mole on her cheek which he called her beauty spot he had the red spot on his forehead which you told me of

very bright and happy was the home where marie and her children were gathered under one roof mrs leroys neighbors said she looked ten years younger into that peaceful home came no fearful forebodings of cruel separations harry and iola were passionately devoted to their mother and did all they could to flood her life with sunshine

 iola dear said harry one morning at the breakfasttable  i have a new pleasure in store for you

 what is it brother mine  asked iola assuming an air of interest

 there is a young lady living in this city to whom i wish to introduce you she is one of the most remarkable women i have ever met

do tell me all about her said iola  is she young and handsome brilliant and witty 

she replied harry is more than handsome she is lovely more than witty she is wise more than brilliant she is excellent

well harry said mrs leroy smiling if you keep on that way i shall begin to fear that i shall soon be supplanted by a new daughter

 oh no mamma replied harry looking slightly confused i did not mean that

well harry said iola amused go on with your description i am becoming interested tax your powers of description to give me her likeness

 well in the first place continued harry  i suppose she is about twentyfive years old

oh the idea interrupted iola of a gentleman talking of a ladys age that is a tabooed subject why iola that adds to the interest of my picture it is her combination of earnestness and youthfulness which enhances her in my estimation

 pardon the interruption said iola  i am anxious to hear more about her

well she is of medium height somewhat slender and well formed with dark expressive eyes full of thought and feeling neither hair nor complexion show the least hint of blood admixture

i am glad of it said iola every person of unmixed blood who succeeds in any department of literature art or science is a living argument for the capability which is in the race

yes responded harry for it is not the white blood which is on trial before the world well i will bring her around this evening

in the evening harry brought miss delany to call on his sister and mother they were much pleased with their visitor her manner was a combination of suavity and dignity during the course of the evening they learned that she was a graduate of the university of a one day she saw in the newspapers that colored women were becoming unfit to be servants for white people she then thought that if they are not fit to be servants for white people they are unfit to be mothers to their own children and she conceived the idea of opening a school to train future wives and mothers she began on a small scale in a humble building and her work was soon crowned with gratifying success she had enlarged her quarters increased her teaching force and had erected a large and commodious schoolhouse through her own exertions and the help of others

marie cordially invited her to call again saying as she rose to go  i am very glad to have met you young women like you always fill my heart with hope for the future of our race in you i see reflected some of the blessed possibilities which lie within us

 thank you said miss delany  i want to be classed among those of whom it is said  she has done what she could

very pleasant was the acquaintance which sprang up between miss delany and iola although she was older than iola their tastes were so congenial their views of life and duty in such unison that their acquaintance soon ripened into strong and lasting friendship there were no foolish rivalries and jealousies between them their lives were too full of zeal and earnestness for them to waste in selfishness their power to be moral and spiritual forces among a people who so much needed their helping hands miss delany gave iola a situation in her school but before the term was quite over she was force to resign her health having been so undermined by the fearful strain through which she had passed that she was quite unequal to the task she remained at home and did what her strength would allow in assisting her mother in the work of canning and preserving fruits

in the meantime iola had been corresponding with robert she had told him of her success in finding her mother and brother and had received an answer congratulating her on the glad fruition of her hopes he also said that his business was flourishing that his mother was keeping house for him and to use her own expression was as happy as the days are long she was firmly persuaded that marie was her daughter and she wanted to see her before she died

there is one thing continued the letter that your mother may remember her by it was a little handkerchief on which were a number of cats heads she gave one to each of us

 i remember it well said marie  she must indeed be my mother now all that is needed to complete my happiness is her presence and my brothers and i intend if i live long enough to see them both

iola wrote robert that her mother remembered the incident of the handkerchief and was anxious to see them

in the early fall robert started for the south in order to clear up all doubts with respect to their relationship he found iola harry and their mother living cosily together harry was teaching and was a leader among the rising young men of the state his northern education and later experience had done much toward adapting him to the work of the new era which had dawned upon the south

marie was very glad to welcome robert to her home but it was almost impossible to recognize her brother in that tall handsome man with darkbrown eyes and wealth of chestnutcolored hair which he readily lifted to show the crimson spot which lay beneath it

but as they sat together and recalled the longforgotten scenes of their childhood they concluded that they were brother and sister

 marie said robert  how would you like to leave the south  

 i should like to go north but i hate to leave harry hes a splendid young fellow although i say it myself he is so fearless and outspoken that i am constantly anxious about him especially at election time

harry then entered the room and being introduced to robert gave him a cordial welcome he had just returned from school

we were talking of you my son said marie

 what were you saying  nothing of the absent but good  asked harry

i was telling your uncle who wants me to come north that i would go but i am afraid that you will get into trouble and be murdered as many others have been

 oh well mother i shall not die till my time comes and if i die helping the poor and needy i shall die at my post could a man choose a better place to die

 were you aware of the virulence of caste prejudice and the disabilities which surround the colored people when you cast your lot with them  asked robert

not fully replied harry but after i found out that i was colored i consulted the principal of the school where i was studying in reference to the future he said that if i stayed in the north he had friends whom he believed would give me any situation i could fill and i could simply take my place in the rank of workers the same as any other man then he told me of the army and i made up my mind to enter it actuated by a desire to find my mother and sister and at any rate i wanted to avenge their wrongs i do not feel so now since i have seen the fearful ravages of war i have learned to pity and forgive the principal said he thought i would be more apt to find my family if i joined a colored regiment in the west than if i joined one of the maine companies i confess at first i felt a shrinking from taking the step but love for my mother overcame all repugnance on my part now that i have linked my fortunes to the race i intend to do all i can for its elevation

as he spoke robert gazed admiringly on the young face lit up by noble purposes and lofty enthusiasm

you are right harry i think it would be treason not only to the race but to humanity to have you ignoring your kindred and masquerading as a white man

 i think so too said marie

 but sister i am anxious for you all to come north if harry feels that the place of danger is the post of duty let him stay and he can spend his vacations with us i think both you and iola need rest and change mother longs to see you before she dies she feels that we have been the children of many prayers and tears and i want to make her last days as happy as possible the south has not been a paradise to you all the time and i should think you would be willing to leave it

yes that is so iola needs rest and change and she would be such a comfort to mother i suppose for her sake i will consent to have her go back with you at least for awhile

in a few days with many prayers and tears marie half reluctantly permitted iola to start for the north in company with robert johnson intending to follow as soon as she could settle her business and see harry in a good boarding place

very joyful was the greeting of the dear grandmother iola soon nestled in her heart and lent additional sunshine to her once checkered life and robert who had so long been robbed of kith and kin was delighted with the new accession to his home life

 uncle robert said iola after she had been north several weeks  i have a theory that every woman ought to know how to earn her own living i believe that a great amount of sin and misery springs from the weakness and inefficiency of women

 perhaps thats so but what are you going to do about it  

 i am going to join the great rank of breadwinners mr waterman has advertised for a number of saleswomen and i intend to make application

 when he advertises for help he means white women said robert

 he said nothing about color responded iola

 i dont suppose he did he doesnt expect any colored girl to apply

well i think i could fill the place at least i should like to try and i do not think when i apply that i am in duty bound to tell him my greatgrandmother was a negro

well child there is no necessity for you to go out to work you are perfectly welcome here and i hope that you feel so

oh i certainly do but still i would rather earn my own living

that morning iola applied for the situation and being prepossessing in her appearance she obtained it

for awhile everything went as pleasantly as a marriage bell but one day a young colored lady welldressed and wellbred in her manner entered the store it was an acquaintance which iola had formed in the colored church which she attended iola gave her a few words of cordial greeting and spent a few moments chatting with her the attention of the girls who sold at the same counter was attracted and their suspicion awakened iola was a stranger in that city who was she and who were her people  at last it was decided that one of the girls should act as a spy and bring what information she could concerning iola

the spy was successful she found out that iola was living in a good neighborhood but that none of the neighbors knew her the man of the house was very fair but there was an old woman whom iola called grandma and she was unmistakably colored the story was sufficient if that were true iola must be colored and she should be treated accordingly

without knowing the cause iola noticed a chill in the social atmosphere of the store which communicated itself to the cashboys and they treated her so insolently that her situation became very uncomfortable she saw the proprietor resigned her position and asked for and obtained a letter of recommendation to another merchant who had advertised for a saleswoman

in applying for the place she took the precaution to inform her employer that she was colored it made no difference to him  but he saidâ  dont say anything about it to the girls they might not be willing to work with you

iola smiled did not promise and accepted the situation she entered upon her duties and proved quite acceptable as a saleswoman

one day during an interval in business the girls began to talk of their respective churches and the question was put to iolaâ  where do you go to church  

i go she replied to rev rivers church corner of eighth and l streets

 oh no you must be mistaken there is no church there except a colored one

that is where i go

 why do you go there  

 because i liked it when i came here and joined it a member of a colored church what under heaven possessed you to do such a thing 

 because i wished to be with my own people

here the interrogator stopped and looked surprised and pained and almost instinctively moved a little farther from her after the store was closed the girls had an animated discussion which resulted in the information being sent to mr cohen that iola was a colored girl and that they protested against her being continued in his employ mr cohen yielded to the pressure and informed iola that her services were no longer needed

when robert came home in the evening he found that iola had lost her situation and was looking somewhat discouraged

well uncle she said i feel out of heart it seems as if the prejudice pursues us through every avenue of life and assigns us the lowest places

 that is so replied robert thoughtfully

and yet i am determined said iola to win for myself a place in the fields of labor i have heard of a place in new england and i mean to try for it even if i only stay a few months

well if you will go say nothing about your color

uncle robert i see no necessity for proclaiming that fact on the housetop yet i am resolved that nothing shall tempt me to deny it the best blood in my veins is african blood and i am not ashamed of it

 hurrah for you  exclaimed robert laughing heartily

as iola wished to try the world for herself and so be prepared for any emergency her uncle and grandmother were content to have her go to new england the town to which she journeyed was only a few hours ride from the city of p and robert knowing that there is no teacher like experience was willing that iola should have the benefit of her teaching

iola on arriving in h sought the firm and was informed that her services were needed she found it a pleasant and lucrative position there was only one drawbackâher boarding place was too far from her work there was an institution conducted by professed christian women which was for the special use of respectable young working girls this was in such a desirable location that she called at the house to engage board

the matron conducted her over the house and grew so friendly in the interview that she put her arm around her and seemed to look upon iola as a desirable accession to the home but just as iola was leaving she said to the matron   i must be honest with you i am a colored woman

swift as light a change passed over the face of the matron she withdrew her arm from iola and said   i must see the board of managers about it

when the board met iolas case was put before them but they decided not to receive her and these women professors of a religion which taught if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin virtually shut the door in her face because of the outcast blood in her veins

considerable feeling was aroused by the action of these women who to say the least had not put their religion in the most favorable light

iola continued to work for the firm until she received letters from her mother and uncle which informed her that her mother having arranged her affairs in the south was ready to come north she then resolved to return to the city of p to be ready to welcome her mother on her arrival

iola arrived in time to see that everything was in order for her mothers reception her room was furnished neatly but with those touches of beauty that womanly hands are such adepts in giving a few charming pictures adorned the walls and an easy chair stood waiting to receive the travelworn mother robert and iola met her at the depot and grandma was on her feet at the first sound of the bell opened the door clasped marie to her heart and nearly fainted for joy

can it be possible dat dis is my little marie she exclaimed

it did seem almost impossible to realize that this faded woman with pale cheeks and prematurely whitened hair was the rosycheeked child from whom she had been parted more than thirty years

well said robert after the first joyous greeting was over  love is a very good thing but marie has had a long journey and needs something that will stick by the ribs how about dinner mother

 its all ready said mrs johnson

after marie had gone to her room and changed her dress she came down and partook of the delicious repast which her mother and iola had prepared for her

in a few days marie was settled in the home and was well pleased with the change the only drawback to her happiness was the absence of her son and she expected him to come north after the closing of his school

 uncle robert said iola after her mother had been with them several weeks  i am tired of being idle

 whats the matter now  asked robert you are surely not going east again and leave your mother

 oh i hope not said marie anxiously  i have been so long without you   no mamma i am not going east i can get suitable employment here in the city of p

but iola said robert you have tried and been defeated why subject yourself to the same experience again   uncle robert i think that every woman should have some skill or art which would insure her at least a comfortable support i believe there would be less unhappy marriages if labor were more honored among women

well iola said her mother what is your skill nursing i was very young when i went into the

hospital but i succeeded so well that the doctor said i must have been a born nurse now i see by the papers that a gentleman who has an invalid daughter wants some one who can be a nurse and companion for her and i mean to apply for the situation i do not think if i do my part well in that position that the blood in my veins will be any bar to my success

a troubled look stole over maries face she sighed faintly but made no remonstrance and so it was decided that iola should apply for the situation

iola made application and was readily accepted her patient was a frail girl of fifteen summers who was ill with a low fever iola nursed her carefully and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her restored to health during her stay mr cloten the father of the invalid had learned some of the particulars of idas northern experience as a breadwinner and he resolved to give her employment in his store when her services were no longer needed in the house as soon as a vacancy occurred he gave iola a place in his store

the morning she entered on her work he called his employes together and told them that miss iola had colored blood in her veins but that he was going to employ her and give her a desk if any one objected to working with her he or she could step to the cashiers desk and receive what was due not a man remonstrated not a woman demurred and iola at last found a place in the great army of breadwinners which the traditions of her blood could not affect

how did you succeed  asked mrs cloten of her husband when he returned to dinner

admirably  everything is lovely and the goose hangs high i gave my employes to understand that they could leave if they did not wish to work with miss leroy not one of them left or showed any disposition to rebel

 i am very glad said mrs cloten  i am ashamed of the way she has been treated in our city when seeking to do her share in the worlds work i am glad that you were brave enough to face this cruel prejudice and give her a situation

well my dear do not make me a hero for a single act i am grateful for the care miss leroy gave our daisy money can buy services but it cannot purchase tender loving sympathy i was also determined to let my employes know that i not they commanded my business so do not crown me a hero until i have won a niche in the temple of fame in dealing with southern prejudice against the negro we northerners could do it with better grace if we divested ourselves of our own we irritate the south by our criticisms and while i confess that there is much that is reprehensible in their treatment of colored people yet if our northern civilization is higher than theirs we should criticise by creation we should stamp ourselves on the south and not let the south stamp itself on us when we have learned to treat men according to the complexion of their souls and not the color of their skins we will have given our best contribution towards the solution of the negro problem

 i feel my dear said mrs cloten  that what you have done is a right step in the right direction and i hope that other merchants will do the same we have numbers of business men rich enough to afford themselves the luxury of a good conscience

 goodmorning miss leroy said a cheery voice in tones of glad surprise and intercepting her path dr gresham stood before iola smiling and reaching out his hand

why dr gresham is this you said iola lifting her eyes to that wellremembered face  it has been several years since we met how have you been all this time and where

i have been sick and am just now recovering from malaria and nervous prostration i am attending a medical convention in this city and hope that i shall have the pleasure of seeing you again

iola hesitated and then replied  i should be pleased to have you call

it would give me great pleasure where shall i call

 my home is  south street but i am only at home in the evenings

they walked together a short distance till they reached mr clotens store then bidding the doctor good morning iola left him repeating to himself the words of his favorite poetâ  thou art too lovely and precious a gem to be bound to their burdens and sullied by them

no one noticed the deep flush on iolas face as she entered the store nor the subdued quiet manner with which she applied herself to her tasks she was living over again the past with its tender sad and thrilling reminiscences

in the evening dr gresham called on iola she met him with a pleasant welcome dr gresham gazed upon her with unfeigned admiration and thought that the years instead of detracting from had only intensified her loveliness he had thought her very beautiful in the hospital in her gray dress and white collar with her glorious wealth of hair drawn over her ears but now when he saw her with that hair artistically arranged and her finelyproportioned form arrayed in a dark crimson dress relieved by a shimmer of lace and a bow of white ribbon at her throat he thought her superbly handsome the lines which care had written upon her young face had faded away there was no undertone of sorrow in her voice as she stood up before him in the calm loveliness of her ripened womanhood radiant in beauty and gifted in intellect time and failing health had left their traces upon dr gresham his step was less bounding his cheek a trifle paler his manner somewhat graver than it was when he had parted from iola in the hospital but his meeting with her had thrilled his heart with unexpected pleasure hopes and sentiments which long had slept awoke at the touch of her hand and the tones of her voice and dr gresham found himself turning to the past with its sad memories and disappointed hopes no other face had displaced her image in his mind no other love had woven itself around every tendril of his soul his heart and hand were just as free as they were the hour they had parted

to see you again said dr gresham is a great and unexpected pleasure

 you had not forgotten me then   said iola smiling forget you  i would just as soon forget my own existence i do not think that time will ever efface the impressions of those days in which we met so often when last we met you were intending to search for your mother have you been successful  

 more than successful said iola with a joyous ring in her voice  i have found my mother brother grandmother and uncle and except my brother we are all living together and we are so happy excuse me a few minutes she said and left the room iola soon returned bringing with her her mother and grandmother

 these said iola introducing her mother and grandmother are the oncesevered branches of our family and this gentleman you have seen before continued iola as robert entered the room

dr gresham looked scrutinizingly at him and said your face looks familiar but i saw so many faces at the hospital that i cannot just now recall your name

doctor said robert johnson i was one of your last patients and i was with tom anderson when he died

oh yes replied dr gresham  it all comes back to me you were wounded at the battle of five forks were you not  

yes said robert

 i saw you when you were recovering you told me that you thought you had a clue to your lost relatives from whom you had been so long separated how have you succeeded  

admirably i have been fortunate in finding my mother my sister and her children

 ah indeed  i am delighted to hear it where are they  

 they are right here this is my mother said robert bending fondly over her as she returned his recognition with an expression of intense satisfaction  and this he continued is my sister and miss leroy is my niece

 is it possible  i am very glad to hear it it has been said that every cloud has its silver lining and the silver lining of our war cloud is the redemption of a race and the reunion of severed hearts war is a dreadful thing but worse than the war was the slavery which preceded it

slavery said iola was a fearful cancer eating into the nations heart sapping its vitality and undermining its life

and war said dr gresham was the dreadful surgery by which the disease was eradicated the cancer has been removed but for years to come i fear that we will have to deal with the effects of the disease but i believe that we have vitality enough to outgrow those effects

 i think doctor said iola  that there is but one remedy by which our nation can recover from the evil entailed upon her by slavery

what is that asked robert

a fuller comprehension of the claims of the gospel of jesus christ and their application to our national life

yes said robert while politicians are stumbling on the barren mountains of fretful controversy and asking what shall we do with the negro i hold that jesus answered that question nearly two thousand years ago when he said whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them 

yes said dr gresham the application of that rule in dealing with the negro would solve the whole problem

 slavery said mrs leroy  is dead but the spirit which animated it still lives and i think that a reckless disregard for human life is more the outgrowth of slavery than any actual hatred of the negro

the problem of the nation continued dr gresham is not what men will do with the negro but what will they do with the reckless lawless white men who murder lynch and burn their fellowcitizens to me these lynchings and burnings are perfectly alarming both races have reacted on each otherâmen fettered the slave and cramped their own souls denied him knowledge and darkened their spiritual insight subdued him to the pliancy of submission and in their turn became the thralls of public opinion the negro came here from the heathenism of africa but the young colonies could not take into their early civilization a stream of barbaric blood without being affected by its influence and the negro poor and despised as he is has laid his hands on our southern civilization and helped mould its character

yes said mrs leroy the colored nurse could not nestle her masters child in her arms hold up his baby footsteps on their floors and walk with him through the impressible and formative period of his young life without leaving upon him the impress of her hand

 i am gladsaid robert for the whole nations sake that slavery has been destroyed

 and our work said dr gresham  is to build over the desolations of the past a better and brighter future the great distinction between savagery and civilization is the creation and maintenance of law a people cannot habitually trample on law and justice without retrograding toward barbarism but i am hopeful that time will bring us changes for the better that as we get farther away from the war we will outgrow the animosities and prejudices engendered by slavery the shortsightedness of our fathers linked the negros destiny to ours we are feeling the friction of the ligatures which bind us together but i hope that the time will speedily come when the best members of both races will unite for the maintenance of law and order and the progress and prosperity of the country and that the intelligence and virtue of the south will be strong to grapple effectually with its ignorance and vice

 i hope that time will speedily come said marie  my son is in the south and i am always anxious for his safety he is not only a teacher but a leading young man in the community where he lives

yes said robert and when i see the splendid work he is doing in the south i am glad that instead of trying to pass for a white man he has cast his lot with us

but answered dr gresham he would possess advantages as a white man which he could not if he were known to be colored

doctor said iola decidedly he has greater advantages as a colored man

 i do not understand you said dr gresham looking somewhat puzzled

 doctor continued iola  i do not think lifes highest advantages are those that we can see with our eyes or grasp with our hands to whom today is the world most indebtedâto its millionaires or to its martyrs taking it from the ideal standpoint replied the doctor  i should say its martyrs

to be continued iola the leader of a race to higher planes of thought and action to teach men clearer views of life and duty and to inspire their souls with loftier aims is a far greater privilege than it is to open the gates of material prosperity and fill every home with sensuous enjoyment

and i said mrs leroy her face aglow with fervid feeling would ratherâten thousand times ratherâsee harry the friend and helper of the poor and ignorant than the companion of men who under the cover of night mask their faces and ride the country on lawless raids

dr gresham said robert we ought to be the leading nation of the earth whose influence and example should give light to the world

not simply said iola a nation building up a great material prosperity founding magnificent cities grasping the commerce of the world or excelling in literature art and science but a nation wearing sobriety as a crown and righteousness as the girdle of her loins

dr gresham gazed admiringly upon iola a glow of enthusiasm overspread her beautiful expressive face there was a rapt and faroff look in her eye as if she were looking beyond the present pain to a brighter future for the race with which she was identified and felt the grandeur of a divine commission to labor for its uplifting

as dr gresham was parting with robert he said this meeting has been a very unexpected pleasure i have spent a delightful evening i only regret that i had not others to share it with me a doctor from the south a regular bourbon is stopping at the hotel i wish he could have been here tonight come down to the concordia mr johnson tomorrow night if you know any colored man who is a strong champion of equal rights bring him along goodnight i shall look for you said the doctor as he left the door

when robert returned to the parlor he said to iola  dr gresham has invited me to come to his hotel tomorrow night and to bring some wideawake colored man with me there is a southerner whom he wishes me to meet i suppose he wants to discuss the negro problem as they call it he wants some one who can do justice to the subject i wonder whom i can take with me 

 i will tell you who i think will be a capital one to take with you and i believe he would go said iola

 who   asked robert

 rev carmicle your pastor

 he is just the one said robert courteous in his manner and very scholarly in his attainments he is a man whom if everybody hated him no one could despise him

in the evening robert and rev carmicle called on dr gresham and found dr latrobe the southerner and a young doctor by the name of latimer already there dr gresham introduced dr latrobe but it was a new experience to receive colored men socially his wits however did not forsake him and he received the introduction and survived it

permit me now said dr gresham to introduce you to my friend dr latimer who is attending our convention he expects to go south and labor among the colored people dont you think that there is a large field of usefulness before him  

yes replied dr latrobe if he will let politics alone

 and why let politics alone   asked dr gresham

because replied dr latrobe we southerners will never submit to negro supremacy we will never abandon our caucasian civilization to an inferior race

have you any reason inquired rev carmicle to dread that a race which has behind it the heathenism of africa and the slavery of america with its inheritance of ignorance and poverty will be able in less than one generation to domineer over a race which has behind it ages of dominion freedom education and christianity

a slight shade of vexation and astonishment passed over the face of dr latrobe he hesitated a moment then repliedâ  i am not afraid of the negro as he stands alone but what i dread is that in some closelycontested election ambitious men will use him to hold the balance of power and make him an element of danger he is ignorant poor and clannish and they may impact him as their policy would direct

any more asked robert than the leaders of the rebellion did the ignorant poor whites during our late conflict 

 ignorance poverty and clannishness said dr gresham  are more social than racial conditions which may be outgrown

and i think said rev carmicle that we are outgrowing them as fast as any other people would have done under the same conditions

the negro replied dr latrobe always has been and always will be an element of discord in our country

what then is your remedy asked dr gresham

 i would eliminate him from the politics of the country

as disfranchisement is a punishment for crime is it just to punish a man before he transgresses the law asked dr gresham

 if said dr latimer  the negro is ignorant poor and clannish let us remember that in part of our land it was once a crime to teach him to read if he is poor for ages he was forced to bend to unrequited toil if he is clannish society has segregated him to himself

and even said robert has given him a negro pew in your churches and a negro seat at your communion table

wisely or unwisely said dr gresham the government has put the ballot in his hands it is better to teach him to use that ballot aright than to intimidate him by violence or vitiate his vote by fraud

today said dr latimer  the negro is not plotting in beersaloons against the peace and order of society his fingers are not dripping with dynamite neither is he spitting upon your flag nor flaunting the red banner of anarchy in your face

 powersaid dr gresham naturally gravitates into the strongest hands the class who have the best brain and most wealth can strike with the heaviest hand i have too much faith in the inherent power of the white race to dread the competition of any other people under heaven

i think you northerners fail to do us justice said dr latrobe the men into whose hands you put the ballot were our slaves and we would rather die than submit to them look at the carpetbag governments the wicked policy of the government inflicted upon us it was only done to humiliate us

oh no said dr gresham flushing and rising to his feet we had no other alternative than putting the ballot in their hands

i will not deny said rev carmicle that we have made woeful mistakes but with our antecedents it would have been miraculous if we had never committed any mistakes or made any blunders

they were allies in war continued dr gresham and i am sorry that we have not done more to protect them in peace

 protect them in peace  said robert bitterly what protection does the colored man receive from the hands of the government  i know of no civilized country outside of america where men are still burned for real or supposed crimes

johnson said dr gresham compassionately it is impossible to have a policeman at the back of each colored mans chair and a squad of soldiers at each crossroad to detect with certainty and punish with celerity each invasion of his rights we tried provisional governments and found them a failure it seemed like leaving our former allies to be mocked with the name of freedom and tortured with the essence of slavery the ballot is our weapon of defense and we gave it to them for theirs

and there said dr latrobe emphatically is where you signally failed we are numerically stronger in congress today than when we went out you made the law but the administration of it is in our hands and we are a unit

but doctor said rev carmicle you cannot willfully deprive the negro of a single right as a citizen without sending demoralization through your own ranks i think said dr latrobe that we are right in suppressing the negros vote this is a white mans government and a white mans country we own nineteentwentieths of the land and have about the same ratio of intelligence i am a white man and right or wrong i go with my race

 but doctor said rev carmicle  there are rights more sacred than the rights of property and superior intelligence

 what are they   asked dr latrobe

the rights of life and liberty replied rev carmicle

that is true said dr gresham  and your southern civilization will be inferior until you shall have placed protection to those rights at its base not in theory but in fact

 but dr gresham we have to live with these people and the north is constantly irritating us by its criticisms

the world said dr gresham is fast becoming a vast whispering gallery and lips once sealed can now state their own grievances and appeal to the conscience of the nation and as long as a sense of justice and mercy retains a hold upon the heart of our nation you cannot practice violence and injustice without rousing a spirit of remonstrance and if it were not so i would be ashamed of my country and of my race

 you speak said dr latrobe  as if we had wronged the negro by enslaving him and being unwilling to share citizenship with him i think that slavery has been of incalculable value to the negro it has lifted him out of barbarism and fetich worship given him a language of civilization and introduced him to the worlds best religion think what he was in africa and what he is in america 

the negro said dr gresham thoughtfully is not the only branch of the human race which has been low down in the scale of civilization and freedom and which has outgrown the measure of his chains slavery polygamy and human sacrifices have been practiced among europeans in bygone days and when tyndall tells us that out of savages unable to count to the number of their fingers and speaking only a language of nouns and verbs arise at length our newtons and shakspeares i do not see that the negro could not have learned our language and received our religion without the intervention of ages of slavery

ifsaid rev carmicle  mohammedanism with its imperfect creed is successful in gathering large numbers of negroes beneath the crescent could not a legitimate commerce and the teachings of a pure christianity have done as much to plant the standard of the cross over the ramparts of sin and idolatry in africa  surely we cannot concede that the light of the crescent is greater than the glory of the cross that there is less constraining power in the christ of calvary than in the prophet of arabia  i do not think that i underrate the difficulties in your way when i say that you young men are holding in your hands golden opportunities which it would be madness and folly to throw away it is your grand opportunity to help build up a new south not on the shifting sands of policy and expediency but on the broad basis of equal justice and universal freedom do this and you will be blessed and will make your life a blessing

after robert and rev carmicle had left the hotel drs latimer gresham and latrobe sat silent and thoughtful awhile when dr gresham broke the silence by asking dr latrobe how he had enjoyed the evening

very pleasantly he replied i was quite interested in that parson where was he educated  

 in oxford i believe i was pleased to hear him say that he had no white blood in his veins

i should think not replied dr latrobe from his looks but one swallow does not make a summer it is the exceptions which prove the rule

dont you think asked dr gresham that we have been too hasty in our judgment of the negro  he has come handicapped into life and is now on trial before the world but it is not fair to subject him to the same tests that you would a white man i believe that there are possibilities of growth in the race which we have never comprehended

 the negro said dr latrobe  is perfectly comprehensible to me the only way to get along with him is to let him know his place and make him keep it

i think replied dr gresham every mans place is the one he is best fitted for

 why asked dr latimer should any place be assigned to the negro more than to the french irish or german  

 oh replied dr latrobe  they are all caucasians well said dr gresham is all excellence summed up in that branch of the human race  

ithink said dr latrobe proudly that we belong to the highest race on earth and the negro to the lowest and yet said dr latimer you have consorted with them till you have bleached their faces to the whiteness of your own your children nestle in their bosoms  they are around you as body servants and yet if one of them should attempt to associate with you your bitterest scorn and indignation would be visited upon them

 i think said dr latrobe  that feeling grows out of our anglosaxon regard for the marriage relation these white negroes are of illegitimate origin and we would scorn to share our social life with them their blood is tainted

who tainted it asked dr latimer bitterly  you give absolution to the fathers and visit the misfortunes of the mothers upon the children

 but doctor what kind of society would we have if we put down the bars and admitted everybody to social equality  

this idea of social equality said dr latimer is only a bugbear which frightens wellmeaning people from dealing justly with the negro i know of no place on earth where there is perfect social equality and i doubt if there is such a thing in heaven the sinner who repents on his deathbed cannot be the equal of st paul or the beloved disciple

doctor said dr gresham i sometimes think that the final solution of this question will be the absorption of the negro into our race

never never exclaimed dr latrobe vehemently  it would be a death blow to american civilization

 why doctor said dr latimer you southerners began this absorption before the war i understand that in one decade the mixed bloods rose from oneninth to oneeighth of the population and that as early as  a law was passed in maryland to prevent englishwomen from intermarrying with slaves and even now your laws against miscegenation presuppose that you apprehend danger from that source

 doctor it is no use talking replied dr latrobe wearily  there are niggers who are as white as i am but the taint of blood is there and we always exclude it  how do you know it is there  asked dr gresham  oh there are tricks of blood which always betray them my eyes are more practiced than yours i can always tell them now that johnson is as white as any man but i knew he was a nigger the moment i saw him i saw it in his eye

dr latimer smiled at dr latrobes assertion but did not attempt to refute it and bade him goodnight

 i think said dr latrobe  that our war was the great mistake of the nineteenth century it has left us very serious complications we cannot amalgamate with the negroes we cannot expatriate them now what are we to do with them  

deal justly with themsaid dr gresham and let them alone try to create a moral sentiment in the nation which will consider a wrong done to the weakest of them as a wrong done to the whole community whenever you find ministers too righteous to be faithless cowardly and time serving women too christly to be scornful and public men too noble to be tricky and too honest to pander to the prejudices of the people stand by them and give them your moral support

 doctor said latrobe  with your views you ought to be a preacher striving to usher in the millennium

 it cant come too soon replied dr gresham

on the eve of his departure from the city of p dr gresham called on iola and found her alone they talked awhile of reminiscences of the war and hospital life when dr gresham approaching iola saidâ  miss leroy i am glad the great object of your life is accomplished and that you have found all your relatives years have passed since we parted years in which i have vainly tried to get a trace of you and have been baffled but i have found you at last clasping her hand in his he continued i would it were so that i should never lose you again iola will you not grant me the privilege of holding this hand as mine all through the future of our lives your search for your mother is ended she is well cared for are you not free at last to share with me my northern home free to be mine as nothing else on earth is mine dr gresham looked eagerly on idas face and tried to read its varying expression  iola i learned to love you in the hospital i have tried to forget you but it has been all in vain your image is just as deeply engraven on my heart as it was the day we parted

 doctor she replied sadly but firmly as she withdrew her hand from his  i feel now as i felt then that there is an insurmountable barrier between us

what is it iola asked dr gresham anxiously

it is the public opinion which assigns me a place with the colored people

 but what right has public opinion to interfere with our marriage relations  why should we yield to its behests  

 because it is stronger than we are and we cannot run counter to it without suffering its penalties

and what are they iola shadows that you merely dread 

no no the penalties of social ostracism north and south except here and there some grand and noble exceptions i do not think that you fully realize how much prejudice against colored people permeates society lowers the tone of our religion and reacts upon the life of the nation after freedom came mamma was living in the city of a and wanted to unite with a christian church there she made application for membership she passed her examination as a candidate and was received as a church member when she was about to make her first communion she unintentionally took her seat at the head of the column the elder who was administering the communion gave her the bread in the order in which she sat but before he gave her the wine some one touched him on the shoulder and whispered a word in his ear he then passed mamma by gave the cup to others and then returned to her from that rite connected with the holiest memories of earth my poor mother returned humiliated and depressed

 what a shame  exclaimed dr gresham indignantly

 i have seen continued iola the same spirit manifested in the north mamma once attempted to do missionary work in this city one day she found an outcast colored girl whom she wished to rescue she took her to an asylum for fallen women and made an application for her but was refused colored girls were not received there soon after mamma found among the colored people an outcast white girl mammas sympathies unfettered by class distinction were aroused in her behalf and in company with two white ladies she went with the girl to that same refuge for her the door was freely opened and admittance readily granted it was as if two women were sinking in the quicksands and on the solid land stood other women with lifelines in their hands seeing the deadly sands slowly creeping up around the hapless victims to one they readily threw the lines of deliverance but for the other there was not one strand of salvation sometime sinceto the same asylum came a poor fallen girl who had escaped from the clutches of a wicked woman for her the door would have been opened had not the vile woman from whom she was escaping followed her to that place of refuge and revealed the fact that she belonged to the colored race that fact was enough to close the door upon her and to send her back to sin and to suffer and perhaps to die as a wretched outcast and yet in this city where a number of charities are advertised i do not think there is one of them which in appealing to the public talks more religion than the managers of this asylum this prejudice against the colored race environs our lives and mocks our aspirations

 iola i see no use in your persisting that you are colored when your eyes are as blue and complexion as white as mine

 doctor were i your wife are there not people who would caress me as a white woman who would shrink from me in scorn if they knew i had one drop of negro blood in my veins  when mistaken for a white woman i should hear things alleged against the race at which my blood would boil no doctor i am not willing to live under a shadow of concealment which i thoroughly hate as if the blood in my veins were an undetected crime of my soul

 iola dear surely you paint the picture too darkly

 doctor i have painted it with my hearts blood it is easier to outgrow the dishonor of crime than the disabilities of color you have created in this country an aristocracy of color wide enough to include the south with its treason and utah with its abominations but too narrow to include the best and bravest colored man who bared his breast to the bullets of the enemy during your fratricidal strife is not the most arrant rebel today more acceptable to you than the most faithful colored man  

no no exclaimed dr gresham vehemently you are wrong i belong to the grand army of the republic we have no separate state posts for the colored people and were such a thing proposed the majority of our members i believe would be against it in congress colored men have the same seats as white men and the color line is slowly fading out in our public institutions

 but how is it in the church  asked iola

the church is naturally conservative it preserves old truths even if it is somewhat slow in embracing new ideas it has its social as well as its spiritual side

society is womans realm the majority of church members are women who are said to be the aristocratic element of our country i fear that one of the last strongholds of this racial prejudice will be found beneath the shadow of some of our churches i think on account of this social question that large bodies of christian temperance women and other reformers in trying to reach the colored people even for their own good will be quicker to form separate associations than our national grand army whose ranks are open to black and white liberals and conservatives saints and agnostics but iola we have drifted far away from the question no one has a right to interfere with our marriage if we do not infringe on the rights of others

doctorshe replied gently i feel that our paths must diverge my lifework is planned i intend spending my future among the colored people of the south

 my dear friend he replied anxiously  i am afraid that you are destined to sad disappointment when the novelty wears off you will be disillusioned and i fear when the time comes that you can no longer serve them they will forget your services and remember only your failings

but doctor they need me and i am sure when i taught among them they were very grateful for my services

i think he replied these people are more thankful than grateful

 i do not think so and if i did it would not hinder me from doing all in my power to help them i do not expect all the finest traits of character to spring from the hotbeds of slavery and caste what matters it if they do forget the singer so they dont forget the song  no doctor i dont think that i could best serve my race by forsaking them and marrying you

 iola he exclaimed passionately  if you love your race as you call it work for it live for it suffer for it and if need be die for it but dont marry for it your education has unfitted you for social life among them

 it was replied iola through their unrequited toil that i was educated while they were compelled to live in ignorance i am indebted to them for the power i have to serve them i wish other southern women felt as i do i think they could do so much to help the colored people at their doors if they would look at their opportunities in the light of the face of jesus christ nor am i wholly unselfish in allying myself with the colored people all the rest of my family have done so my dear grandmother is one of the excellent of the earth and we all love her too much to ignore our relationship with her i did not choose my lot in life and the simplest thing i can do is to accept the situation and do the best i can

and is this your settled purpose  he asked sadly

 it is doctor she replied tenderly but firmly  i see no other i must serve the race which needs me most

 perhaps you are right he replied  but i cannot help feeling sad that our paths which met so pleasantly should diverge so painfully and yet not only the freedmen but the whole country need such helpful selfsacrificing teachers as you will prove  and if earnest prayers and holy wishes can brighten your path your lines will fall in the pleasantest places

as he rose to go sympathy love and admiration were blended in the parting look he gave her but he felt it was useless to attempt to divert her from her purpose he knew that for the true reconstruction of the country something more was needed than bayonets and bullets or the schemes of selfish politicians or plotting demagogues he knew that the south needed the surrender of the best brain and heart of the country to build above the wastes of war more stately temples of thought and action

on the morning previous to their departure for their respective homes dr gresham met dr latrobe in the parlor of the concordia

 how asked dr gresham  did you like dr latimers paper 

very much indeed it was excellent he is a very talented young man he sits next to me at lunch and i have conversed with him several times he is very genial and attractive only he seems to be rather cranky on the negro question i hope if he comes south that he will not make the mistake of mixing up with the negroes it would be throwing away his influence and ruining his prospects he seems to be well versed in science and literature and would make a very delightful accession to our social life

 i think replied dr gresham  that he is an honor to our profession he is one of the finest specimens of our young manhood

just then dr latimer entered the room dr latrobe arose and greeting him cordially said  i was delighted with your paper it was full of thought and suggestion

thank you answered dr latimer  it was my aim to make it so

and you succeeded admirably replied dr latrobe  i could not help thinking how much we owe to heredity and environment

yes said dr gresham continental europe yearly sends to our shores subjects to be developed into citizens emancipation has given us millions of new citizens and to them our influence and example should be a blessing and not a curse

 well said dr latimer  i intend to go south and help those who so much need helpers from their own ranks

i hope answered dr latrobe that if you go south you will only sustain business relations with the negroes and not commit the folly of equalizing yourself with them

why not asked dr latimer steadily looking him in the eye

 because in equalizing yourself with them you drag us down  and our social customs must be kept intact

you have been associating with me at the convention for several days i do not see that the contact has dragged you down has it  

you what has that got to do with associating with niggers asked dr latrobe curtly

the blood of that race is coursing through my veins i am one of them replied dr latimer proudly raising his head

you exclaimed dr latrobe with an air of profound astonishment and crimsoning face

yes interposed dr gresham laughing heartily at dr latrobes discomfiture  he belongs to that negro race both by blood and choice his fathers mother made overtures to receive him as her grandson and heir but he has nobly refused to forsake his mothers people and has cast his lot with them

 and i said dr latimer  would have despised myself if i had done otherwise

 well well said dr latrobe rising  i was never so deceived before good morning 

dr latrobe had thought he was clearsighted enough to detect the presence of negro blood when all physical traces had disappeared but he had associated with dr latimer for several days and admired his talent without suspecting for one moment his racial connection he could not help feeling a sense of vexation at the signal mistake he had made

dr frank latimer was the natural grandson of a southern lady in whose family his mother had been a slave the blood of a proud aristocratic ancestry was flowing through his veins and generations of blood admixture had effaced all trace of his negro lineage h is complexion was blonde his eye bright and piercing his lips firm and well moulded  his manner very affable his intellect active and well stored with information he was a man capable of winning in life through his rich gifts of inheritance and acquirements when freedom came his mother like hagar of old went out into the wide world to seek a living for herself and child through years of poverty she labored to educate her child and saw the glad fruition of her hopes when her son graduated as an m d from the university of p

after his graduation he met his fathers mother who recognized him by his resemblance to her dear departed son all the mother love in her lonely heart awoke and she was willing to overlook  the missing link of matrimony and adopt him as her heir if he would ignore his identity with the colored race

before him loomed all the possibilities which only birth and blood can give a white man in our democratic country but he was a man of too much sterling worth of character to be willing to forsake his mothers race for the richest advantages his grandmother could bestow

dr gresham had met dr latimer at the beginning of the convention and had been attracted to him by his frank and genial manner one morning when conversing with him dr gresham had learned some of the salient points of his history which instead of repelling him had only deepened his admiration for the young doctor he was much amused when he saw the pleasant acquaintanceship between him and dr latrobe but they agreed to be silent about his racial connection until the time came when they were ready to divulge it and they were hugely delighted at his signal blunder

 mamma is not well said iola to robert  i spoke to her about sending for a doctor but she objected and i did not insist

 i will ask dr latimer whom i met at the concordia to step in he is a splendid young fellow i wish we had thousands like him

in the evening the doctor called without appearing to make a professional visit he engaged marie in conversation watched her carefully and came to the conclusion that her failing health proceeded more from mental than physical causes

 i am so uneasy about harry said mrs leroy he is so fearless and outspoken i do wish the attention of the whole nation could be turned to the cruel barbarisms which are a national disgrace i think the term bloody shirt is one of the most heartless phrases ever invented to divert attention from cruel wrongs and dreadful outrages

just then iola came in and was introduced by her uncle to dr latimer to whom the introduction was a sudden and unexpected pleasure

after an interchange of courtesies marie resumed the conversation saying harry wrote me only last week that a young friend of his had lost his situation because he refused to have his pupils strew flowers on the streets through which jefferson davis was to pass

 i think said dr latimer indignantly  that the israelites had just as much right to scatter flowers over the bodies of the egyptians when the waves threw back their corpses on the shores of the red sea as these children had to strew the path of jefferson davis with flowers we want our boys to grow up manly citizens and not cringing sycophants when do you expect your son mrs leroy

 some time next week answered marie

and his presence will do you more good than all the medicine in my chest

 i hope doctor said mrs leroy  that we will not lose sight of you now that your professional visit is ended for i believe your visit was the result of a conspiracy between iola and her uncle

dr latimer laughed as he answered ah mrs leroy i see you have found us all out

 oh doctor exclaimed iola with pleasing excitement  there is a young lady coming here to visit me next week her name is miss lucille delany and she is my ideal woman she is grand brave intellectual and religious

 is that so  she would make some man an excellent wife replied dr latimer

 now isnt that perfectly manlike answered iola smiling  mamma what do you think of that  did any of you gentlemen ever see a young woman of much ability that you did not look upon as a flotsam all adrift until some man had appropriated her 

 i think miss leroy that the worlds work if shared is better done than when it is performed alone dont you think your lifework will be better done if some one shares it with you   asked dr latimer slowly and with a smile in his eyes

 that would depend on the person who shared it said iola faintly blushing

 here said robert a few evenings after this conversation as he handed iola a couple of letters is something which will please you

iola took the letters and after reading one of them said miss delany and harry will be here on wednesday and this one is an invitation which also adds to my enjoyment

what is it  asked marie an invitation to a hop or a german  

no but something which i value far more we are all invited to mr stillmans to a conversazione

 what is the object  

his object is to gather some of the thinkers and leaders of the race to consult on subjects of vital interest to our welfare he has invited dr latimer professor gradnor of north carolina mr forest of new york hon dugdale revs carmicle cantnor tunster professor langhorne of georgia and a few ladies mrs watson miss brown and others

 i am glad that it is neither a hop nor a german said iola  but something for which i have been longing

why iola asked robert dont you believe in young people having a good time  

oh yes answered iola seriously  i believe in young people having amusements and recreations but the times are too serious for us to attempt to make our lives a long holiday

well iola answered robert this is the first holiday we have had in two hundred and fifty years and you shouldnt be too exacting

 yesreplied marie human beings naturally crave enjoyment and if not furnished with good amusements they are apt to gravitate to low pleasures

 some one said robert has said that the indian belongs to an old race and looks gloomily back to the past and that the negro belongs to a young race and looks hopefully towards the future

if that be so replied marie our racelife corresponds more to the follies of youth than the faults of maturer years

on dr latimers next visit he was much pleased to see a great change in maries appearance her eye had grown brighter her step more elastic and the anxiety had faded from her face harry had arrived and with him came miss delany

good evening dr latimer said iola cheerily as she entered the room with miss lucille delany this is my friend miss delany from georgia were she not present i would say she is one of the grandest women in america

 i am very much pleased to meet you said dr latimer cordially  i have heard miss leroy speak of you we were expecting you he added with a smile

just then harryentered the room and iola presented him to dr latimer saying this is my brother about whom mamma was so anxious

 had you a pleasant journey   asked dr latimer after the first greetings were over

 not especially answered miss delany  southern roads are not always very pleasant to travel when mr

leroy entered the cars at a where he was known had he taken his seat among the white people he would have been remanded to the colored car

but after awhilesaid harry as miss delany and myself were sitting together laughing and chatting a colored man entered the car and mistaking me for a white man asked the conductor to have me removed and i had to insist that i was colored in order to be permitted to remain it would be ludicrous if it were not vexatious to be too white to be black and too black to be white

 caste plays such fantastic tricks in this country said dr latimer

i tell mr leroy said miss delany that when he returns he must put a label on himself saying i am a colored man to prevent annoyance

on the following friday evening mr stillmans pleasant spacious parlors were filled to overflowing with a select company of earnest men and women deeply interested in the welfare of the race

bishop tunster had prepared a paper on negro emigration dr latimer opened the discussion by speaking favorably of some of the salient points but said â  i do not believe selfexilement is the true remedy for the wrongs of the negro where should he go if he left this country  

go to africa replied bishop tunster in his bluff hearty tones  i believe that africa is to be redeemed to civilization and that the negro is to be gathered into the family of nations and recognized as a man and a brother

go to africa repeated professor langhorne of georgia  does the united states own one foot of african soil and have we not been investing our blood in the country for ages  

lam in favor of missionary efforts said professor gradnor of north carolina for the redemption of africa but i see no reason for expatriating ourselves because some persons do not admire the color of our skins

 i do not believe said mr stillman  in emptying on the shores of africa a horde of ignorant povertystricken people as missionaries of civilization or christianity and while i am in favor of missionary efforts there is need here for the best heart and brain to work in unison for justice and righteousness

 america said miss delany is the best field for human development god has not heaped up our mountains with such grandeur flooded our rivers with such majesty crowned our valleys with such fertility enriched our mines with such wealth that they should only minister to grasping greed and sensuous enjoyment  climate soil and physical environments said professor gradnor have much to do with shaping national characteristics if in africa under a tropical sun the negro has lagged behind other races in the march of civilization at least for once in his history he has in this country the privilege of using climatic advantages and developing under new conditions

yes replied dr latimer and i do not wish our people to become restless and unsettled before they have tried one generation of freedom

 i am always glad said mr forest a tall distinguishedlooking gentleman from new york when i hear of people who are ill treated in one section of the country emigrating to another men who are deaf to the claims of mercy and oblivious to the demands of justice can feel when money is slipping from their pockets

the negro said hon dugdale does not present to my mind the picture of an effete and exhausted people destined to die out before a stronger race gilbert haven once saw a statue which suggested this thought  i am black but comely the sun has looked down upon me but i will teach you who despise me to feel that i am your superior the men who are acquiring property and building up homes in the south show us what energy and determination may do even in that part of the country i believe such men can do more to conquer prejudice than if they spent all their lives in shouting for their rights and ignoring their duties no as there are millions of us in this country i think it best to settle down and work out our own salvation here

 how many of us today asked professor langhome would be teaching in the south if every field of labor in the north was as accessible to us as to the whites  it has been estimated that a million young white men have left the south since the war and had our chances been equal to theirs would we have been any more willing to stay in the south with those who need us than they but this prejudice by impacting us together gives us a common cause and brings our intellect in contact with the less favored of our race

i do not believe said miss delany that the southern white people themselves desire any wholesale exodus of the colored from their labor fields it would be suicidal to attempt their expatriation

history said professor langhorne tells that spain was once the place where barbarian europe came to light her lamp seven hundred years before there was a public lamp in london you might have gone through the streets of cordova amid ten miles of lighted lamps and stood there on solidly paved land when hundreds of years afterwards in paris on a rainy day you would have sunk to your ankles in the mud but she who bore the name of the  terror of nations and the  queen of the ocean was not strong enough to dash herself against gods law of retribution and escape unscathed she inaugurated a crusade of horror against a million of her best laborers and artisans vainly she expected the blessing of god to crown her work of violence instead of seeing the fruition of her hopes in the increased prosperity of her land depression and paralysis settled on her trade and business a fearful blow was struck at her agriculture decay settled on her manufactories money became too scarce to pay the necessary expenses of the kings exchequer and that once mighty empire became a fallen kingdom pierced by her crimes and dragged down by her transgressions

 we did not said iola  place the bounds of our habitation and i believe we are to be fixtures in this country but beyond the shadows i see the coruscation of a brighter day and we can help usher it in not by answering hate with hate or giving scorn for scorn but by striving to be more generous noble and just it seems as if all creation travels to respond to the song of the herald angels  peace on earth goodwill toward men

the next paper was on  patriotism by rev cantnor it was a paper in which the white man was extolled as the master race and spoke as if it were a privilege for the colored man to be linked to his destiny and to live beneath the shadow of his power he asserted that the white race of this country is the broadest most christian and humane of that branch of the human family

dr latimer took exception to his position  law

he said  is the pivot on which the whole universe turns and obedience to law is the gauge by which a nations strength or weakness is tried we have had two evils by which our obedience to law has been testedâslavery and the liquor traffic how have we dealt with them both  we have been weighed in the balance and found wanting millions of slaves and serfs have been liberated during this century but not even in semibarbaric russia heathen japan or catholic spain has slavery been abolished through such a fearful conflict as it was in the united states the liquor traffic still sends its floods of ruin and shame to the habitations of men and no political party has been found with enough moral power and numerical strength to stay the tide of death

i think said professor gradnor that what our country needs is truth more than flattery i do not think that our moral life keeps pace with our mental development and material progress i know of no civilized country on the globe catholic protestant or mohammedan where life is less secure than it is in the south nearly eighteen hundred years ago the life of a roman citizen in palestine was in danger from mob violence that pagan government threw around him a wall of living clay consisting of four hundred and seventy men when more than forty jews had bound themselves with an oath that they would neither eat nor drink until they had taken the life of the apostle paul does not true patriotism demand that citizenship should be as much protected in christian america as it was in heathen rome

i would have our people said miss delany more interested in politics instead of forgetting the past i would have them hold in everlasting remembrance our great deliverance hitherto we have never had a country with tender precious memories to fill our eyes with tears or glad reminiscences to thrill our hearts with pride and joy we have been aliens and outcasts in the land of our birth but i want my pupils to do all in their power to make this country worthy of their deepest devotion and loftiest patriotism i want them to feel that its glory is their glory its dishonor their shame

our esteemed friend mrs watson said iola sends regrets that she cannot come but has kindly favored us with a poem called the  rallying cry in her letter she says that although she is no longer young she feels that in the conflict for the right theres room for young as well as old she hopes that we will here unite the enthusiasm of youth with the experience of age and that we will have a pleasant and profitable conference is it your pleasure that the poem be read at this stage of our proceedings or later on  

 let us have it now answered harry  and i move that miss delany be chosen to lend to the poem the charm of her voice

 i second the motion said iola smiling and handing the poem to miss delany

miss delany took the poem and read it with fine effect the spirit of the poem had entered her soul

a rallying cry

oh children of the tropics amid our pain and wrong have you no other mission than music dance and song

when through the weary ages our dripping tears still fall is this a time to dally with pleasures silken thrall 

go muffle all your viols  as heroes learn to stand with faith in gods great justice nerve every heart and hand

dream not of ease nor pleasure nor honor wealth nor fame till from the dust youve lifted our longdishonored name and crowned that name with glory by deeds of holy worth to shine with light emblazoned the noblest name on earth

count life a dismal failure unblessing and unblest that seeks mid ease inglorious for pleasure or for rest

with courage strength and valor your lives and actions brace  shrink not from toil or hardship and dangers bravely face

engrave upon your banners in words of golden light that honor truth and justice are more than godless might

above earths pain and sorrow christs dying face i see  i hear the cry of anguish â why hast thou forsaken me

in the pallor of that anguish i see the only light to flood with peace and gladness earths sorrow pain and night

arrayed in christly armor gainst error crime and sin the victory cant be doubtful for god is sure to win

the next paper was by miss iola leroy on the  education of mothers

i agree said rev eustace of st marys parish  with the paper the great need of the race is enlightened mothers

 and enlightened fathers too added miss delany quickly  if there is anything i chafe to see it is a strong hearty man shirking his burdens putting them on the shoulders of his wife and taking life easy for himself

 i always pity such mothers interposed iola tenderly

 i think said miss delany with a flash in her eye and a ring of decision in her voice that such men ought to be drummed out of town as she spoke there was an expression which seemed to say and i would like to help do it 

harry smiled and gave her a quick glance of admiration

i do not think said mrs stillman that we can begin too early to teach our boys to be manly and selfrespecting and our girls to be useful and selfreliant

 you know said mrs leroy that after the war we were thrown upon the nation a homeless race to be gathered into homes and a legally unmarried race to be taught the sacredness of the marriage relation we must instill into our young people that the true strength of a race means purity in women and uprightness in men who can say with sir galahad â  my strength is the strength of ten because my heart is pure and where this is wanting neither wealth nor culture can make up the deficiency

 there is a field of christian endeavor which lies between the schoolhouse and the pulpit which needs the hand of a woman more in private than in public said miss delany

 yes i have often felt the need of such work in my own parish we need a union of women with the warmest hearts and clearest brains to help in the moral education of the race said rev eustace

yes said iola  if we would have the prisons empty we must make the homes more attractive

in civilized society replied dr latimer there must be restraint either within or without if parents fail to teach restraint within society has her checkreins without in the form of chaingangs prisons and the gallows

the closing paper was on the moral progress of the race by hon dugdale he said the moral progress of the race was not all he could desire yet he could not help feeling that compared with other races the outlook was not hopeless i am so sorry to see however that in some states there is an undue proportion of colored people in prisons

 i think answered professor langhorne of georgia  that this is owing to a partial administration of law in meting out punishment to colored offenders i know redhanded murderers who walk in this republic unwhipped of justice and i have seen a colored woman sentenced to prison for weeks for stealing twentyfive cents i knew a colored girl who was executed for murder when only a child in years and it was through the intervention of a friend of mine one of the bravest young men of the south that a boy of fifteen was saved from the gallows

 when i look said mr forest  at the slow growth of modern civilizationâthe ages which have been consumed in reaching our present altitude and see how we have outgrown slavery feudalism and religious persecutions i cannot despair of the future of the race

just now said dr latimer we have the fearful grinding and friction which comes in the course of an adjustment of the new machinery of freedom in the old ruts of slavery but i am optimistic enough to believe that there will yet be a far higher and better christian civilization than our country has ever known

 and in that civilization i believe the negro is to be an important factor said rev cantnor

 i believe it also said miss delany hopefully and this thought has been a blessed inspiration to my life when i come in contact with christless prejudices i feel that my life is too much a part of the divine plan and invested with too much intrinsic worth for me to be the least humiliated by indignities that beggarly souls can inflict i feel more pitiful than resentful to those who do not know how much they miss by living mean ignoble lives

 my heart said iola  is full of hope for the future pain and suffering are the crucibles out of which come gold more fine than the pavements of heaven and gems more precious than the foundations of the holy city

 if said mrs leroy  pain and suffering are factors in human development surely we have not been counted too worthless to suffer

and is there continued iola a path which we have trodden in this country unless it be the path of sin into which jesus christ has not put his feet and left it luminous with the light of his steps has the negro been poor and homeless  the birds of the air had nests and the foxes had holes but the son of man had not where to lay his head has our name been a synonym for contempt   he shall be called a nazarene have we been despised and trodden under foot  christ was despised and rejected of men have we been ignorant and unlearned  it was said of jesus christ  how knoweth this man letters never having learned   have we been beaten and bruised in the prisonhouse of bondage  they took jesus and scourged him have we been slaughtered our bones scattered at the graves mouth  he was spit upon by the mob smitten and mocked by the rabble and died as died romes meanest criminal slave today that cross of shame is a throne of power those robes of scorn have changed to habiliments of light and that crown of mockery to a diadem of glory and never while the agony of gethsemane and the sufferings of calvary have their hold upon my heart will i recognize any religion as his which despises the least of his brethren

as iola finished there was a ring of triumph in her voice as if she were reviewing a path she had trodden with bleeding feet and seen it change to lines of living light her soul seemed to be flashing through the rare loveliness of her face and etherealizing its beauty

every one was spellbound dr latimer was entranced and turning to hon dugdale said in a low voice and with deepdrawn breath  she is angelic 

hon dugdale turned gave a questioning look then replied  she is strangely beautiful do you know her

yes i have met her several times i accompanied her here tonight the tones of her voice are like benedictions of peace her words a call to higher service and nobler life

just then rev carmicle was announced he had been on a southern tour and had just returned

 oh doctor exclaimed mrs stillman  i am delighted to see you we were about to adjourn but we will postpone action to hear from you

 thank you replied rev carmicle  i have not the cue to the meeting and will listen while i take breath

 pardon me answered mrs stillman  i should have been more thoughtful than to press so welcome a guest into service before i had given him time for rest and refreshment but if the courtesy failed on my lips it did not fail in my heart i wanted our young folks to see one of our thinkers who had won distinction before the war

 my dear friend said rev carmicle smiling some of these young folks will look on me as a back number you know the cry has already gone forth  young men to the front 

but we need old men for counsel interposed mr forest of new york

 of course said rev carmicle  we older men would rather retire gracefully than be relegated or hustled to a back seat but i am pleased to see doors open to you which were closed to us and opportunities which were denied us embraced by you

 how asked hon dugdale doyou feel in reference to our peoples condition in the south  

 very hopeful although at times i cannot help feeling anxious about their future i was delighted with my visits to various institutions of learning and surprised at the desire manifested among the young people to obtain an education where toilworn mothers bent beneath their heavy burdens their more favored daughters are enjoying the privileges of education young people are making recitations in greek and latin where it was once a crime to teach their parents to read i also became acquainted with colored professors and presidents of colleges saw young ladies who had graduated as doctors comfortable homes have succeeded old cabins of slavery vast crops have been raised by free labor i read with interest and pleasure a number of papers edited by colored men i saw it estimated that two millions of our people had learned to read and i feel deeply grateful to the people who have supplied us with teachers who have stood their ground so nobly among our people

 but asked mr forest you expressed fears about the future of our race from whence do your fears arise  

 from the unfortunate conditions which slavery has entailed upon that section of our country i dread the results of that racial feeling which ever and anon breaks out into restlessness and crime also i am concerned about the lack of home training for those for whom the discipline of the plantation has been exchanged for the penalties of prisons and chaingangs i am sorry to see numbers of our young men growing away from the influence of the church and drifting into prisons i also fear that in some sections as colored men increase in wealth and intelligence there will be an increase of race rivalry and jealousy it is said that savages by putting their ears to the ground can hear a faroff tread so today i fear that there are savage elements in our civilization which hear the advancing tread of the negro and would retard his coming it is the incarnation of these elements that i dread it is their elimination i do so earnestly desire whether it be outgrown or not is our unsolved problem time alone will tell whether or not the virus of slavery and injustice has too fully permeated our southern civilization for a complete recovery nations honeycombed by vice have fallen beneath the weight of their iniquities justice is always uncompromising in its claims and inexorable in its demands the laws of the universe are never repealed to accommodate our follies

surely said bishop tunster the negro has a higher mission than that of aimlessly drifting through life and patiently waiting for death

we may not answered rev carmicle have the same dash courage and aggressiveness of other races accustomed to struggle achievement and dominion but surely the world needs something better than the results of arrogance aggressiveness and indomitable power for the evils of society there are no solvents as potent as love and justice and our greatest need is not more wealth and learning but a religion replete with life and glowing with love let this be the impelling force in the race and it cannot fail to rise in the scale of character and condition

and said dr latimer instead of narrowing our sympathies to mere racial questions let us broaden them to humanitys wider issues

 let us replied rev carmicle  pass it along the lines that to be willfully ignorant is to be shamefully criminal let us teach our people not to love pleasure or to fear death but to learn the true value of life and to do their part to eliminate the paganism of caste from our holy religion and the lawlessness of savagery from our civilization

 how did you enjoy the evening marie   asked robert as they walked homeward

 i was interested and deeply pleased answered marie

 i said robert  was thinking of the wonderful changes that have come to us since the war when i sat in those welllighted beautifullyfurnished rooms i was thinking of the meetings we used to have in bygone days how we used to go by stealth into lonely woods and gloomy swamps to tell of our hopes and fears sorrows and trials i hope that we will have many more of these gatherings let us have the next one here

 i am sure said marie  i would gladly welcome such a conference at any time i think such meetings would be so helpful to our young people

 doctor said iola as they walked home from the conversazione  i wish i could do something more for our people than i am doing i taught in the south till failing health compelled me to change my employment but now that i am well and strong i would like to do something of lasting service for the race

 why not asked dr latimer  write a good strong book which would be helpful to them  i think there is an amount of dormant talent among us and a large field from which to gather materials for such a book

 i would do it willingly if i could but one needs both leisure and money to make a successful book there is material among us for the broadest comedies and the deepest tragedies but besides money and leisure it needs patience perseverance courage and the hand of an artist to weave it into the literature of the country

miss leroy you have a large and rich experience you possess a vivid imagination and glowing fancy write out of the fullness of your heart a book to inspire men and women with a deeper sense of justice and humanity

 doctor replied iola  i would do it if i could not for the money it might bring but for the good it might do but who believes any good can come out of the black nazareth

miss leroy out of the race must come its own thinkers and writers authors belonging to the white race have written good racial books for which i am deeply grateful but it seems to be almost impossible for a white man to put himself completely in our place no man can feel the iron which enters another mans soul

well doctor when i write a book i shall take you for the hero of my story

 why what have i done asked dr latimer in a surprised tone that you should impale me on your pen 

you have done nobly answered iola in refusing your grandmothers offer

 i only did my duty he modestly replied

 but said iola when others are trying to slip out from the race and pass into the white basis i cannot help admiring one who acts as if he felt that the weaker the race is the closer he would cling to it

 my mother replied dr latimer  faithful and true belongs to that race where else should i be  but i know a young lady who could have cast her lot with the favored race yet chose to take her place with the freed people as their teacher friend and adviser this young lady was alone in the world she had been fearfully wronged and to her stricken heart came a brilliant offer of love home and social position but she bound her heart to the mast of duty closed her ears to the syren song and could not be lured from her purpose

a startled look stole over iolas face and lifting her eyes to his she falteredâ  do you know her  

yes i know her and admire her and she ought to be made the subject of a soulinspiring story do you know of whom i speak  

 how should i doctor  i am sure you have not made me your confidante she responded demurely then she quickly turned and tripped up the steps of her home which she had just reached

after this conversation dr latimer became a frequent visitor at iolas home and a firm friend of her brother harry was at that age when for the young and inexperienced vice puts on her fairest guise and most seductive smiles dr latimers wider knowledge and larger experience made his friendship for harry very valuable and the service he rendered him made him a favorite and everwelcome guest in the family

are you all alone asked robert one night as he entered the cosy little parlor where iola sat reading  where are the rest of the folks  

 mamma and grandma have gone to bed answered iola  harry and lucille are at the concert they are passionately fond of music and find facilities here that they do not have in the south they wouldnt go to hear a seraph where they must take a negro seat i was too tired to go besides twos company and threes a crowd she added significantly

 i reckon you struck the nail on the head that time said robert laughing  but you have not been alone all the time just as i reached the corner i saw dr latimer leaving the door i see he still continues his visits who is his patient now

 oh uncle robert said iola smiling and flushing he is out with harry and lucille part of the time and drops in now and then to see us all

well said robert i suppose the case is now an affair of the heart but i cannot blame him for it he added looking fondly on the beautiful face of his niece which sorrow had touched only to chisel into more loveliness how do you like him

i must have within me answered iola with unaffected truthfulness a large amount of hero worship the characters of the old testament i most admire are moses and nehemiah they were willing to put aside their own advantages for their race and country dr latimer comes up to my ideal of a high heroic manhood

 i think answered robert smiling archly  he would be delighted to hear your opinion of him

i tell him continued iola that he belongs to the days of chivalry but he smiles and says he only belongs to the days of hardpan service

 some one said robert  was saying today that he stood in his own light when he refused his grandmothers offer to receive him as her son

 i think said iola it was the grandest hour of his life when he made that decision i have admired him ever since i heard his story

but iola think of the advantages he set aside it was no sacrifice for me to remain colored with my lack of education and race sympathies but dr latimer had doors open to him as a white man which are forever closed to a colored man to be born white in this country is to be born to an inheritance of privileges to hold in your hands the keys that open before you the doors of every occupation advantage opportunity and achievement

 i know that uncle answered iola  but even these advantages are too dearly bought if they mean loss of honor true manliness and self respect he could not have retained these had he ignored his mother and lived under a veil of concealment constantly haunted by a dread of detection the gain would not have been worth the cost it were better that he should walk the ruggedest paths of life a true man than tread the softest carpets a moral cripple

 i am afraid said robert laying his hand caressingly upon her head that we are destined to lose the light of our home

 oh uncle how you talk i never dreamed of what you are thinking answered iola half reproachfully

and how asked robert do you know what i am thinking about 

 my dear uncle im not blind

neither am i replied robert significantly as he left the room

iolas admiration for dr latimer was not a onesided affair day after day she was filling a larger place in his heart the touch of her hand thrilled him with emotion her lightest words were an entrancing melody to his ear her noblest sentiments found a response in his heart in their desire to help the race their hearts beat in loving unison one grand and noble purpose was giving tone and color to their lives and strengthening the bonds of affection between them

harrys vacation had been very pleasant miss delany with her fine conversational powers and ready wit had added much to his enjoyment robert had given his mother the pleasantest room in the house and in the evening the family would gather around her tell her the news of the day read to her from the bible join with her in thanksgiving for mercies received and in prayer for protection through the night harry was very grateful to dr latimer for the kindly interest he had shown in accompanying miss delany and himself to places of interest and amusement he was grateful too that in the city of p doors were open to them which were barred against them in the south

the bright beautiful days of summer were gliding into autumn with its glorious wealth of foliage and the time was approaching for the departure of harry and miss delany to their respective schools when dr latimer received several letters from north carolina urging him to come south as physicians were greatly needed there

although his practice was lucrative in the city of p he resolved he would go where his services were most needed

a few evenings before he started he called at the house and made an engagement to drive iola to the park

at the time appointed he drove up to the door in his fine equipage iola stepped gracefully in and sat quietly by his side to enjoy the loveliness of the scenery and the gorgeous grandeur of the setting sun

 i expect to go south said dr latimer as he drove slowly along

 ah indeed said iola assuming an air of interest while a shadow flitted over her face  where do you expect to pitch your tent 

 in the city of c north carolina he answered

 oh i wish she exclaimed  that you were going to georgia where you could take care of that highspirited brother of mine

 i suppose if he were to hear you he would laugh and say that he could take care of himself but i know a better plan than that

 what is it  asked iola innocently

 that you will commit yourself instead of your brother to my care

 oh dear replied iola drawing a long breath  what would mamma say  

 that she would willingly resign you i hope

 and what would grandma and uncle robert say again asked iola

that they would cheerfully acquiesce now what would i say if they all consent  

 i dont know modestly responded iola

well replied dr latimer  i would say â could deeds my love discover

could valor gain thy charms to prove myself thy lover id face a world in arms

and prove a good soldier added lola smiling when there is no battle to fight

 iola i am in earnest said dr latimer passionately  in the work to which i am devoted every burden will be lighter every path smoother if brightened and blessed with your companionship

a sober expression swept over idas face and dropping her eyes she said  i must have time to think

quietly they rode along the river bank until dr latimer broke the silence by saying â  miss iola i think that you brood too much over the condition of our people

 perhaps i do she replied but they never burn a man in the south that they do not kindle a fire around my soul

 i am afraid replied dr latimer  that you will grow morbid and nervous most of our people take life easilyâwhy shouldnt you  

 because she answered  i can see breakers ahead which they do not

 oh give yourself no uneasiness they will catch the fret and fever of the nineteenth century soon enough i have heard several of our ministers say that it is chiefly men of disreputable characters who are made the subjects of violence and lynchlaw

 suppose it is so responded iola feelingly  if these men believe in eternal punishment they ought to feel a greater concern for the wretched sinner who is hurried out of time with all his sins upon his head than for the godly man who passes through violence to endless rest

that is true and i am not counseling you to be selfish but miss iola had you not better look out for yourself

thank you doctor i am feeling quite well

 i know it but your devotion to study and work is too intense he replied

 i am preparing to teach and must spend my leisure time in study mr cloten is an excellent employer and treats his employes as if they had hearts as well as hands but to be an expert accountant is not the best use to which i can put my life

 as a teacher you will need strong health and calm nerves you had better let me prescribe for you you need he added with a merry twinkle in his eyes  change of air change of scene and change of name well doctor said iola laughing that is the newest nostrum out had you not better apply for a patent  

 oh replied dr latimer with affected gravity you know you must have unlimited faith in your physician  so you wish me to try the faith cure  asked iola laughing

yes faith in me responded dr latimer seriously  oh here we are at home  exclaimed iola  this has been a glorious evening doctor i am indebted to you for a great pleasure i am extremely grateful you are perfectly welcome replied dr latimer  the pleasure has been mutual i assure you

 will you not come in  asked iola

tying his horse he accompanied iola into the parlor seating himself near her he poured into her ears words eloquent with love and tenderness

 iola he said  i am not an adept in courtly phrases i am a plain man who believes in love and truth in asking you to share my lot i am not inviting you to a life of ease and luxury for year after year i may have to struggle to keep the wolf from the door but your presence would make my home one of the brightest spots on earth and one of the fairest types of heaven am i presumptuous in hoping that your love will become the crowning joy of my life  

his words were more than a tender strain wooing her to love and happiness they were a clarion call to a life of high and holy worth a call which found a response in her heart her hand lay limp in his she did not withdraw it but raising her lustrous eyes to his she softly answered   frank i love you

after he had gone iola sat by the window gazing at the splendid stars her heart quietly throbbing with a delicious sense of joy and love she had admired dr gresham and had there been no barrier in her way she might have learned to love him but dr latimer had grown irresistibly upon her heart there were depths in her nature that dr gresham had never fathomed aspirations in her soul with which he had never mingled but as the waves leap up to the strand so her soul went out to dr latimer between their lives were no impeding barriers no inclination impelling one way and duty compelling another kindred hopes and tastes had knit their hearts grand and noble purposes were lighting up their lives and they esteemed it a blessed privilege to stand on the threshold of a new era and labor for those who had passed from the old oligarchy of slavery into the new commonwealth of freedom

on the next evening dr latimer rang the bell and was answered by harry who ushered him into the parlor and then came back to the sittingroom saying iola dr latimer has called to see you

has he answered iola a glad light coming into her eyes  come lucille let us go into the parlor

 oh no interposed harry shrugging his shoulders and catching lucilles hand he didnt ask for you when we went to the concert we were told threes a crowd and i say one good turn deserves another

 oh harry you are so full of nonsense let lucille go said iola

 indeed i will not i want to have a good time as well as you said harry

 oh youre the most nonsensical man i know interposed miss delany yet she stayed with harry

youre looking very bright and happy said dr latimer to iola as she entered

my ride in the park was so refreshing i enjoyed it so much the day was so lovely the air delicious the birds sang so sweetly and the sunset was so magnificent 

 i am glad of it why iola your home is so happy your heart should be as light as a schoolgirls

 doctor she replied  i must be prematurely old i have scarcely known what it is to be lighthearted since my fathers death

 i know it darling he answered seating himself beside her and drawing her to him  you have been tried in the fire but are you not better for the crucial test  

 doctor she replied  as we rode along yesterday mingling with the sunshine of the present came the shadows of the past i was thinking of the bright joyous days of my girlhood when i defended slavery and of how the cup that i would have pressed to the lips of others was forced to my own yet in looking over the mournful past i would not change the iola of then for the iola of now

yes responded dr latimer musingly   darkness shows us worlds of light we never saw by day

oh doctor you cannot conceive what it must have been to be hurled from a home of love and light into the dark abyss of slavery to be compelled to take your place among a people you have learned to look upon as inferiors and social outcasts to be in the power of men whose presence would fill you with horror and loathing and to know that there is no earthly power to protect you from the highest insults which brutal cowardice could shower upon you i am so glad that no other woman of my race will suffer as i have done

the flush deepened on her face a mournful splendor beamed from her beautiful eyes into which the tears had slowly gathered

darling he said his voice vibrating with mingled feelings of tenderness and resentment you must forget the sad past you are like a tender lamb snatched from the jaws of a hungry wolf but who still needs protecting loving care but it must have been terrible he added in a painful tone

it was indeed for awhile i was like one dazed

i tried to pray but the heavens seemed brass over my head i was wild with agony and had i not been placed under conditions which roused all the resistance of my soul i would have lost my reason

 was it not a mistake to have kept you ignorant of your colored blood  

 it was the great mistake of my fathers life but dear papa knew something of the cruel crushing power of caste and he tried to shield us from it

yes yes replied dr latimer thoughtfully in trying to shield you from pain he plunged you into deeper suffering

 i never blame him because i know he did it for the best had he lived he would have taken us to france where i should have had a life of careless ease and pleasure but now my life has a much grander significance than it would have had under such conditions fearful as the awakening was it was better than to have slept through life

 best for you and best for me said dr latimer  there are souls that never awaken  but if they miss the deepest pain they also lose the highest joy

dr latimer went south after his engagement and through his medical skill and agreeable manners became very successful in his practice in the following summer he built a cosy home for the reception of his bride and came north where with harry and miss delany as attendants he was married to iola amid a pleasant gathering of friends by rev carmicle

it was late in the summer when dr latimer and his bride reached their home in north carolina over the cottage porch were morningglories to greet the first flushes of the rising day and roses and jasmines to distill their fragrance on the evening air aunt linda who had been apprised of their coming was patiently awaiting their arrival and uncle daniel was pleased to know that  dat sweet young lady who had sich putty manners war comin to lib wid dem

as soon as they arrived aunt linda rushed up to iola folded her in her arms and joyfully exclaimed  howdy honey ise so glad yous come i seed it in a vision dat somebody fair war comin to help us an wen i yered it war you i larffed and jist rolled ober and larffed and jist gib up

dr latimer was much gratified by the tender care aunt linda bestowed on iola

 i aint goin to let her do nuffin till she gits seasoned she looks as sweet as a peach i allers wanted some nice lady to come down yere and larn our gals some sense i cant read myself but i likes ter yere dem dat can

well aunt linda i am going to teach in the sundayschool help in the church hold mothers meetings to help these boys and girls to grow up to be good men and women wont you get a pair of spectacles and learn to read  

 oh yer cant git dat book froo my head no way you fix it i knows nuff to git to hebben and dats all i wants to know aunt linda was kind and obliging but there was one place where she drew the line and that was at learning to read

harry and miss delany accompanied iola as far as her new home and remained several days the evening before their departure harry took miss delany a drive of several miles through the pine barrens

 this thing is getting very monotonous harry broke out when they had gone some distance

oh i enjoy it replied miss delany these stately pines look so grand and solemn they remind me of a procession of hooded monks

what in the world are you talking about lucille asked harry looking puzzled

 about those pinetrees replied miss delany in a tone of surprise

 pshaw i wasnt thinking about them im thinking about iola and frank

 what about them   asked lucille

 why when i was in p dr latimer used to be firstrate company but now it is nothing but what iola wants and what iola says and what iola likes i dont believe that there is a subject i could name to him from spinning a top to circumnavigating the globe that he wouldnt somehow contrive to bring iola in and i dont believe you could talk ten minutes to iola on any subject from dressing a doll to the latest discovery in science that she wouldnt manage to lug in frank

 oh you absurd creature   responded lucille  this is their honeymoon and they are deeply in love with each other wait till you get in love with some one

 i am in love now replied harry with a serious air with whom  asked lucille archly

with you answered harry trying to take her hand

 oh harry  she exclaimed playfully resisting  dont be so nonsensical dont you think the bride looked lovely with that dress of spotless white and with those orange blossoms in her hair  

yes she did thatsafact responded harry but lucille i think there is a great deal of misplaced sentiment at weddings he added more seriously

flow so

 oh here are a couple just married and who are as happy as happy can be and people will crowd around them wishing much joy  but who thinks of wishing joy to the forlorn old bachelors and restless old maids   well harry if you want people to wish you much happiness why dont you do as the doctor has done get yourself a wife  

 i will he replied soberly  when you say so

 oh harry dont be so absurd

 indeed there isnt a bit of absurdity about what i say i am in earnest there was something in the expression of harrys face and the tone of his voice which arrested the banter on lucilles lips

 i think it was charles lamb replied lucille  who once said that schoolteachers are uncomfortable people and harry i would not like to make you uncomfortable by marrying you

you will make me uncomfortable by not marrying me

 but replied lucille  your mother may not prefer me for a daughter you know harry complexional prejudices are not confined to white people

 my mother replied harry with an air of confidence  is too noble to indulge in such sentiments

and iola would she be satisfied 

 why it would add to her satisfaction she is not one who cant be white and wont be black

 well then replied lucille  i will take the question of your comfort into consideration

the above promise was thoughtfully remembered by lucille till a bridal ring and happy marriage were the result

soon after iola had settled in cshe quietly took her place in the sundayschool as a teacher and in the church as a helper she was welcomed by the young pastor who found in her a strong and faithful ally together they planned meetings for the especial benefit of mothers and children when the dens of vice are spreading their snares for the feet of the tempted and inexperienced her doors are freely opened for the instruction of the children before their feet have wandered and gone far astray she has no carpets too fine for the tread of their little feet she thinks it is better to have stains on her carpet than stains on their souls through any neglect of hers in lowly homes and windowless cabins her visits are always welcome little children love her old age turns to her for comfort young girls for guidance and mothers for counsel her life is full of blessedness

doctor latimer by his kindness and skill has won the name of the good doctor but he is more than a successful doctor he is a true patriot and a good citizen honest just and discriminating he endeavors by precept and example to instill into the minds of others sentiments of good citizenship he is a leader in every reform movement for the benefit of the community but his patriotism is not confined to race lines  the world is his country and mankind his countrymen while he abhors their deeds of violence he pities the shortsighted and besotted men who seem madly intent upon laying magazines of powder under the cradles of unborn generations he has great faith in the possibilities of the negro and believes that enlightened and christianized he will sink the old animosities of slavery into the new community of interestsarising from freedom and that his influence upon the south will be as the influence of the sun upon the earth as when the sun passes from capricorn to cancer beauty greenness and harmony spring up in his path so he hopes that the future career of the negro will be a greater influence for freedom and social advancement than it was in the days of yore for slavery and its inferior civilization
