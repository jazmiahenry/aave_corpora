immediate jewel of his soul a romance the dreer herman 
smith youll be leaving soon wont you asked henry lee a lad of eighteen and a classmate of william smith whom he addressed with an air of non chalance

yes was the melancholy reply and i feel lonely now think of the teachers i have learned to love think of my classmates and friends it is not easy to give them up after taking many precious years to form these ties at length they must all be broken i go out into the night and for what for the greatness that is yours for the striving you arc young and if as reverend mc call says our last days are often our best days much that is good is merely waiting for you to claim it cheer up the best is yet to come said henry trying to radiate some of his own sunshiine

that sounds fine yet i deeply grieve that this time at last has come

now smith old boy be serious but not too serious get some ginger into you you know the pagan philosophy eat drink and be merry today for tomorrow we die

yes i know it well our sunday school teacher has mentioned it often

well live itâto some extent any way this much at least we may accept from the ancients there must be joy as well as sorrow

you are doing no more than many a man has done who was eager to rise to advance in any way we must give up something we love it may be home treasures friends or even life itself so history has taught us if we risk nothing we gain nothing remembering the event planned for smith for that evening henry did not give william a chance to reply but took the whole situation in hand saying well old boy i must be going you know why but understand my young man tho this occasion is planned for you if you do not watch sharply ill have more real fun than you youre putting on trying to be serious just wait till the girls get you tonight youll be serious all right i know you henry hurried off excusing himself with perfect tact and decorum

william smith who has just formed our acquaintance even in this tilt with henry lee behaved in no unaccustomed way a proud son of africa whose blood had not been adulterated by the vicious stock of any land he towered six feet with a massive aphysique a genuine black prince a king of kings his broad shoulders were capable of any human task and his hands tho calloused by much gruesome toil were equally ready to answer the call of ciscumstance a glance at his flowing crimpy hair his sparkling honest eyes and his pearly teeth at once commanded grave respect and lingering admiration

as he moved along randall street of a cosmopolitan eastern town during the latter part of august after his high school graduation he thot of the deep mystery of human existence

in the midst of this particular meditation he met henry lee what he said we already know

smith like a happy connoisseur surveyed the situation grandly how well he knew that preparations would be elaborate did pilgrim tabernacle ever indulge in anything insignificant he could not recall an instance of such at last those willing members were making ready for him was he worthy of this care 

call to mind what he had seen all were eagerly bent on a merry occasion members old and gray had long finished appetizing cakes embellished with scrupulous care with many comely designs women of middle age so well prepared the choice meats that even the most fastidious could uter no complaint nor were the younger set without their special tasks they prepared the salads decorated the dining hall and scattered prophetic greetings of great joy smith knew that the bustlings of these cheerful souls was a wish he wondered if he deserved it

then came another question provoked by the friendly intercourse with henry lee how can i repay them these questions and others crowding william at some time face us all

upon the sea of life we all must sail and whether we would have it so or not our own pilots we must be friends and relatives will cheer us near and from afar but glory is before us happiness within us and victory continually at our side and tho we founder we will not fail worthy of the strife the gift and hope we cruise along successful ever more

the dining hall of pilgrim tabernacle was sufficiently spacious to accommodate at its tables three hundred persons on occasions of great significance however these did not suffice whether this particular evening could be so construed few would categorically declare still as it was to be an affair of great moment with the young who always patronized their social functions in great numbers the committtee on arrangements wondered whether the hall was large enough

william who was to be feted by his church was well beloved by all the members who did not know his interest in the old and young especially his honored devotion to the little folk what important event occurred there in which he had not taken part brought to sunday school as soon as he could talk under its spiritual guidance he had flourished and worked in a way that was highly gratifying for four years he had been president of the young peoples circle from the age of twelve he had aided the choir first as tenor and after his voice changed as leading baritone and when the older members desired an impressive home missionary he ended their predicament by offering his servicesâin short all the activities of pilgrim tabernacle had been touched and bettered by his personality

now that this excellent young man had graduated from madison high school and was about to make preparation for his life work the church was honoring him with a reception as an expression of their appreciation of his manly conduct and their hope for his constant achievement the church also had said it would come confronted thus the committe was considerably embarrassed as to how to meet the situation

here was a throng of honest sturdy young folk equally ready to give and to receive remember it is more blessed to give than to receive is that true at least the ministers have preached it yet when we think of the barriers of life we say let the rich give and the poâr receive if this were logically followed where would the churches be  among our people commonly the welltodo withhold but the poor give their all shall we condemn their depths of zeal judge not that ye be not judged

how excellently did they dignify this occasion with a simplicity much in contrast with the elaborately decorated hall  the ceiling was wrought with an intricate yet delicate basrelief from the center of which was hung a chandelier with a brazen circle of sixty lights the walls were frescoed with pea green as a border above and below for many carefully depicted biblical scenes for this occasion however there were added bunting and runners of crepe paper in twirls and undulations this unostentatious adorning gave prominence to the six tables extending almost the center length of the room yet no less attracive was the virgin white cloths and the vases of roses and carnations equidistantly placed which rested beautifully upon them at slight intervals from the flowers there were fancy dishes of afterdinner mints salted peanuts olives and dill pickles along the edge of these tables were dainty blue plates on the top of which were paper napkins containing views of scenes presented in the poems of paul lawrence dunbar finally on each napkin rested an embellished cardboard a star of triumph in the center of the star was a tiny photograph of william smith here was being enacted no unimportant drama but one of much consequence and great joy

if you want to see our humble people where they express themselves most freely where they arc determined to try and achieve see them in their religious endeavors giving out unselfish love see them testify in public to the abundance of gods grace see them minister to the sick and dying see them cling to the faith of their fathers tho others in like circumstances would take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them see them after they had been cheated and robbed depprived of justice lynched scourged or violatedâat such a time as this seeing them bearing no man a grudge asking gods benediction upon all people black and white saint and culprit rich and poor each race has some distinctive virtue ours is to rejoice at the pleasure of our fellowman to enjoy ourselves and not envy someone elses enjoyment

just before the ceremonies began the chairlady of the committee on arrangments and mistress of ceremonies mrs lulu castle accosted mr grant stevens the chairman of the deacon board mr stevens have we not reason to rejoice our church lays just claim to having fostered the most unusual youth williamsburg has ever seen just think how he has climbed with the growth of the church year after year taking the leading parts in our sunday school programs and when he became too old for that producing concerts of the highest order 

after a few moments of reflection mr stevens asked but isnt that the very reason why we should feel sad dont you see that thru him we have gained such a reputation as we may lose with his departure  who is going to take his place 

no one of course was the prompt reply he alone can take his place none can fill it for him you cant fill even your brothers place nor can your brother fill yours tho many dont know it we are all personalities and we can contribute our greatest blessings by wearing our own shoes not those of others if each member will be true to himself as william has and not play the hypocrite pilgrims reputation for attainment will not suffer in the least

im sure youre right mrs castle as you always are he said jokingly my feelings however are mixed you understand me dont you

yesâlook she agreed pointing towards the entrance a sort of urbane hilarity and bustle were plainly apparent in that quarter

at this moment the boys and girls of the young peoples circle formed a double line extending from the main door to the seat of the distinguished individual the rows in which each member seemed supremely happy faced each other and formed as tho our young man was to run a gauntlet as william entered escorting susan lee who of the young ladies of this thrifty town had impressed him most the occupants of these lines clapped hands and cheered as homage to this uncrowned king when he had reached his seat he casually glanced at the wall before him seeing a curtain gradually being lowered he gave more than scant attention displayed on this choice fabric was the following character appraisement a man in whom there is no guile william smithâa knight without fear and without reproach

at a sign from the mistress of ceremonies all sat down fo a sumptuous repast made more gracious and appetizing by superb orchestral music as the courses were being relished sparkling humor gave the spice to life during these glad moments it was difficult to discern whether smith was the special company of susan for all of those within speaking distance had their distinctive claims to make this evidently was not her day

when the dessert was eventually laid mrs castle called first upon the visiting ministers to speak we have often heard that our ministers can always speak effectively after an excellent meal whether this is true or false let others prove every speech on this occasion however was eloquent the feast certainly might have been a stimulus yet not so potent as the grand themeâthe departure of a black youth of great ability for a far country each commended williams untiring church work his enthusiasm to advertise and give strength to the business league then because of his many community interests they hailed him the long expected moses a universal man

finally the pastor was presented reverend andrew ross his speech was a survey of williams entire life when he at length announced that this young giant of energy had decided to prepare for the ministry the satisfaction of the church was shown by long and loud applause during this outburst whisperings among the older members seemed to say i told you so gods cause needs our best

in closing the venerable divine said friends we all have our ups and downs but god who reigns on high is ever with us this negro race has suffered for weary centuries but shall this always be i think not the night must end then comes day

when i saw our brothers lynched in the south circumscribed rebuffed and scorned in the east north and west indeed i did despair i believed that progress was only degeneracy that civilization was barbarism that love was hate and just when i was about to vow eternal vengeance toward the white man as hannibal the great carthaginian did to the romans i saw the light i saw a man booker t washington sprang up almost in the night and entered securely the affections of black and white he emphasizd economic freedom some wanted him to bring all things but he was a specialist he did one thing well yet since the economic by its very nature ramifies into the social he raised his voice in immortal tones at the atlantic exposition and said that black and white could be together in all matters purely economic and separate in affairs purely social as the fingers on his hand for me the problem was solved for hope had returned then du bois kept hammering away with constantly increasing force for us to seek the paramount force in a nation political freedom thank heaven we are at last paying attention following in the train of these comes our promising youth none but god can say that he will be as great as washington or du bois yet the world can say that he will be our leader our prophet a man in whom there is no guile a knight without fear and without reproachâ william smith

cheers at once filled the hall how well reverend ross expressed their sentiments had not william penetrated their souls as deeply as human beings could his sacrifices had been unusual

resuming his remarks the pastor declared friends we can not do too much for this lad i have never seen his like besides the church in some impressive way should encourage each of its members that completes a school course it should do something tangible for that person on each such occasion we remember those who are kind to us if the church always receives and never gives it is not doing gods bidding these young people we must remember will be in our places tomorrow in the case of smith you may te helping to prepare your future pastor for you see i am withered and gray with the frost of many winters if this lads face were not black i should say without the least hesitation some day he will be president of these united states he is equal to it he has in him all the possibilities but friends his face is black

turning so that he could face the young man squarely he said with full affection smith my gallant friend the hope of our church as an expression of our appreciation different members will make special presentations in behalf of pilgrim tabernacle in the name of the lord these gifts we tender you together with the continued support of the church for your schooling keep close to the cross and bear in mind his solace lo i am with you always even to the end of the world since you have unstintedly given given your life to these your friends and to this your community god speed you on may endless years never cease to sing your joyous march to hard earned victory go with our prayers of triumph go with our tears of love go yith our hope of blessing

when this was done william made his response dear christian friends you graciously send me on and i go i have put my hand to the plow and will not turn back for god is with me there were many amens

darkness is indeed before me but is there no such a thing as endless night no the morning light is breaking i know this i know i have been bowed i know i have at least touched the skies if not in big accomplishments certainly in my dreams of race distinction yet i am not most happy i wonder how i shall do without you your hand shakes your prayers and your devotion i am trying to imagine how my unknown friends will be will they grapple me or will they leave me

i must take the chance for humanity i will hazadrd all

man am i grown a mans work must i do follow the deer follow the christ the king live pure speak true right wrong follow the kingâ else wherefore born with reverent thanks i accept your proffers of love your gifts and your devotion they overwhelmingly humble me you have given me a great responsibility to prove to you during the coming years that my life will be what you expect as i strive to learn the old and new of god appropriately to enter his great service happy recollections of this occasion will be a lamp to my pathway i leave i must god calls me there but i will return to you my loving friends and with you die bringing in the sheaves

the day following the reception at pilgrim tabernacle found william speeding south this trip brought him many novel experiences the first of which he had on the train of course he had heard of some behavior which was peculiar to the south but he did not begin to comprehend its full significance until this day when he entered a coach at washington d c he found himself facing this sign displayed in yellow and black colored at once he knew he was in a jim crow car in the very capital of the nation why was there this distinction  did it mean that he was criminal vulgar or immoral  it was simply because he was black what a difference a color makes in america 

at once william began to ponder he thot of negro scholars who would be teaching in the best universities of the country their hair was sufficiently straight but their skin was not white thereupon william questioned himself as to whether the white people of the south were essentially different from those of the north an expression of tennyson quickly flashed itself before himâman is man he concluded then that the difference was only superficial due probably to custom and education or to lack of education he knew that great men had come out of the south washington jefferson and lincoln were no more to come he could not believe it

these reflections called to mind an important circumstance he had noticed in many cities of the east particular at the national capital when the marine band gave its concerts the national anthem which is the star spangled banner never brought forth as vigorous applause as did the sectional song i wish i was in dixie surely surmised smith that must be a delightful place now he was going to dixie

with such musings chiefly on the status of the colored people in america he arrived at cassida a typical southern town teeming with the life of earnest people and wilful people alike sturdy negroes were the laboring folk and they were masters of their toil speedily carrying their merry burdens with many a merry tune here and there a straggler with jaunty pride casually looked on but the good work never ceased porters truckmen with ease courtesy and grace and smiles that only colored men can give busily made charming history strenuously made a happy land

while william stood outside the station observing this jolly atmosphere he noticed two modes of address while he was thus occupied his uncle abbot heywood came up and said william i was just about to go home under the impression that you had missed your train give me your suit case come we must hurry home

im ready uncle abbot said the youth turning from his observation of the throng and giving the old gentleman a very warm handshake im happy to see you uncle abbot i hope youre all well how is aunt carrie  are all well  were all in excellent health i assure you you must pardon me for a few days if i seem to be a little distant you know this is my first time south when i seem to have drawn myself almost into a shell im thinking hard how i may adapt myself to what appear to be extrme artificial conditions

i noticed that you were considerably absorbed with something when i touched you

uncle abbott i deem this an excellent opportuity to study our people my people at close range im eager to see if the negro in the south behaves as dunbar and chestnut depict him i have resolved not to let slip the occasion to know them for these are the people who gave me my existence among whom i must live whom i must help to get their heritage

boy i tell you youve got an old head on your shoulders this should not be considered unnatural reverend ross my pastor regularly preaches concerning racial relations in the united states as he talked one sunday morning i recalled my study of history and i could not bring to mind a single colored face that it contained upon going home i searched my histories from cover to cover not a negro varrior or statesman there i saw at once that we must write some books

probably youre too reflective the uncle interrupted no uncle some times i wonder whether i think enough you call me a boy grant that i am not a man in age my sufferings and sacrifices have made me a man in experience a negro child one year of age is older by far than a white child born at the same hour and by the time the white child is twentyfive the colored child is forty

theres much truth in what you say

here his uncle took his suit case and started off as they drove along william askt uncle abbot please explain to me this circumstance the colored people call the white mister and missis the whites call the colored uncle and aunt is this a mark of ignorance on the part of our people or of the white is it fear on the part of our people and arrogance of the white if the relationship is so close as to admit of uncle and aunt under any circumstance certainly the relationship is not onesided our people ought to return the compliment

william its this way you up north dont quite understand slavery has never been gotten out of the south before the war there were the mistress and master now the mistress has become missis and the master mister but the colored man has remained where he was if we started calling the white folks uncle and aunt the rebellion would have to be fought over again

uncle was smiths interruption we shouldnt like for that to be but this distinction must end we must be addressed as we are

in the south continued mr hey wood there are a few colored people called mister and missis by black and white alike this few however are wealthy

dont bother yourself about these matters at this time prepare for the happy moments you are to have with us then turning the conversation as much as possible he askt has your journey been pleasant

yes uncle just as pleasant as it could be under existing circumstances recalling those character forming events which bad veritably engulfed him at pilgrim tabernacle

but why do you say under the existing circumstances  inquired the devoted uncle has some recent occurrence saddened you

thereupon william related the details of the church reception he was very fervid and enthusiastic

we all are glad when there is even the slightest indication of approval put in the uncle

that was the greatest experience of my life remarked william who as he related the story lived again through the entire festivities the devotion of those generous souls irresistibly wove my career with the hopes of williamsburg they are my friends they believe in me and i in them this tie i know can not be severed by time i was happy there

such thots as these kept rising as i journeyed here im well aware when absent from a friend thats why i say as happy as circumstances permit 

well here we are at last exclaimed the southerner as he stopt his brown roadster in front of his resplendent cottage suggestive of the colonial style stepping from the buggy he called andy andy

a stalwart farm helper scortched by many suns hurried around the house approaching the vehicle he said yes sar yes saar right heah

give prince some water and then hitch up the carryall

i want you to get williams trunk you havent met my nephew have you the planter said

no saar

william this is mr jones my most reliable worker mr jones this is my nephew william smith

boy ise sure am proud to see yo mr heywood talkt so much about yo wed been terribly disappinted if yo hadnt came said andy bubbling over with joy

mr jones im really glad to meet you said the youth shaking the gentlemans hand vigorously

turning toward the planter andy declared mr heywood dat aint no boy atall dats a man i tell yo he sho did hurt my hand put him on my plantation and hell work the socks off all my folks he paused a moment and then said well i must be gone be good to yoself and nothing cant harm yo with these remarks mr jones hurried away

that afternoon as william sat on the porch indulging in many delightful reveries he noticed a green bungalow trimmed in white in front of which extended an incomparable lawn bordered with a stocky growth of hedge the summer chairs and benches scattered here and there and the tall oak tree standing guardian over all made a scene both unassuming and picturesque

from the oak was suspended a swing which was affording great joy to a girl of six on the porch sat the mother and two of her boys one eight the other ten happy was this industrous family whose members by sacrifice and toil had become the foremost negroes of that town such as there america desiresâenergetic folk and these were surely energetic

the father christopher loving was president of the union banking institution which did a prosperous business with both black and white he had risen to this distinction thru his plantation and his construction company the farm was handled by tenant fanners the construction company by his eldest son

having met all his relatives and gone over the farm to get an idea of the manner in which our people workt william turned to the house and sat on the porch he came there to read the life of alexander hamilton of african descent a great american statesman the scene across the street had been somewhat distractive this did not last long however for he was soon absorbed with that grand career

when he had been thus occupied for a half hour his attention was once more diverted he scrutinized mr lovings home again then he began to meditate comparing what was before him with other residences he had seen or imaged from his reading since this abode far surpassed the rest he asked himself if he were not beholding the eighth wonder of the world it was superb indeed a masterpiece of architecture and landscape gardening what loveliness the mother and children made the scene complete how happy they were

as the young man now mused on and on a rising noise caused him to look down the street there he saw a crowd of turbulent individuals men women boys and girls many of the children had just sprung from infancy the men however were in the majority with cursing and profanation they advanced in his direction down staten street one of the main thorofares of the town he beheld that a few were masked these alone had pistols approximately a score who followed them had rifles others had pieces of pipe or bars of iron the remainder carried staves sticks or ropes william divined at once that this was a mob

as these blood thirsty people approached their defamations continued they were not intelligible to william however at his distance he learned later their nature which was like this colored people who lived along the way were his busy informers

damn these niggers said one of the reprobates when they gits a little property theys bettern white folks think of a nigger refusing to lend a white man money thundered another

keep the nigger down he never was nothin he aint nothin and he never will be nothin how paradoxical their behavior was

we po devils have seen a nigger get rich while we stay po even after we saw to it dat dey didnt hab no schools remarked the first speaker

if we let dese niggers go on dis way deyll soon be running de govmint came from another

whiles were at it lets do a turnkey job clean up the neighborhood run all these niggers out of town dats got propety deys not de ones dat wuk fo yo no way many a remark of this kind was uttered by many an ignoble throat

when william informed the household of the disturbance there was general consternation they wondered what to do where to go they bustled about a few moments in great anxiety but returned to the place where they were before have mercy lord have mercy said one then followed groans mutterings and sighs

seeing nothing done to alleviate the matter the visitor askt is there no way to stop this but who are they after they must be very close now and they are headed this way

this utterance only increased the alarm cant we stop this he repeated

not at all said his aunt resignedly theres nothing to do but take it oh its so dreadful to have to live thus

its a disgrace to us and to the nation particularly to us to tolerate such outrages he spoke in great anger

youre from the north william you dont understand the south affirmed the aunt apparently trying to palliate the matter

if to suffer thus is necessary to understand it god give me ignorance no i dont understand i never will let me have a pistol or a rifle and let me take several men and break up that mob you told me scoundrels dont live on this street they are after some one who deserves to live even if it is a negro criminal they have no right to break the law theyre just a bunch of cowards a few brave men can end this give me a gun or a rifle he demanded

william we havent any andy was saying we ought to have them in selfdefense she remarked

well aunt julia i didnt think youd try to live down here where the lives and property of our people are not protected by the law without a good supply of fire arms and ample ammunition the honor of our women are not even safe here the constitution of the united states allows a man to defend himself in his home a mans home is his castle he protested

sam halloway had arms but the policemen went into his house and took them she said

auntie if anybody respects the law it is the colored man and this talk of the proportions of negro crime is all bosh as long as white men make these criminals read some of the studies in the race question made by even white men and if you read between the lines as well as the lines youll see that many planters want negro crimnals many of them get their wealth from negro convict labor such a system is profitable for them

the colored man respects the law but the law does not respect him he must now demand respect of the law how can he do this by being a man by stopping this business of turning the other cheek if the law will not protect him he must protect himself

he must grasp the situation no policeman is allowed even by the law to cross your treshhold and search for anything without a warrant besides that warrant should state exactly what he is searching for if you have been living respectably he has no business with a warrant to search for the means by which you defend your home you shouldnt take them out into the streets but you should use them anywhere on your premises in selfdefense and i shouldnt let any policeman have them

ive been interested in reading what has been done when authorities surmised that the colored people were going to defend themselves the policemen rush at once to disarm the blacks and let the whites keep their weapons as i know this theyll not get a weapon in my house unless im dead or dying

william calm yourself the aunt interrupted

auntie i mean it if i have lived as a man should live and a policeman came to my house id greet him courteously and seek his business there if he said he came to search for arms id ask for his warrant and read it carefully then id return him the paper and tell him i forbade the search for i must defend my home if he would rush in anyhow he would go out a dead man this is how i would act as a respectable citizen respectable negroes do not keep arsenals if i were a culprit id act differently im merely saying how the honest law abiding citizen of any race should act when the law fails to protect a man must protect himself

i hope somebody will do something said the aunt pitiably

well i see this is work for all our people to stop this humiliation he remarked now becoming calmer he thot of following the course of the mob and started for the front

william my boy pleaded the aunt dont go out there arent you afraid

satan himself couldnt frighten me now he said and left without more ado the others remained within thru accustomed cowardice and scare

william angrily stood on the porch and watched the mob at work the outlaws had stopt in front of his uncles house large numbers of them were on mr lovings premise as the mob comprised about a thousand the street and sidewalks were crowded for quite a distance smith had to resist the temptation of throwing a stone but he conquered himself upon deeming it only foolhardiness he wanted the persons leaning against his uncles trees to move but he held his peace

he saw a colored man of very stately mien already beaten unconscious dragged to the lawn he greatly admired the children had fled into the house mrs loving wanted to run too but thinking that someone dear to her was involved she stood upon the porch and faced the mob stolidly when she beheld the haggard face however her spirit was broken she shrieked and screamed my husband my poor husband spare my husband he has done no wrong well give you all we have but spare him my poor husband my poor husband

the limp man with wandering eyes sputtered out no dear i worked hard for mine theârascalsâshantâhaveâ oneâpenny

hereupon one outlaw slapped him in the face and shouted damn it shut up why should i worry hell be quiet very soon

chris chris called the wife forcing her way to her husband

several ruffians pushed her back yet she tried to reach him crying in the meanwhile dont kill him spare him ill give you whatever you wish

wed rather put him quietly to sleep someone answered

oh god prayed the devoted wife save my husband save him we have served thee always if ever i need thee my savior tis now

if you dont stop that damned hollering well get you first said one of the miscreants

take me she cried do but spare him

here john gag her and leave her until we finish this job commanded the mob leader

that day the children saw their father lynched in their own yard from their cherisht oak tree they saw his body suspended and riddled with bullets all because he would not make a loan to a white man of ill repute they saw women and children enjoying this debauchery as if it had been a theatrical show

the family was not even allowed the body dimpled boys and lithesome girls took parts of clothing as souvenirs and danced with ghoulish glee then excelsior was placed about the body and many staves were lit the flames quickly did their work and the spectacle was soon at an end

where were the officers when one of their foremost citizens was suffering this disgrace they were calmly looking on not attempting or daring not to oppose they even beheld photographers taking views of the scene views to be sold the next day as additional souvenirs there was abundant evidence for prosecutions but none were made the next day matters went on as if nothing disgraceful had occurred

what happens to people who lose their sense of shame they hasten to degeneracy america beware

william stood upon the porch thru the entire catastrophe several members of the mob lookt at him but that was all when they had finisht they straggled back whence they had come the stranger watched them until they faded out of view

looking across the street he saw the wife gagged and tied stretched upon the porch the little girl and boy were trying to relieve her william went at once to her assistance and freed her from her bonds she thanked him while she wept then suddenly she became stolid and wiped her eyes

this isnt the end of the sport true im a woman but a woman can die bravely as well as a man the devil must pay for this then recalling that she had never met her sympathizer she said pardon any untowardness on my part youll make due allowance for all unseemliness im the wife âi was the wifeâim the widow of the man you saw lynched âchristopher loving

william smith is my name im the nephew of mr heywood

he told me you were coming im more than glad to meet you edward my oldest son will be delighted to see you ill see that he meets you i thank you again for aiding me

madame i havent done anything the kind of assistance i wanted to render i could not just think there wasnt a rifle or pistol on the place i wonder if they dont even have a shot gun well i hope our folks will get busy and break this up but where is your son

hes directing a job about five or six miles from here but hell be in soon

madame you seem rather calm in view of this disturbance

my determination for vengeance makes me so the law of this state punishes murder by death im going to permit the state ample time to do its duty now that my husband is gone life means nothing to me if the state fails i will perform the execution id recognize the scoundrels even at night

but what of your children

benjamin lily she called for they had been standing in the hall this gentleman is our friend he is mr heywoods nephew they bashfully came forward and greeted him then the mother said have no fear they shall be provided for the main thing now is this i must not bear the insult alone those people who went from here do not feel that they have done wrong theyre rejoicing as if they had won a great battle some of them must feel as i have felt theyre going to be sorry for this

several hours after this william sat down to supper the signs of anxiety had not completely worn off yet they were doing rather well at readjustment during the course of the evening william askt uncle abbot are our people doing nothing at all to end this or to prevent its recurrence  it used to be that our men were lynched for rape but now they are lynched because they steal a hog or because they have acquired a little wealth im not satisfied with aunties answer

william began mr heywood we thot that if we lived right respected ourselves and the white people that lynching would pass away but we seem to have been wrong loving has been called by black and white alike the towns most honest man yet you see how honesty has been rewarded god in his own good time will make the matter right

but uncle abbot what are we going to do in our own time

just wait on the lord

heaven helps those who help themselves furthermore does the white man wait isnt the machinery even too slow for him inquired the nephew

well they do at times seem impatient things must happen for them rather quickly for intsance just the other day uncle parker as faithful a man as ever lived went to jenkins store to get some odds and ends while he was there young jenkins appearedânow a lad of twentythree

 hello jack said uncle parker ise sho am proud to see yo

the father took a block of wood and struck our poor brother such a hard blow on the head that he became unconscious ill teach you he said to address a white man properly thats not jack thats mr jack mr jenkins the next day with head bound uncle parker came back to the same store and said mr jenkins you know i nursed yo boy till he went off to skule an ise always called him jack i didnt realize that time done made a difference i  well said jenkins thats all right just see that it doesnt happen again

do these crimes continually occur without being punished askt william

yes they do and up in the country sometimes called the back woods many of the atrocities never reach the press

i dont know whats to become of us said mr heywood very deeply moved

uncle abbot affirmed william with unusual bitterness this day i consecrate my life to my people i have decided to enter the ministry but i shall not merely preach i shall work among all sorts of people only to bring protection and freedom to my race what i saw today will last me a life time for your sake i kept quiet today hereafter i respect nobodys feelings unless it is for the good of the race and humanity

one such loving is worth more than all the members of any mob yet the worthless live and the worthy die and pologize im sorry it happened it wont happen no more this is dixie

now smith was gone williamsburg knew it the sunday school mist him the church mist him and so did the community at large of those who had become fondly attached to this interesting personality none treasured him more than susan lee her father was one of the most accomplished men of the town whose efficiency was well known by virtue of his being president of the eureka shirt factory his daughters advancement was his great concern in order that she might impressively begin the battle of the sexes he spared no pain that her debut into elite society might be unexcelled nor did he in this prove a failure

susan now eighteen accomplished and attractive resembled an hawaiian beauty she was somewhat more than five and a half feet tall of excellent proportions firm and robust as she moved with stately grace one would particularly notice her wealth of black straight hair and her delicately brown complexion nature had endowed her well for even women who beheld her were entranced

many were her suitors but many she did not desire for her there was only oneâthe valorous william smith often she plaintively askt herself how is he to know this 

wait until he speaks came the answer

will men thus always be favored in such artificial societies as our ownâhave numerous excellent and superior chances of marrying while the women have but a few the woman wonders how long it will be before someone asks why should she wonder or wait for that which often never comes

within the brief few months that had passed since susan became a debutante many undesirables had long since askt but the hope of her anxious nights the pride of her noblest thot had not touched the exalted theme of love this was not a pleasant recolection

to prevent that mood lest she should be sad at any moment nature was doing its utmost to keep her well pleased rains not desired were kept in steady abeyance sultry stifling days somehow had dropped out of sight the leaves seemingly nourished with an extraordinary refreshment preserved their former hue untinged with crimson or autumnal brown hitherto at this season of the year many had already danced their dance of death and vanisht with a sigh but now they all made merry with the magic breeze whistling melodious symphonies

towards twilight the day following williams departure for the south as easily as a nymph susan stept upon the porch of her gothic home expecting company her cheeks were promptly kissed by a welcome breeze which seemed to say be composed my goddess somewhere a lovers true

she started to arrange the chairs then suddenly stopt to reflect here i am she mused with great social opportunities excellent home conditions luxury and coveted prerogatives yet what i desire most i fail to have my soud craves william will the longing of my aching heart be satisfied 

he and i have been casual friends at a distance for several years but our intimacy is just about two months old his occupation and my hesitancy have prevented a declaration he did say that he admired me he promist also to write but as we havent plighted troth im a prey to much uncertainty if i love him why may i not tell him so within a week instead of waiting for months of intimacy or even a year or years society considers such improper sometimes i wish i could give society a lecturing and then a genteel threshing

i may win him and yet i may not

so many couples are mismated that i blame society if women keep getting the wrong men something is wrong with the social order probably a revolution is needed some sacrafices the group may justly require but to deprive a woman of her love is often to court death well i hope to win and liive she sighed clasped her hands upon her breast and bowed her head then she let her hands drop and thrust her head back in despair a rustling of dresses caused her to turn and look her reverie had been interrupted come up girls she said welcoming thelma haskell catherine staples and letitia strausâall debutantes

quickly they greeted susan and seated themselves comfortably on the imposing porch happy to chat of the event at pilgrim tabernacle

before such a line of talk could begin however thelma interfered girls watch me she said is this the way all became uproariously absorbed in the perfect pantomine she was executing to portray susans recent emotion they laughed and clapped their hands after assuming the attitude of despair thelma said susan you reminded me of lady macbeth and the merchant of venice what was troubling you in sooth i know not why you are so sad it wearies me

thelma youre a regular old tease susan remarked enjoying the joke even tho she was the butt of it i have my serious moments sometimes impulsive ones just now i was obsest with both

but susan exclaimed catherine the daughter of the high school principal you were so dramatic

hereafter i must be sure that i am alone within my room when i give full vent to my feelings protested susan now somewhat flushed

dont you do it dont you do it urged letitia naughtily shaking her finger at her schoolmate dont you dare do it for the world it would be a shame to deprive us of the show

do be serious girls pleaded susan lets think of other things yet she knew she would return to thots of him tell me how you enjoyed the banquet

i know you enjoyed it was the prompt thrust of thelma you were afraid wed take him from you but we had to talk to him a little we couldnt help it could we girls

no was the quick response it was somewhat annoying to susan

you know he is so tantalizing isnt he ventured thelma playfully her friend was now completely disarmed dont blame us thelma continued we all have our ambitions for the noblest there is no sensible girl in this town who does not acknowledge him our best its a game to win be sure you play it well if he wants you why youre his if he wants me then i am his at present however were giving you the right of way the honor is all yours

aroused by this unusual demeanor of her friend susan said thelma i appreciate your frankness many girls never would have said that yet under cover they would have been doing their utmost to outdo me still i didnt think kate was more than passingly interested in william girls i am going to give you a little bit of information some time ago brother and i used to go together to socials thats impossible now because of a perpetual previous engagement with kate kate kate

now susan smiled catherine henry knows where he stands in my affections yet i may be interested in others and others interested in me do you think henrys admiration for me would go far if i couldnt arouse the commendation of his associates furthermore if no other girl desired him i shouldnt either iâi couldnt be jealous and whats the use of loving if you cant be jealous

aaah kate arent you ashamed of yourself im going to find henry and tell him what you said ejaculated letitia rushing from the porch

she hadnt gone far before she was overtaken no you wont gasped catherine holding her friend firmly youre going right back on the porch like a good little girl there were many outbursts of laughter

you know i shouldnt be so bold said letitia taking her seat

but i had to make sure remarked catherine now at ease should you have told how could i meet him after that

it would be difficult i know declared susan glad that the joke had fallen on someone else then turning the conversation she said now girls lets be serious were all interested in particular young men whom we hope to many im interested in william

interested they said with surprise youre wild about him

i was going to say crazy about him letitia declared as if nothing had occurred other than a common interruption susan smiled and went on kate dotes on henry letitia claims sinclair young and thelmaâthelma worships beckett king

thelma stared at susan as if in amazement laughed heartily and then said girls doesnt she put the case well she began to mimic her chum kate dotes on henry letitia claims sinclair i worship beckett and she is interested in william

the bantering now ran high all were quite happy after surviving the storm she had raised by her careful delineation of the les affaires d amours susan resumed what she had planned to say often girls are so very much afraid that one will take their beaux that they manage their own hearts troubles even without the advice of their parents and when the dear old people become aware of the situation the girl is either engaged or ready to announce her marriage on the other hand frequently for lack of advice they lose or choose improperly because of this since ours is an age of cooperationâso says reverend rossâi was thinking that we of the twentieth century should not be above advice even the advice of one another

i believe youre right susan said letitia consequently im willing to teach or learn

what do you think of the idea thelma inquired susan

you know im strictly modern was her terse reply

and you kate are you with us inquired letitia

yes she said and paused for better and for worse

then susan spoke again of course we always have the counsel of our parents but itll be excellent for us occasionally to have our own experience meetings what id like to know is this what should a girl do to keep first palce in the affections of a young man while he is away at school

merriment arose afresh isnt she interested said letitia

at this point a young woman and her escort passed by the ladys dress at once attracted their attention it was a pink georgette elaborately trimmed and draped what do you think of that askt catherine

for once let us not discuss dress thelma entreated

the girls agreed then catherine very eager to get her friends ideas on the question proposed by susan urged them to return to business i have a thot you might consider in many cases i do believe it helps if the young man in question is fondly attached to his mother tactfully court her as well as the son to win her is to gain half the battle and whether the relationship between mother and son is unusual or not to enter the mothers affection certainly makes the task easier

at last i understand you came from susan you sly fox kate youre not satisfied to win the mother youre courting the whole family i see now why you call frequently catherine blushed

you mustnt embarrass her susan letitia interrupted

i just have to be naughty sometimes if i had to be good all the time i suppose id soon die from congested emotion susan responded

well my suggestion spoke letitia with a somewhat staccato effect may be astounding but youre under no compulsion to follow it im perfectly willing to use kates sterling counsel but i couldnt make a supreme sacrifice and lose

i think it would kill me

knowing myself to have this temperament i have determined during sinclairs absence to enjoy myself with all the boys equallyâthat is the desirable ones this is my way of getting out of the dilemma having thus a great effection for sinclair and a slight interest in many boys i could lose sinclair and yet live

i see nothing shocking in that said thelma with great firmness i have known many girls who have staked all on one and lost then they became overwhelmed with a grief that caused poor health or death isnt my sister julia just such an example all absorbing and disappointing love this love all for one and one only may be romantic but its dangerous

besides said catherine your choice must be between many a few and none who of us would say refrain from the company of all young men during the absence of the lover if were to marry them we should first know them not just one but many to do this contact is necessary now is the time to learn thoroly

kate i think im forced to agree with you for if you have an exclusive few one will very likely be preferred said susan and probably develop the strong possibilities of a rival whether this is true or not the public will soon single out a specially favored one and conclude that the absent friend has been superseded before long some officious person will be writing your beau that he hasnt a ghost of a chance

yes remarked letitia some people are very meddlesome i too think it better to be about equally interested in all here with a supreme affection for the one absent

one circumstance however we should not forget for it is the staff of parted loversâits correspondence thelma declared of course all lovers write to each other yet judging by what ive read i can not believe that theyre aware of its significance we can not make too much of this

a few years can make a mountain of difference between us during that time we should not let the boys get ahead of us as they grow we should grow they go away boys but come back men

do you remember wrights the shepherd of the hills

of course we do they replied and began at once to discuss different parts of it that they liked best

as soon as she got the chance thelma continued where she left off you recall then that ollie stewart who had been early betrothed to sammy lane changed so much in the few years he was absent that she could not marry him the qualities that led her to love him were no longer there this is human nature

what we must do is to discover thru frequent correspondence our lovers new outlook on life as it comes then we must go to the library get some books and read along that line we must do more we must think along that line with thinking people at length when our young man comes from school with his new ideas to us at least they will be old familiar friends

bravo exclaimed susan has socrates come back again 

i hope you understand what i mean she continued not at all flattered so long as the natures of the young man and young woman blend in ideals the marriage is likely to be a possibility if it does occur it will very likely be a happy one it is because girls have neglected this fact that very few early sweethearts marry that men as a rule marry not the home girls but girls where they pursue their life work âat least where they begin it

but if we write frequently inquired susan may we not be too forward mamma says we should write occasionally and be patient and wait here she recalled the ideas that ran thru her mind just before her friends appeared

my answer is this was thelmas impatient utterance if the mother is to marry the man let her do what she wishes when the time comes for me to marry however and i see the man i want i do not promise to wait wait wait for him to choose someone else ill make the fight of my life to get him therell be no escape if i lose i shall certainly have the satisfaction of having made a good fight

how will you fight susan inquired

dont you know said thelma ill use all the arts of woman and my own distinct accomplishments ill make a study of winning mens hearts and proceed accordingly

thus the girls went on until it was quite late

when susan retired to her boudoir that evening she brot before her all that had been said how could she win she had seen the man and certainly she loved him should she follow her mothers advice or thelmas unquestionably she would write but should she risk all by making a disclosure and then launching the fight of her life or should she wait striving in the meanwhile by tact to force a declaration from him

susan susan her mother called

then the tender maiden askt herself what did milton say  they also serve who only stand and wait 

we are in a world of changes and to be perfect is to change and that person is most perfect who changes most oftenânewman

as very few of the members of my race have had a chance to attend a first class college or universitythey can not understand how those who come from such institutions do not take the same attitude towards the church and religion as they did before they went away these brave boys and girls have fought strenuously day after day in sadness trying to keep the old beliefs the trouble is this almost every professor in these schools put such ideas aside long ago even the ministers who come to them do not hold such

these facts our people should know for our present religious views may be making our economic freedom impossible for once we come to know the difference between our religion and that of our white brother and the significance of each we shall become more united in our struggle in this country to get all that becomes a man

sometimes an historian presents facts that we dislike it is not his business to tickle his fancy nor our own he should tell the truth in this spirit i relate the events which worked signal changes in the religious views of william smith this chapter is not mere fiction every incident related herein actually did occur do not think williams experience exceptional it is typical i am relating the experience of the college man and the college woman reader perhaps you will find it shocking but these experiences have been none the less shocking to those who had them

three years at henderson college the pride of the north had produced the college seerâas he was calledâthe lad who in glory had left williamsburg to find a broader glory in the exalted affections of the best sons america had produced this school which could claim as its graduates some of our best poets and novelists at least one of the presidents of our great land could not help rejoicing at the career of william smith who excelled in all his endeavors peerless on the gridiron in class and in debate who was this powerful son of africa was he the promist emancipator of his race or should we look for another

one thing was certain he was black about this there could be no mistake was his complexion a handicap color is almost invariably the curse of the colored man his unpardonable sin is being black if colored and white show equal fitness for a task who is taken who is left even at times when the negro has arrived at eligibility for the captaincy of an athletic team even tho he was the honor man who has been given the distinction ask some of our all american men

there are however many noble white people and there will be some as long as the world endures these are intelligent peopleâstaunch and generous lovers of humanity with them a man is a man they have no time for prejudice for prejudice is characteristic of ignorant folk their lives reveal this lofty ambition fair play and may the best man win this motto fundamentally democratic the favored utterance of general joshua chamberlain had became the spirit of this institution here was a place where merit and not color courage and not color perseverance and not color decided the fates of men

the negro who wanted as his summon bonum a jug of molasses forty acres and a mule was not the one who came to that great institution of learning besides that negro with such ambition is not typical of this stalwart race which has suffered most to make america regardless of innumerable closed doors despite forbidden opportunity notwithstanding peonage and gross humiliation the typical negro today is not a prodigal pampered by the indulgence of a doting father not a profligate dedicated to saturnalias but a man an exploited man a lily in a pool of slime he asks no favors he seeks only an open field and a fair fight

with this spirit william entered henderson college in this enlightened environment while his alma mater shaped him to her will he brot her proud distinction as he came to his senior year he realized that he had a new attitude towards life how different things must be from what he had supposed who was right the theologian the poet the scientist or the philosopher or did each have but a glimpse of the truth for quite a while william perused several passages from tennyson and a sonnet from rossetti the passages follow flower in the crannied wall i pluck you out of the crannies i hold you here root and all in my hand little flowerâbut if i could understand what you are root and all and all in all i should know what god and man isâtennyson we have but faith we cannot know for knowledge is of things we seeâibid

think thou and act tomorrow thou shalt die outstretched in the suns warmth upon the shore

thou sayst mans measured path is all gone oer up all his years steeply with strain and sigh man clomb until he touched the truth and i even i am he whom it was destined for

how should this be art thou then so much more than they who sowed that thou shouldst reap there nay come up hither from this wavewashed mound unto the furthest floodbrim look with me then reach on with thy thought till it be drownd

miles and miles distant though the last line be and though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyondâ still leagues beyond those leagues there is more seaârossetti these passages and many like them william studied carefully trying to arrive at the truth

william reasoned somewhat thus are these passages false or true is the preacher right and everyone else wrong does each profession but get its portion of the truth the preacher says the world is six thousand years old the scientist gives the age of the world as being millions of years the preacher says the world was made in six days the scientist says it was millions of years in the making and that creation has never ceased the preacher says adam was the first man but science says that even egypt had men before adam that adam is a creation of babylonian mythology

to get these ideas in his sociology was very disconcerting for william had been reared in an orthodox church accordingly his religious views were strictly conservative and dogmatic he had been taught for years that the bible was a perfect book a flawless revelation of god the bible was the whole truthâtelling all that had been and was to be persons disbelieving the infallibility of the bible or rejecting christ as the son of god he was convinced could not be saved

now that he found himself instructed by individuals who did not hold these dogmas but believed in god and the bible in a different way what was to become of them where was he to find an anchorage these people were not scoundrels but some of the noblest people he had ever met not satisfied with contact in class to thresh out these soul problems at close range he called upon his professors in physics biology sociology and philosophy for conferences they encouraged his inquiry and suggested to him many books for further reading as these were assuredly admirable men ready to instruct or advise strenuous workers to uplift humanity he could not persuade himself that these men would be forever lost

one day while he was in the class in ethics a question arose concerning punishment soon the discussion turned on an appraisement of everlasting punishment almost as soon as it began one student askt if punishment by hell fire was just

lets work it out the professor said is it lawful for a mother for any offense her child might commit to throw it into fire even for a moment

its certainly wrong the student replied

is it just then for god to burn his children not for a day a week or a year but forever the professor askt

the two acts are identical yet i thot god could do as he pleased said the student

so he can the professor admitted but is it just which is the superior being which would you expect to be the nobler god or man if man burns his child he is a criminal is god different if he burns his if man will refrain from such punishment and try to reform his child will not god do the same

is there such a thing as hell fire any way another pupil inquired

i dont see how it can be possible the professor calmly responded if there is such it can not bum souls for these are spiritual

professor young remarked the student who began the discussion i think the trouble is this our ministers by trying to carry us back to the middle ages when the church burned and tortured because god so some said would torture in medieval history i learned that the bible was written centuries ago with no thot of us in mind at all and now we have outgrown much of its morality we must write our own bibles and construct our own morality and so must every age no previous age can do it for us

then what are we going to do with this bible askt smith

reinterpret it in light of present day thot as it is exprest in all branches of knowledge the professor replied there is enough good in the bible to inspire the noblest in any man accept the good reject the bad

but we have been taught that all is good william declared that nothing is to be added and nothing to be taken away that god is the same today yesterday and forever

to reinterpret is not to take away nor to add you merely reevaluate what is there besides the bible does contain such statements as you mentioned remarked the venerable instructor as to whether god changes or not that is a point we might reconsider if you conceive of god as being the universe you are immediately aware of many changes various species come and go creation really has never ceased even if you conceive of god as personality you must admit changes for sometimes god is calm sometimes angry and sometimes jealous these are changes of moods if you think of god as a spirit he changes with the spirit of the people who worship him with the warlike jews he was terrible in his acts one who never lost a battle a mighty god of war with civilized people he is not a god of war but loveâthe prince of peace

but professor inquired william im planning to prepare for the ministry can i preach what we have discust to the people would i not be called an infidel and my career as a minister finisht with its beginning

smith im glad you askt that question the professor replied i hope my answer will help you

it is the duty of every minister to preach the truth not only the truth in the bible but the truth in nature in manâ in brief anywhere it is to be found only the truth makes a man free ministers have too long condemned such men as voltaire rousseau paine and ingersoll these intellectuals have not contended that they were right and everyone else wrong they have merely called the attention of the ministers and of the world in general to the fact that there was some truth that some persons had neglected and they have rendered a valuable service to our age and all subsequent ones by reminding us that this other side of the truth should get a hearing

no one has a monopoly of truth let the ministers in their sunday schools consider the bible and also what these men have to say about it the church will always be behind the schools if it will not permit both sides of the truth to be aired at its meetings especially in the sabbath schools under no circumstances should it shirk this responsibility

the minister necessarily mut proceed with tact but the minister must tell the truth even if it costs him his pulpit you can minister to the needs of man even out of the pulpit a man of your resourcefulness need have no fear of making a living the world doesnt need men absorbed with the idea of making a living it wants men absorbed with a determination to tell the truth no matter what the outcome do your duty

professor young of reverent memory certainly won many disciples that day the boys reluctantly left him at the toll of the bell to attend their next recitation as william reflected upon what had occurred he knew that he was changing rapidlyâhe saw life anew

was it good for him to change he could not answer knowledge was sweeping him on and he could not stop it

he went about his studies now with even greater zeal he read many more texts on sociology anthropology religion and the negro among which were the writings of wallis spencer boas von luschan chamberlain ripley sergi h h johnston finot ripley william wells brown and george williams since he was going to work chiefly among black people why shouldnt he try to know them well very little was said concerning them in the american histories he read which could be regarded as an inspiration to the colored youth accordingly he plunged into source material documents and periodicals contemporaneous with slavery

in his study of sociology he became particularly interested in this discovery namely that there are no pure races greeks romans jews germans frenchmen hottentots kaffirs in brief all races have been formed by intermarriage and miscegenation yet in the south many politicians  ride into congress on negrophobia they say keep the white race pure they have laws forbidding the intermarriage of the races yet they are permitting amalgamation to take place faster in the south than in any section of the country what valuable information this was for him  why should it be presumed that america today has the finest men that time can produce  has progress ceased 

we should not be doing justice to williams intellectual and spiritual growth should we omit a talk he heard one sunday afternoon in chapel and an address he heard under the auspices of the college y m c a it was the custom to have at henderson college the foremost ministers of the nation to stimulate the religious life of the youth to hear these men would force one to conclude the old order changeth giving place to new and god fulfils himself in many ways on a bright sunday afternoon a distinguished minister from milwaukee in addressing the students in college chapel made the following statement i dont care whether you have ever gone to church or not i dont care whether you will ever go to church or not that is a matter of slight importance i do care however as to what you resolve to do with all your being if you have been a liar a murderer or a thief if you have been the meanest man that ever lived but have formed unshakable determination henceforth to help uplift your fellowman to give him a drink of water when he is thirsty a crust of bread when he is hungry to give him shelter when he is houseless you are bound to become good in the process if you neglect doing this but go to church you can not see the kingdom of god

on the other hand if you pursue this course with all your soul though you never go to church you will live daily with god

yet i would have you to go to church and become active members the church represents organized religion and you know that organization accomplishes more than spasmodic efforts i want you to join the church not because of fear of god but because you love him because you love your fellowman you can do good out of the church but the largest amount of spiritual renewal can be accomplisht thru the church which is a specialist in this activity and this is an age of specialization

william reflected long on the entire discourse did every minister talk like that  what of being justified by faith  was it a noble life like christs that would save men from themselves 

another minister of liberal disposition a preacher and scholar of great repute was requested by the president of henderson to address the students in the y m c a auditorium on the ministry as a life work this was one of a series of talks business law medicine and music had already been discussed as vocations now came the christian ministry that evening an enthusiastic group of budding leaders was thrilled by the eloquence of this eminent divine during the course of his remarks he made a significant utterance which caused smith to be rapt with wonder the speaker said young men ministers frequently mystify and terrify men with declamations of heaven and hell we get caught up in the spirit and say these things when we come to reflect we feel that probably we do wrong to make such an appeal for after all we do not know whether there is a hell of torture and a heaven of golden streets in our saner moods we regard them as being figures of speech to describe the extremes of joy and bitterness that we experience here within you is the kingdom of heaven or of hell

i avoid making appeals from hell fire as also do my colleagues inspired by christs personality i anchor upon this statement of his i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also i do not know its nature hence i dare not try to describe it this is a matter about which the minister needs to be very particular ill tell you why when the members speak of hell they mean one thing when the minister speaks of hell he means something elseâ wasted opportunity unsatisfied desire lack of comfort extreme poverty or the like

another difficulty you will experience in the ministry will be with reference to your conception of god if you speak of god as actually having eyes hands and feet you deprive him of one of his chief attributesâomnipresence the conception of god as spirit is the more logical we bow and kneel to this existence as if he were far away yet the attribute of omnipresence has him always with all men our problem is to make the people conscious of his uninterrupted presence

after hearing this talk william askt himself what he should do should he enter the theological school or choose some other calling he had promist pilgrim tabernacle that he would enter the ministry at least he had said he would and his word was a promise the church of his youth those devoted friends whose means were constantly coming to henderson to help him continue to be a manâthese people had kept their promise should he not keep his it was difficult not to do so

his friends expected him to return home as the same william smith that had gone away how impossible how could he be unaltered could a man see a fellow being who was innocent lynched in his own yard before wife and children and be unchanged could he hear that wife pray and see her petition unanswered without questioning his faith could a man be impervious to the teachings of such men as professor young and the great divines that visited henderson college could he be unimprest by these individuals of international repute impossible william was born again and he knew it at this cosmopolitan institution he had had many rebirths

will the people understand he askt himself will they regard me as an impostor i have been sincere in all that i did there and i am just as sincere now moreover i shall be sincere in all i do when i return but i cant proceed exactly as i did formerly of what service would my college training be if i did

is it for this that parents send their sons to college do they want us to get such ideas as i possess many of which are diametrically opposed to those by which they have lived certainly they send us here to change to be different to reject the false and grasp the true to abandon ignorance and superstition and become amenable to all that the college or university thinks will make a liberal and noble man

professor young says you can be a minister even out of the pulpit no matter what the outcome do your duty this may be the kind ill have to become anyhow i know now what to do i said id prepare for the ministry so to the theological school i will go

with great distinction and impressionableness as one of the most scholarly and forceful characters that ever finisht at excelsior theological seminary the reverend william smith was called to pastor sinai shrine at seaton a little town eightyfive miles from williamsburg thus he was not entirely disassociated from his pilgrim friends he would meet them in conventions he could preach for them occasionally and often make a flying trip to attend social events or make more secure expectant ties of love

the beginning was fascinating should it not rather be so should hurricanes with ruin rampant give us battle at the start sometimes it is thus sometimes the turmoil arises with our birth to be our constant companion in life and in death we prefer however the calm and serene if this we may have we are willing to accept all else if such a gift is too costly a boon we will get it some day anyhow

how william rejoiced that he was again useful he was shaping for the better many who had never seen the light in commencing his great effort he knew that he had to hold himself in leash for his congregation tho ambitious to be called progressive was not quite ready to accept all the progress at their young pastors disposal there remained with him however this decision since no matter where i go i shall find the hosts of my people conservative in religion no larger peril awaits me here than elsewhere therefore i am resolved i will not sacrifice my personality tho the whole universe condemn me i will not temporize i will not truckle i will be myself and speak my thots the world has nothing to give me commensurate with my manhood i will suffer or grieve i will laugh or rejoice and i will be a man

altho the reverend mr smith entered upon his pastorate just after leaving excelsior theological seminary he had been granted as a special token of esteem six weeks for a vacation what better use could he make of this boon than to supplement his agricultural knowledge with a course at cornell university he had had years of practical farming if during the summers by attending school and by study thru correspondence at leisure moments he could equal his rich experience with the best theory the world could afford he would make of seatonâa rather unpromising rural communityâa great commercial center accustomed to see all things thru he did not relax until he had become master of the art

the former pastor of sinai shrine to a great extent had lived away from his flock the esprit de corps had been that the minister was to be fine appearing to call on the members occasionally for a social chat to marry the lovelorn pray for the sick and dead and preach rousing sermons such had been reverend mc cauleys ministry his successor however did not follow the predestined course he strove to promote a kindlier fellowship and touch all lives for greater usefulness

accordingly on mondayâalwaysâand often during the week he was clad in overalls busy among the farmers showing them improved methods whereby they might obtain larger and better yields seaton was peculiarly blest by his presence

one year past happily william had won a permanent place in the hearts of many of the fellow townsmen he attended to his own business he was always launching something new which strengthened the community life

because of these endeavors and of the great commendation which spread abroad the state lookt toward seaton and then set its pace the adjoining states were also followers on account of this recognition who but reverend william smith should make the address on church extension at pilgrim tabernacle his home church in behalf of the tristate convention he was chosen without a dissenting vote

when the fall came on with its glory emphasizing the approach and departure of all things the convention assembled on the appointed day three hundred strong and set a record by its rapid yet thoro dispatch of its business the delegates were highly satisfied with what had been done when they came to the last day of the session

that morning the reverend mr smith arose to speak glad were the faces anxious the hearts on this great occasion a product of pilgrim the pride of pilgrim was to have on the program the place of honor most of the members old and young who had half willingly and half reluctantly permitted their fond associates to leave them were again cheering and welcoming him to othes victories the opportunity had come

dear christian friends and fellow citizens he began easily but firmly i am fully aware of the distinction you bestow upon me this is a great occasion demanding great utterances whether i am equal to your expectations i leave you to judge but i thank you for your favor accept the task and render an account of my stewardship

the european nations are engaged in a great struggle striving thru blood and brains to make it impossible for any group of people to be goverened without their consent and participation in the government this is a basic law of all democracy consequently i wonder why almighty god permits america a land dedicated to the principle that all men are created equal to look silently on can she permit the great issue to be solved without taking part if i correctly read the signs of the times america will decide the day there was great applause

these people are fighting for liberty can this priceless boon be gained in other ways probably but how has it been gained how did the english gain it tho they were not so passionate as other powers someone had to shed comely blood i am thinking particularly of the rise of the protectorate under oliver cromwell what caused the passing of the old regime and the establishment of the french republic was it not the shedding of blood how awful is this truth someone had sinned and atonement was long due at last the purging came countless lives were laid upon the altar of freedom woful day yet this has been the history of all nations without the shedding of blood there could be no remission of sin there followed a grave silence

god has spoken who will combat his word is the shedding of blood for the remission of sins an eternal law  is this the only way  will man never cease to oppress his fellow man till he has poured out his precious blood must there always be civil wars rebellions riots strikes and barbarous conquests why have throbbing intellects if we will not think why have hearts if we will not love why should rigth be establisht only by the arbitriment of arms o father when thou hast advised us to attain all grandeur not by might nor by power but by thy spirit

i am thinking of my people the climbing black folk of america opprest for centuries and throttled even now in the south we may accumulate but not enjoy in the north we may enjoy but not accumulate who are responsible for this calamity friends both black and white since the white people however are in the majority and have had more centuries of favorable environment theirs is the greater sin they have sinned in not requiring the education of the south we know the south has some excellent universities but the masses of the people remain unlearned

the summer i went south to visit my uncle and stopt at other points i met hundreds of young white men unable to read and write moreover there seems to be a desire on the part of some to encourage this condition for tho there are illiteracy tests for voters the whites are not required to pass them since the south furthermore is agricultural and the masses of the people live on the farms where schools operate only for a few months what else can exist other than bitter prejudices expressing itself to the disgrace of our glorious nation in jim crowism and lawlessness if as we believe prejudice is a gift of little minds whenever you meet an educated man you meet a man without prejudice

our sin has been not to demand our rights even if to demand were to die can the exalted utterance of patrick henry give me liberty or give me death if lived by us as it was by our forefathers bring other than one of these two liberty or death even for us there probably may be no remission of sin without the shedding of blood

the utterance of eloquent miss nannie burroughs the sage of washington d câweve fought every races battles but our own must cease to be true greeks romans jews germans spaniards english and others have fought their own battles shall we of all peoples forgetting the spirit of our ancestors wait for others to fight ours god permit no such shame to come upon us let us struggle ever and cry out with might tho we may be the dying voice of an immortal cause a voice crying in a wilderness

there is too much to do to remain silent and inactive why have we delayed  is it not because we have been waiting on god and god has been waiting on us we have been admonished since the dawn of slavery on these shores first seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you here is the thot preacht thru the centuries which with other conditions has made us a contented people it has caused the masses of us to say with religious fervor you may have all this world but give me jesus true we have jesus and the white people have the world who is the happier

friends i want you only to face facts have we not first sought the kingdom of god and his righteousness i believe we have a few observations which you can parallel in almost any city will suffice to prove this many districts in washington d c have five and six churches within a radius of ten blocks within an area of half a square mile in saint louis i counted eighteen churches this congestion is characteristic of our people we have more churches than the white people tho they are more numerous than we are our schools and business institutions thus multitudinous if our people had been directed to put about onethird of their energy into business our nation would be quite different this is our departure for church extension not to expand by numbers of edifices but by influencing many activities far better would it be to have a few first class churches than swarms of second class ones

the attitude of some pastors prevent this i heard one in a neighboring state say that the members of a colored church must always have something to do who would contradict him  all christians white and black must have something to do why should the church ever stop while the world moves on what was this pastor to have his members do anyway he said our church is paid for if i dont put these folks to work theyll soon be fighting me so im going to have them build a new church in this instance the members did not fill the existing substantial edifice yet they must have a larger and newer church this man assumed that the only thing christians could do was to build churches with mortgages out of the way with an inspiring group following him tho a large opportunity had come to remould the lives of his people thru careful and regular pastoral endeavors to lead them into new enterprises of moment he did not see the kingdom of heaven was at hand and that he was to lead his people in

let us not err in this direction we can have too many church edifices but we can not have too many ministers not every minister need pastor a church let him pastor the people a minister does not exert his greatest force in the pulpit he is most influential in making his word flesh to dwell among the people

our numerous and excessive churches and our unparalleled devotion to them certainly show that we have first sought the kingdom of god and its righteousness does not the world call us a distinctly religious people what other race offers the other side of his face when slapt the meek shall inherit the earth do the meek inherit it have they ever inherited it will they now god knows we are meek we have first sought the kingdom of god now have these other things been added unto us what things joy protection  equal opportunity life there have been added discrimination segregation jim crowism and lynching

is the god of those who oppress us our god  pray to remove these abominations do you get an answer they tell us god will answer in his own good time why not in ours that we may enjoy the good fortune

the attitude of two great men may help us take a proper stand the lamented gregory willis hayes president emeritus of virginia theological seminary and college used to say first go into your secret closet and pray pray as if it all depended on god then come out and work work as tho it all depended on you the other celebrity sir rabindranath tagore says when gods fail to help their sons men must come to their assistance has the time come when we should consider the suggestions of these men or must we wait longer must the negro not look more and more to himself for the activities and comforts he deserves and desires what else did cicero mean when he said every period of life is burdensome to those who have not within themselves the resources for a virtuous and happy life on the other hand nothing that the necessity of nature brings to pass can be a hardship to those who seek all good things from their own ability if the kingdom of heaven is within you if god is everywhereâand hence within youâthen within ourselves should we look for all we may do or become i believe that the idea couched in the words of these philosophers is true not only for individuals but also for sexes races and nations we do not know the will of god and probably can never know it it is hardly worth while trying to find it out we can guess it and work out what we think it is by studying the bible but some of his will is yet to be exprest by those who live now and others that shall live we do know however the desires of our own hearts to have the rights of man let god continue to inspire us but let us not err in thinking that service to god does not mean service to man recently i heard an orator say god shall fight our battles for us patrick henry said the same but he took good pains to urge the patriots to take arms in their defense i still have in mind the utterances of the celebrities god is not going to fight our battles he has his own to wage our thots are not his thots our ways are not his ways hence our battles commonly are not his battles why did christ say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me if god would forsake his only begotten son in the crucial hour is he not likely to forsake us who are less worthy friends the fight is on the conflict is ours to win or lose god will inspire us but after all man will be saved or ruined by man

in view of this realization what is the mission of the church  it is to see that the other things shall be added unto us does this mean that the church is to become a participant in politics to the detriment of religion must the church become the field of worldly disputes and subtle malice it must not yet it should not remain within four walls it ought to expand it should preach that christ came not that we might have death political or otherwise but that we might have life and have it more abundantly it must promulgate that religion is not a one day affair but a matter of every day of the week that religion is not separable from business politics law medicine or any pursuit that religion is life hence i contend that no person is a christian who fails to live the life of christ it is not so much a believing as a living

we are to live the life of mutual helpfulness of being our brothers keeper we must not sin nor must we permit our white brothers to sin a glance at our condition arouses amazement if our white brothers are religious then we are not if we are religious they are not we must become like them or they like us the difference must pass away

the problem of church extension therefore is upon us since the world says that we live the exemplary life we have much to teach our white neighbor how can we do this while we meet him so seldom we must meet him more that he may learn of us and we of him what shall we say declare that god is no respector of persons that christianity is not segregation of races in any way but the universal brotherhood of man

this idea of interdependence of all races and all nations must pervade the world the united states included since we are by choice or otherwise an asylum for weary peoples j tendering them the torch of liberty no one group has made j this nation what it is all have had a share is this a matter j to be spurned now when the world is in a death grapple i agonizing to bring men together shall we by supineness quiescence and cowardly submission retard the victory by i clannishness by living unto ourselves by developing within the  land a distinct civilization not unless the white people make i us do so we shall be only so mean as they force us to be desperadoes here and there unscrupulous profiteers myopic and biased schoolmen would lay this weight upon us they have establisht ghettoes for little chinas little italies little africas and the like and we unprotesting silent and docile accept the slander god forbid

the honorable mr roosevelt seeing that this attitude is developing a national disunity has with his accustomed farsightedness begun to call for a manifestation of pure americanism he believes that the germanamerican alliance is establishing a little germany creating a propaganda which will make the burden of the united states extraordinarily heavy should we be drawn into the war accordingly he is the apostle of one hundred per cent americanismâno hyphen no this or that no qualification whatever but simply americans if any group of people deserve to be called one hundred per cent americans it is our colored men the applause was vigorous the delegates carefully followed every utterance some have called us negroes but we are not he continued so much white blood was mixt with ours during the two hundred fifty years of slavery and continues to be illegally mingling in the south that the negro among us is to be found only after years of patient search so few there are some have called us afroamericans reminding us of our african descent this however is not the only source of our existence many of my brethren have in their veins some of the proudest blood of anglosaxons french and germans this is a matter of triviality i grant that some other land was the abode of our fathers but we were born in america thus we are americans nothing else

since the federal constitution vouchsafes to those born upon these shores the full rights of citizenship our due is all that this land affords during our sojourn and here we shall abide forever

some say however that we must have patience that we must be longsuffering great heavens what do men expect all tolerance from the colored but none whatever from the white who have been more patient than we who upon this continent have suffered longer those advocating long suffering say wait a crisis will come and we shall reap its joys in every crisis of american history they urge we have been benefited yes we always get the crumbs which fall from the table why not like other folks for instance the suffragists produce a crisis and receive the first fruits of them that slept

some are afraid others are indifferent and still others are ignorant if our people were alert to their opportunities why would they permit an organization like the national association for the advancement of colored people to struggle for existence why is not every adult black man a contributor to its weal this society as it stands for upholding the constitution of the united states without equivocation contending for a democracy not on paper but in the lives of men is the most patriotic society in america a friend tells another friend his faults and tries to help him amend them such is the business of this group of individuals it is the one organization in which all americans should enroll black and white alike it is not a theory but the greatest example of this concretion of thot ever witnessed by the eyes of man as we might expect it appeals for a democracy which begins at home and spreads abroad the idea is tangibly demonstrated here black and white love and think together here there is no color line

when i recall the accomplishment of this society when i think of the sacrifice of christ when i see that europe is fighting for our ideals i wonder why we say no more than we do about the brutish malice the degenerate littleness which is doing its utmost to foster here a separate civilization separate ideals separate ambitions but mutual hates has lincoln labored and died in vain must there be another war of the rebellion we hope not we cry union and liberty now and forever one and inseparable one language one country one flag at the same time the hosts of the nation by oppression or quiescence are doing all they can to split the country pray god that this shall never be

our ancestors came to this country accompanied by white men we have gone with them shoulder to shoulder from bunker hill to the north pole after all these years of comradeship shall they leave us now shall we leave them we shall ever march together for our language is their language our country their country our flag their flag at this moment william had his audience thoroly within his grasp he had taken the convention by storm

since our white brother has retarded the progress of the nation he continued by finding time to be prejudiced god almighty calls us by the good in our hearts and in those that scorn us by the thunder and by the lightning to demand universal brotherhood tho white favors white we must favor only merit truth and right we must preach the end of segregating movements when wars are upon us black and white die together when peace comes why can they not live together

think of separate schools for a group of people in a democracy what a paradox democracy means mixed schools with mixed faculties why are we blind to the fruits of this the stratification of society schools for the rich and schools for the poor but not american schools it has been the hope of our greatest men that the college and university would be purely democratic somehow these institutions in unmistakable numbers have either been unaware of these hopes or as a matter of course ignored them what college or university in addresses and leadership has made it positively clear to the students that such was expected the matter is left entirely with the students these promising young men and women are not interferred with in their racial antipathies they bring them to the schools and carry them away as they came or accentuated by biased professors these are scholars who set out to prove a contention and prove it of course some men can prove anything thus the hope of democracy is crusht

since this is so let us never ask for separate schools let us enter these strongholds and by character and scholarship show our selves the equal of all people if the cleft school must come let it be forced upon us for it tends to increase racial separateness and thus undermine our government how can there be a democracy based on color rather than upon the inequality of merit the ideal is the mixt school why run from a goal we have reacht with hope of returning to it some day why not use the ideal while we have it we can not deny that the masses of our educated people if they had been dependent upon mixt schools would still be illiterate the fact still remains however that a democratic government should have democratic schools if it is to continue as such aristocratic schools perpetuate aristocratic government with a hope that democracy will never rise so the church should contend

a further activity needing church help is politics the scriptures say that the powers that be are ordained of god the corruption which exists with many of them however almost persuades us that they were ordained of hell as soon as they find the colored man about to get an important office they arrange a gerrymander or get a new charter and thereby shut him out if proportional representation were in vogue âthe form which is certainly democraticâwe should have in the united states senate at least four members and thirtysix in the house of representatives this is just an inkling of the injustice we bear what hosts we should have in the state and city assemblies

this condition is a concomitant of any policy of racial separateness i shall mention but one example in several states i have visited around election time i have observed signs to this effect the republican club the democratic club the negro republican club the negro democratic club only white people attend the republican club and the democratic club the colored people attend something else may these jim crow organizations die forever the fatlings of plutocracy the corrupters of the public weal if white and black worked together in politics in all their meetings corruption would pass with the night god open the eyes of the whites to this some day

another work the church may well perform is to spread good tidings intelligence to all people consider how onesided has been our life i touch upon the press newspapers edited by colored men circulate freely only among colored people newspapers edited by white men circulate freely among both black and white the consequence is easily discerned we know the whites much better than they know us with the additional advantage of knowing ourselves we know how mean they are and how good they are we are aware of their basest and their noblest thots most white people take the colored man for a joke they believe us all minstrels ready always for a jig a slice of watermelon or to bow and scrape the black man who never laughs the one who is always serious this type they do not know equally ignorant are they of what we think of them what we think of ourselves and what we think of life our points of view as exprest in newspapers magazines and books of our men commonly do not reach them

papers of all groups should have a wide reciprocity especially those of a group that is circumscribed a democracy can not afford to be ignorant of the ideals of any of its groups for ignorance keeps people apart intelligence brings them together

preach the gospel to all people but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel begin with those about us our white brothers if they will not hear if they will keep up the bars if they reject the brotherhood of manâto live in a realm of equal opportunity for allâlike other nations that rose on the enslavement of man political and otherwise america too will fall keep off this doom preach that out of one blood god made all peoples that dwell upon the face of the earth that we are not enemies but brothers in sacrifice love and honor

bring to their minds incidents like this which i am about to relate an east indian who might have been regarded as the twin brother of a boy in the sumner high school of saint louis matriculated at a university located in this town yet the sumner boy of the same build with the same complexion and bewitching hair whose fathers suffered and died that this nation might be free must keep without he would not even be accepted as one of its janitors those who gave their lives that their country might be free surely have died in vain since they who have not suffered and bled for the union are more highly honored than those who did shall the undeserving continue receiving blessing while the worthy are crusht under foot no these things shall pass away

to hasten the process let us remember that god is no respecter of persons we must be just like him if a black man commit a crime see that he is punisht if a white man commits a crime see that he is punisht if a black man performs a noble deed praise him if a white man performs a noble deed praise him if a white man marries a colored woman or a white woman marries a colored man let us remember that before god there is no difference both black and white are his persons so matched have braved much have assumed greater responsibilities than others who marry they dared unite with the one they loved

i know that i am walking on fragile ground but let us keep stepping until we reach more solid soil commonly when these marriages occur we look down upon them with scorn or dismay the white person is ostracized and the colored nearly so this condition too must change is it not the democratic ideal if we are to have one country must we not also have one morality can we have a united country with one morality for whites and another morality for blacks  would human beings be little valued if white men who impregnate colored girls under age were prosecuted if other white men who cohabit with colored women could marry them if they chose too long this practice has been characteristic of our land when will man learn that justice is evenhanded

if two persons of good health love and wish to marry who should gainsay them be they white or black or white and black  i have met in my travels happy marriages of both sorts the white woman and the colored man and the white man and the colored woman seeing a mutual attachment being fondly exprest in the careful toil and sacrifice on the part of both for their children whenever this democratic couple proves itself in a community the neighbors should endeavor to break down all barriers and make these stalwart people their own

let our reproach for the marriage between white and black vanish like a mist rather reproach the union of unequals be they white black or black and white on the other hand when persons of relatively the same spheres and accomplishments choose to marry our part is to make the union last some say these people quarrel not all do so yet how few marriages of any sort are without some differences how many marriages of our peoples are absolutely without quarrels having seen many of these nuptials followed by unparalleled devotion i can believe that before i taste of death that america will have one morality

do not mistake that i am advocating intermarriage as a group ideal nothing is further from my purpose i am merely saying that if it happens that is the affair of those two i am simply indicating the evils which arise by forbidding by law intermarriage the base miscegenation of slavery and another sort has not ruined us can a noble miscegenation do worse at least it has not where it has been practised what the nation needs to become conscious of is that the government is an aristocracy and no democracy at all and as long as societies are aristocratic morality is impossible

our heavenly father may we know that a mans a man may we treat a man as a man may we love a man as a man and may we marry a man as a man

this is the test of our religion our thots must be thots of love for all our lives must be lives of love for all

a final consideration a very important consideration i now present this i hope will set aright all particularities out of joint despite the pleasantness of romance the basis of happiness seems to be economic poverty we know is the mother of vice crime and most uncleanness yet the adage says money is the root of all evil not so rather the lack of money has been the root of most evil i call this to mind because of what the scripture tells of filthy lucre we must realize that not all lucre is filthy  we must lay up treasure not only in an imagined realm but even on earth where moth doth corrupt and thieves break thru and steal how otherwise can we prepare for our childrens comfort in case we die prematurely or prepare for old age

we must accumulate to do this we must more and more enter those branches where money grows let us go extensively into the trades and business if we want to get together let us put our money together this is what the jews have done if we have not the experience of financiers let us get it as we got our churches and schools just tread the wine press we shall not tread alone here and there our people are ready for a big enterprise if these people having the desires of our hearts will not come close to us let us come close to them all need to march together

 no man liveth unto himself and no man dieth unto himself if this thot we carry with us our religion will extend iself into all phases of our community life

the white man has been deluding himself by thinking he does not need us similarly we have resolved to let him alone but how can we do this we need his business experience he needs us at least to fight his battles besides each will always have something to teach the other

zangwill well portrays the spirit of america to assimilate all people in his play the melting pot however it lacks one element americas most loyal folk the colored people the broth will not be right unless these colored masses also simmer in that crucible

when then is the ultimate goal the answer is simple if we can live the life of christ the church will extend its influence to every man our battle will be won over night when we become like god no respecter of persons we have life we give life we save life thus our building can never fade away

the reverend mr william smith had made a good speech good so some said but others thot it heretical what could have happened to the prophet of sinai shrine who expected anything like this despite the consternation he had caused no one left the auditorium during the course of the address no one even dared interfere for just when ire was aroused by a statement seemingly irreligious the holy spirit seized the speaker and his hearers thrilling them with sacred emotion no one called the speech ineffective all felt that the racial issues in the main were sound the greatest difference of opinion bore upon the apparent atheism of the clergyman

what could have possest rev smith we lookt for one of the good old sermons to take us out of self and lift us upon the rock of eternal ages said reverend caldwell the president of the convention

yes agreed reverend williams secretary of foren missions i lookt for something different myself i admit tho that we have been edified baffled and mystified and have considerably lost our bearings mr president for this reason while im on my feet i want to offer a suggestion suppose we depart a little from our usual way of closing the convention let us dispose of some of our afternoon work as the committees are ready to report and close the afternoon session with a discussion of reverend smiths address you know we must discuss it and then take action on his suggestions we should have our dinner hour for reflection upon it mr president i move that we do this the motion carried

at the close of the morning session the delegates did not go at once to dinner but divided themselvs almost automatically into three groups the better to discuss the young ministers remarks conservatives progressives and radicals such a spontaneous arrangement was a natural prognostic that theological belligerency was in the air each group aglow with enthusiasm and determination to carry the others was untiring in effecting a thoro organization these groups were maintained at the tables and continued up to the time of afternoon meeting with plans definitely arrangedthe groups lost their identity in the general assembly as the members assembled with unusual promptness devotionals suffered no interruption the president then declared the convention ready for business

mr president began rev monroe leader of the conservatives properly to discuss the address of our dear brother we should be strictly parliamentary we need a motion more definite than any that has as yet been proffered i therefore offer the following he read his motion and forwarded it to the recording secretary it ran thus resolved that the convention withdraw the hand of fellowship from reverend smith pastor of sinai shrine thus depriving him of all privileges and distinctions which accrue to a member of this organization this shall mean that he can not represent here or can his church send delegates that no minister enrolled with us shall preach in his church nor shall he preach in any church as a pastor enrolled with us that our members may not attend his church and his members may not commune with us this withdrawal is to be effective until he is removed from the pastorate of sinai or until he renounces the main tenets of his address which conflict with our articles of faith the motion was seconded and at the call for unreadiness the discussion began

the radicals had hoped to get in a resolution first but the conservatives had been the more alert now each group tried to get recognized eight or nine speakers arose simultaneously appealing mr president as recognition under these circumstances was utterly impossible rev caldwell said gentlemen you are about to be disorderly please be seated remember that order is heavens first law i know that we are assembled in extraordinary session i am aware that all are eager to handle the order of the day but let us proceed aright rise one at a time proportion your speech so that every one may have a chance and move on with dispatch im ready to go on

again a conservative won the floor it was rev stone pastor of shiloh who remarked mr president in this matter we want to be fair in requesting a withdrawal of the hand of fellowship we need to state the charges and have the accused brother make his defense for that purpose i rise he stroked his grizzled beard nodded his head several times and then cleared his throat

we feel he continued that the dear brother has forfeited his place among us because he has not respected our traditionsâdoctrines which we have cherisht and reverenced for many decades some of his utterances hark back to infidelity the notorious robert ingersoll could not have said worse for instance the young man said god is waiting on us and we are waiting on him thus he tries to impute to the holy father idlenessâhe who started light to dazzle in the sun to sparkle in the stars to flash in capricious lightning he who poured the waters forth from his radiant throne to make the fertile earthâmy god began his work in eternity and has never stopt he spoke with great emphasis

amen amen was an uproarious response coming from various parts of the assembly hallelujah hallelujah praise his name

mr president rev hillard a radical appealed

rev hillard

mr president i rise to ask the speaker a question

rev stone askt the president do you permit a question i do was the reply

my dear sir sought rev hillard have you not yourself by your utterance just now overstept the margin of these same traditions for which you seek to withdraw the hand of fellowship from rev smith you yourself just said that god has never stopt his work did not brother smith say the same the bible has us to understand that god rested on the seventh day this you even deny tho christ himself said tis finisht furthermore when we are trying to have sinners to decide to follow christ dont we say that god that the spirit is waiting for you to repent that god that christ stands at the door patiently waiting

mr president remarkt rev stone the learned gentleman knows that tho i may err in some of my remarks our conception of god is as one prompt to act industrious good and just rev smith has implied that god neglects his children that god is unjust did he not say in quoting tagore when gods fail to help their children men must come to their assistance what does this argue but the negligence of god what but his injustice thus i lay before you the charge that rev smith is wholly unorthodox if i am wrong

let my reverend chatechizer or the prophet of sinai shrine himself prove it

mr president began rev mc vicar another conservative of the most uncompromising type we must sustain our coworker in his charges he almost roared with his heavy bass

amen amen came back many responses

the distinguisht pastor continued rev smith today has been as heterodox as a turk reeking with christian blood and as ingratiating as a hog in a ladys chamber he challenges gods answering in his own good time if a human being can not wait for the allwise for the everlasting father the prince of peace to answer his prayer not only is he unfit to preach for the salvation of men unfit to be a doorkeeper in the house of my lord but is unfit to claim allegiance to the christ

verily verily i say unto you rev smith you must be bom again

hallejujah praise the lord the delegates shouted in various parts of the assembly

the enthusiasm flowed profusely with violent inundations as is the custom when tense religious fervor is provoked nearly every representative wanted to speak at once many arose but like a meteor flashing unawares to vanish and give way to orbs of more lasting grandeur they spoke and were admired for their brilliancy but the gaze of all was fixt upon the men of great renown with hope as for a coveted light the meeting surged with cheers for each respective group but how could one doubt the leaning of men untouched unseasoned by the lives of diversified thinkers trameled by the radiation of one clime and therefore hostile to new truth

then came forth the rev stamford a man of somewhat progressive views mr president the dissention evoked this morning may have some just basis i do believe the clamor of metallic tongues however and hearts brazened with duplicity and coated with envy for a man who has turned his back upon the night needs scant consideration yet those who love the truth who believe that even the church must step ahead value the many contributions of our distinguish young man who can deny that we must reshape our ideas to adjust ourselves to this complex life must we not rethink our attitude towards the great issues mentioned by reverend smith social equality intermarriage mixed schools newspapers and business consider for instance the prevailing conception and denial of any desire for social equality harking back to our ancestors of recent generations suffering in indecent slavery they desired not to live in the cabin but in the big house they desired not to have corn meal all the time but an occasional taste of magic flour life was not merely the fiddle and the dance but labor and rest leisure and travel and schooling all these our forefathers desired what was this to them other than social equality

since we however have had advantages of school have lived in other years and other climes our conception of social equality can not be theirs we include the right to vote and hold office we go even further than that if we shall have democracy here we must not be many nations but one with liberty and justice for all

to this extent i agree with rev smith and with him i contend that the laws of the south preventing intermarriage of individuals of different races is autocratic and therefore subversive of democracy that it prostitutes not only our women but the women of our white brother increases crime and moral degeneracy so far am i with my noble and able friend

when he says however of my redeemer of him who has cast countless worlds into space that we do not know the will of our father who is in heaven and that it is not worth while trying to find it out we meet at the parting of the ways he spoke with great fervor

amen amen the responses arose and continued for quite a while rev smith sat still almost stolidly thruout all these remarks he did cast nevertheless a casual glance at the various speakers

do we know the will of god rev stamford seemingly askt his entire audience

yes we do praise his name yes we do

do we not know that out of chaos god formed the universe that by making plants and beasts and man he willed us life  do we not know that before he created man according to his holy and everlasting will he determined that christ should come that the word should be made flesh and dwell among us was it not his will that christ should teach love thy neighbor as thy self is it not gods desire that we should love one another that we should love our enemies is it not worth while to try to learn more of this that our light may shine

amen amen

rev smith concluded rev stamford i love you i want you to succeed and tho some of your utterances seem untimely and apostatic i know that you are sincere i am fully aware that not a word was spoken to disrupt this convention but to spur it to larger usefulness i look upon you almost as a lone star on a gruesome night almost as a beautiful flower in a tractless desert we must admire you because you are rare i will not vote against you it takes a brave man to do what you have you have said these things because you believed them now if the hand of fellowship should be withdrawn do not be dismayed god is ever with you true we have a covenant but if we were to question every minister here and each would be as frank as you we should find i am afraid as many different interpretations of that covenant as there are ministers present let anyone deny that we do not differ as to our fundamental doctrines the conservatives squirmed they wanted to speak but rev stamford would not yield

the matter however which you need to rethink is your categorical that we do not know the will of god and that it is not worth while trying to find it out in your defense i should like for you to touch upon this thereupon the speaker sat down

now for the first time a radical gained the floor he had been sitting nervously trying to get recognition when the chance eventually came he arose and said with the air of a braggadocio mr president

rev gaston

dear christian friends members of the convention you know what i am going to say for several years you have called me an extremist and said that my folks have no religion at mount horeb well if we dont have much religion we do have something we have the largest and most beautiful structure in the state as well as the biggest congregation besides my people are doing the most missionary work at home and abroad friends my folks have religion i have a little religion myself i certainly burn with love for christ the delegates smiled

i have no speech to make i merely rise to commend sinai shrine i will answer however the preceding speaker rev stamford is not god unknowable the history of the world has assuredly been a search for god each generation learns more of him and in that great day or thru the ages when it is our pleasure to see him not thru a glass darkly but as he is shall we know him he almost shouted friends we shall not but we shall become better and better acquainted if we were to find out all about god i am afraid we should become tired of heaven and leave it in order that we might go to some place where there would always be something new to learn if we can not know god we can not know his will we can approximate but we can not know mr president exclaimed rev monroe excitedly i appeal for the vote if rev smith has nothing to say there has been enough discussion let us vote

mr president said rev ross as the preceding speaker sat down permit me a word the request was granted i rise as the father of this young giant for many years i nurtured him with teachings of the christ and you know his phenomenal youth as well as his ministerial career how strange life is from this very church with loving pathos we heralded reverend smith into prosperity and success here he was ordained to preach the word and here he is accused gentlemen it is strange

let us be careful how we judge the ideas of this young man to many of us may be new we were always told that we could not have too many churches but did we think that out for ourselves no we just accepted it if now we are honest we must admit that our religious growth is not determined by the number of churches that it is better to have a few firstclass churches thoroly uptodate than a host of secondclass churches behind the times

if this is followed however then what not every minister has a pulpit literally some are evangelists others are college presidents some are teachers in seminaries others are publishers

the question where do i exert my greatest influence had never occurred to me unquestionably it is not in the sermon i utter but it is in the sermon of my daily lifeâin laying hands on people in fully sharing life not from afar but at close range

i do not agree with all our youth has said but we need such a speech as his frank and earnest we need the truth

rev smith remarkt the president when a consensus of opinion had been exprest that the pastor of sinai shrine make his statement what do you have to say

with his wonted composure and equipose rev smith addrest the chair surveyed his audience and spoke thus friends now there is little need for words as men your minds are fixt you know how you will vote and so do i then do not think that i hope to change you not at all i have enjoyed working with you it has been a pleasure to preach in your churches but i have not desired to be an unwelcome guest i weighed my words before i spoke and i said them because i believed them whether you think my presence pernicious to the faith or wholesome vote according to your conscience i can afford to sever our fond relations i can afford to resign my pastorate but i can not afford to leave this community i can not afford to be less than a man i have no defense to make i have done my duty now may you do yours

the president having commended rev smith exprest his regret that the convention had to close thus but he hoped that whatever the decision they would act with the spirit of christ they had prayer anxious were the hearts devoted to rev smith while the ballots were being collected and more anxious during the counting of the same whispers of tenderness sighs of love strongly imprest this upon the assembly when all the votes had been tolled and checked by a slight majority the hand of fellowship was withdrawn

condemned by the church scorned by upstart timeservers  abused and misunderstood persons who yesterday hailed him an uncrowned king today keep anxious space between fond only of those whom all the world admires worshippers of those who court the crowd considered him stricken with a contagious malady poor young man you know that i am sorry but i must keep away the church demands it thus the manners of those who dwelt apart forcefully spoke to rev smith

when we have long been nurtured by the attention and counsel of many acquaintances and these at last suddenly slink away our souls still hunger and thirst for the accustomed care ignorant mayhap where to find it we ponder mindful of what has been and wonder should we covet its return or something like it then promptly we are flooded with a vision proudly dear and tho we stand alone we should exchange it never for the oldâfor what had long outlived its time and should have passed away we ourselves have died with these old glories but now we live again how we hate to die either in the flesh or in the spirit yet we all must die we who live must give the life that they who die may live

such were the thots crowding smith for recognition as he sat with his mother one pleasant evening enjoying the old home place it was several days after he had returned from a flying trip to xenia he had left immediately after the convention and had accordingly given very little time to his friends at last his vacation had begun this was the one day of the year when his mind might follow any fancy whether he would go back to his pastorate he was uncertain probably the members would not have him at this time however being in seaton was not a matter of importance he should lay all thot of former activity aside and be thrilled by the rapture of vacation his friends and those of his mother particularly the younger set wanted to see him now he was at their shrine hosts of charming memories of good well done kept him facinated with the spot now he realized why his mother would not leave williamsburg to be with him at seaton he himself was so entranced he began to wonder if he could leave he had come and gone often but could he now 

after a while william left the porch and went within to obtain a pencil in order that he might make a sketch of the sunset so variegated were the hues with unusual tints that the artist in him could not resist the alluring scene then he thot of his sketch book which would be more convenient than a mere piece of paper a brief search brot him upon it thus prepared for a feast of beauty he started to work he had made only a few bold lines when he felt that black and white would not do justice he decided therefore to get his crayons he desired most his paints but these he had left at seaton

he had hardly more than gone upstairs when two fair guests arrived susan attired in alice blue and thelma in russet at the request of mrs smith a saintly old matron who had never lost her winsomeness the girls nimbly tript into a mediumsized room the modest but commodious parlor they askt the mother not to announce their presence she consented the callers then closed the door and made themselves at home the pianoforte which they noticed immediately upon entering for a few moments was the chief attraction indeed it was a great temptation but they did refrain from touching the keys they whispered about the music displayed then went to the well curtained windows from which proceeded abundant light to see if he had come he had not the young women now ran lightly from here to the opposite side of the room where they found a divan loaded with oriental pillows and a few that were strictly suggestive of college life tho they had handled and admired the room before it seemed not less interesting now the massive chairs cushioned in blue with mystic designs were the next attraction the belles were thinking of some of their own artistic work and wondering if theirs was equally grand after musing and chatting about these they glanced at the landscapes placed here and there one seemed to be faithfully representative of the vase of fragrant magnolias before them they were flowers of rare beauty

finally william appeared on the porch and rapidly began to make a sunset that he hoped would be true to that of nature

he was enjoying his occupation immensely when a sweet voice called him he turned to see the owner where are you susan he answered recognizing her at once

here i am she replied rushing upon the porch laughing merrily

thelma followed and said with great satisfaction making a sunset

yes william responded the effort was irresistable you know well that i am a dilettante in this phase of art but yet an ardent lover of it i wish i could give more time to it public life however prevents me

still youre showing considerable talent in this sketch said thelma it seems that this is going to be just as excellent as some of your landscapes we were just admiring

i may be able to get the same results with crayon but im not sure

i know you will remarkt susan with emphasis you can do anything i appreciate the compliment he assured her he rapidly workt on upon pausing for a time and seeing them standing over him he requested them to sit but they preferred to stand girls you so quickly overwhelmed me with surprise that i so far lost my bearings as to be inconvenienced in spontaneous hospitality of course set words conventionalized are not always necessary to express a cordial greeting yet i need indulge in no lengthy harrangue to have you feel welcome he left off sketching for a while and then said i seem almost in fairyland so delicately sweet and cheery is the air because of your presence

we are indeed glad to come at any time said thelma with a smile

thelma he resumed his face flusht with the tint of the setting sun a face which showed the calm of a conqueror i was confident that you would act your own thots unsolicited by anyone for such as you we masculines call the assertive type the feminist

well you do understand me in part came from thelma smiling with her accustomed goodnaturedness at once there was exhibited a set of teeth charming and perfectly designed

susan i was not so sure however as to what your attitude toward me would be after the convention i am fully aware he said as his hand moved the crayons almost automatically that my remarks to some were very startling but what i spoke should have been uttered long ago the church as constituted is suited to the older generation these will soon be dead what will happen then will a new church suddenly spring forth to satisfy the new people not at all the changes should be gradual it is these i am trying to start to encourage directed evolution instead of a violent revolution or the extinction of the church

true i was shockt but i believed in you william hence i never once feared she declared

i did not once think that you would consider me a renegrade he affirmed the hope that has arisen in you from my avowal of endeavor was not yesterday betrayed it was merely set on with unusual momentum feeling however that because you are a mother child willing oftimes to sacrifice your own idea and act upon hers even tho your better judgment desired another course i wasnt sure what you would do

william youve spoken discerningly came from susan striving to adjust herself to this sudden expression of what was one of her fundamental characteristics you understand me well but you know the first commandment of promise honor thy father and thy mother with the reverence of that ancient holy people almost with adoration i have esteemed my mother i could defy my father but as yet i fear that i might yield to any wish of hers

thelma followed the completion of the sketch at the same time listening to the conversation ready at the proper suggestion to make her contribution

turning the talk a little for the purpose of trying to convert her to a different manner of procedure he askt has not your judgment frequently proved superior to your mothers im aware that mrs lee is a lovable woman with a valuable experience gained by contact with the hard hard world grant her all this yet can she equal you in view of your having largely shared that experience read more widely than she and traveled more extensively

occasionally i do devise better plans she admitted yet i cant say that in matters of great importance i have ever excelled up to this time no circumstance of honor has been able to draw me from a friend no matter what has been said still our relations might be in a measure altered by some suggestion of my mother

you see then that i was right remarkt rev smith

pardon me put in thelma at this point but may i interrupt you a wee bit she had been about to invade the kitchen to call upon the mother for once it seemed that the conversation between susan and smith was about to become extremely confidential

why certainly susan replied and william added his assent

thank you she remarkt i have often told susan that she must solve her own problems she must see her chances and not leave such immediately personal affairs to the dictation of others her parents have lived their lives susan must live hers since life was less complex for them than it has been for her they can merely suggest they are just as powerless as we to portray a detailed future when mr and mrs lee married they thot they knew each other well but if you just question them for a moment they will assure you that many modes of behavior not at all glimpsed during courtship gained expression later on they will tell you that even now tho well acquainted they dont know each other thoroly they believed their love to be genuine and even themselves to be so and life has been according to their faith

thelma said susan somewhat abasht that she had become the topic for discussion there is much truth in what youve said as evidence of my appreciation let me assure you that i will reflect upon it tonight i will try to be more selfpropelled

but have we not neglected the chief purpose of our visit in going thus astray  came an utterance more atune with her eager nature reverend smith she pronounced it with firmness we have come to offer you congratulations on that extraordinary address extraordinary in its bold heroism and in its heralding the dawn of a new era

yes reverend smith said thelma with the firmness of susan accept our hearty congratulations we treasured every word you spoke i think you know that the zeal of the young people of the church is not so great as that of the old it is due to preaching to a new generationâ as you said âwisdom suited for the past you come with a frank statement of the matter bringing to your command the philosophy of the east and the west and we enjoyed it tho susan was at times shockt we cant merely live in the past we must have a part of the present and the future besides provincialism must pass to let cosmopolitanism have the day the learning of our fathers or of all america is insufficient we must learn of all people of all the earth

this is well said but what are the utterances of the people generally askt the divine tho i dared to face the convention i have not visited a home that may be quite a different experience

the older people susan affirmed are almost a unit against you still some of them believe that such thots as yours must have a hearing these merely wonder whether the time is quite ripe for such they do say however that the untrained and the narrowly trained ministers have too long swayed our people that now since the great issues of our great national life require unusual thinkers for their solution the educated minister must be heard

it is needless to say interrupted thelma that the younger set is with you fully

many of the younger set however are not jn the church rev smith said consequently i dont have their support or i may say that their good wishes amount to little right now

if you were here remarkt susan lowering her eyes tenderly dont you know we should crowd your church your appeal was for life and we need life

probably youre right for should i keep hammering away id get them eventually any way he changed the conversation a little holding up the completed sketch well what do you think of it it is yours to condemn

i think it truly exquisite then to think how quickly you have done this youre more than a dilettante said susan

yes it is a remarkable sketch was thelmas remark

lets start an art gallery susan said in jest

yes responded thelma my collection will be at your disposal

and mine

and mine

but lets return to the point requested thelma smith id like to know if you preach at seaton as you did at the convention

yes i do however i dont touch so many issues in one discourse as i did at the convention with one issue before me calling for advancement i speak with vigor and as i do so i point to the new i point forward was smiths reply

i so much wish that you could be in williamsburg regularly declared susan with a melody of tone that generally compelled conviction how we should appreciate all your work

i may come said smith laughingly resigning himself for any happening i may be forced to some other field

who would be so bold as to try  inquired thelma fully aware that william would not be bullied about

ministers william replied because i know this i have been trying to conclude whether i sould enter another field or not

here he met distinct opposition both young ladies were firmly against his leaving the ministry completely they felt that he might give most of his time to something else for a while but not long they wanted him never to lose an opportunity to preach to do pastoral work or enter biblical discussions

william said susan with an impressive look almost with a plea  remember that you are specially trained for the ministry remember that you are better qualified to do this work i believe than any man in the state pilgrim is with you god has called you and you can not turn back

yes william said thelma susan is right you cant forsake your calling an educated man can do more than one thing as a means of livelihood so you need no defense if seaton doesnt want you return to your home town and go to work do anything for a living well think no less of you the truth is well admire you the more start a mission of your own hundreds are waiting to follow you

the conversation went on until dusk when it was about time for the girls to go home william said girls i hope you have spent a pleasant evening and accomplisht the purpose of vour call you have heartened me with inspiration you have shown the way now i know what i shall do

your coming is indeed a compliment

under ordinary circumstances we should have waited we could not talk with you long on the day of the last session because you had to hurry away as some were against you we thot it should not be necessary for you to seek your friends we thot your friends should come to you so we are following our philosophy

william walkt with the girls to their homes that evening throbbing in his every vein with new life he had the freshness of a first spring morning after a weary winter and the gladness of a soul set free what a blessing he thot that we have women what a joy to be a part of them trials might arise with the morning but women force them soon to take wing

god bless them said william as he strolled homeward there is just one course for me to pursue

news of the ouster of rev smith by the recent state convention came to seaton as an astonishment it was difficult at first to make the people understand why their idol had fallen but when some of williams utterances had been communicated to them apart from their setting and with bias the people concluded that the convention should be sustained since the markt gentleman was popular and magnetic they knew that spasmodic and scattered efforts to remove him however indignant they themselves might be would avail nothing accordingly the foremost among them fomented designs to force the prodigal to depart or return as he went out apparently the pastor of sinai shrine was resolved to let them have their way for he did not return to his pulpit until the second sunday after the convention thus he took all the time allowed for his vacation

when he reacht the thrifty little town his sermon was already prepared in order to avoid contact with many of the people he arrived on the midnight train thus he was able quietly to go home and obtain a good rest before the ordeal of the next day

shortly before time for the service he started for church he became interested on the way in surveying the passersby what were their thots what did they think of him there was certainly no change in the words of greeting no lessening of the vigorous handshake how could they be christian and act otherwise if these same people could lay loving hands upon the wicked those who had not pledged themselves to follow christ how could they withhold this consideration from one truly born of god and specially set apart to do his work there was however a difference in their countenances true rev smith was to be chastized but it was to be the chastisement of god

preparations had been made for his home coming each minister of the convention pastoring at seaton being almost ultraconservative and therefore unanimously opposed to williams views to let the town know in a formal way that they were a unit had decided to preach on a designated sunday from the same text beware of false prophets this was to be one week before rev smiths return the following sunday they preacht the text dust shall be the serpents meat they argued that god the same yesterday today and forever never deserted his own he had been their dwelling place thru all generations and lo he would be with them always even to the end of the world thru the darkest days of slavery thru the perilous reconstruction they had walkt with god and god with them how could he desert them now when they believed in him furthermore the ministers urged that since rev smith had departed from the old doctrines he had forfeited his right to leadership thus they were resolved to wrest it from him at each congregation the majority of the members voiced the approval of the united effort

tho unaware that this sermon was being preacht from the pulpit of his colleagues yet somehow divining such rev smith uttered the final one pervaded with the opposition of the state ministry and with the cooling inspiration of susan and thelma he sensed what was going on elsewhere he chose therefore the familiar text he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth its fruit in its season he told his members what had occurred at williamsburg and that probably while he was giving his remarks he was being denounced in the neighboring churches he had always had a good attendance but on this particular morning large numbers were standing the surplus had come not to worship but merely to observe what would happen

notwithstanding the fact that they had come out of curiosity william was happy to see them since they had very likely heard only one side he thot he owed it to seaton to present the other for they were all followers of christ and tho they might go in different directions they would finally assemble at the same place

the gist of the sermon was this trees are of various sorts and even trees of the same species differ of even the commonest trees abut us the maple and the oak you can find no two alike they differ because the environments of these are not the same a tree near a stream is bound to be richer than one away from such

the tree near the rivers of water is likely also to be longlived

it gives fruit not prematurely nor when it is too late it bringeth forth its fruit in due season

finally drought will sometimes reach other trees but the leaves of this tree shall not wither god has said it and it must be so

in applying the text i have in mind all people but because of recent momentous events particularly all ministers i do not even exclude myself

the tree is man the water is thot the river is immensity like trees we differ because of different parents and different associations if we are planted that is established so as not to be moved if we are grounded in the immensities of thot not only of the few men who wrote the bible but the thot of men of india of egypt persia and other lands in the thot that not only of the past and of the present we are richer than they who have only the thot of one land and that of the past we communicate the thot we have thus received inspired by god those having little give little those having much give much

remember the fivers move on and no one can bathe in the same stream twice thus the tree by the water ever has fresh food and gives luxurious fruit so it is with man a life fed on stale food naturally stagnates

in closing rev smith became very personal his hearers had been deeply swayed for tho they had harkened to some machinations of the throng they had to commend a personality on tuesday night he said the church will meet and decide as to whether i am to be reelected or not may your judgment not fail you nothing will change my attitude toward you i have served you faithfully in the greatest and i will serve you equally in the least

because i have ever lookt for better things even before i was called to the ministry and before i came here i can not now use the other thing i may not have brot forth fruit recently in its season but the fruit hitherto vas always strictly on time i am have been and ever shall be a tree planted by the rivers of water i stand for progress i will move abreast of the times i will always bring forth the new that is worth while if i can find it and as the years change so will i this may mean that you will not want me but god does i can go elsewhere i am a minister not only in the pulpit but out of it

this is a serious moment but serious moments must come and with them defeat or victory however i can not believe that i was born to fail my mother has suffered too much to give me birth she came of a tribe of african stock that knew nothing but ultimate achievement what one may now call defeat may eventually be attainment does not defeat often prove to be real success of course today we fail and so tomorrow and tomorrow but do we yield not at all cloud and fog fast fall upon us we pine and grieve we languish amidst forgetting folk still we try at last when we have nearly despaired convinced that our efforts were in vain we have achieved the coveted renown sunshine came after rain rejoicing after sorrowing what seemed defeat was a glorious victory

when william left the pulpit at the close of the services he noticed some of the older folk who had usually lingered to shake his hand did not stay this afternoon the faces of many showed signs of disappointment for these expected denial or retraction since neither came forth in his discourse here and there disapproval was strongly exhibited strangers could not have discerned it but the members could the deacons omitted the social chat and merely attended to the business of the day this added to the omission of an invitation to dinner from the elderly people distinctively indicated what should be the younger people were for him but not the others but in williams heart there was malice towards none

several months after william had resigned the pastorate of sinai shrine the ministerial conference assembled in extraordinary session the divines thot they had played a trump when they swayed the members to vote not to reelect the young pastor the battle however was far from being won smith had taken a more strategic position as it were he had found employment in the public schools to discuss this was the business of their meeting they had approacht the principal and superintendent in vain now they desired to find a way to reach the members of the school board

at the appointed hour the conference opened and proceeded with dispatch having finisht the preliminaries with unusual expedition the president called for the new business all faces were resolute radiant with an understanding of what they were to do tho devotionals had been greatly curtailed the more energetic ministers seemed restive they were happy however in their responsibility happy in their confidence

acknowledged leaders of the community they were very eager to keep and get all possible distinction with this in mind rev canty pastor of christs church arose and said mr president you know our business we are here to decide upon ways and means of removing a great annoyance we succeeded in effecting rev smiths resignation but that is all he is yet in town and worse than that he is teaching in the public schools there he will get the children of all our churches and with his heresay lead them to destruction

rev matthews pastor of hebron here interrupted saying pardon me rev canty im just as desirous as you to remove any nuisance but im not here to throw mud if we speak the truth we must admit that rev smith is at least a gentleman a man like him is not going to lead anyone to destruction he will undoubtedly teach doctrines incompatible with our faith but he will not ruin a life

as this wsa a round table argument the president allowed them almost absolute sway in determining who should speak and what should be the time permitted this was a fortunate circumstance for those of the opposition when doctor matthews made his startling remark thus there followed considerable heated discussion for the prevailing feeling was that smith should not be in the schools true the schools were undenominational yet the pastors strongly believed that the man of their condemnation was too good a preacher too thotful and inspiring not to win a following among the youth

didnt he make of the poorest young peoples meeting in town the largest and most interesting inquired rev young impressive of voice and bearing and long pastor of saint johns

we must concede that he understands youth being much nearer to them than any of us remarkt rev canty pained by the truth of it hence we are compelled to remove the menace as a plan of carrying our point i suggest that we preach a special sermon to our people in order to have them in continuous streams voice their disapproval to the principal who i am sure would then suggest that rev smith would go elsewhere if we get him out of the public schools that would be enough we should have accomplisht our aim and should be willing to stop there

would you stop there said rev lester the venerable pastor of seaton a man loved almost equally by all the groups radicals progressives and conservatives i should like to know anyhow why you are bringing up this action against the young man for he has acted like a prince i defy anyone to mention an instance of his reproaching or rebuking us mention his utterance against us all were silent

why preach a sermon against him he resumed to act as we did some months ago would be shameful and infamous think of all the ministers preaching from one text what a disgrace how bitterly i have regretted it ever since we all say that we are inspired by god then tell me pray how often has he inspired any two of us to preach the same text on the same sunday as we are different we are inspired to different thots altho by the same god if we should repeat that act where would be the inspiration god would not be in it it would come from satan from malice and not from love but what is the basis of your complaint

this is our grievance and a sore one said rev young who like rev canty felt that something should quickly be done rev smith approved a dance in school

what can we charge concerning that inquired rev lester what you have just said would be a just reason for unfrocking a minister but youve already done that for a less sufficient cause rev smith is no pastor you know that hes simply a teacher besides if you are going to take from the public schools all those teachers who either dance or approve of dancing you wouldnt have anybody to carry on the work in many of the high schools of the country boys and girls dance together without offense i remember having seen such in washington d c chicago and new york

gentlemen you are well aware that im ready to attack vice without delay but i do believe in meeting it properly in the case of dancing that is vicious im ready to attack it now but is the dancing which is conducted in public schools vicious  if it is we have been asleep for many years we have allowed it to become a part of the curriculum of all firstclass public schools and many private ones it is in the kindergarten the grades and the high schools if this is our grievance it is not rev smith we should attack but those who are responsible for its being a required feature of the school program

let us injure no man especially one who has been true to us under our machinations some day hell be among us again hes coming back i have the faith

probably that is not a just ground for complaint still i felt that one called of god should not approve a dance resumed rev young one other grievance however remains rev smith is calling our childrens attention to love whereas we should like for them to postpone it as long as long as possible

at this point there was universal consternation some opened their mouths and kept them so for a while others uttered excoriating sighs some rose others sat in uneasy chairs the president at once proceeded to get order in the midst of this confusion to the dire astonishment of all rev smith came in and greated them good morning

why had he come that was the question when certain that our plans are well laid that they are the consummation of hours of patient reflection there rises within us the certainty that come what will they can not miscarry since they were contrived in secret they would continue in secret until the time deemed convenient for their execution for the inconceivable to happen for premature opposition to get the right of way our ministers were not prepared

rev canty who had been most tenacious in his contention at once revealed the greatest loss of selfpossession he was wholly taken off his guard under such circumstances if some one else acts first and then the stem aggressor is given a few moments to himself for reflection or a thrust he would come back with another almost irresistable onslaught so the chief accuser was placed rev canty hoped that just for an instant rev young or someone else would take the initiative he could not recall when he had been so much disturbed as he was then why did not some proper utterance or event detract his thots from himself why could he not continue to think out a resistance had he been basically wrong had he been unjust what spell was this why could he not speak why was the moderator tongueless why did rev smith just await the ministers bidding

the young man whose career had been challenged stood a master diplomatist silent to the dismay of all calmly and patiently he surveyed his accusers as if thru telepathy striving to divine their purposes not a face wore a welcome and distant were the smiles since he was flayed an incongruity and labeled a malefactor let those with just complaints lodge them in his presence

rev canty wondered how william learned of the meeting he soon dismist the thot tho it was not a question of how the young man came there but how ought they dispose of him the archaggressor because the others failed to act knew they were waiting on him any dereliction on his part he felt might be positively detrimental to his designs after a few moments of unnerving silence rev canty to get his bearings went to a window near by and raised it as far as it would go the place was not in need of ventilation as any one present would have testified not the body but the mind was ill at ease just as the sash went up a woman jubilant and robust passed by with a basket of clothes upon her head and as she walkt along with a voice of overwhelming sweetness she sang this old familiar tune the ministers listened rapt on every word rev canty beckoned for the ministers to observe the singer thus the spell was broken how remarkably god consoles even the worst of us he said we never have greater burdens than we can bear but let us return to business the pastors soon returned to the conference eager to bring it speedily to a close when all were seated rev canty said with much spleen mr president this young man a markt individual has overstept many proprieties by coming here brother moderator i demand an explanation

the president having no desire to delay the crisis without ado askt rev smith to make a statement

gentlemen since you desire it i will make a statement said the former pastor of sinai shrine with a smile that bespoke an unconcern as to what had been planned against him i have come to be at your service then he sat down

this was another surprise for very few were satisfied rev canty now himself again became persistent doctor he contended the distinguisht gentleman conducts himself rather obscurely what does he mean  he has convinced us that his sphere is different from ours and yet he comes among us what effrontery some men will have when will they learn that some conventionalities are sacred  gentlemen it is almost impossible for me to understand it

as he spoke rev smith lookt at almost everyone present trying to grasp unspoken thot he was certain that the ministers were not neutral that either they were for him or against him when rev canty paused william arose with his accustomed grace positive and assertive with his clarion voice that easily filled the assembly room he said i was not aware that you held secret meetings hitherto not only ministers but laymen of any denomination have been permitted to come then why should i be unwelcome  the situation was fully comprehended by him

rev smith our meetings are not secret put in the president determined at all hazards to lay the matter bare yet when we go into extraordinary session until our plans have been well formed we prefer not to clash with opposing forces out side of our group

yet often the clash might be indefinitely posponed if the individual likely to confront you contrarily would be with you at least awhile interrupted rev smith

we have assembled to organize plans to have you modify your teaching you have disturbed us annoyed us bored us not satisfied with making many of our members disgruntled you seek to make fickle all our young or lead astray the conscientious rev canty was angry and made the young devine feel it

something of this nature had come to my ears as i visited some of my former members i learned that some parents were told by their children that i had discussed love affairs in school some probably thot that i was urging their children to marry prematurely when nothing was farther from my purpose they evidently did not understand me you do not understand yet ignorant of the situation you seize upon this as a basis for having me removed from my position

do not for a moment be deceived if you can get me out of a position i hope you will enjoy the accomplishment i am not here to ask you play hands off as i said at first i came to help gentlemen do not forget that you are gods chosen do not debase yourselves do only what is right my business in the world is to make people happy by being good and helping them to be the same since even ministers are sometimes mischievous and you may be so now i have come not to make you uncomfortable but to serve you

well let us have the service thundered rev canty very impatiently and dont be long about it our time is valuable

id at least be courteous replied william with his accustomed grace

rev canty be silent said the president i think i have charge of this meeting let rev smith proceed

when the president gained control once more william resumed his remarks i was teaching tennysons idylls of the king have you read them gentlemen

of twenty pastors present only four knew of the book here the young divine related the story and proceeded to discuss it as he had presented it in class save for the literary merit the idyl which has occasioned the present altercation is called lancelot and elaine lancelot the favorite knight of a noble king by several remarks incited elaine a beautiful simple maiden to love himâa man of fiftyfour a girl of eighteen she askt him do her a favorâto wear a pledge as he fought at a tournament this request was equivalent to asking him to wear an engagement ring after he was wounded she nursed him back to health to reward her he instructed her to speak the wish nearest to her heart since he told her that in wearing the pledge tho to disguise himself he had never before done so much for any woman she naturally thot she was preferred above all she spoke her dearest  wish which was to become his wife when he rejected her love she askt to follow him around the world he said that could not be then he offered her land this she would not accept at length he left her without saying goodbye

whether this classic should be taught to high school pupils i am not prepared to judge superiors in making the course of study have deemed it a proper work as a member of the teaching staff i am pledged to teach it

but what was your interpretation inquired rev canty with a jerk for he wanted the good or ill done quickly

i said that if a young man had made overtures of the same kind as those of lancelot to one of our young women she would have spoken the wish nearest her heart very likely if this request to be the wife had been rejected however our young lady would not have askt anything else why then did elaine entreat it why did she have to die this was my answer

the ministers were intensely interested elaine lived not in a great city nor one of middle size society was rural thus the houses were far apart she lackt a mother and all that such possession impliesâmotherly counsel and else reared apart from girls and deprived of association with many young men she clove to the first she saw with affection for no one else if she had had the privilege of our girls of today as in public schools to be in class with boys to see them in the halls and talk with many she would have been forced to make a choice and her love would not have been of the dangerous sort that cannot survive a refusal elaines was purely a case of unguided love such was my interpretation to try to prevent the occurance of elaines

doctor you have a silvery tongue said rev canty with a slur im glad youve come we shall consider your explanation for its worth

gentlemen as i have already said responded william apparently unaffected by the sneer of rev canty i live not to injure but to help is your life purpose the same are you trying to help or to injure me if my being at douglass high school retards the progress of the community or if it must prevent my aiding the people as i deem i should i can leave but do not think i will leave the state my career has been determined by this vicinity and until i have spent an equal number of years in service as payment for my debt to those at hand my ear is deaf to other fields his attitude was a challenge he arose once more and lookt about the assembly then he concluded thus i hope i have been of service may god bless you he departed almost as unexpectedly as he had come

the latter part of the next month found rev william smith practicing law at seaton yet not unharrassed by many pastors since few of the members of the churches brot their legal problems to his office tho he had been well recommended by the state bar association he thot that the ministerial alliance had not acted exactly right they opposed him as minister teacher and lawyer could they not distinguish between the man and the office must personality enter in regardless of all ill feeling he would continue his practice at least until spring when he would decide upon a permanent work then it would be a plunge into a weltering flood to sink or swim survive or perish

one day in januaryâseveral months after the conference âwhen the blinding snow was reminding the improvident of their follies reverends smith and canty met in front of sinai shrine tho it was rather cold william removed his glove

rev canty did the same they shook hands vigorously many happy recollections and bitter memories forced themselves to view rev canty said william calmly but with a pleasing defiance you have now exhausted your devicesâat least against me i have decided to return to the ministry tho at first a great portion of my time will be devoted to pastoral work i shall preach regularly i will rise among you and you shall hear from me the lawyer would not stay for a reply

the issue will be settled in the spring the birds will come again in the spring smith will attain a grandeur he can not see in the spring the jubulant spring

the months that lay before william were passing slowly weary months of anxiety he had before him ambitions which could not crystalize until the long nights had past away this by no means meant that he was not working for he well proportioned his time for systematic endeavor interspersed with timely recreation like a general amassing a wealth of munitions and supplies numbers of men and bounteous information for many days before launching a campaign william zealously planned his preliminaries not only for an effective organization but for sure success

during these days he wondered how he might spend the bulk of his leisure moments should he break other customs or should he for the interim permit the right of way to any who sought to enter it was there now or had there been a demand for strict conformity did the wavering of the i masses or the bigotry of the clergymen taking advantage of his seeming indifference expect a departure of any sort that i would prove them right and him wrong the ministers rigid as they were were in a state of flux the people mobile and fickle awaited the dominant will which would sway them to pleasure or to ruin was he the posessor of that dominant will

such were williams thots one wintry morning as he lookt from his abode upon the hurry of busy folk enroute to the factory a few miles off to get the fruits of honest toil

the day was cold but not offensive for tho worn countenances exhibited many cares each face was bright with the gleam of morning the younger folk smiling and buoyant were as free as the bare trees bidding the skies good day yet coats were buttoned snugly scarfs tho wantonly flying in the sportive air kept themselves about the necks of the willing workers i can not say that there was a cadence but there was a regularity of movement indicative of resolute people here were comedy and melodrama galore was there also tragedy

turning towards the table our lawyer noticed the williamsburg post which had come in the night before he scanned the news of the previous day until he came to the society columns for he was eager to know not only of those in places of potency but even of the plainer folk the events were not out of the ordinary there had been the accustomed number of births deaths and marriages in brief all was going well yet one announcement engaged him especially that of a party to be given at the home of mrs annelle in behalf of her goddaughter letitia strauss it was the linen shower the happy precursor of letitias marriage william wondered why he should be so obtuse as to have forgotten it the opportunity to see and greet many old friends anew the welcome of many now might be cold rigid or rebukingly artificial yet they would be glad to see him he belonged to them they belonged to himâeach had contributed freely to make the other what he was at this party he would find them some with antipathies bom of his religious breach and others with adoration for his courage should he go there was his place there was his treasure and there was his heart

since susan thelma and letitia were upon the most intimate terms he became promptly aware that he would be expected if im going he said to himself having reflected a while i must obtain a worthy gift to make a proper selection i should start now rather than wait until i arrive at williamsburg i have so much business to adjust today that i can leave only on the late train this would not allow sufficient time for a choice in williamsburg i must therefore make the purchase before going to my office

laying the paper aside he turned again towards the window the workers steadily moved on this time he noticed particularly groups of men and women conversing with evident hilarity besides girls and boys were following in their train were they equally happy the frequent zealous glance at each other the hearty laughs and the equipoise with which they passed assuredly reflected a satisfaction which is one of the joys of life here certainly ivere comedy and melodrama was there also tragedy

wrapping himself securely with an air of calm defiance william stept into the street and joined the happy throng before him was the work of the day together with thots of the following evening however he had not gone far from his home when he noticed in the street a little urchin of three years a child of poverty hatless and almost shoeless for several toes had burst their prisons to get an icy freedom without a coat with ropes for suspenders with jacket and trousers tattered and unkempt this lad was running directly down the street to obtain a rubber ball that seemingly would not stop rapidly approaching not far away swerving from side to side with reckless speed came an automobile two young men easily recognized as the reprobate sons of the chief manufacturer of seaton wantons who put no premium on human life occupied the front seat neither said anything to the other yet with the same momentum the car came on they evidently failed to see the child if they saw they did not care for no signal was given by horn bell or voice to warn the joyful little lad

several persons saw the danger among this number was william smith he shouted at once to the driver to avoid the boy did he hear evidently not for the automobile now was speeding faster than ever suddenly the child stopt waved a good bye to his mother who was on her way to earn his daily bread it reminded our lawyer of the gladiatorial greeting we who are about to die salute you upon hearing her name called the mother turned at once she saw the danger and shriekt

what should be done would not some one with great courage risk his life for the child for attempt or rescue meant death or just bare escape quick must be the decision and quick the effort the mother started for the merry lad but was restrained by several women at her side she struggled to go but fortunately they held on they knew that at her home there were two daughters who needed a mother living and not dead which did the community need the more the mother or the child with these gallant women there was but one answer

faster and faster came the vehicle now the young fellow stoopt to pick up his ball then he sat down to toss it shouts and cries from many troubled breasts sought to warn both child and driver yet neither seemed to heed it in the least how in a crisis we may be entranced to defiance or indifference

when william observed this combat between recklessness and innocence convinced that action must be speedy he wondered whether he was sufficiently quick of foot to make the rescue and escape then came the thot that this was a white child should he be willing to die even for it well trained as he was to lead a slighted race should he give his life for this one child of the race that scorned him or save it for the millions of his race who loved him if this had been his child and if a white man filled with the hope of millions happened to pass that way would he sacrifice his life for a little black lad of poverty he quickly reacht his conclusion he was living his life for man it was not a question of white or black but where could he serve humanity here was a chance

he remembered that he had been a sprinter in college having won many a hundred yard dash he had always run as if it were a matter of life or death in order that his alma mater might have the glory of splendid achievement once he had fallen at the finish exhausted but he had won now however he was out of practice still this could be no determining factor before him at last was his first actual race for life or death the others had been races with human beings this was a race for a human beingâthe greatest prize that all the world could give because it was an unusual race many of his college tactics were of little avail upright he was to dash with his greatest rapidity until within a few yards of the little lad when he must stoop and run low without lessening speed seize the child and carry him to safety

as the automobile had not been heard the same should be true of him lest the child frightened by a sudden and unexpected approach should run towards the vehicle to certain death like a flying meteor this stalwart black prince dashed ahead faster and faster he speeded on faster and faster came the demon how could a human being outstrip a miracle of mechanical ingenuity nearer and nearer they came to each other finally william reacht the lad and seized him without the little fellows having been aware of his approach the automobile was just a little more than a yard away when he graspt the tender boy he made one step to escape with his prize then the vehicle struck his hindmost leg and whirled him round he fell and the car hurled by shrieks and curses rose from the anxious and horrified onlookers they grieved to see their champion fall when the dust had settled there could be seen deaths challenger lying on the groundâunconscious and bleeding the tattered child however stood calmly at his side wondering what had occurred

the mother took her child and fondled him speedily she sought to thank william but he was motionless she put her babe aside then lifted the head of the gallant young man and began to apply her handkerchief to staunch his blood by this time many workers were about her take him to my house she urged most of those present wanted him carried to the drug store but she insisted that he be given a soft place to lie and that a physician be called her request prevailed thereupon she dispatched this message to her employer tell mr davenport that i shall be late today let him know of this accident im sure it will be all right

it was not long before a physician came a few minutes were sufficient to revive william and dress his wounds his injuries were a wrencht ankle and several severe bruises almost cuts along the side of his head as soon as this had been done the mother thankt him because he had braved so much she took him in her arms to help him sit ministered to him in various ways and enlisted the willing service of those about her here the barriers of centuries were broken down true he who had dared was black but he was a man for all that

slowly he regained his strength about a half hour after he had been brot to the house he felt that he was himself once more then he askt if anyone had seen his overcoat it was handed him neatly brusht the lady of the house tried to have him stay longer but he informed her that he had much to do that day she wisht he might rest now about to go he askt for an old cane or a stick with which to support himself a stick was quickly put into his hand a few minutes later he donned his overcoat thankt those who had attended him and limpt away

tho the mother entreated his name and address he would not tell however when he pulled out his muffler a tiny case fell on the floor when he had gone the gentle lady picked it up she could not tell how it came there nor could she guess what it was upon opening it she saw several cards she took one and read it it ran thus rev william smith attorney at law room  booker t washington building she rejoiced to know who had rescued her child

the guests assembled promptly at the home of mrs annelle to inspire and make happy one of the most genteel girls of williamsburg as they stept into the spacious hall specially designed for social functions their smiling countenances bespoke the praise of this stately maiden letitia strauss who had determined to know the best of life her rhythmic gait enhanced by a silk of old rose commanded the attention of all

the people there were truly joyous magic ditties which seemed to come out of fairyland dances old and new alluring games and intermittent feats elicited praise for the jollity of life how excellent it was to live

after the second dance henry lee called his sister to one side thelma and letitia thinking that it was not a matter requiring privacy came also merely to gather the news they were following a basic instinct and in this they knew they could not err when they had reacht the drawingroom with its brilliancy and oriental trimmings the girls seated themselves about a table embellisht with artistic carving henry placed before them a newspaper the seaton post pointed to the article he wanted them to read and then stood opposite them to enjoy divining their thots by observing their facial expression

i had meant for it to be a secret he smiled but since you all have come im willing that it be an open secret what do you think of it

yes what must we think of it said thelma dont crowd give us all a chance to look no it will be better for just one to read susan you can do this very well read for us all

susan read a daring rescue by a negro rev william smith barrister of seaton he riskt his life for a child of one of our poorest familiesâa lad of two years when we think that this man so dear to his race should take the chance he did for a member of that group which commonly looks upon his people with scorn and spite we hope that there will come out of this adventure a closer relationship between the white and darker breeds of men rev smith is no common man had he been killed his race would have suffered a great loss for look where you may you will not find in our environs one who has accomplish so much as he in developing a lasting friendship between the two racial groups the article then went into detail concerning the whole incident and commended the stand of the mother the young people listened almost breathlessly

there was not intermittent comment when they had finisht they first lookt at each other then thelma said it is just like him

i too am not at all surprised came from susan i hope he isnt seriously injured

the paper informs us that he finally went to his office if this is true im confident that he is much better now put in letitia

since the incident occurred yesterday morning said henry and as william has a vigorous constitution within a few days he will be perfectly well anyway

we were hoping that he would be here this evening quickly spoke letitia slyly glancing at susan he has never missed anything like this

yet said susan coyly we did hope that he would come

henry then displayed a yellow journal the seaton gazette at least it was yellow on the negro question girls he remarkt with much vivacity here is an editorial in another paper on the same incident you will be interested in following this i know for this periodical generally heralds our faults and keeps silent concerning our virtues

they read in this instance with more fascination but interspersed their perusal with spirited comment before they could come to the end a familiar voice said good evening girls how are you they turned and greeted william smith im glad to be with you once i thot i couldnt come âwhy hello henry i didnt see you when i came in each shook the others hand vigorously

im so sorry you have to use a cane said susan deeply moved by williams limping its bad enough to have to wear head bandages doesnt your ankle pain you more than your head there were many smiles

yes it does my head wounds are rather slight eve tho several stitches were necessary

all exprest their sympathy

well old man said henry im glad you escaped foi we have much for you to do i know you didnt purposely come to see me so im gone enjoy yourself with the girls of course ill see you many times this evening and at least once tomorrow youll not be leaving for several days will you 

i go back tomorrow night answered william but as you said well see each other many a time before then henry went to find catherine staples the woman of his choice as a matter of course she had been informed first her absence from the group was due to the fact that she desired to disclose the secret to others about the first young person she met was sinclair young the prospective groom and the gentleman of the evening until william came after she had told a few these did the rest they were willing informers

the news of the exploit was soon known thruout the house and tho smith had quietly come in fearing a demonstrationâfor he knew that the events of yesterday might have got the speed of himâthe people everywhere were aware of his presence crowding the drawingroom they heapt upon him an avalanche of congratulations william tried to slink out of view but he could not when the orchestra gave the signal for a quadrille those who had commended him proceeded to arrange for the dance soon all had gone except william susan thelma and letitia sinclair came for letitia for the dance was on then beckett king came for thelma at first she lookt at him haughtily as if he had been a transgressor of her peace then she started for the i hall as she reacht the door she turned and said william your achievement now is certain had any one else attempted that rescue death would have claimed him but you were spared spared for us and we are spared for you this is the blessing of providence

why had thelma said this thot susan this congratulation was quite different from all the rest it contained an appeal that went to the soul she had noticed that thelma was no longer deeply interested in beckett king and tho she would go out with him occasionally her utterances of him no longer told of a heroworship which was constant the summer william went south was that speech a challenge the words were such as any acquaintance might have spoken but the air with which she pronounced them was very portentous susan recalled the conversation on her porch the evening after that spectacular feast at pilgrim

thelma had said with great frankness speaking of girls and of william we all have our ambition for the noblest and there is no sensible girl in this town who doesnt acknowledge him our best it is a game be sure you play it well if he wants you why you are his if he wants me then i am his but at present the honor is all yours and i am giving you the right of way then flashed before her another potent utterance of thelma spoken that same evening when she informed the girls that her mother had said be patient and wait thelma had affirmed as a reply if the mother is to marry the man let her do as she wishes but when the time comes for me to marry and i see the man i want i do not promise to wait wait wait for him to choose someone else i suppose ill make the fight of my life to get him there will be no escape well fight it out if it takes all summer if i lose i will have made a good fight the whole scene came before her like a panorama evidently thelma had come to the decision that now was the time for her to marry probably at last she had seen the man she wanted and had resolved to fulfill her prophecy of several years past

if susan understood any woman other than herself it was thelma she knew that the belligerency characteristic of miss haskell in her childhood was even with her now the words spoken on that momentous evening were even at this time very important and prognostic thelma by her utterance made as she arrived at the door of the reception hall had apparently so far as her friend was concerned cast a bold defiance susan was quite aware that she must pick up the gauntlet and enter the lists accordingly she thot william must speak tonight 

susan tried to analyze the feelings of the man she loved but he was not one to wear them on his face then she remembered that while thelma was speaking she herself had not lookt at him she had been regarding her friend thelma

when all the others had gone and at last she and william were alone susan led him to the divan she desired not to be disturbed when they were seated she said tauntingly pardon me please but i brot you here taking for granted that you didnt plan to dance had you made any arrangement for such

susan do not mock me you know im a minister he pleaded

but how liberal you are william she pronounced his name with great affection most ministers would do away with all laughter and enjoyment

people do call me liberal i am probably however more practical than liberal i see that it is instinctive for people at times to give vent to their feelings in rhythmic motion they do this even in their religious services those not possessed of a strong religious fervor will dance such at least is my conviction yet i can not subscribe to unrestricted dancing i oppose public receptions because the people dance indiscriminately and without supervision i have nothing to say however against a supervised private dance where one knows or may become well acquainted with all the others

furthermore if i were not a minister iâid ask you join me in a quadrille

then william you think it all right for the masses to dance but not for ministers why shouldnt right be the same for all persons she inquired in the spirit of twentieth century impatience

so it is tho some believe it to be otherwise to be frank id dance here tonight if i did not believe it would interfere with some work i aim to do in the spring sometimes in my efforts to aid the younger folk i see them practicing so much vulgarity with their dances that i feel like calling upon the ministers and their wives together with other earnest church folk to learn to dance open a dancing school and teach our generation the beauties of rhythmic motion

if ministers would do this service they would get a firm hold on their young people such as they have never had but for me to suggest this to them even ten years from now would be an aeroplanes dropping a bomb on an unfortified city yet if i enter an assembly like this two years from tonight i will hardly miss a dance and i will be a minister still bishops used to train people to dance without any lowering of their religious dignity the same can be done today

at this utterance she smiled with eagerness ill be waiting for those years to pass i certainly want to see you on the floor with whom will you take your first dance she inquired playfully

with my wife i hope

susan paused questioning whether she should ask what crost her mind would the boldness be a sacrifice of modesty her mother had said wait let the man take the initiative she had waited long and so had thelma susan delayed no longer pardon me for being bold but do you have any idea who the lady will be tho she smiled again william began to feel the sure charms of a noble woman enmeshed by many conventionalities

i have not decided that as yet i do have an idea as to whom i should like for it to be thats my principal reason for coming here tonight im old enough i think at least to begin to settle the question of marriage william had never been so confidential whom could he have in mind but her but hadnt she led him on still if he did not mean to consider her why did he not tactfully turn the question to discuss some other subject he continued confidentially do you think you could dance with a minister

susan somewhat bowd her head if you were to leave the ministry id dance with you at any time upon any occasion scruples would go to the winds if you were to ask me to dance with you tonight i think i could not id beg you not to insist and you would yield wouldnt you however if the minister two years from tonight should ask me to dance with him in public i could do so i should have prepared myself for it

would you require that much time he askt sportively

im not sure but i certainly could not bring myself to do so tonight even if you were ready

is there present any young woman who would do so now he was teasing

thelma would be so defiant i believe why did she say defiant

now tell me why you would not

mother and some of the older membersof pilgrim wouldnt like it theyd accuse me of making you fall from grace you know i desire their benedictions then turning the conversation somewhat he said susan we met during my years in high school but casually towards my graduation we did find time to establish a close friendship the summer before i first went to college i saw you by appointment but not frequently

that was because i followed strictly the counsel of my parents when i had made my debut however i became more selfpropelled but by that time you had to go away

you know however that i admired you he spoke fondly

but the heart craves more than admiration

then came our letters ceasing to be formal vividly announcing a mutual love since i have finisht my schooling i have had ample opportunity to study you closely i do not say i know you thoroly for we can become better acquainted

i understand

i came here this evening to ask you to be my wife very unconventional isnt it for a minister to make a proposal of marriage at a dance

she admired his frankness and directness even tho he had made it difficult for her to reply at length she said and youre not going to ask of course she meant the opposite her entire being indicated this her eyes spoke worlds of entreaties to say nothing of many graces

i was wondering if we could be happy together he held her hand tenderly susan there is no question in my mind about my love for you i certainly love you more than any woman ive ever met it is because i do love you truly that i could give you up if by so doing i should make you could not move freely among the guests he decided upon the parlor as the place where he might be most free he felt like singing and entered into it with zest he lookt at her lovingly and then requested play your favorite my favorite it was the rosary upon hearing the delicate strains most music lovers would have felt certain that a professional was singing so full and clear were the tones his closing was truly a climax

before he could finish the parlor was once more being invaded mr and mrs lee had now arrived and proceeded at once to find william to congratulate him they were glad to find him singing for susan conversations flowed along variously but ever now and then came hints o another announcementâthat of william and susan when the orchestra began a minuet however the disturbers were gone once more

susan said william i have told you my feelings in speech and song i will sing you another lyric which will tell the same you see i love you you see i will marry you if our temperaments are not so diverse as to prevent genuine companionship if you think we can lets decide now

why did he not positively ask her to marry him and take the responsibility of making her happy she would have assumed it for him if he had only spoken as she had desired why did she not say anyhow william we can be perfect companions our rearing and education are not so widely diversed as to make ideal companionship impossible you will be the best husband in the world i will be the best wife isnt that enough lets seal it with a kiss society said the man should take the initiative probably it is better to wait awhile she thot she waited

when the music in the dance hall ceased again william offered to sing another songâthen youll remember me it thrilled the souls of both

at the close of the linen shower william walkt home with susan but he made no more formal proposal than that already spoken at the door he took her hand to bid her good night but he did not kiss her she wondered if he would she hoped strongly for she was well aware that had he kissed her he would have proposed according to her most exact desire this he did not do but with a solemn expression and head somewhat downcast he went home in deep reflection

as for susan she feared that she would lose him if she did not act quickly within three days he would return she would claim him then

in her chamber almost thru the entire night she mused upon thelmas momentous words if he wants me then i am his but at present the honor is all yours and i am giving you the right of way    but when the time comes for me to marry and i see the man i want i do not promise to wait wait wait for him to choose some one else i suppose ill make the fight of my life to get him there will be no escape well fight it out if it takes all summer if i lose i will have made a good fight had susan made a good fight

sixteen months had past since william attended the linen shower during these days many signal events had occurred to make more potent the life of seaton and williamsburg letitia had married sinclair catherine had married henry but susan had not been able to obtain the kind of proposal she desired she was waiting probably he would come some day william had not called regularly as previously susan had not inquired into his reasons but lookt to herself to discover the reason for the failure was her temperament against her the handicaps of nature were the hardest to offset but she would make the attempt

she lost no time she estbalisht the coleridgetaylor conservatory of music for instruction in piano organ violin violoncello mandolin and guitar with five assistants as she desired to test her initiative she kept her plans secret until she was ready to mail her dedication announcements the conservatory had from the time of its inception been carefully advertised but the prime mover was unknown because of the location mentioned many persons wondered who was the promoter the affair however was so tactfully managed that the public was completely surprised because the enterprise was carefully planned the institution was a success from its very opting william and susan were both satisfied since even her mother had not been consulted in this endeavor she had an argument for her efficiency

thelma was yet teaching in the louverture college but she was devoting most of her spare time to community welfare work she had reclaimed a number of girls from houses of ill resort and having taught them the arts of the home had them become industrial factors and makers of citizens in this activity she had been aided by the y w c a which rejoiced that she had started a work long neglected but very necessary in our multifarious lives that institution had vainly tried to reach the abandoned girls the coming of thelma was thus a providential favor since she had succeeded in an unparalled way the workers of the young womens christian association were glad to cooperate both in initial and followup work the mistake had been made in the manner in which these persons had been approacht before the administration of the present secretary the young womens christian association was an exclusive club for the wives and daughters of the best women in the town the masses were approacht but only with an extreemly long handled spoon fortunately the last secretary was a woman of the people when she explained her plans to thelma she found a willing missionary thelma had gone to those fallen human beings not as their superior but as their equalâone prone to err her attitude was veritably that of a friend

so well had she conducted her work that she was hailed by the ministers as a palpable apostle of practical christianity she was deemed the making of the young womens christian association

the spring following the party at mrs annelles william purchased a farm of six hundred acres situated about eight miles from seaton on this tract of land he placed six fiveroom cottages for his croppers whom he expected to work fiftyacre tracts near these houses he placed the necessary barns and stables that his helpers might concentrate upon their special work being able to start with the best advantages this was a great advance because on the surrounding farms the people lived in cabins about a half a mile from the railroad he built a brick house and furnisht it like a house in the city among the welltodo

for the home site he used five acres which he had designed by a landscape gardener that it might have the appearance of a suburban estate across the entire front of the house he extended a porch in steel gray colonaded with gothic pillars various plants which would bloom thruout the season arose before the porch roses rooster cones hyacinthes lilacs snowballs crysthanthemums and others about fifty yards from the house in every direction extended a neatly trimmed hedge which appropriately set off the evenly cut grass here and there was placed shrubbery to add to the charm of symmetry leading to the house were graveled walks which connected with the main road and that to the garage

about a quarter mile from this site he had built a church with a seating capacity of three hundred tho a frame structure it was beautiful both within and without

about a quarter mile from the home site in the opposite direction could be found the farm buildings which would come under williams immediate supervision directly to the rear of his house was a fifty acre tract given over equally to an orchard and an experimental farm the rest of his land was for staple crops

here william spent most of his time assuredly changing the status of farmers about seaton preaching a progressive gospel to an increasing congregation and commanding the attention and respect of the entire state

thelma had been deeply imprest with the news of williams attainment and like the queen of sheba dissatisfied with the report she wanted to see for herself

the truth is thelma had never had for beckett king the deep affection she cherisht for william as she had said on mr lees porch that autumnal evening she had given susan the right of way while smith was in college and the theological school she had shown susan how to win up to the night of the linen shower she had not placed an obstacle before her friend what had caused her to change she would not reveal but evidently she was bent on marrying the young clergyman if she could  and susan seemed to know it

to speak justly of susan none could call her narrow she had always been above little things not only would she refrain from speaking ill of thelma when she discerned the change of attitude she actually praised her how noble is the soul of woman if she and thelma now were rivals such they had not always been thelma had never written william a line tho he had written her once from college whose advice had been the most pointed in her gaining the clergymans affection  thelmas she was fully aware what should be done to marry the sometime prophet of sinai shrine

sixteen months had elapsed since that eventful night eight months more remained at the end of which time he would dance with his wife would it be susan or thelma she feared if she did not act quickly it would be thelma at last she accepted her friends advice she would make the fight of her life

that evening when thelma came in after having supervised a club meeting at the y m c a contrary to her wont mrs anderson with whom she lodged was not on the porch but was in the parlor with her motherâmrs haskellâand rev ross thelma knew that her pastor admired the summer breeze with an appreciation more uproarious than her own altho the day had been unusually hotâit was the first week in julyâthere he was within doors

as soon as she had removed her hat and gloves she returned to the parlor and shook hands with rev ross once more when she had seated herself in an arm chair he spoke of her community work which had received practically all her time during the vacation he commended her for it hoping she would draw even more women about her as aids

thelma had the highest admiration for her pastor because his every activity was guided by a conscious purpose thus she discerned at once that he had not come to discuss her service as a social worker she decided therefore to make him state his business

mrs anderson however prevented this by interrupting thus pardon me but what do you think of the work of rev smith she was about to answer her own question but hesitated when she saw that rev ross was going to speak

i think it really phenomenal put in rev ross each time i think of it i regret the fiasco which occurred at the convention if ever there was an apostle of christianity william is the man like christ he has been misunderstood but he is in spite of it reaping a harvest of souls

im glad he has risen regardless of the opposition from those who should have helped him up in their hearts i know they are sorry for they see that some day they must bring him back and apologize dont fight against god said mrs haskel deeply moved she was a christian of the old school

somehow it has seemed queer to me remarkt rev ross looking pointedly at thelma that there isnt a mrs william smith on that estate whats the trouble thelma all who had grown up in his church from infancy he continued to call by their first names i hope the girls of this town wont let him escape to be seized by a lady of seaton

i think well take care of that said thelma smiling and did not blush at all

t suppose some of the girls will be wanting to see that splendid estate well have to get up a party that they may go wont we he said to mrs anderson

thelma now knew that mrs anderson had spoken to the minister of the conversation of the previous night what a delight that would be she exclaimed but i have decided to go tomorrow

ill try then to arrange for a party to go with you was the ministers tactful remark

rev ross i am going on business and will make the trip alone she spoke with firmness her tone distinctly indicating that she desired no company she was almost angry but was doing her utmost to keep composed the minister was somewhat unprepared for such a direct thrust accordingly he had to pause for thot while he reflected for a reply not a word was spoken thelma was waiting for his next remark the others felt themselves unqualified to take the initiative at length after a few moments he said pleadingly are you aware of the risk you take

i am aware of everything was her interruption

you must remember tho you are a woman if you do this your name will become common gossip when this happens to a school teacher in this town it is not long before she is compelled to do something else the minister argued

rev ross if the board of trustees wants my position it is welcome to it i lived before they employed me and ill live when i have left them you say i am a woman  she emphasized the word because im full grown i feel that i can look after myself if i should tarnish my character by making this call i have womanhood enough to offer my resignation without any outside request if i thot i could not make it without being sullied i never should have accepted the position such is my confidence in the board of trustees that i believe they would never have employed me if they thot i could not make a trip like this and end it as id begin it you are impugning not only me but those discreet gentlemen who placed me here

you dont know what youre saying i went into ill resorts to save abandoned women and came out as i went in you know how long i have been doing this you and your entire brotherhood have praised me for my courage and moral strength now when i go to call on a manâthe noblest character in these parts the most lovable individual youve ever met and you know itâyou infer that my character will be besmirched

dont you see im trying to guard your good name rev ross replied i believe in you fully but it is not so with my associates if you go unchaperoned of course i will defend you but i do not want to see you out of the schools your influence over the girls has been most wholesome so well do you know how to guide

the irony of it yet i can not guide myself if i go i suppose i shall be treated as was william well ill give the holy church a chance she paused to observe the effect of her bitter utterance as no one spoke she continued since i have reacht the age of discretion i can manage my own affairs i never let others attend to my business it is proper for william to board a train to come to see me yet its improper for me to board a train to go to see him men can do as they please but women must not suit their fancies fie upon your double standard of morality that requires good girls to marry trashy men fie upon conventionalities which permit men to sow wild oats but deny the same to girls fie upon your society women who will kick out one of their own sex but will hurriedly embrace the scoundrel who ruined the girl they scorn such is the church such is the home such is society rev ross wanted to speak but she stopped him i defy you all if i hadnt thot of going alone id certainly go now ive made up my mind it would take all the powers of heaven to stay me so it is useless for hell to try she almost screamed

mrs haskell was much embarrassed the others were greatly surprised thelma said the mother it seems as tho you have no respect for your pastor

mother i honor him in the highest i appreciate his counsel but i can not follow it now i have there in seaton a work of my own to do and nobody can do it for me i will leave tomorrow at eightthirty even at this time all is definitely arranged i will remain here however only on one condition that is if nature opposes if tomorrow the plains become mountains and touch the skies if the streams i must cross become shoreless seas if the lights of heaven and all artificial light fade into mist

 thelma i must admire you said the pastor your strong will moves me irresistibly let me shake your hand you have done too much for the church for it to forsake you now i can not speak for my brethren but i can speak for myself may the peace of god be with you always god speed you on turning to the other ladies he remarkt thelma is true blue id trust her with anything even my life have no fear she is able to take care of her self thelma started towards the door then turned and said thank you rev ross but will you excuse me now i must be making ready for my journey

certainly he said thereupon she left the room

tho william had been on his estate just a little more than a year he had greatly changed the life of his environs can a man be born again who could doubt it now had not the cabins for ten miles around given place to cottages and weatherboard houses had not many who had left for the cities returned to the farms were there not more independent farmers just out from seaton than anywhere in the state and what had made possible the building of the new station but the new impetus give to farming

william had attracted considerable attention by experiments of various sorts at his demonstration farm for instance he showed the effect of different feeds on hogs having been able to market the heaviest hogs on an extremely economical concentrated food since his stock always topped the market other farmers began to seek his methods furthermore from the most uncompromising land he had by careful treatment of the soil obtained the greatest yields of com wherever his land was simply as good as that of a neighbor he produced almost twice as much as his fellow farmer he had exhibited also unusual skill in intensive truck gardening

williams specialties were hogs and small grains but since he was more than well versed in the many aspects of agriculture his experimental station became a frequent rendezvous here flockt both white and black to learn of this wizard of the soil

the morning following thelmas conversation with rev ross william began the days work in his orchard as it was likely that the threshing machine would not arrive until late in the afternoon or the next morning he would discuss with his croppers there some essentials of spraying and tillage also to contrast certain features of his orchard with those of several unprofitable fruit farms nearby one of these was on a well drained spot an excellent site for a lucrative orchard its failure to bear had been due to the fact that it was planted in sod the owner of that plot went with william to be informed along this line and observe the effect of cultivation on the delicacy of pulp and texture and the vigor of the new wood

while in the midst of his discussion one of his helpers handed him a special a glance at the familiar handwriting told him at once that it came from susan lee he was eager now for noon to come when the demonstration would have been concluded the visitors gone and leisure present since he had to wait he resigned himself without more ado from this point the farmers promptly noticed however that there was a change in their instructor his speech was rapid with a quivering tone yet the demonstration went on

how the time lingered how perplexing the weariness of waiting once he colored with the flush of vehement emotion almost as frequently as he put thots of susan aside they returned with greater vividness thus he was stirred till noon when he could have sweet moments of undisturbed reflection when he could think of all she had been and all he hoped her to be

fearing interruption by casual visitors william did not return to his house but went to his forest reserve at the farthest extremity of his farm as he stretched on the ground he noticed flitting and playing two humming birds so happy they seemed that he envied them he drew the letter from his pocket opened it then said to himself j wonder what she has to say now what does she think of me she trusted during these years in my sincerity have i been false i can not feel that i have but she has waited alone for me sometimes i think i should go at once to williamsburg and ask her point blank to marry me then i wonder if i can be the type of husband she desires she wants me to find my comfort in satisfying her desire for a home life created and sustained with equal enthusiasm by us both she loves the home i love a public career with a radicalism that may take me so frequently from her that i should almost have the status of a boarder if i can not be indeed a husband to furnish the companionship a mother and children should have if i lead a life which would soon make my wife a widow and my children orphans should i marry is not this the very thing she would oppose and would i not pursue my present way of life which is the result of years of thinking in spite of her opposition this would create between us a gulf which might become well nigh impassable

i love the girl i know better than my dreams of heaven but when the question arises of spending days weeks months and probably years with another i should have in mind her good fortune rather than mine if i can not make her happy i will not intake her miserable even for her own sake then he paused in his revery and wiped his face for it was quite warm at length the decision came let me see what she has to say it may be possible yet

he read carefully and with deep feeling

william my dear how are you since we said we should be permanent friends you will not think it presumptuous for me to ask about your health and welfare for a month you have not called or written tho you know the reason i am in the dark and dare not call for light

another month and another might have past without my writing for tho miles may keep between us our souls may touch with or without the aid of pen or voice tho there i know your heart is here by your very silence and all the world is awareâthe world in which i liveâthat my heart is happily with you you love me william am i wrong i believe you because you have proved it you have said it you have sung it you have lived it you love me more than any you have met if  err tell me so but for this you have no tongue for if we live i have written truly

long has been my pondering and long my hesitation you know i was taught to wait however the last few days have given birth to events which may greatly alter the lives of us both i shall not here state what they are but let it suffice that they prompt me now to act my dear you are a man and being a man who has loved one woman it is impossible for you not to have varying inclinations for all my sex i laugh to scorn his utterance who says of several women that he cares as much for one as for another such affection i consider wholly impossible i agree with canouib when he says beauty must be scorned in none tho but truly served in one these lines reflect your personality

almost a year and a half have past since you gave me hope of womans greatest joy true to my sex i have feasted on it desiring always its immediate realization in this you have made a conquest but i have not tho yet i have hope tho still i think you love me best even now during these sixteen months your admiration for my friend thelma may at this time border on the beginnings of passionate love all this while you have been wondering whether to marry me have you not had sufficient time i am ready to hear the best or the worst but please end the suspense

it may happen that you will not marry me but you will not find a woman wholl love you more than i nor will there come the man that i shall love more than you yet we may not marry that is a matter for you alone to decide i say this because our artificial society makes it possible for individuals not to get their choices even during my brief existence i have met women who say they did not marry the man they loved best because these men did not propose moreover father tells me that my mother was not his best love but that his choice jilted him and married someone else

when i think of these conditions i drift at once to milton who expresses in the lines i shall quote a great truth if we consider them as applying not only to the man but also to the woman baffled in love he says for either he never shall find out fit mate but such as some misfortune brings him or mistake or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain thru her perverseness but shall see her gaind by a far worse or if she love withheld by parents or his happiest choice too late shall meet already linkt and wedlockbound to a fell adversary his hate or shame which infinite calamity shall cause to human life and househould peace confound william light of my life the barriers to your realization vanisht long years ago and i thot that mine had vanisht but here they are

during those days you were in college how i cried and prayed that you would finish and come back to me at last you did return and i claimed you for my own then you were mine and i was yours

love think of the nights of anguish think of the days of weary waiting your soul has so mingled with my own that i am yours and you are mine for ever you may wed someone else but as for me never do as you think best for me and for you but our spirits cannot dwell apart

i am that type of woman that loves one and once to be disappointed in love will cause me unutterable langour but william i will not die i shall suffer but i will not die if i should go you would soon follow but i must live my love that you may live your work has just begun and you need womanly counsel for the good of your work for the good of the community for your own good decide this matter without delay i will make any sacrifice for you you need my advice come let me give it or i shall come to you

sixteen months ago you intimated that two years from that eventful night you would be married that same night thelma began an intimacy with you which since has forced you to take notice i am extremely frank now because i feel that we should understand each other thoroly if ill must come of this may it be speedy if good i can wait forever

william i have tried to be frank and specific surely you understand me i do not know what your answer will be but as you love me truly you will act for the greater happiness of us both true eight months life before you and as you have always kept your work i know you cannot do less now

hearts everywhere are beating for their lovers yours is beating and so is mine nights and days of anxious waiting for you my heart beats every hour my hope of ages rests upon you my childhood dreams i longed to come true do you not hear me faintly calling calling to you heart atuned to love in the distance can you not hear the call of love dearest oh dear i am seeking seeking the one man for me love my soul is calmly pleading love you will come to me 

do not deceive yourself you are my friend you are my all in all and i am yours in the past the present and the future susan

when william had finisht he started homeward full of the emotion susan had aroused the curtain seemed to have been lifted and he saw what he was and what he hoped to be i see the way i will answer he thot today then as soon as the wheat harvest is over i will go to her she shall wait no longer

william bent on making himself wholly subservient to the gladness he had just found hurried onward suffused with the glow of the coming achievement the wild flowers now took on a grander aspect the trees were now brighter than ever the squirrels frolickt with great glee peculiarly thrilled with glee the birds made soothing harmonies would you believe all this was a part of him the sun of splendid happiness had given him a new birth for he became aware that with this awakening his soul could sleep no more no more was it good for him to be alone he knew that before the close of summer he would marry there was no other way

as he came towards the rear of his garage he was met by one of his helpers who had been seeking him for some time rev smith he said rejoicing that his effort was now successful a lady wants to see you at the house she wouldnt give her name shes been there now more than an hour besides my madame says she fears she must scold you for dinner has been ready almost as long

william wondered who could it be was it possible that susan had come anyhow  she had said if he did not come to her she would come to him how would he receive her he would receive her as she deserved

mr brown he said then paused a moment for reflection tell your wife put on an extra plate we shall have company for dinner this afternoon just as soon as i brush up and wash ill be in im glad i didnt come from the front

mr brown proceeded to deliver his message and william prepared to meet his guest when he had finisht he came to his parlor in his khaki trousers and khaki shirt from the neck of which suspended a knitted black tie this habit together with his tan shoes and leather puttees gave him the appearance of an american soldier of  sometimes visitors upon seeing him thus attired askt if he was in the service of his country meaning of course if he were a soldier he would reply yes ive been in the service of the country all my life however im not a soldier tho if necessary i fight im not a member of the standing army but i do oelong to the working army which is to help according to our presidents phrase to make the world safe for democracy his dress was always impressive

william lost no time in his preparations as he neared the arch leading from the dining room to the parlor his soul felt a yearning it was trying to burst the bonds of present experience to grasp at others more profound he sought to fathom the impassable to know and yet be not known mr brown had been unable to describe the visitor with the distinctness with which he had pictured others in such a way as to cause william to be fully aware who the person was that is if the two had ever met why had the gentleman failed in this instance was it because he did not look fastidiously due to the ladys being of the common place or to his being face to face with such an extraordinary presence as overawed him before he could become selfcomposed how for once he wisht the impossible that intervening doors might vanish without ruin that supernatural sight transcending all clairvoyants might serve him at this hour then he realized the wish was vain that happiness arises from the natural that it is not good always to know what is hid to know what each tomorrow will bring it would take away all the surprises most of the laughs and much of the joy of life

he was satisfied at last not to know until he would see her face he took a step forward and paused in his heart there was great rejoicing the new day had come at last each thing he toucht seemed spirited with the benevolence of an aladdin genius so that it would ever now be different with a splendor intrinsic and ideal the brush he used was lighter for with each movement to make himself suited for the teteatete visions arose of home enchanted of williams and susans yet to be he walkt now with better grace for the call of youths unborn was lingering with him and as he moved on the old world had past away and he saw a new heaven and a new earth as garments which have long kept us company till other fashions seem more worth the while eventually pass for the more novel to bring a long awaited joy william left old thots behind to cling to those which susan had conjured up his dream of dearness now was tangible one goal at least he had reacht at last

on other occasions when visitors had been announced william had had no trepidation the coming of strangers was entirely a matter of course they were welcomed feasted and entertained with the characteristic southern hospitality but he had felt no depth of passion no unusual desire to see his guest in this instance he had already delayed too long if it were only susan he hoped that it was only she he rusht into the parlor to greet her who had called he was face to face with a woman almost peerless with a queen of beauty and of love heiress of great princes of egypt of a people great in every land he came forward astonisht he bowed as a plumed knight and with a cheery smile shook hands with thelma

she was the first to speak for william was too firmly besieged with amazement and consternation thelma understood in advance that her coming would be a surprise how great this would be of course she did not comprehend im glad to see you william how have you been how are you you have indeed a wonderful establishment here i hope to view it more minutely as the train flew over the trestle just out from happy forge a stranger to me but a friend to youâa mr trundle hopeâaskt me if i had seen your estate when i told him i had not he said that i was just where i could obtain a fine view of it if i only had a field glass when i produced one he took great pride in indicating and explaining the various parts of your land of hearts desire would you believe me if i told you i saw a group of white and colored men in the north western section of your farm but their features were not plainly distinguishable william was glad that she had some idea of the place because he could pass over many details and dwell upon the aspects of chief interest he continued silent as a consequence thelma went on that view of course since it was largely panoramic was seen from too great a distance to reveal some features which should leave with me a kaleidoscopic impression in this i need have no doubt you will place everything at my disposal you will want me to speak to your friends in williamsburg with authority for they are desirous of all they can learn of you

yes my whole farm shall be at your disposal said william now gaining his equipoise im glad youve come and hope you will not regret having called upon the humblest vorker of these parts but he gave great emphasis to the word you have come alone why didnt some of the others come also the more the merrier our party would be it seems that susan would have been good company he hesitated before pronouncing susans name then uttered it with noticeable feeling thelma was not daunted by this outburst she had planned well and was consequently ready for all surprises

with wonted frankness she said susan im sure didnt know i was coming he thot of susans statements concerning his fair caller of the letter which had given him a new birth at once he discerned that another battle was on to those who were eager to come i said nothing i wanted to see you alone she admitted william now saw that susan divined aright was not thelmas last utterance an avowal of love when a woman tells a man she wants to see him alone or if the man has so told the woman is it not because of something admired is it not because of love thelma continued by saying rev ross mother and mrs anderson suggested getting up a party but that would have required probably several days as i was in the spirit of coming i would not wait i might have told susan but thinking i should not i have come alone

william found himself at once in a quandary as to what could be the purport of her excursion he listened almost breathlessly for as she spoke his thots went back to williamsburg where clustered in romantic musing and temporarily resigned satisfaction was one who had come out of dreamland fairyland or eldorado to make a conquest of his heart could there yet come another

as he wanted thelma to relish her visit he checkt that flow of thots and askt if she had brought baggage and whether it had been properly cared for i brought simply a bag with me was her response which i left with mrs johnson in town she says that you have helped her much by sending to her visitors to spend the night or to remain several days

i was referred to her by the secretary of the y w c a as the rooms there had all been taken as she is both winsome and congenial i have no doubt that well become bosom friends besides she commends you highly

mrs johnson is one of my dearest friends im glad youre well situated now i can be composed come have some dinner he said incoherently extending towards her his hand with a gentle bow im sure you must be hungry since you arrived this morning at ten oclock your subsequent time must have been given to adjusting your affairs but how long do you plan to be here 

i dont know was her quick response they started tor the dining room absorbed in several big ideas i may go back tonight or tomorrow or i may remain several days all depends upon how much i can accomplish

william found himself once more wondering what she could have in mind

they sat down to a well spread table as only one is spread where there is loving and rural abundance both were thrilled with the opportunity to enjoy a good repast and showed such by hearty application while thus engaged she thot she would make an excellent first impression by showing a deep interest in the work he dearly loved she was testing this philosophyâto be sure it was some of her ownâfor a woman to win the affection of man she would profit by being deeply interested in those activities which interested him she might have in some instances different views but his interests needed to become her interests thus she knew definitely where to begin william she said commencing the conversation the very fact that i have come this distance alone despite thunders of criticism indicates that we have at least something in common namely the success of your experiment here i have frequently heard from afar that you are engaged in a great work well thats nothing new to me for thru all these years ive known you so far as my intelligence permits me to observe a great work has alone been able to attract you somewhat abasht he thankt her for her compliment true ive heard something from others but should like to know at first hand from you what is the nature and scope of your endeavor you know that during vacation i devote practically all my time to community work my specialty is to reach the girl who has fallen yet i give some time to other girls and even to boys since you yourself are naturally magnetic and radiate inspiration i am here to catch even the faintest gleams of incentive and carry them to persons almost devoid of hope tell me therefore what you are doing and what is the ultimate attainment you have in mind

i am engaged in an experiment thelma which i feel should succeed yet i can not be too certain tho i may realize many great accomplishments ordinarily when men engage in experimentation they have their equipment so well under control that a large amount of success is rather sure i am speaking of course of the best scientists mine however is an experiment in democracy i am trying to convert the prejudice against races into an hostility against particular individuals who wilfully neglect to make the best of opportunities and who expect to reap tho they have not sown to see to it that he who sows shall reap to place in public office the man who is most efficient and unselfish to give every man an equal chance to rise no matter whence he comes or what he has been

at this point mrs brown seated herself as would a proud hostess to eat with them until all were ready for dessert william introduced thelma to mrs brown in order that all might participate in informing not only his guest but as he said their guest mrs brown sometimes would join in also her husband on this occasion however she preferred to listen and not to speak

william you have indeed a great task before you one which may require many generations for its completion it is more than a life work

thats true still we may be able to speed it on its way

but you have located here in the south amidst a people committed not to democracy but aristocracy an ideal which has been with this section since the importation of the first slaves probably even earlier here prejudice goes rampant true a few of our people vote but the many are shamefully disfranchised while white men more ignorant than they go to the polls here you are faced with the so called jim crow cars on railroads and street car lines partial courts and frequent manifest humiliation she wanted him to feel the bigness of his undertaking

thelma he said with assurance t feel the weight of all you spoke but do you think i can find democracy anywhere in these united states she shook her head youre a graduate of one of our best northern universities tell me if you found democracy there

tho i went shoulder to shoulder with the first in my class not for once during my entire stay did i feel that i was not colored

of course my effort here is more strenuous than it would be in pennsylvania or new york but if the proper relations can be realized in the south between black and white the battle practically speaking will have been won

youre not doing this alone tho are you thelma inquired with a dainty smile

no not now i have five croppers to aid me aside from the cooperation of three white farmers who specialize in tobacco then there are others who have aided me by mentioning my endeavor in their addresses before white audiences especially has this been true of editors and ministers

give me some idea of an instance wherein you have done something to break down prejudice she implored wanting to be satisfied

in this country he began firmly for about five years farmers believed it unprofitable to grow white potatoes and onions for the market they never ceast to grow them for their tables but had left off producing them for sale

seeing that the soil in this country was particularly adapted to the growing of these two vegetables i thot the failure to hit was due to the preparation of the soil accordingly i askt mr brown who had planned to grow only tomatoes to plant onions and potatoes instead he was reluctant because he is a specialist in tomatoes but i gave him a guarantee of four thousand dollars the amount he expected to realize from his tomatoes in addition to this i had him put in an acre for each of these crops at the demonstration farm i told some farmers what we were doing and askt them to visit us when we could show the plants the cultivation and results we invited both white and black when the season closed we had attained signal success

in the same way i suggested to my other croppers what they should make their staple crops since our products became preferred because of lusciousness texture marketing and storing qualities demands have arisen thruout the state for the privilege of attending our demonstrations and obtaining suggestions as to the most economical way of producing a quality maximum yield

thelma wanted to see him thru but as she was speedily brot to an appreciation of the magnitude of his work she felt compelled to interrupt you know william she said with interest achievement is not unaccompanied by other things

we must pay the price of success some i doubt not envy you and by your own words many already seek to learn of you true you are young and vigorous but are youth and health everything i fear you may work too hard i do not mean to be inquisitorial but are you doing all this without advice without well qualified helpers

smith was somewhat disconcerted for he had not been greeted hitherto by thots of his own welfare now that they had been spoken they brot reflection this did not last long so he replied my croppers are my helpers particularly mr brown and mr wilson my specialist in orchard gardening when we decide to launch a movement in the interest of a particular crop we meet in conference arrange plans and detail the work thus no one needs to do too much

but you are the prime mover besides you are a minister are you not exhausting your strength to the extent that you need a counsellor to restrain you

nothing worth while thelma is accomplisht without much work as for my being a preacher you know you and susan both opposed my forsaking my chief calling i am merely keeping my promise my preaching now is more effective than ever for not only in trying to spur others to get a thoro education and achieve can i point to the success of others but i can indicate very forcibly the attainment of those about me they understand what i mean when i preach the word was made flesh and dwelt among us 

i was wondering tho if your sacrifice were not too great your work instead of obtaining the goodwill of the ordinary white farmer may merely aggravate the evil you are trying to stamp out havent you really excelled him pray tell me what white man wants to see a colored man outdo him inquired the fair guest

they may not desire it but in many ways they ignore it they ignore it they allowed booker t washington to outdo them they allow our boys in college in many instances to forge ahead they just cant help themselves if i havent said enough this i know will suffice the white man everywhere allows his dark brother to excell him in unselfishness religion and loyalty william protested with firm assurance

thelma responded with her usual complacence in this you are right but wont the southern demagogs the products of color prejudice or rather to some extent the makers of color prejudice do you great wrong your intentions are strictly logical but are you not trying to alter conditions which in themselves are so mighty that they may ultimately engulf you

that is true he admitted but wrong must be righted truth and right must prevail as the apostle of truth and right im ever ready to pay the priceâeven to die kelley miller our great chieftain a calm thinker reminds us when we would be rash that the pen is mightier than the sword he says that almost invariably it has required shot and shell to knock wrong doctrine out of the heads of some white men as is instanced by most of the wars of history at last has appeared a lover of peace the colored man in america a man who can fight but a lover of peace devoted to peace after principles purely pacific the speech of edmund burke on conciliation with the american colonies with very slight modification is our plea today the principles therein embodied are applicable to all backward and opprest peoples right never changes the english colonists stood oppression for a hundred and fifty years and gained their political freedom by the sword and not by the pen we hope that what kelley miller informs us has been true thru the ages will not be true in our realizing liberty weve already shed blood for the liberty of others may that also suffice for our own

it is too hot for receptions pilgrim however is planning an excursion to seaton for the express purpose of allowing the members to see just what they have inspired they have never forsaken you you are theirs now even as you were years ago when the convention closed its pulpits to you pilgrim continued to say come as you will recall they did not understand all you said but they trusted in your sincerity they love you because you always loved them

if they had forsaken me i should not have disliked them for i knew some of my utterances shockt them now that they have been so liberal as not to allow the old love to cease i cherish them all the more i shall be happy to place my farm at their disposal

but how is my mother i wish she would come here yet i appreciate her reasons for remaining where she is well do i remember after that eventful convention i myself was so enrapt with the past that i preferred to linger there how i wisht to stay yet i had to leave an important work awaited me i had to rise unto my place by this time they had finisht their dessert so william escorted her to the parlor she was well imprest with her experiences and was confident that her trip was not in vain

once she started to mention williams mother but believing that her end would be better served if he suggested the theme she waited until he had given her the cue then she said your mother is quite well i suppose youre unaware that i go to see her almost as to a shrine i go so frequently i went just before coming here as i wanted to come fresh with news of her she had thot for some time of visiting you but learning of the plans at pilgrim she thot shed wait for mrs green isnt it remarkable how your mother seems to take no account of time she might easily pass for an elder sister yet her life has been strenuous to aid you in realizing your chief aims

i have much to prize in her for tho she would have preferred my settling in williamsburg she was broad enough to see that like a prophet of old i had to seek honor in a distant country i have been unable to bring her here yet if my success depended upon her presence in seaton she would have been here long ago thelma had not erred in her judgment  for the tie between mother and son was unusually strong

to make a master stroke and prepare for subsequent effort she would become personal she had to gain time or as some would put it she had to make up for lost time no letters had passed between her and william never had they met alone except to pass the conventional greeting this was their first teteatete thelma planned that this should not be their last furthermore she intended to write whether he would answer was not the question but she must somehow thrill his soul since she knew william had commended her with an admiration which might involve great promise she was always optimistic she could not however construe it as the love that makes man and woman one there was susan whom she knew william loved she also knew that his calls had recently been markt by long intervals a sign of the estoppage of love but as she had ceased regularly to call on susan she felt sure that susan suspected her ordinarily susan would wait it was her temperament would she wait now thelma was afraid to take any risk she said therefore certainly you miss your mother and probably others who have cheered you much

yes he replied i do miss them so much that i rejoice when anyone comes from those parts

for sometime that has been my belief she affirmed looking at him bashfully and then lowering her head it seems your work tho well organized needs one other helper

and pray what is he to do

to give you constant counsel to keep you from working too hard a great man needs a wife ive wondered why youve waited so long i can say this because when we were quite young we said whatever we pleased to each other but when you stept into manhood and i into womanhood susan came between since then we have kept apart i have said this reluctantly but i am speaking only for your good she knew she was playing with fire

thelma i have been thinking of it and have about reacht a decision i have not i fear dealt fairly with susan but i will do so now by the way let me show you the farm brown is coming with the auto i will tell you more of what you suggested as we go over the farm william had spoken before he was fully aware of the significance of his words the idea came to him that thelma might be interpreting his remarks for her own contentment should he speak freely certainly it was best for her to know susan had hinted that thelma was her rival william held both women in high esteem and he would have both happy but he made up his mind that rivalry would have to cease

at present thelma was his guest and as such she would receive hearty welcome he helped her into his chandler and started over the estate how beautiful it is to have such pleasure i think i must make seaton my home she remarkt

he replied thelma seaton would be glad to have you

thelma and william were kindred spirits bom anew this day with visions bright they sailed on and on for a time they said nothing to each other because there were elfish voices skipping thru the air that had a language lovingly their own the breezes pure and serene told of journeys over seas to distant lands where gods folk just rising unto place wisht civilization would embrace the world the laughing birds scouting on wing suggested the nobility of companionship yet they had their foes many perisht each winter some hastening on the return of spring were stopt by the bullet of civilized barbarism for all this they could not help singing the gladness of the time to fashion a dvorakain symphony like unto that of the new world the trees joined in with measured bows gracefully gesticulating to the strains resounding full and free

what need of speech when all else was talking the whispering birds the lowing cows the bleating lambs the capricious calf the prancing horse  for quite a long while thelma and william could only be silent but their souls were not quiet at all great idealists like them could not be near and at the same time distant the glance of an energetic eye a dynamic expression of profound interest and astonishment and the understanding of a purposive personality conjured up avenues of communications inexpressible in song or speech each thus soared in imagination surmising the beautiful in the other dreaming of the grandeur of being together making noble the common place

they stopt at all buildings for this was the courtesy shown all visitors tho there was the temptation to be personal and use the time for intercourse touching the crystalline experiences of childhood and youth william thot of the reason why thelma had come her trip should realize that end with this in mind he showed her the cosy homes of his croppers

when he had completed the tour promptly with the world before her in panoramic view she wondered how he could afford this his answer was capitalism of today is wrong it does not eliminate classes rather it fixes them a wage earner gets hardly a tenth of the wealth he produces the bulk goes to the enterpreneur i might within fifteen or twenty years easily accumulate a million but a millionaire is an anachronism in a democracy i am striving to give the worker all he produces at the same time to keep a minimum for my counsel and guidance thus i never have any trouble getting workers furthermore i run my farm on the eighthour plan except during seed time and harvest when we go far beyond this during these seasons the laborers are given double pay for all extra time

ive been thinking that youre making trouble for yourself how do neighboring farmers take this thelma questioned rejoicing that she had come alone

they are rather complaisant theyve come to regard my estate as a university of these parts a sort of rendezvous for the inspiration of progressive methods in farming my ambition is primarily not to make money but to show others how consequently i am no competitor to arouse their envy my position is that we must not pull apart but strive together as an example i go as readily to aid a white farmer as i do to aid a black one besides both black and white frequent my place probably the whites more than my own people the immortal words of mrs dickinson in her assault on fort wagner are my inspiration she says black and white were buried together black and white in a common grave let liberty see to it then that black and white are raised together in a life better than the old

thelma thru whom spoke generations crying to be born stood like a stature firm and still she was thinking of what she could do to help bring together two peoples equally misunderstood she took a dainty memorandum and jotted down a gem looking away from a cottage to the west she discovered a beautiful knoll she moved in its direction and william followed almost automatically come she said with her voice as magic as the chimes of christmas morning come i want to recite a poem which i recently composed

he listened attentively while she read the following idyl o cabin dear dost thou not hear her faltering voice

thy gloried choice twan once dost not remember well how sweetly to her songs we fell

a mother fair oerwhelmed with care tript to the field a hoe to wield the buried treasure there to reap her babe forsaken fast asleep

the fleeting wind oft too unkind takes holiday to sport and play

refreshing greetings sweet and long it fashions in a cradle song

while baby sleeps the mother keeps beside her mate early or late

to bid their poverty goodbye the two must slave or fall and die

when the weary sun blushing for fun shoots from the view and bids adieu that evening shades might fall and sport in the slumbering hall the mother stands with welcome hands at the cabin door loves shower to pour on him who unseen trophies brings her lord her saint her king of kings

the tattered shirt with honorable dirt and sweat neer stains the soul that rains a flood of twilight mirth and joy that hearts unchain and griefs destroy

come come my boy naught can annoy the white mans hate or a curse of fate

she said with loving arms entwined to bring a star to his troubled mind

our souls run true our lives renew god makes the strife god crowns the life

tho riches gulf we may not span

our babe shall pass for hes a man

come to your meat my noble sweet the day is done and joy begun

as heaven and earth are blithe and true you live in me and i in you

ill work for a song ill suffer wrong but whereer i be my spirits free the darkest hours are filled with light the stars eer shine tho out of sight

with you as bliss i naught can miss

our rising race has set the pace

love flowers are gay and skies are blue you live in me and i in you thelma william began just as soon as she had finisht i like your poem yet in a way it comes as a surprise for ive been under the impression that youre so fully occupied with public service that you had no time for the muses

she smiled and whispered sweetly to be the more entrancing i have to continue scribbling to finish my apprenticeship i hope some day to sing the deeds of the sage of seaton would you like that

to be sure it would be par excellence he jested merrily

thelma moved somewhat closer to him lookt away a moment then lookt toward him and smiled to be mischievous she artfully took his hand and speedily let it go that was long enough too long for in the instant seaton had vanisht for the land of pure delight for the joyous trembling of mate for mate for the rapid heartbeat that hurries us to love for the thrills that herald the approach of heaven william wanted to retain her hand to hold her against his heaving bosom to assuage the tempest there his hands moved involuntarily towards her and as he glanced her lips quivered with soft emotion her eyes spoke depths of love then smiling with the radiance of happy sunlight she called in pleading tones of dainty melody william william and as if he had been naughty sprang from the knoll and answered back my william

he followed replying thelmaâhis voice was all entreatyâthelma dont

turning towards him she said what do you wish william

the prophet stood silent and dismayed he recalled his days of romping with the thelma of the past he recalled her passing into womanhood he saw a loving personality how his soul cried out within him how he longed to break the silence why could he not clasp her hand and be himself again he moved nearer to her and she towards him then leapt before him susans words william you love me and tho you may not take me for your wife there is not born the woman who will love you more than i

of what are you thinking william laught thelma to end his meditation but would not wait for an answer this is a beautiful retreat who could not be happy here the birds of paradise have never ceased their ditty since here we paused they sang be dear my friends and the breeze whispered a pleasing lay young people soon grow old besides yon gay stream purled along saying i hope to see you when i return at the same time the trees which form an admirable screen lisp ill see that none disturb you even my home companions the flowers speak they promise we shall be your garland against a very welcome day 

with arms outstretched he rapidly goes to take her when a whistle hoarse with sounding announces the approach ol the community threshing machine and the laborers on surrounding farms this was followed by a sharp outburst of vigorous singing faintly first then loud and louder pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile smile smile while youre a lucifer to light your fag smile boys thats the style

whats the use of worrying

it never was worrthwhile so pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile smile smile

finally appeared the man and the voice a young white planter from a neighboring farm finding rev smith visavis with a young woman of great charms he was much embarrassed to make however the best of the untoward circumstances he brusquely began to perform his duty my names fred he spoke whats yours

mines william is there someone youre trying to find

yes responded the new arrival im looking for mr smith the elder who owns this farm ive just lately moved into this section and have not learned all the folks

im your man said rev smith and i think i know why youve come how soon will mr davis begin threshing

within half an hour

tell him well be on time in an instant the planter had gone

thelma because of the dignity he showed a dignity somewhat unusual among rustic people inquired whether his attitude was typical he showed no hesitancy in properly addressing you where we are white people dislike to call a colored person mister or miss thats social equality you know furthermore you must not call them by their first names the gentleman who just left considered us human beings like himself

his attitude is typical thelma was the response there may be the traditional southerner on outlying farms but on this and neighboring plantations and even in the towns my coworkers and i are addrest as we should be by anyone in new york city he paused a moment reflected and then continued thelma come witness a novel sight i believe you have not seen a wheat threshing he spoke inquiringly yet in a mood which was almost carefree

no i have not i have so much longed to see one how fortunate i am in having come in time for this great occasion  i am almost overjoyed thelma thot of the excellent teteatete ended but decided not to resume it at this time

a few moments later they stept into his car and soon were on their way to his palatial home

after the croppers and their helpers had been notified of the appointment william and thelma started for mr davis farm as they rode along greeted by fields of swaying corn on either side of tar oiled roads they noticed men going in the same direction with pitch forks on their sturdy shoulders the white workers were talking merrily the colored were either whistling or singing then came occasional pranks accompanied with vivacious outbursts of oh boy  next a caper followed a strut accompanied by this merry tune going to halloway with my amanda jane at once hearty peals of laughter all about the salubrious performer rang happily

lord and lady soon reacht the designated place and parkt at a point from which there was a full view of the coveted activity whereupon thelma and william left the car to meet a group of women about whom tots were frolicking after being introduced thelma made herself a friend of all the little folk and they were trailing behind her to share an envied caress the women were happy too for they noticed at once that this urban personality had none of your city airs

having placed the visitor in good company william proceeded to organize the workers so as to expedite time he himself chose to feed the bundles of wheat to the harvester daniel martin a white farmer was to take the stand with him cut the bands and hand him the bundles andy clarkston was to receive the grains in the bushel baskets and empty them into barrels nearby mr davis laborers were to haul the bundles of wheat from the stacks to the harvester henry and james mitchell both white were to hand the bundles to daniel martin all other laborers white and black were to handle the straw

here was a joyous scene about sixty people as many black as white were about to perform a miracle for humanity the field where once countless blades of wheat stood now showed everywhere a stubborn stubble this however was no barrier to the urchins who ran wherever they desired in their bare feet they lookt at the seven large stacks of wheat faintly visible in the distance products of arduous life then they lookt at the large oil engine panting ready to make the harvester go particularly did they eye the long pipe which they thot would make some melodious sound one little fellow bolder than the rest moved near to examine this magic worker whereupon mr davis shouted boy the lad speedily took to his heels

the colored laborers who were to dispatch the straw took their places and as if beginning a ceremony started to sing the hoeing of the corn this was followed by thresh dat wheat and pile dat straw folks git tired of corn bread such robust strains of matchless harmony filled the air and thrilled all hearts that all were at once exalted

the whistle sounded for the task to begin all were in place the work was on the harvester was fast but rev smith was faster also were the other busy folk each tried to outdo the other to show himself a man among men this master man however could not be found to get a greater inspiration from time to time individuals sang to the accompaniment of their own rhythmic souls such songs as im going back to east colorado and one more time eh lord at sunset the toilers ceased and went to the big house for the evening meal having washt white and black sat down to the same tables and all were served at once heartily did they eat joke followed joke hilarity ran high most were highly pleased a few of the white thelma noticed appeared at rare intervals somewhat choleric or disgruntled whatever their inner thots were spleen never once was uttered when all had finisht the guests left for their homes

it was not long before a wonderful harmony again arose the men were singing on their way home the following air thresh dat wheat and pile dat straw folks git tired of corn bread

thresh dat wheat and pile dat straw we folks want some white bread

ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha

ha ha ha ha ha hal ha ha

were goin home dis ebening

when de sun pops in de sky airs itself and says goodbye we air fightin wid de dust because some must some must

thresh dat wheat and pile dat straw

folks git tired of corn bread etc

tho de rich folks laugh and spend all our life blood to de end we can live at least oneday we can be gay be gay

thresh dat wheat and pile dat straw folks git tired of cornbread

thresh dat wheat and pile dat straw we folks want some white bread

ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha 

ha ha  ha ha  ha ha  ha ha

were goin home dis ebening

when the strains ceased to be audible the heavens were veiled with purple twilight thelma said can this be a dream do miracles now occur what is this but a miracle how did you bring this about 

as he answered he moved towards his car i first won the confidence of my people i told them their power when acting as a unit that as they were the laboring force of the south they could compel fair treatment i instructed them to refuse as a unit to be employed unless they were regarded as human beings the work you saw done this afternoon was given freely when a man gives his labor he can not afford to take insults i would not as soon as this was learned the others followed in my train william spoke with great earnestness he had by the time he finisht come to his automobile

when they were seated thelma said indeed this is truly wonderful i came here liking this vicinity but now i adore it how long do you think the bliss can last

the prompt response was forever

when thelma reacht williamsburg and found no one at her home she left her bag where her mother might readily see it and thereby know of her daughters return attacht to it she left a note saying that she planned to make several calls after which she would be at home for the evening

she first saw rev ross and told him of her trip in great detail he was deeply imprest before she left he told her that the party of which he had previously spoken would make an excursion to seaton on the following day would she go  no she preferred to go later she called next on williams mother then several other dear acquaintances but she consciously avoided susan lee

this done she returned home amidst a shower of her mothers tender embraces for quite a while thelma spoke of seaton and william then of william and seaton mrs haskell interrupted with this remark my child come have some supper surely you are hungry

mother im not in the least she said with great fervor im so full that i just must talk i have room for nothing else

now i know what has occurred youre in love with william smith what will susan say i see why you have not been close friends recently until a few weeks ago one could hardly turn for the other

she spoke pointedly as she was disillusioned you have been friends from infancy but nowâ

mother im so hungry

mrs haskell laught how has it come so suddenly as this

i didnt feel thus a while ago i do really crave something now thelma pleaded

is it bread or is it william her mother taunted

mother mother mother she laught please let me have some supper

after a few exertions thelma sat down to an appetizing meal and attackt it vigorously how vehemently she tried to dispel all thots of seaton yet they would not down mrs haskell permitted her to eat without interruption then when thelma had finisht she brot a letter which had been there for several days

a letter from president harper at this timeâwhat an unusual circumstance he has never written me during vacation until the early part of september why this letter now she mused without more ado she opened it and read thus my dear miss haskell the members of our trustee board waited upon me several days ago and discussed your visit to seaton they feel that tho in all matters pertaining to sojourner truth college and the community you have acted with tact and great discretion in this instance you have been most unwise and rashly impetuous when i was importuned by our worthy officials you had already been in seaton ten days during which time your name had become a synonym of evil suggestion

not only have the trustees opposed you but petitions containing the names of fifteen hundred patrons have askt for your removal stating that your continuing on the faculty would lead them to send their children elsewhere the public is one in saying that your attitude is the expression of ideals that they wish their children not to acquire

it is quite a calamity that our dean of girls has brot this odium upon her for parents and girls both loved you well

yet i am constrained to ask that you tender your resignation i know that many girls will not return because your great affection made you a part of them since my constituency however demands this i act

yours sincerely thomas harper

mother began theima as soon as she had finisht president harper has written me a very entertaining letter read it

mrs haskell eagerly began to peruse it but when she had come to the end of the first paragraph she frowned and said thelma

read it thru first and then put me on the wrack the daughter spoke as if in jest

when mrs haskell had concluded she remained silent for a while and then said youve just made a perfect mess of it my premonitions pointed to something disastrous now the catastrophe is at hand thelma why have you done this  she sat down in anguish then tears began to flow i cautioned you concerning this yet you would go i know youve done no wrong but i dislike the ill feeling and unpopularity you have brot upon yourself

the daughter lovingly embraced the mother and attempted to console her with these words  as a man thinketh in his heart so is he it is not what people think of me that is of prime importance but what i think of myself what i am what i know i am many who walk and flaunt themselves angels of mercy are veritable devils infernal i try to let my life be as a book where all may read i am truly myself outworn creeds and customs have no power over me in my life i smash them all id rather be myself than ape the powers that be id rather be a beggar than crush the soul within me why have i done this  it was my desire i did it because i am a woman i did it because woman must be as free as man i did it because neither heaven nor hell shall keep me from the man i love

thelma dear the mother pleaded be calm i believe in you but i would not have you suffer i fear that youll have now few companions that youll be very lonely

mother do you realize that its possible to be lonely in a crowd this was often true of christ similarly its possible to be by ones self and yet have ample company in attending some of the receptions of williamsburg and conversing with some of its socalled best people ive found them so empty that i felt as if i were in a desert plodding forlornly these people dont think they pay others to do their thinking for them they scorn me now but soon theyll give me tender embraces as for the women theyve always murdered one another then why should they spare me  notwithstanding this be undisturbed i have to depend upon no one occupation for my livelihood i can now give all my time to those in the slums i rejoice to go to those who need me she spoke with great persuasiveness thus the mother was won

how can i break the news to your father mrs haskell askt

just permit me mother you know father and i get on very well

what a relief

mother i see i have much business before me help me this much please while i make ready to go out againâ contrary to my former arrangementsâdo call up president harper and ask if i may have an interview within half an hour

mrs haskell proceeded at once to the telephone a few minutes later she returned to her surprise thelma was writing thelma president harper will be expecting you what are you doing now my child  she remarkt

im writing my resignation im trying to glorify you this night you will be proud of me when she had completed this she went upstairs to get her hat and scarf as she stept upon the porch she said ive had a vision ive found my place have no fear goodbye just for a while president harper a man of fortyfive a giant in bronze with a bearing which at once commanded attention and respect was seated this luxurious evening in his simple but alluring study it was a room of about ten square feet with two modestly curtained windows that afforded ample light resting irresistibly in the center on a rug of beautiful but plain design was a mahogany table supporting a vase of red roses in one corner was a couch loaded with historical pillows a veritable summons to sit inquire and love in the opposite corner was a case of books to transport one to many storied lands in the corner which would last be seen upon entering was a rollingtop desk before this making an excellent appearance was a commodious revolving chair here and there yet well placed were several chairs for visitors this study with all its suggestiveness did not suit mrs harper until it fumisht the biography of the spirit that staid there longest by athletic pictures and pennants of the schools that had inspired so carefully had the furnishings been selected that to enter was to become a prey to the temptation to scrutinize every detail to stand captivated how attractive how bewitching it all was

at seventhirty the bell rang the distinguish educator who had been in his study for an hour put aside his book and went to the head of the steps to greet thelma to his surprise he did not meet the lady but shook hands with mr

charles tucker president of the board of trustees mr tucker he said im happy to see you how have you been since last we met

first rate dr harper first rate your pleasing countenance tells me at once that all has gone well with you

not quite all but ive been feeling fine he moved a chair near the table and askt his guest to be seated then he himself sat in the revolving chair with his back towards his desk but his face towards his visitor

mr tucker to whom long years in heading a construction company had made abstemious about the use of every minute lost no time in stating his business once greetings had been exchange dr harper he began pleasantly but seriously have you as yet decided upon your new dean of girls no not yet a matter of such moment as this needs much reflection and not even one week has past since you took action

i was thinking that miss kelley at the nathaniel turner industrial school would be most satisfactory

since i do not know her very intimately and since it is my duty to recommend have her present her credentials and call to see me i was hoping that we might do something to reinstate miss haskell you are well aware that she is the best teacher that has ever entered the walls of sojourner truth college her spirit strongly reflects that of the great leader after whom our school is named i believe if our people were educated to this conception they would make of our staunch citizen not a reproach but a providential satisfaction i meant to leave within a few days for buenos ayres if however you and your colleagues will at least reconsider your action i will forego my vacation and conduct the campaign for miss haskells continuing with us

dr harper that is unthinkable once ive put my hands to the plow i never turn back

mr tucker you are a business man remarkt the educator being such you have not never modified your plans and policies many an undertaking you have estimated at a particular price only later to go over the whole account again and make your bid at a different figure besides in doing so you know you have been wise if the furrow was crooked you turned back and made it straight why not do so now

a woman who would so lower herself as has miss haskell deserves no consideration he replied irritably

my dear sir said president harper with his eye well alert to the inconsistencies of modern society you are a deacon in one of our most progressive churches a church whose business is the salvation of the people accordingly after your faith in christianity if miss haskel has erred you must consider her if she has sinned you must help save her does the attitude you and your colleagues have taken tend to save her or ruin her

growing impatient mr tucker rose to go and said let her come to church and there be saved but what about the salvation of the young who would come under her instruction  it is better that one should suffer than many

at this point the bell rang again be seated just a moment longer if you please spoke dr harper with great composure so inured was he to the choler and phlegm of patrons that mr tuckers outburst was like a zephyr of spring

a voice called miss haskell wishes to see you papa may she come up now

yes show her up at once

i must be going doctor said the trustee who now had become uneasy i have some other business needing attention

doctor harper spoke for time and before the conversation could end thelma greeted the gentlemen good evening recognizing mr tucker she sat between him and the door then said to him very affably surely youre not going to let a woman run you away

he frowned and twitcht no i can spare a few minutes i suppose you want to ask me to keep you on the faculty he sneered well say your sayâ

mr tucker dont insult me she uttered with calm defiance ive always respected you dont take me for a child for you will be grievously mistaken let the lion within me remain asleep before fd ask you to use your influence in my behalf for any position id curse god and die she was very positive her voice rang like a silver bell turning to president harper that she might change the conversation and thereby not lose her temper she said with her accustomed dignity pardon me dr harper when i entered your house i had no intention of making a scene but having been trained to defend myself i had to answer the distinguisht gentleman

miss haskell no apology is necessary you were entirely within your right was the educators terse remark

do you still wish me to remain miss haskell inquired the trustee partially wishing to remain and partially to leave

yes mr tucker since what i have to say is concerning my relation to truth college as one of its chief executives you should hear me thru came forth almost spontaneously turning more directly to her adversary she requested goodnaturedly tell me please why you didnt dismiss me but preferred to ask me to resign there was no need for ceremony whether i wrote the resignation or not i could not teach at truth college

true the request is a formality yet we did not want to injure your career years hence some one desiring to employ you would not consider you if our records read dismissed mr tucker affirmed mopping his face with his favorite blue bordered handkerchief

what oddities occur in life thelma ejaculated producing her resignation from her bag youd cast the undesirable on others no less desiring her

not that at all the trustee said with a grimace squirming almost at every word there might be others whod accept you regardless of anything we might say wed have to acknowledge your efficiency still we can not condone your recent impudence

pardon me but what was my impudence thelma requested

you went to seaton alone and spent most of your time on the estate of rev smith a man who has not the good graces of the minister of williamsburg nor of many of the peopleâa visionary a radical a fanatic hence we believe that you are of the same type mr tucker resumed now with more vivacity president harper decided not to interrupt

a person with original ideas has no place in society

those ideas are not to be incompatible with the welfare of the majority of the group

mr tucker have you ever visited dr smith and surveyed the work hes doing do you realize that he is bringing white and colored together upon terms of increasing familiarity arent you aware that such must be done if we continue here cant you see that to serve god you must help your fellowman thelma broached him fervently for she now had no need of diplomacy but only for straight forward thrusts

no i havent been there and do not wish to go ive heard enough of it to keep me away the trustee was very impatient and unreasonable

you let your prejudice get the better of you and condemn a cause of which you are ignorant you are just like most white people in this country they see the negro only from a great distance most of them never meeting our best yet they assume most intimate knowledge

thats neither here nor there to be brief rev smiths ideas which unfortunately have seized you too are not welcome here furthermore you went contrary to the advice of your pastor as dean of our girls you were to them a model your life we regarded as the tangible ideal which our girls should achieve since youve ceased to be that your place is naturally elsewhere arent you quite different from most of our women mr tucker spoke rapidly desiring the matter soon to end yet in doing so he was somewhat brusque

yes im different from many of the women of this town ive tried all my life so to be if im regarded as being of another variety my labor has not been in vain she admitted with meek sedateness mr tucker im always changing if you meet me tomorrow you will not meet the woman of today thus ive taught these girls to be not fossils not models for such are merely samples not ornaments for ages the same but plastic creatures ever fresh and new with a grandeur unique that will not only attract men but make even women pay them adoration i should have them so moulded that their spirits would never grow old that even after they marry they might always show their husbands new charms something in them for further conquest once a husband knows his wife thoroly he is likely to seek another woman who can entertain him a wife needs to be very resourceful she should always have a surprise

the trustee became exceedingly interested in her train of thot however as he did not wish her to know to what extent he turned his face somewhat lest she would observe the emotion

at this gesture which thelma interpreted as an effort for reflection she renewed her remarks with dr harper when i finisht reading your letter she said turning toward the educator i thot of ignoring it certainly i could only construe it as a dismissal but having workt with you for two years and shared your joys and sorrows sure that tho you penned the letter the request was not your own out of great respect for you i have written the resignation here it is she handed him the letter and went back to her seat

at this point the other personality broke in his tones were rather sonorous miss haskell im hoping that the trustee board will reconsider its action and not accept your resignation youve been an invaluable coworker and i dislike much to lose you of course a faculty should be mobile otherwise it can have no life we can not always keep our workers but when they do go we want to lose them for important considerations not mere caprices

doctor harper do you think we have acted merely upon impulse and not for the interests of the community mr tucker interrupted impatiently

i can regard the action as being only the result of a public storm not of quiet deliberation as one who for twenty years has been selecting teachers and passing upon their usefulness to the school under my charge i was the one to dismiss miss haskell i determine the policies of the institution i see that they are carried out the president was very impressive

here thelma interrupted dr harper i couldnt remain now since the majority of the people do not want me

miss haskell youll do i know what is best for the community the president affirmed thelma nodded assent all this is the work of a few irascible citizens there were several mass meetings stirred by explosive oratory my presence was not desired at any of them i attended the last however and forced an opportunity to speak i askt the people first to hear you miss haskell but so much venom had already been dispersed that they chose a hasty course to the disgrace of williamsburg he paused a few moments and then continued mr tucker do you know anything about sojourner truth her whose spirit we try to emulate

i know only that she was a great negress who was freed before the civil war and lived quite a while after it he replied

then read this chapter concerning her in mr cromwells the negro in american history meanwhile ill glean from miss haskell many particulars concerning her recent trip he requested very politely

may i take the book home and read it ill have more time to do the task justice mr tucker remarkt rising to go

treating him as he would a school boy that studies only under the task master dr harper said its important that you read this now we have a serious matter to decide which can only be handled after knowing all the facts the president urged his request because of the influence of mr tucker with his colleagues as went mr tucker so went the other trustees

assenting to the entreaty he withdrew to the farthest corner of the room thelma and dr harper to the opposite tho mr tucker wanted to know what was being softly spoken in the interview he was finally able to concentrate sufficiently to be entranced by the life of that great woman after an interval he read voraciously having completed the sketch he went to his former seat and said dr harper im ready

the president turned in his chair opened the envelope on his desk and said miss haskell read this its your resignation

dr harper i object mr tucker put forth impatiently that letter should be placed before the board this is no time for its consideration

i see no grounds for your objection the lady knows its contents for she wrote it moreover it is addrest to me i may hear it finally since resignations are filed in my office and are never read at board meetings except upon request and as no such request has been made up to this time the reading is entirely apropos he uttered with great passion

well i dont like it protested the trustee

read on miss haskell said the educator

president harper dear sir i resign i resign the girls to your wise counsel and to her who comes to be your dean i resign the board of trustees to their proper sphere champions of better days to be i resign you and your loyal teachers to a work much better than the old instructing adults as well as children for all have much to learn i resign myself to my own world of hope love and youthful endeavor i resign the shackles of woman forged by superstitious conventionality and hurl them to their destined place a thousand years behind time

what care i for the scorn of thousands this world has its millions i am living not for today but for all the tomorrows i go goodbye i resign

yours respectfully miss thelma haskell

when she had finisht dr harper said do you still feel the same towards our dean havent you really made a mistake dont you feel that you should see your coworkers and arrange for a reconsideration

mr tucker was convinced of his error and the very fact that he was wrong irritated him immensely unwilling to admit that he had made a mistake he spoke vehemently miss haskell is an imposter a regular snake in the grass she performs acts which we vigorously condemn then puts herself before us as a martyr shes a devil incarnate suddenly inflamed with an almost unconquerable hate he lost complete control of himself

be careful as to what you say came passionately from thelma i have this evening given you my greatest respect not because you deserve it but because youre in the home of one whose character is faultless

mi tucker dr harper interrupted to have his guest resume his equipoise temper is powerless where reason fails miss haskell has done you no wrong as she has treated you most kindly your vituperation is entirely out of place if i were as sure of the honor of the majority of the women of williamsburg as i am of that of this young lady i should know that the future of my race is secure

women can deceive some men but i know them well this woman is a vampire get out of my sight he shriekt

you forget that this is my house mr tucker

well i can leave it responded the trustee as he started to go thelma stept to one side to let him pass woman dont look at me ill crush the life out of you he said rushing to her with hands outstretcht to grasp her by the throat

stand back you demon you reprobate you scoundrel put your hands on me and youre a dead man shame on you she shouted flashing a revolver in his face before the president could place himself between them thank you dr harper but i can take care of him myself i bought this companion for the white and black toughs who assault colored women id expect to find them occasionally in the slums but least of all here this place should be sacred only those with the highest sense of honor should enter it the trustee cowered mr tucker she continued after scrutinizing him a while if i thot you were ready for heaven id send you there you are not fit to die and yet not fit to live sir remember i am a woman

then dr harper interrupted to make the master stroke dont you in your heart admire miss haskell

before the trustee could answer sounds of childrens joyous singing came beneath the windows miss haskell is a lady shes always sweet and shady

well take her to the bowling green to be our fairy queen

when these sweet sounds could no longer be heard the trustee proceeded to leave as the guest past out of the door dr harper said mr tucker i am going to recommend that miss haskell continue to be our dean in a moment the trustee had gone when the door downstairs closed he added with great satisfaction gallant lady i believe weve won a victory

when the party which included rev ross and susan arrived at seaton william smith was standing at the station ready to give them every hospitable consideration the south could afford after he had arranged for the conveyance of all the others he placed susan by his side rev ross and the mothers sat in the rear within a few minutes they were at the celebrated estate and seated for breakfast

after the morning meal the eager visitors made a tour about the farm william took unusual pains to see that no phase of his enterprise escaped the attention of his guests furthermore as each detail was considered time was taken for a brief discourse in order that all might have a comprehensive view of the entire plan which would be both educative and highly enjoyable

when they had made thus a complete survey of the property and witnessed several demonstrations they assembled for a fete on the lawn it was now late in the afternoon the sun had gone down besides a welcome breeze came upon them in a shady nook where all was charming and delightful

there the people rejoiced and reveled singing dancing romping and gaming all were happy and gay why should they not be refreshments were free and in great abundance cake ice cream punch and various soft drinks everyone was enraptured that he had come and regretted the absence of his friends

while the gayety ran high william tried to find a secluded place where he might talk intimately with susan but as all had apparently laid claim to him up to this time he had not succeeded he might have gone off in his car but as this was a party he felt that he should always keep within reach

at last as the best he could do he went quite a distance from the others but never out of view

susan was as fine and dainty as ever sweet and good like a robust girl ready for tennis her dress of white and her canvas oxfords bewitcht the gazer at once add to this a glance at her russet face demure and fair and her waving dark hair the spectator would not be charmed transported or allured but completely overawed

they sat upon a wicker seat facing the other guests hoping not to be disturbed susan im glad that you have come ive been hoping that you would have appeared earlier since i could not leave because of the wheat harvest in the neighborhood within a few days we shall have finisht then ill have considerable time to myself said smith

i wanted to come william so much but i thot it best to wait until today when i learned that thelma was here however i became almost furious her face showed it i wonder should i tell you this she continued well its all right i had started had really reacht the station when mother overtook me she pleaded and cried so bitterly that i decided to go back she was sadly happy to tell william of the fullness of her heart dedicated wholly to him

yet i do wish you had come alone we should have found time to thresh out all uncertainties as it is we may be disturbed at any moment

suppose i had come what would have occurred in williamsburg  do you know what the community did for thelma  they held indignation meetings against her that wasnt all i met her as she was coming from president harpers

just think of it mr tucker was so rude as to make a scene in the presidents office im glad he found his match tho for a while susans jealousy was gone her face showed a smile delicately sweet and captivating

what did she do inquired william very eager to know all the details

ask me rather what she did not do i have to admire her even tho she is my rival

at this juncture lewis brown appeard accompanied by another gentleman of rustic mien but simple grace a loyal citizen of the land rev smith said brown a bit embarrassed pardon this intrusion please but mr houstonâ he pointed to the gentlemanâwants to sec you on some very important business if it hadnt been urgent id forced him to wait until tomorrow

is the business private

i can say what ive got to say right heah dis all tis mr martin wants to rent me his farm dis fall for four hundred eighty dollars what mus i do ef you says tek it its a bargain ef you says let er go i don want it he spoke with great directness fearless and unshamed

itll be all right mr houston responded william very courteously you must draw up no papers tho dont sign anything until i go with you to mr martin

you bet yo boots one oder thing rev smith danel martin told me ef i sed yis today i could buy rations dere and pay after id made a crop should i do dis the visitor inquired with a simple faith that showed almost worship for our young man

pay cash for your rations you have enough in bank to do this if you start working a crop to pay a grocery bill you may never get out of martins debt

id git out but ise gwine a foller your advice ill be heah early tomorrow mornin thank you good bye he bowed and turned to go

william detained him for a while mr houston he said you havent met my guest im sure this is a dear friend of mine miss lee of williamsburg miss lee meet mr houston

my specs my complemints he did not tarry long he soon said be good to yo self good bye

within a few minutes brown and mr houston were soon out of sight almost immediately loud outbursts of laughter now came forth near the house as a result of the fall of mrs castle as it was merely an incident of merriment the party was not disturbed in the least susan had started in that direction but since order was very quickly restored she returned to her seat

william how i wish i could remain here several days ive had a good time a good time ive been almost in a continuous state of ecstacy im going to ask mother if she wont stay longer papa can spare us hell do anything for me

do ask her

ill do so at once she hurried off when she had gone quite a few yards she was accosted by a white farmer of middle age in working attire

madame he began can you tell me where i can find mr smith  i want his advice on a very serious matter

there he sits hell be glad to see you susan found her mother with practically no difficulty took her aside and made her request her effort however was rather arduous because there were many interruptions there were inquiries of how are you enjoying yourself isnt the punch delightful this is truly a wonderful estate isnt it they rarely expected an answer for before the person questioned could make reply the inquisitor was gone by persisting and constantly renewing the broken threads of speech she was able to get a definite answer

when she reacht william again she saw that his visitor was about to go he turned to him and said this is the young lady who pointed you out i havent seen her before is she a stranger in these parts

yes she comes from my home town williamsburg mr nailor this is miss lee daughter of one of the largest manufacturers in that town

miss lee im glad to meet you i hope youll have a pleasant time here

so i am i find this country almost a paradise susan was perfectly natural

well i must be going well see davis monday good day mr smith good bye miss lee susan lookt at him in amazement for the first time she had met a southern white man who did not place himself above colored people she stood entranced almost as if hypnotized watching mr nailor move slowly over the stately hillocks of williams farm she herself eventually started in that direction sighed and peered then she returned to her seat

william i want some information and you must give it since ive been in your company today at least twelve persons have sought your counsel i have counted five white farmers among the number what has come over this place it was not thus before you came susan tossed her head bewitchingly and awaited an answer

a better day is dawning thats all the south you know is aristocratic once you grasp the significance of that progress becomes rapid the typical southern gentleman wants someone perpetually to do the laborious tasks of life particularly his farming regarding the black man as his inferior he seizes upon him to do this work perpetually

i know the colored share little in common with the whites we do come together in a few stores but not as equals william why is this she pleaded breathing deeply the breeze which then passed gently by

mit is simply the white mans ignorance booker t washington has well said to keep a man in the gutter you must stay down there with him yourself the south has been staying in the gutter while the north east and west have gone on high

i came here accepting two callenges first that of my fellow minister according to which i should not preach the other defiance was the white mans namely that my place is down south on the farm my people can not all become farmers for many of us have the genius of merchants or of mechanics or of the professional men all these we need and shall have to dignify farming however and cause even many of the whites to consider it honorable toil i launcht this big experiment

tve seen your building and several of your demonstrations given by use of equipment stored in them but id like for you to tell me of some of the influences which do not lie at the surface

well this was my inspiration seeing that the colored outnumbered the whites and that i was in the midst of a traditional aristocracy i at once became aware that we were being even forced to work while a few enjoyed idle ease not only were my people hardly making expenses but even large numbers of the whites weve been held back by the endless grocery bill thats why i told mr houston to obtain nothing on credit

i remember the incident

another important fact you yourself mentioned the two groups rarely meet i do believe however they meet more frequently in the country than in the town its no uncommon sight for white and black farmers to help each other both during planting and harvest both groups have been and are oppressed and need each others help to throw off their economic slavery of course the groups are closer together now than they were when i came to establish here anyone can vouch for that whose life can touch both extremities tell me tho what you did to help on the change susans eyes were riveted upon him the occasional laughter did not disturb her in the least william paused merely to look at her and be made anew by the magic of her sparkling eyes would the day might never endl i put in a small crop he began and askt different members of my own race to let me help them produce theirs many were at first reluctant but after a mass meeting in the school house i had them all there i askt how many owned farms how many rented how many meant to buy soon and how many were not going to buy at all i advised them if they had not bought to see me before discussing the matter with any one who wanted to sell the following day i lookt at the deeds of those who had bought most of theme were deeds fee entail and not fee simple which means that those persons holding such were owners until death after which time the property reverted to the man who sold or to his heirs the possessors were furious several of the deeds were made out properly but most of them were not it was this incident that gave me my people

susan was not satisfied she knew that he must have angered many of the whites even tho he had merely done his duty to learn the other phase of the issue she askt how did you win the white farmer

i pursued the same policy and found that many of them who thot they owned their land were merely renting for life all their deeds however were rewritten so that those who had been beguiled would have such a title as would permit the property to go to their own descendents in addition to this i showed many of them how to prepare their own fertilizer and how to test their soil i have given myself equally to both groups as far as they would permit

you surely have done wonders yours is the work that counts at this she lookt away and within four feet of her there skipt and played two squirrels she called them at once they stopt turned in her direction and capered to a tree near by she called again and they turned merely to notice then gracefully scampered away susan stood enraptured forced for a time to be speechless

seeing her thus absorbed william askt what is your meditation permit me to share with you susan had gone to the tree where the sinuous creatures had sought refuge she lookt up in order to follow their movements but she lost sight of them as soon as they leapt to another tree

they are indeed happy would i were so i wonder if they are mates for the first time that day her brow was clouded she was thinking of her own situation

i thot you were happy at least you have said so several times today why are you otherwise now he questioned as he went to her side he wanted to take her hand but as there was no privacy in that spot he contented himself with a look that spoke great admiration

i was happy until i saw the squirrels she remarkt with an emotion so deep as to thrill his entire frame i was thinking how near they are to each other and how far we are apart

arent we near to each other susan my soul goes out to yours and i do believe they oft embrace

ill agree to all that but do they go out to each other as the only possible refuge as the only port in a storm as the only oasis in a desert you understand came the query with a passion that revealed a determination to have an answer the circumstances were not to send her empty away thelma she knew had made an impression she must know of any change

william reflected a few moments before making reply the interruptions had been so many as to prevent his being occupied only with susan the image and grace of thelma kept looming before him thus he found himself all day contrasting the two he had resolved within several days to make the choice which was recently forced upon him

that is the point i must reach soon he continued my desire is not to make you miserable but happy the life i pursue is one which may incite strong currents of envy in a lawless south ive declared war on prejudice on fraud and all injustice you recall the lynching of mr crawford one of the most worthy citizens of his state what was his crime the acquisition of legitimate wealth he recalled too the lynching which he had seen the summer he went far south brutality barbarism savagery

now susan became somewhat nervous for she was about to ask a question which had long been lingering on tier mlnu she wanted to hear what he had to say concerning it william she askt do you like thelma as soon as she had spoken she moved a step or two away for she partly believed that she had acted improperly yet she was bent on standing her ground because she wanted to remove all uncertainty

yes i do he admitted i like her very much you know how we used to romp together in early childhood

i remember she said plaintively i wish i could tell you how i feel at times especially at night as i lie in bed just before going to sleep i have tried to send you a thot i think of all i should like to have indeed strange presentiments come before me i fear i fearâ

what do you fear  he broke in to retard her rapid emotion realizing the burden of her soul he wanted to help her to dispel it

the guests in the distance now became rather uproarious the cessation of the music gave occasion for many peals of laughter for at this time george brown the son of the chief cropper passed by on a goat that was trying its best to throw him

susan thus found time to become more composed for the attention of all had to some extent been disconcerted when the hilarity abated they saw rev ross coming towards them leisurely

susan you failed to tell me your fears he persisted

sometimes i fear some great harm will befall you and ill not be by to aid you i fear alsoâwilliam i cant tell you

susan you must he persisted you can confide in me cant you if its a secret ill carry it with me to eternity i answer all your questions surely you will answer mine

william i can no longer hold out you know my heart is yours forever oh that yours were mine thats my dread i fear that i shall lose you she almost whispered yet she was conquering the manly heart what bulwarks can we raise againt sweetness what defense against beauty loveliness and constant devotion love conquers all things

try to remove the fear a few moments of privacy will settle it all if i thot i had the promise of ten more years of life i could make answer now he said going towards the house

to know that you were mine even for a day would be bliss enough for me her soul cried out with the admission she had made for a while she trembled because she felt as if the night winged horrors of disappointment to her

think of this tonight he urged to avoid rashness and let us decide tomorrow after a soul to soul talk alone youre going to remain over another day arent you at this time rev ross was almost upon them already he had called to them saying it was time for the party to prepare for williamsburg

susan sorrowfully replied no i go back tonight i ought to be stubborn for once i ought to rebel that night she went back to williamsburg

while the party from williamsburg was taking a full measure of happiness while william was entertaining susan under difficulties twelve white men assembled at the home of robert white a hard worker strongly obsest with the idea of white supremacy tho biased he was liberal enough to call in men of different occupations

in the modest front room of the weatherboard dwelling illuminated with a simple kerosene lamp the gentlemen discussed miscellaneous topics till all those expected had arrived when the last was seated robert white promptly began gentlemen were here to decide whats to be done wltli niggers round hereâespecially this smart darkey parson smith mr davis whose wheat was thresht the first day of thelmas visit rose promptly and interfered thus mr white pardon my interruption but let us not speak of niggers and darkies when we talk in that way we lose our presence of mind call them colored people if we are to act justly we must be calm davis im just talking as i feel to me theyre just downright niggers if to you theyre different all right gentlemen the meeting is open he spoke in utter scorn of a loyal race

fred dean then arose he had not been long in the vicinity and therefore was somewhat unwilling to lead the way having developed a keen appreciation for smith he was ready for a defense but thot he should first have a thoro knowledge of the facts in the case gentlemen as im a newcomer just tell me what all the noise is about what harm is mr smith doing

tom howell reporter for the seaton gazette robust and boisterous was on his feet in a twinkling theres the trouble he shouted brandishing his first in the air and looking quickly from one to the other mr smith he sneered mr smith before that coon came here nobody called a nigger mister now all those darkies on his farm have to stay in their place

mr nailor who had gone there directly from williams estate broke in at this point tom howell i know you what have you done for this town youve only gotten drunk off crabtrees liquor with that political bunch and stolen the labor of ignorant colored men if our courts werent crooked youd been on the chain gang long ago thats where you belong this was too much for the biased men

luke crabtree and tom howell began simultaneously to abuse nailor pandemonium almost followed the alertness of those not involved in the altercation alone prevented blows

when quiet again prevailed nailor resumed his remarks as if no turbulence had occurred i call the reverend misster and properly address all members on his estate because they are gentlemen i treat them as such besides he and his helpers have made this community thrive more than any one ive seen here in the last fifteen years ill take off tny hat to him and as many more as will do as much

theyll be wanting to marry your daughter too

interrupted newton young one of the brokers of seaton

newton i call you mister yet if i thot any one of my daughters was bent on marrying you id kill her before shed have the chance id rather marry her to any of those colored men on that estate for they are honest

gentlemen came from silas jones who had kept silence only with great constraint i believe bob made a mistake in calling some of these folks here this night

no silas its better to have all sorts of folks in this meeting for tho i feel that the niggers have taken some of our rights i want to hear what some of our best men think of the matter he put in desiring to have all be tolerant towards each other probably we cant never agree with em but it aint goin to hurt us to listen

as soon as a white man starts doing his duty towards his colored brother men who want something for nothing begin to throw up the question of amalgamation want to marry my daughters said nailor with a jeer thats their business the women will take care of that if my daughter loves a black man and he loves her if they decide to unite after having considered all the consequencesâall i have to say is this what god has joined together let no man put asunder

you talk like that said sandy james a pettyfogging lawyer because youve got your property but these men who see the nigger going ahead see that something must be done to keep the darkey down if they dont wake up the niggers will be running the country turningto mr davis he continued davis youre a fairminded man youre the biggest of us all answer one question for me do you think it safe for us to follow this high sounding talk of nailor

mr davis did not care to answer at this time for be felt that some of those present might purposely distort his words however as he was not a man to stand on the fence he very soon made reply i may not agree with all nailor says but i do agree with him in this treat a man as you find him if hes honest industrious and keeps his word treat him on the square there are some colored folks i dont want around me but any time i can get one of rev smiths force i hold him tight he struck one hand in the other to be the more impressive i have to pay those men more than i do other folks but they stick to the job they do their work better and even show me how to make more money

thats what were complaining about said silas jones stamping his feet that niggers running our folks out of work

on the contrary went on mr davis hes making work for them hes showed them how to keep fruit upon the tree until it ripens hes showed them how to treat their hogs for cholera hes shown them how to raise other staples than cotton and silas you know he came to show you how to handle your bottom lands that would have meant work for many of our people whats been the result the lands idle âno good to you nor anybody else

i ran him away i dont want a nigger to show me nothing came from silas with a scorn even for those who brook such consideration

why dont you go to the university then and have some white man teach you something about improved farming remarkt fred dean who was moving with the spirit of his age he chewed vigorously his quid of home cured and offered some of the same brand to all present we folks have believed the professors were just dreamers but these days if a man means to go ahead in farming he must keep in touch with the agricultural department of the united states and with the agricultural schools smith wouldnt be able to do these wonders if he hadnt gone to one of those schools hes done this community a whole lot of good were going to be glad to go having seen what this one man has done in spite of the prejudice against him more of our people are going to stay on the farms and not run to the cities

the tide had drifted too favorably in smiths direction for several present who had ambitions which they deemed it unwise to disclose at this particular time these put their heads together as it were to make their case strong of this group luke crabtree the saloon keeper who had listened attentively to all that had been said arose to put in his contention friends this niggers almost running me out of business the darkies used to drink almost their entire weeks earnings with me now theyre becoming scarcer and scarcer than ever instead of spending with me theyre carrying it to the bank even old rufus childs that trifling nigger almost never comes now if this keeps up there wont be anybody on the chain gang to work the county roads and some of the big plantations somethings got to be done mighty quick

you ought to be glad the darkies are behaving themselves spoke daniel martin for the first time that evening when theyre good you get more work out of em then you can depend upon them for they work every day

that may be all right came from sandy janes but when niggers get a little money they begin to think theyre just as good as white folks i dont fear the nigger who hasnt any sense youre not going to have any trouble keeping him in his place its the educated nigger i fear

you gave me the impression awhile ago said henry mitchell the harness repairer who had been trying to edge in a word but somehow had been prevented that the negro is inferior to you that he is inferior to the white race yes hes inferior was the lawyers quick retort he never was anything hes nothing now and hell never amount to anything

if thats so replied mitchell the white man needs have no fear if theres nothing in the negro then our discussion is out of place give him time and hell die out nothing you do for him can save him if hes inferior besides if youre superior you have no cause whatever for worry everything ir in your favor success was yours before the world began

well they say theres nothing in him rejoined the lawyer not to be outdone by the good sense of a nonprofessional man yet when we see one do the work of that smart darkey and his helpers there may be a mistake hence we must be on the safe side i might probably be speaking differently but for the birth of a nation the moving picture which was shown here six weeks ago did you see it gentlemen all had seen it what do you think of it

all agreed that reflection was necessary the attempted rape by the lustful bloodthirsty scoundrel stirred the passionate natures of them all the suggestion was enough to move to action and produce the effect that several had all the while desired they seized upon it as the crux of their whole design vituperation poured upon vituperation then many ebullitions of pusilanimity the lawyer spoke now as if in a political campaign and used all the tricks of the experienced fire eater he recalled the scene in the southern senate which griffith and dixon have made disgusting and nauseating in the extreme he followed this with a vivid sketch of the lieutenantgovernors effort to force the governors daughter to marry him then he closed with praise of the ku klux klan representing it as the savior of the south he sat down amidst great applause of half the assembly

those who had spoken in behalf of fair play tho imprest by the lawyers rhetoric maintained their presence of mind while the others went to sandy james and shook hands with him firmly congratulating him upon his magic eloquence these gentlemen remained calmly seated as if mere spectators of a drama eventually mr nailor interrupted gentlemen pardon my disturbance i call upon you now more urgently than ever to be composed after a storm we need to look to our moorings this is a new south and rev smith is the new negro the scoundrel shown in the birth of nation tho later than the uncle tom type is also passing you know as well as i that in the last ten years not a colored man has been lyncht in this state for rape the educated negro never commits this crime anywhere the guilty man is the culprit we permit to loaf in the streets

i dont trust none of them put in bob white i wish i could but it just goes against the grain

why cant you trust them your fathers did and your mothers too when the yankees came upon us and stript us of our parents and of their possessions when filthy soldiers would have done them violence who kept them pure who died to preserve their chastity it was the negro slave bob your own mother often tells how the slaves fought and died to keep her inviolate affirmed mr nailor with abundant gratitude for their unstinted love

that was the old nigger was bobs response they never gave no trouble we like that kind of nigger even today but we can find only a precious few of them theyre dying out fast if all the niggers were like those wed not have no complaint they always staid in their place

i see the trouble you want a new south but an old negro the combination is impossible old things have passed away if you have a new south you must have a new negro and i dont bite my tongue to say that rev smith is the kind the south wants mr nailor again took up the gauntlet as the contestant for the new order of the day he wanted these men to do nothing rash so he held them in abeyance

well see about that interrupted tom howell fully recovered from the rebuff given him at the early part of the meeting tom dixon has as much blue blood as you mr nailor and we believe he knows his business

before there could come a reply mrs white and her two daughters brot in a service of cake and wine as their energies had been well consumed by the days work and the evenings discussion they welcomed the refreshments with unusual rest their minds relaxed the tension lessened then followed an animated jollity that seemingly dispelled all differences each had to be served several times

when each was ashamed to ask for more bob white again called the meeting to order gentlemen lets return to business i think weve had enough discussion now lets decide on some sort of action the question is whats to be done with parson smith and his niggers and others whore taking on his ways

the question was certainly perplexing for whites manner of putting it included not only the colored people but the white who had profited by williams friendly counsel those who had been swept away by sandy james invective tho ready to take any course against the negro were not inclined at all to act against the whites gentlemen what are you going to do to these folks  he repeated

i say let them alone  spoke mr davis representing the progressive element of the south who tired of the turmoil produced by the lawless and the impetuous were eager for the economic life of that section to take its proper place gentlemen weve been thinking too much about ourselves we must stop it we must look to the interests of the nation she has a proud name that should not be tarnisht to do this we have always been aided by the loyal blood of our colored brother if you knew the honorable place he has held in american history jou would aid him and not throw obstacles in his path free negroes and slaves were with washington at valley forge and endured all the hardships of the revolution they were with perry at lake erie and with old hickory at new orleans not a war have we fought on this grand continent which has not been made successful by the help of negro slain for the sake of our country for the sake of dear old dixie let us be law abiding the passionate plea made an appeal to reason and to the pride which has been the great force in solidifying the sentiment of that section davis loved the south they knew when the tears were trickling down his troubled face they were enthralled in silence they were captivated by his personality for a moment all wanted to do right

it was only for a moment the tricksters hearts could not relent long they were too admantine

gentlemen i have all respect for mr davis came from lawyer james i honor him as the great son of general davis who fell in the cause of the unionâan unpopular cause in these partsâa man so courageous as to bear the odium of his neighbors to follow what appeard to him to be right i honor mr davis because of his wholehearted support of every activity launcht for the welfare of this town yet for the life of me something must be done to save the south we cant afford to let these niggers get such a hold on our people as has this one already he has most of the welltodo folks on his side and we poor devils grovel in the dust

ive listened to you attentively i took you all to be men you dont want to do right if the plea of mr davis didnt move you why should any of us try remarkt mr nailor trying to force a decision he stood with a hickory in his right hand gentlemen nothing should be done to terrify our colored population you know we need their labor thousands of them keep going north because of just such men as you when theyve piled up dollars by honest toil you find all sorts of ways to steal them when they have laid by luxurious crops you take them as your own you give them poor schools you insult their women now youre asking what are we going to do to them havent we already done enough he raised his cane aloft as if ready to strike anyone who would disturb him i think ive heard enough he said impatiently taking his hat and starting for the door i lost enough by this kind of efforts of you scalawags crops which should have been harvested long ago have rotted because of just such foolishness ive heard enough he screamed if anyone bothers any of my hands hell is going to overtake him and that before judgment day good night he slammed the door

just leave him to me said tom howell ill bring him round ive more power than you think

others also rose to leave who stood only for fair play there were many entreaties that all would remain until a definite decision had been reacht the lawyer however knowing that there were others present whom he could not trust with his plan had no apology to offer no entreaty to make he desired only their speedy departure

bob i must go insisted fred dean shaking hands warmly i promised the old lady id be back long before midnight so id better be on my way bob i aint goin to do anything wrong but because i love old dixie you can count on me to do anything thats right good night good night old pal was the exchange

the discussion waxed warm to bitterness not against any there but against a rising race seeing that villany was uppermost one by one those for justice left for they regarded a longer sojourn there as merely wasteful mr davis lingered until they formally dismissed and all were supposed to go home when he was starting away he observed that young james crabtree howell and jones lingered behind evidently there was to be an extra session feeling that he was not wanted he mounted his spirited bay and galloped homeward

when he had gone a mile he decided to turn from his way and go to nailors in the bright moonlight when he reacht the main house every place was dark he called for quite a while without getting a response finally jefferson nailor the eldest son appeared at the door and said that his father had not as yet returned that probably he had gone from the meeting to the station to meet number sixtyfive the engineer was to bring him a message from dallas in an instant he was on his way

when he arrived at the station he found mr nailor placidly walking up and down after tying his horse to a tree he went to greet his friend well this is a surprise

said nailor divining however what had caused his neighbor to seek him

nailor said davis i couldnt go to bed tonight until i congratulated you on the spirit you showed against those rascals we can stop these outbreaks that disgrace our country if we only act soon enough are you willing to stop them 

you bet your boots when will you make the start 

this very night

im with you in life and death by the god who made us who brot us to this land not to debase but to exalt mankind i dedicate myself to this holy work to free my country

the morning following the excursion from williamsburg rev smith went early to his tasks he sang a merry tune how woman impresses man a goddess of beauty a queen of love a paragon of adoration she sinks him in hell then thru pity or sport and most often love exalts him straight tââ heaven once man has toucht her saintly person he has tasted food fit for the gods alone he has sipped ambrosial nectar having once enjoyed rapture how can he live but at this celestial board

william had lately drunk the best of life no day now could be dreary affronts of any sort were opportunities to be nobleâto scorn hate to love the sublime and true to make the night like unto the day

as he was eager to read the newspaper before starting the demonstration arranged for the forenoon he lingered on his lawn beneath the exuberant shade of a stately elm there he thot of his recent happiness particularly the ecstacy of thelma and susan what a joy to have lived and laught during those golden days of immediate recollection some other changes because of these soul benedictions would have to come to his estate how soon he dared not say

while contentedly overwhelmed by these musings that set his heart afire with tenderness for all things andy clarkston  came to him hurriedly and left the seaton gazette and the mail as the work on the farm was very well systematised clarkston had no time to tarry he proceeded at once to put the material in order for those expected at the experimental plant

automatically william scanned the first page of the newspaper tho he had planned to let his letters take precedence eagerness for news forced a glance at the daily his most immediate observation was the following headline the daughter of ted nailor our great townsman may marry rev smith the smart nigger the father says he has no objection men rise for the south william was determined now that the letters should wait thereupon he directed himself to a careful study of the article and as far as possible all its ramifications unaware of the meeting at whites he could not fathom it he read it several times then ceased to puzzle himself further

tom howell had prepared a biased sensational article distorted in the extreme to put the public against nailor one of the foremost business men and prepare for instant action against william the aim was to throw a match into a barrel of gasoline the reaction was of such nature the white people were about as dumfounded as william for they had thot that the reputation of the editor of the seaton gazette was such as to prevent any yellow journalism there was no reflection about the nonappearance of an editorial based upon the news item the important consideration was the fact that the statement was in the newspaper as a natural sequence a rapid discussion of the matter occurred in various groups

william hurried to the house only to find no one there

promptly he went to the garage obtained his motorcycle and rode with greatest possible speed to the experimental farm generally these demonstrations were attended by both white and black but on this occasion only colored farmers were present

when william dismounted jim turner a young man of twentysix said dr smith youre late this morning this is the first time ive know it to be so we were all discussing it when we heard your bike 

gentlemen i had something to make me late he spoke with emphasis a scurrilous a damnable article appeared in this mornings gazette concerning me he read the item then handed them the paper to survey smiles now gave way to melancholy scorn and anger they were as greatly disturbed as if they knew an unavoidable avalanche was sweeping upon them to utter ruin with no chance of their escape

to remove their distraction to bring them to a common end to assuage the horrors which brooded upon them lewis brown broke the suspense

you stand here like frightened sheep you say youre men now show it what are you going to do about this you see what the white folks have done already theyve read this article dont you see theres not a one here whereas generally we have as many white as colored the white folks have acted theyre together where are you 

gentlemen interrupted william who showed entire absence of fright or purturbation andy put away the experimental material and come by the house as speedily as possible as for the rest of you come by the house too and ill suggest what youre to do ill ride on ahead and by the time you get there i will have read my mail i ask for this brief interval in order that you may be properly guided as this is a crisis every precaution is necessary

but what about yourself inquired moses lampkins a middleaged farmer whose skin showed the weathering of many storms whose shoulders were broad enough for any burden

have no fear for me was the prompt reply i can take care of myself rest assured however should any misfortune come to me ill see that therell be someone to guide you gentlemen ill see you at the house the motor responded promptly as if aware of the importance of every second with equal readiness william started on his way smiled and waved adieu

all were astonisht the men older than forty were dumfounded previously when a colored man was about to be assaulted in their neighborhood all were cowed the man assailed did not show signs of courage until placed at bay to see one of their number calm before a brewing storm which they thot would have a momentum greater than that of a cyclone or hurricane to see him smile in the midst of grave danger and act almost as if nothing untoward had occurred to disturb the even tenor of his way was sufficient announcement that grim night had rolled away

another circumstance heralded the dawn formerly when a member of the race was being attackt or if persons thot him liable they shunned him as if he were a contagious disease with power to create a fatal epidemic on this occasion it was not so every man was bound for an interview with the markt individual no one thot of doing anything else

a few minutes brot william home where he would await his sturdy folk leaving his cycle before the door he went at once to his desk in a very alluring study there with expedition he proceeded to examine his mail he had received four letters according to his custom he noticed the post marks and the chirographies before perusing the contents the survey revealed two letters from williamsburg one from seaton and the fourth from washington d c

his attention was particularly attracted to the letter from seaton which had in the upper left corner the letters k k k and beneath them a skull and two crossed bones with almost prophetic insight he divined the contents unceremoniously he tore it open and read the curt missive it ran thus parson bill smith nigger your days round here are numbered if you dont leave this town within twentyfour hours be sure you make your git away quick

signed in blood the klan

william smiled as he read it and when he had finisht he laught almost uproariously it was not the laugh of merriment but the laugh of fierce resolve i wonder what they think i am he mused without more ado he read the letters from susan and thelma as he expected they contained an inspiration he read them twice then said to himself before god in the name of these two i resolve to do at this decisive moment only what is right i hope to survive the awful trial but i hope to have my honor unstained

finally he read the letter from washington for the first time that day he seemed troubled the contents of the communication follow dr william smith denmark vesey estate seatondear sir the fame of your endeavor has spread thruout the country we have studied the work for some time as proof you recall probably the visit of dr francis keats whom we sent there to make a survey of the community in which you live as it is related to your spirited undertaking his voluminous report shows that you are engaged in the proper work to make america safe for democracy you have succeeded in producing greater harmony between the races where their members exist side by side in large numbers than any one in the last fifty years

we have been particularly interested in the news items and editorials inspired by your enterprise articles which have appeared in the dailies and the magazines you are a national character whose name is on the lips of all our people not as the moses but as the joshua to take us into the promised land

finally as you are a minister with a tongue veritably able to set worlds on fire we feel that you should reach larger groups of people thruout the nation we learned that you were ousted at williamsburg because of an address delivered several years ago at your convention we have studied your discourse painstakingly and found ourselves in hearty accord with it if you become one of us you will have a clientele of fifty thousand willing listeners the new times need a new gospel and we behold in you its chief apostle

we the members of the american democracy league an organization formed to preach the new gospel of freedom work responsibility and aggresiveness see in you our logical leader the chieftain able to carry out our great dreams

therefore we offer you the position of national organizer with headquarters in washington at a salary of five thousand dollars for the first year after which time you will receive an increase of a thousand a year until you reach the maximum of twelve thousand

we are depending upon you answer please without delay

yours respectfully henry slater pres edgar young sec

for a while william was in a quandary should he go to washington for the larger work and at a later date return to seaton or should he offer the malefactors of race a firm resistance ill reply at once he decided whereupon he typewrote the letter in duplicate as was his wont in business transactions placed one copy in an envelope and dispatched it at once then he placed the letters from thelma and susan in separate pigeon holes and lowered the top of his desk he had now in hand the letter from the klan the call from washington and his own reply

he placed his hands behind his head and leaned back in the big revolving chair in quiet meditation he was planning the activity of the approaching moments with great deliberations he had not been thus occupied long when mr wilson knockt and informed him that all had arrived from the experimental plant have them come up william requested soon the room was full

i have three letters i want you to hear read them for me wilson take them in the order in which they occur he urged he was interested in studying the countenances of the men hence be askt wilson as a favor to read for him

when the orchard specialist had finisht reading the epistle of threat and warning moses lampkins askt what have you decided to do what do you want us to do

hear the other letters then ill make some remarks as the letters were being read william glanced from listener to listener the expressions on their faces were most satisfactory he rejoiced in silence

gentlemen youve heard my doom said our great character with a smile and a laugh that his hearers were baffled to interpret that letter from the socalled klan is no surprise the south is rather peculiar its perfectly willing to have trifling colored people to do the drudgery and all sorts of dirty work of course someone has to do it but it could be so much more willingly and thoroly done if the workers were specially trained for it the south has yet to learn that not the ignorant but the intelligent worker produces efficiency because of this very sentiment as soon a colored man acquires a good substantial bank account in many parts of this section it is time for him to find new quarters

you see already what ive determined to do now i want you to make your decisions im glad theres present at least one man from each of the farms owned by colored people for we can save much time gentlemen have you rifles and revolvers everyone was well supplied

we bought them shortly after you came here dont you remember said turner ready for any worthy enterprise his willingness to follow the great chieftain was characteristic of them all you said we might need them some day

hows your ammunition do you need any if so let me supply you now spoke william to be doubly sure since during his presence among them he had made constant inquiry along this line they had taken pains to have ample quantities on hand renewal was necessary because of target practice for the rifle tournaments which our young divine held on his estate thus rev smith had inspired among them an unerring marksmanship important at this particular time

all had sufficient ammunition gentlemen this letter has been sent only to me probably youre not to be molested but once a mob has seized its victim it does not stop there it vents its passion upon others youre as innocent as i yet they seek to do me injury then may they not come to you since i believe they will this is my desire prepare to defend your homes let injuries come to your property and your families only after you have died for them gloriously follow the spirit of that great american theodore roosevelt who in a speech in the coliseum of saint louis made this statement some people have said that they would fight but that they would not hit the first lick i used to be that way now i have changed when i see a man about to strike the first blow i hit first then there is no second blow struck when you hit a man always put him to sleep do you understand what youre to do now inquired rev smith

i blieve weve got it elder replied houston if we sees anybody prowlin round our farm dont wait fo him to shoot us but we shoot first aint dat it thats the idea rejoined the young planter glad that the instruction had gone home one further advice if you have to shoot be sure youre barricaded within your house in the day and barricaded on the outside at night ive already told you how to dispose of your families

but rev smith inquired the discontented mr lampkins what are you going to do if it had hot been for you we wouldnt had these farms you stood by us now were going to stand by you

dont worry about me calmly remarkt william who had in his heart longed for that spontaneous remark he knew now that his experiment had been a success tho the persons who sent me my notice are dirty scoundrels they will grant me a respite ive twentyfour hours in which to leave town within that time if i had to i believe i could conquer the world my men about me will look after the estate meanwhile ill transact some other business i can take care of myself

they disliked the idea of his going about by himself but as they believed he would do nothing rash they made themselves contented and went straightway to their homes

when all had left the study william came to himself after a pleasing reverie which closed with thots of susan and thelma suppose he had married what a trial this day would have been for the young wife the more he reflected upon it the more he became convinced that he had made no mistake by waiting of course he meant to keep his word to marry within eight months yet he rejoiced that he was single now a wife might object to some of the things he meant to do at this time but as the matter stood in all events he was sovereign lord the will of the wife he would have chosen would have been strong one which would require great persuasiveness to bring his way if once she thot the best solution to his problem lay in a different course other wills now would have little power over him he cou ld go directly to his mark

a married man will tolerate more offenses than the single one it is not that marriage makes him a coward but he feels that the demands of his family require him to keep alive at almost any price in this case to die is easy but to live is hard yet if the honor of the home is attackt tho married the man promptly defends it if he dies in the effort he rests in peace tht question was not to live but how to live

such was williams reflection as he was single and his mother well provided for his life was in his own hands if he wanted to go to washington objections were unimportant if he preferred to stay and risk his life it was his privilege

at this point he thot of writing his mother but almost as speedily as the idea came there followed the decision not to do so to communicate with her would only cause worry besides she might come there and be a hindrance or expose herself to injury

what should be done would be done quickly within two days all would be over he would be in williamsburg seaton or eternity

well ive been here long enough i must be about my fathers business he remarkt and went to the kitchen to see mrs brown he instructed her to tell garkston as soon as he arrived to see mr wilson who would tell him what to do until it would be time for him to go to post office for the next mail plans had to be changed to meet the crisis he then folded the three letters placed them securely in his pocket then he took from a comer his automatic rifle

he went directly to his range set up a target and practiced as he made fifty hits out of fifty attempts at the moving objects he thot it unnecessary to try the fixt ones even at different angles thereupon he lockt the targets and went back to the house his cycle ready he set the motor going and darted away

his business was to interview white farmers who were indebted to him for instruction and advice he approacht one after another and had them read his letters their attention however was first drawn to the rifle he carried in his hand what would you suggest that i do askt william in each instance not for advice but merely to get the fanners point of view the suggestions varied all regretted the predicament but only a few deplored it accordingly some were noncommittal saying that he must decide for himself others urged him to take the offer at washington trying to persuade him that it was the only thing to do

a few however like dean and martin insisted that he stay and fight the matter out then they told him of the meeting at robert whites and requested that he see mr davis who remained after many of the others had left william hurriedly departed from them to find this influential citizen

when he had gone two miles he had a blow out this did not delay him long for being prepared for all except extraordinary emergencies he adjusted the difficulty quickly and was on his way once more within a few minutes he was at mr nailors when he inquired he learned that mr nailor came in late the previous night and left early that following morning

this is rev smith isnt it inquired mrs nailor

yes this is he i understand your husband came to my defense last evening in a meeting designed to work me ham he replied very graciousl

sometimes i become so very much ashamed of my people remarkt the grand matron some of them do such foolish mean things to think of tom howells reporting that you were going to marry one of my daughters and youve never even met them theyve seen you only from a distance not that they would be discomforted in meeting you

some people will do anything he answered then with the courtesy and grace of a prince he bowed and askt to be excused

you can depend upon ted she replied as he bade her good day hes going to stick by you to the last drop of his blood and i hope hell teach those rascals a lesson

he then hurried along to find mr davis who lived on the adjoining farm no one could tell where he was the wife there gave encouragement also and william was overjoyed mrs davis if i do not meet your husband tell him ill be back this evening good day

i will she replied then william darted away

as it was just about time for a number of men to assemble about henry mitchells store he determined to go there as his last stop before going to town to his surprise he found his enemies absent approaching the storekeeper he said mr mitchell im in for it you need no explanation what do you think i should do 

kid he remarkt youve given me more business than i had in ten years i was just about to go under when you came but you stood up for the little business man and by gad im goin to see you thru all i say is stick on the job what do you say fellows william gave him the letters to read as he had the rest

mitchell we stand by you they replied

men i tell you the boy has plenty of sand read this letter patrick he said turning to the district school teacher youre better at it than me

thereupon he submitted to him the following communication it was williams reply to the offer from washington d c

the american democracy league crispus attucks hall washington d c

gentlemen if you desire an immediate categorical response my answer is i can not accept your offer i should be happy to extend my influence in accordance with the plans of your organization but to leave seaton now would be abject surrender and deprive me of the dignity i should bring to your exalted work

this morning i received in the mail which brot your kindly consideration a notice from a klan of these parts telling me to leave town within twentyfour hours at the peril of my life with me life is so insignificant in comparison with my privileges that i have decided to play the fool and die

not all the armies of this world nor all that have been and will be can drive me while i live from anything that is rightfully mine

i do not believe in stirring insurrection unless as a last resort i do believe in individuals not abandoning the rights i they have won but defending them as long as blood courses i thru their veins if when this crisis is overâi dare not say  how soon that will beâyou wish to consider me for the place i will be able to give you a more favorable reply when a i challenge like this is offered i really accept i must show the klan that i can live here if i so desire if after that i accept the place my headquarters will have to be in seaton

if i survive you will hear from me next week if you i do not you will know that i have died in the south to make america safe for democracy

yours respectfully william smith

how astonisht were all to hear that communication could any good thing come out of nazareth here was one with skin so black but soul as bright and pure as sunlight why could such a man who had veritably placed seaton on the map not be permitted to enjoy the fruitage of his labor

i was late getting here but was in time to hear that letter let me shake your hand thats the kind of stuff we want in this country william turned to see the speaker it was mr davis and with him was mr nailor

when he had finisht an interview with them he started off

which way are you going now inquired mr nailor

william replied im going to see the mayor he left without delay

when he had reacht the edge of the town william decided that he would walk to the mayors office he determined upon this as a precaution which would permit more freedom for selfdefense should it be necessary for him to use his rifle thoroly familiar with the conditions of seaton and the environs he knew that white people in the country were almost entirely for him or were neutral either they were going to aid him or they were not going to oppose him accordingly his enemies were chiefly in the town the machinations of the council of six included the bringing of a mob from the urban throngs he thot to be composed chiefly of persons who did not know him how otherwise could he account for the scurrilous article in the seaton gazette tho cognizant of these conditions he would go thus far into the camp of the enemy for the satisfaction of his own heart for the edification of his race for the arousal of admiration and respect among the reputable people of the town william concluded that this was necessary he must see the mayor

reaching the garage and repair shop of his friend harvey allen he left the motorcycle there the entreprenenr questioned him concerning the newspaper attack and his attitude towards it the planter replied when the enemy comes hell receive a warm reception

ill be there to help you entertain him remarked allen ill be delighted to have your service

at this william started upon his important mission persons who had not come much into his presence casual passersby would have paid him scant attention however those who had observed him closely on other occasions in this instance would have noticed a departure from the accustomed stride the erect bearing and the direct quick pace our hero moved circumspectly with an occasional glance to the left and to the right

when he reached the union station whom should he meet full of smiles and captivating graces but thelma haskell after a brief exchange of greetings and other conventionalities there were expressions of surprises at seeing each other of course thelma had hoped to see him shortly after her arrival but she was not expecting the good fortune which presented itself immediately

why have you come at this particular time inquired william as thots of his predicament thrust themselves crowdingly upon him i wish you had waited a while i fear i can not entertain you as i should like

i did not come to be entertained at all ill look after that was her assurance i am going to return the compliment you see i enjoyed myself so grandly last week that i had to come again im going to show you the time of your life such were the joyous outbursts which fell upon our great character like hail in a summer cornfield but where are you going she remarkt with a sudden turn of thot you appear to be on your way to a hunt

i am en route to the mayor concerning a little business this morning the seaton gazette published a scurrilous article concerning me i cannot show it to you as my paper is at the house furthermore in the same mail which brot your letterâby the way since i think of it you said nothing at all in your letter about your coming why dont you let a fellow know your intention  i should have had some one to meet you and see that you were properly cared for william spoke thus because he felt especially at this time that some harm might befall her

dont you know by now william that a woman cant tell a man everything she must to some extent keep him guessing society says that the men must seek the women if the man understood everything you know hed never run after her we have to do something to keep them coming she remarkt with unusual affability then realizing that there was yet to be obtained the information she desired she pressed a question to bring him back to what certainly was of immediate interest to him you havent told me why you have that gun as he was not afraid to tell thelma anything he explained the matter in detail likewise all that he had done that day as preparation for any outbreak heres the letter demanding that i leave within twentyfour hours he said with great emotion

thelma quickly scanned its contents and then spoke with some degree of alarm and dismay whats the matter with these white folks the president has said that we are to help make the world safe for democracy how can we even have democracy in america with such disrespect for the law on the part of the socalled superior race what are you going to do youre not going to leave are you i dont see yet what youre aiming at she had in her zeal for justice i and respect for property rights become bold and defiant i know what they want and im ready to let them have it i dont see what you want down here tho why arent you on your farm organizing your friends to resist these insults youve organized them for peace and they are with you i saw that during the few days i was among them

i can protect myself thelma i have no fear he affirmed in his effort to assure her that all would be well she lookt at him a while and then became silent charmed with his princely aspect soon the spell was broken and she was returned to the foreboding of her soul dreams you can protect yourself i agree you can protect yourself against individuals man for man and even at great odds but you know the seething south as thoroly as i you know she spoke louder and more defiantly as she proceeded the cowards you know the blackhearted scoundrels come against one colored man by hundreds and thousands so superior are we to that common refuse that one of us strikes such fear into tens of them and even fifties that they must needs oppose us in hundreds and thousands they pay us a great compliment yet when they come a hundred or a thousand against one the chances for defeating them do not exist under these circumstances your attitude is follhardy

thelma my ambition is to be strictly lawabiding the nation is engaged in war for world democracy

for all the world except the negro when american statesmen politicians and scholars engage in argument concerning demrocracy if you think they mean a democracy in which we are included upon equal terms with other races youre sadly mistaken were on the outside

probably they dont include us but their statements are so far sweeping that they can not exclude us we must be reckoned with we shall enter this democracy whether they want us or not the only government that will offer ages of peace is a democracy its right and he who seeks to stop the course of right is by its very momentum crusht to insignificance and degeneracy i mean to be right i mean to do right im going to perform no disloyal act im going to lay this matter before the mayor this was in accordance with his plans or as the soldier would say it was a part of the day s work

what good will that do william she inquired at the same time trying very arduously to see some advantage in that action

it will probably teach the lawless that they should not permit the colored man who receives very little from the country to love honor and respect it more than those who receive mainly humiliations it may teach them to be loyal to america in this great crisis and not embarrass the administration certainly i shall win the respect and admiration of white and black alike who love the south if i die my death will be a monument to the loyalty of my people he spoke with resolution

that sounds well remarkt thelma showing by the intonation of her voice that she did not approve the sacrifice i admire your stand yet this is not what a white man would do under these circumstances recalling his people on and about his estate with whom he was almost a god she askt what have you done as to the security of your friendsâ your helpers and your neighbors you are too farsighted not to be aware that this animosity will not stop with you harm will fall to your friends innocence should exempt a man from violation but has it exempted you and arent you as innocent as those people are they not as innocent as you

yes i am you are speaking truly he replied those were almost his very words

hence you owe it to these people to organize them for their own defense forsake your own estate if you will but do defend these helpless toilers she pleaded earnestly her bosom heaving as she spoke and tears about to flow

it would seem too much like an insurrection he remarks yet if our country were not at war it is the very thing id do but if there is only one person in the nation to respect the law during this awful cataclysm i am determined to be that one i have advised my neighbors to defend their homes to the last drop of their blood a mans home is his castle and none can hold him lawless if he kills the man who assaults it i mean to have the law on my side the twenty men on my estate when properly distributed in ambush will be a formidable offense against any mob be sure ill take care of that

furthermore do not think i shall forsake my people if they have received letters of warning if any of them has received one my duty will bd in their midst and not on my estate

william she returned with a conviction equal to his own with equal emotion and firmness your life is dear to many of us you must not throw it away we can not live always we may die by violence yet we should do our utmost to see that our assassin falls with us your mind i see is made up and so is mine good bye ill see you this evening she started away at once

where are you going what do you plan to do said william calling her back she turned and smiled with a wealth of love and devotion im on my way to mrs johnsons after remaining there a few minutes im going into the country

dont think of it he urged you are putting your life in danger even to be in the town really you dont know what you are contemplating

i do not know she uttered slowly i do not know your danger i do not know the peril of your neighbors i dont know yes i do consequently my business is not in the town but in the country i go to help save a loyal people i go to save those who suffer most and yet serve most good bye william ill see you this evening i shall expect you remember good bye she hurried on to the home of the gentle lady with whom she lodged during the previous week with an air of great importance

william watcht her for a moment and then reflected how i do admire her she is true gold he went directly to the mayors office

while william was engaged in an interview with the chief city official thelma was busy ascertaining the preparations for resistance on smiths estate with despatch she saw both brown and wilson and learned what had been done men were already on guard with proper instructions satisfied with this arrangement she began at once what she regarded as equally essential for maintaining the peace of the entire community mr wilson i think that you are rather well protected on this estate but what about your good neighbors here you have several natural ambuscades and redoubts but what have our other kind friends i was thinking that i can help them if i can get just a little assistance from you since you know them all cant you bring them together at one place for me to speak to them 

miss haskell what would reverend smith say if harm befell you in your effort if i were even indirectly the cause of bringing you woe i fear he would not forgive me was the sturdy affirmation

ive talked with him in town already and he knows i am determined to do something i ask your aid merely to expedite time if you refuse me ill find these people myself and see that they come together im resolute if you desire sincerely to keep me unexposed to affront and injury you will at least do this little thus thelma put her case tersely for this was no occasion for parleying with her it was a matter of life or death and she was leaning we know towards life

give me a moment to reflect he said trying to avoid too hasty a decision

how much time do you wish she inquired

five minutes was the prompt answer

take them she rejoined with a glance that cautioned celerity as you use them remember that five minutes tardiness may be the ruin of hundreds of human lives

he withdrew from the sittingroom and sought brown who had just gone to look at the outposts after having gone a hundred yards he called promptly brown appeared when they had had a brief conference wilson speedily returned and found thelma patiently waiting i have been following the seconds and the minutes thru fear and anxiety she spoke showing the watch fastened about her wrist but you are on time with a few seconds to spare

miss haskell that is a circumstance concerning which dr smith is extremely abstemious thru him we have learned to be prompt in all our engagements was the proud asseveration then he went on i return to your business mr brown and i have decided to help you carry out any plan you have in mind for aiding our neighbors

i appreciate that so much she remarkt with a full flush of happiness you can not imagine how my spirit rejoices thank you mr wilson thank you

im happy to be at your service now what are your plans 

could the people come to this estate for about a half hour

that cannot be dr smiths instructions interfere with that for special reasons which i do not care to divulge he prefers that they do not come here

i know his reasons now that you call his wish to my mind but may they not meet at the school house i want to speak to them assembled

thats possible he replied that is the way out since there is no work in operation on the plantation ill notify several who will see that the rest are there when are they to assemble 

immediatly

come lets be off he obtained his rifle and went to the garage to get his car when all was ready they sped away to the home nearest the school house there he left thelma in congenial company and hastened to notify the others he found all the farmers on guard when he had explained to them the purpose of the meeting they set their sons or wives or both to the task and started for the school house

within less than a half hour all expected were there ready for the great undertaking gentlemen said mr wilson opening the meeting you will recall that the lady before you was present during the wheat harvest she needs no introduction i present to you miss haskell who will give you all details i ask you to excuse me now as i must return to the house but ill be back as soon as dr smith returns i know you will want to hear what hes been doing well ill tell you then miss haskell is an able young woman strong and brave a hard worker she can give you good advice hear her good bye ill be back shortly hereupon he departed

gentlemen american citizens thelma began with her voice full of melodious sweetness for years many of you toiled and toiled yet never forged ahead each planting season found you deeper in debt than the one which had past still you workt on merely existing hoping that some day the yoke you could not remove would be smashed by your children

yes youre telling the truth i never could get out of old halloways debt until about two years ago remarkt one of the farmers who was strongly corroborated by many others

it did not however happen that way she continued it was not your children who showed you how to buy tools implements and groceries how to buy land how to improve your land by its cultivation it was not your children who brought you this freedom who caused you to win the respect of your white neighbors it was not at all whom you expected and it came sooner than you thot this happiness was brot to you by a minister a farmer a man of business a gentlemanâ rev william smith

there followed great applause and approbation happy in the response she received she resumed this friend of yours has been notified to leave this country within twentyfour hours tomorrow at ten oclock he is due to be far away you know i suppose he has decided to remain this means that a mob is coming against him as soon as knowledge spreads that he is here

dr smith has been a friend to every one of you will you be a friend to him will you love him with the greatest love that can stir the human heart no greater love hath a man than this that he lay down his life for a friend even at this moment he is in the midst of his enemies exposing his life for yours for your glory and that of your children he has done no more than you yet he has been ordered to leave these accumulations of his young manhood if innocence would not exempt him from reproach and violence do not believe it will exempt you when your leader has been overthrown the mdb will come in force against you if rev smith survives you shall live if he perish with him you fall where then is your place in this great hour scattered like dandelions in a lawn or united like the streams of the mighty river she pointed to the familiar waterway in the distance your place is on your friends estate under one leadership you did not acquire your lovely homes until he came will you be able to hold them if he falls and dies let there not be thirty different guards but one i mean that all the farmers should keep in communication with one another in this way if any farm is attackt all can quickly go to its defense this is how the battles are being won in europe this is how you must win yours

well do what rev smith suggests interrupted jim turner

he has already suggested thelma broke in but he is just neither to himself nor to you human life must be protected hence i appeal to you dr smith has not askt me to do this hes entirely unaware of my plans he said he would have done this however had the country not been at war he feels that such united resistance as i have outlined would be misunderstood and interpreted as a rebellion or an act of war

at this point some were disconcerted and began to wonder whether they should combine against the prospective foe to prevent such thots having much force the gentle visitor soon turned to utterances that always sway the hearer you think of hesitating men you must act for your friends for your own lives during slavery the supreme court of the united states gave out this decision the negro has no rights which the white man is bound to respect the masses of the white people act in accordance with that statement todav here in this district you do have much respect why it is because you have wealth if the white man does not respect he admires you

if you desire even greater respect from them earn your rights and be willing to die to defend them liberty has been gained by bloodshed do not fear to pay the price you he does respect your dollars you are thrifty thats why white and black alike will honor you and sing your praises always who fears to die preferring to be enslaved is not fit to live

there followed shouts and acclamations those who wavered a while ago were now bent on pursuing a common aim lets do something at once cried one

lets go at once to the estate said others

gentlemen continued thtlma happily i thot you would be noble i was sure you stood for right it may happen that we shall not even be approacht but i regard such a prospect extremely doubtful rev smith has gone to see the mayor we may get the news at any moment but we cannot wait we must be prepared human life i repeat must be protected if the government will not human life must be protected how may we organize put in moses lampkins who believed in expedition

what man here can all follow and obey at the slightest suggestion she inquired to help remove the delay

i can follow jim turner like a chick following a hen said lampkins

i know i can said many others

mr turner said thelma smiling i appoint you leader of these noble men their lives and all their possessions are in your hands be a matchless leader then turning to the throng she continued gentlemen excuse mr turner a few minutes i should like to talk with him individually the honored farmer promptly went to the front of the room and heard the fair lady he thot of his overalls but as a crisis was at hand he had no time to stand on conventionalities

during their conversation thelma and turner planned the resistance they were not to attack they decided upon scouts outposts sentinels and guards also upon a line of communication when all had been assigned they started for their posts hereupon they heard the report from the combustion of a motor they knew it was rev smith he had seen the mayor and had returned to them such cheers and plaudits as are given kings and queens advancing in the midst of holiday throngs were showered upon the prophet of sinai shrine the man of business he lifted his hat in grateful acknowledgment and dismounted in front of the school house

thelma miss haskell he remarkt upon seeing her what are you doing here he was uneasy about her it will soon be dark and you will have a dangerous trip to town i fear

rev smith she said she was conventional because of the crowd

i am preparing to protect you to save you if not for yourself or persons in williamsburg at least for these people she lifted her hand to stay interuption and continued i dont know when i shall go to town

thelma this must not be

william must riot i shall lodge at mr turners isnt he and his wife all right

ah for me give me liberty of give me death âpatrick henry the waiting room of the mayors office was very much crowded when william arrived to have his interview according to the custom he trailed the line and waited his turn the other visitors who were all white first noticed the rifle then the khaki and finally his complexion here they lingered long for they wondered why a colored man would come thus accountered into the office of the chief magistrate of that town only to change their appraisement when they beheld his portly bearing and pleasant demeanor william took out a note book and began to write while they continued to steal occasional glances he appeared wholly absorbed in his work but he never failed for a minute to take circumspect glimpses of his enforced companions

the visitors gradually were successful in their business and speedily left for the next tasks william soon began to feel that the office would close before he could discharge his mission he kept noticing the clock and comparing it with his watch apprehensive lest one chronometer would deceive him the whistle sounded for the close of civic work and brot him to his feet all had seen the mayor except two who were ahead of him two elderly gentlemen and himself tho somewhat disturbed he waited with his accustomed patience then the idea flasht upon him that he was not making the most of his time many details of his venture or of his contemplated resistance could be workt out to this meditation with stolen glances at the other persons in the waiting room

our brave character proceeded at once to apply himself sure that his prospective assailants meant business and that there could be no sparring for time he thrust book and pencil into his pocket and began to think of devices for getting an interview before sundown

while william was thus anxious the messenger came into the sitting room and said the office is closed only those in the sitting room will be heard william sat down and resumed his writing

how calm a man may become when he knows a life struggle is before him how undisturbed is an intelligent soul when brot to bay we sometimes feel too proud to fight thinking that in so doing we stoop to baseness we believe at times that it is wrong for individual or state to force a man to exchange time for eternity we decry war violence and rapine and look for the ages of peace and to be consistent we censure the taking of human life for any crime yet when a fray is forced upon us when we regard it ignoble to flee we fight and kill is this right shall it become the universal law as long as it is sweet and noble to die for ones country it is stately to die for ones honor

such was williams reflection just before facing the mayor a rather chubby man of fortyseven slightly grizzled and adorned with homed spectacles he placed himself back in his chair scrutinized the dignified visitor and then offered him a seat near his desk this is rev smith im sure make yourself at home did the speaker mean that was he not after all an exalted instrument in the hands of unscrupulous people william sat down what can i do for you came a customary question

i dont know mayor goodrich you can better answer that question yourself after i have explained my business

replied william smiling he placed his gun across his knee and handed the magistrate the letter from the klan read that please he requested the mayor read when he had finisht william presented the letter from washington which he followed with his reply mr goodrich ruminated after having perused the epistles and waived for william to break the silence he did not wait long i came to you mayor goodrich because i love this town the nation and my people as tins is a very serious consideration one which may not only disgrace your administration and the town but even humiliate the nation i came to you with all possible facts that you may act wisely and quickly what are you going to do mr goodrich what do you suggest that i do

the mayor aswered hesitatingly dr smith i dont see much that i can do i can have the governor call the militia but what good would that do instead of firing upon the mob theyd aid it either by joining it or by depriving your colored brothers of their weapons and then leave them to the mob you recall what the papers stated concerning east st ixuis that militia is typical of the south

mayor i know said william agreeing with the magistrate that the black man has practically no protection in the south and very little in many other parts of this great nation that is why i have this rifle tho the constitution grants me paper protection i cannot trust my life to it before almighty god i wish i could but i must protect myself the colored man who does not protect himself is dead already you see i do not ask for protection because i know in advance i cant get it

however let nothing rash be done put in the mayor trying to use diplomacy your people are loyal i know you are loyal ive watched your coming here your influence among white and black and your development of industry here ive gone so far as to suggest that a group of the best citizens give you the same token of appreciation now that this trouble has risen i thot out a possible solution why not accept the offer coming from washington  furthermore i have a large estate in tennessee which id like for you to develop ill offer you ten thousand dollars cash as the gift of the townsmen of course its not as yet subscribed ill give you a large farm from my tennessee estate and pay you two thousand a year to do there the work youve done here it would be well for you to leave now and return later on after several years all would be adjusted here are two offers surely for the sake of the nation youll go

mr goodrich permit me to relate two incidents came the calm response and then ill give you my decision have i leave

yes go on

at ebbit seminary in kelston was a very learned colored man dr kemper its president the school he administered was located in the far south where our people live in great numbers some misfortune caused a mob to come against the school and fire thru the windows as this gentleman was a minister his first thot was to seek divine aid he despatched a messenger to the governor asking for troops and had the chapel bell rung for the gathering of the students in extraordinary assembly as they came together in the chapel the pistols withoutâin the language of the presidentâcontinued to bark like dogs so well do i recall this for heard him relate it in a church in saint louis not to digress i conclude this great educator had those seven hundred students kneel in prayer he himself led the petition

while still engaged in that service a message came from the governor that troops would soon be upon the scene with ammunition and a gatling gun the troops came in time and the mob did not storm the buildings president kemper mentioned this in a very important speech to prove that when in danger we should pray he offered it as proof that prayers are answered on time

that is a rare incident remarkt the governor it is very interesting now mention the other

as you say william went on a rare incident such happens in this country only in one case out of ten thousand

the other incident he continued is like the first in many respects but yet it has fundamental differences kendell seminary at harmony had at its head dr wade who was also a christian minister his school has the unique distinction of rejecting the offer of  for the building of a school for colored youth because the donor the home missionary society wanted to control its policy it returned the money with interest today president wade operates that seminary which is controlled and supported solely by colored people it is indeed our greatest monument of negro selfhelp

lets return however to the incident one class in preparing to produce the h m s pinafore found it necessary to have special rehearsals for the principals to expedite the opera the professor in charge had the leading characters to rehearse in town at the home of the professor of music the seminary was located just outside the city limits

one evening when the boys and girls were returning from such a rehearsal three white ruffians accosted and confronted them one of them pulled at one of our girls and insinuated youre a fine lookin nigger gal youll do me as he tried to kiss her the captain of the football team a strong robust individual struck the scoundrel in the jaw broke the bone and felled him to the ground

the other ruffians came to the rescue but were rebuffed by our gallant young men

the professor a man of a very heated disposition said its well i left my pistol behind for i surely would have shot every one of them the dirty dogs he would have done it turning to the young ladies he resumed well take the matter before dr wade hell adjust it as the incident occurred at the foot of the hill on which the school stood it was not long before all reacht the dormitories as they climbed the hill one of the culprits remarkt were going to bring all cotton town against you let them come on went back an answer

as soon as president wade learned what had occurred he called the girls and boys into the chapel this minister was just as conservative about his doctrine as dr kemper when all had assembled he explained the situation and said boys our girls have been insulted what shall we do one promptly arose and declared dr wade theres only one thing to doâdefend them and die for them what do you say boys  die for them was the unanimous acclamation

 girls the president continued we cannot assure you that you will live to see tomorrow many were weeping bitterly this however was no interference we cannot vouchsafe you even your honor there may be some base enough to violate your chastity we do however guarantee this that if even a hair on your head is troubled it will be over our dead bodies so go to your rooms and take your ease

the girls promptly withdrew

one rule of the school was that firearms were not to be kept in the dormitories yet the president askt if there were pistols or rifles about he received an affirmative answer whereupon he askt them to bring arms and ample ammunition to the chapel never before had i seen such an array of fire arms among my people there were automatic colts smith and wesson s many shot guns and winchesters when it appeared that all had returned dr wade himself came in with seven winchesters which he distributed among the male members of the faculty then he sent a student to his home for his own rifle saying take this note to mrs wade and tell her ill not return until late probably till morning thereupon addressing himself to those ambitous young men he continued im going to instruct the professors as to how to repulse any manuever you are to obey them without questioning most of you are to remain without arms these are the only ones to leave the school grounds they will watch the movements of the evening and form our first line of communication boys this is dangerous work yet our effort is valueless without it i cannot therefore assign it i must call for volunteers every youth volunteered boisterously i want to be a scout

im glad of this unanimous response i know now we shall succeed promptly scouts were selected and dispatched to perform their work then the teachers were posted as captains they posted their groups about the campus so as to cover every approach and awaited the attack of those who threatened

the night this occurred the stars were faintly shining in the refulgent glow of a luxurious moonlight shadows of trees and housesâin short all objects in the landscape were strongly visible

an hour after the school force had been on watch the scouts sent back word that a hoard of about three hundred men were coming from cotton town cotton town was the seat of a cotton factory surrounded by the frame dwellings of the workers it lay about half a mile from the school limits

when a hundred and fifty yards from the campus one of the gang shouted were coming niggers say your last prayers

 come on went a robust answer we can take all you can give and pay you back with interest our scouts were called in and armed thus we awaited them

 remember came as the presidents final advice since we have a good number and most of you are in ambush let the enemy fire the first shot if they unload a weapon follow your professors commands quickly and there muzzles flasht outrageously in the quiet moonlight the leaders came within twentyfive yards and started at the glare of those rifles ready for blood the one who apparently was chief called ten together for a conference then messages were sent thru the ranks this was followed by a retreat to their homes with yelling and cursing

mayor goodrich this happened eight years ago the school still stands as a monument to negro selfhelp negro courage and negro manhood

that is interesting i suppose i had to listen as the wedding guest to the voyage of the ancient mariner but what is the point of the incidents he parried fully aware of the purport of it all

i promised when i had related those stories to tell you my decision concerning your offer william spoke rapidly now tho not so rapidly as passed the currents of his emotion i mention the deeds of those men to point out the attitudes of my people dr kemper represents the manner of the new negro in the new south which is at hand the old negro is a misfit you cannot have a democratic south until this new negro represents the majority of his race the old order changeth giving place to new and god fulfills himself in many ways lest one good custom should corrupt the world mayor i had thot of marrying sometime ago i was sure that i would have been married by this time i should have been married by this time now i dont know if ill ever marry ill give my life for democracy here ill give my life for my race ive scented blood my fighting spirit is on fire mayor goodrich mayor goodrich down in your heart do you really think i ought to go

certainly because it will save trouble

who made this trouble

in a way you did rev smith by taking hold of the affairs of the farmers

the man who stops robbers who sees that workers are not only worthy of their hire but actually gets it causes trouble 

you know those stock jobbers are envious of a colored mans rising to wealth and power probably after the education of a few years this violence will cease

more and more mr goodrich i believe that this is not solely a white mans problem if every colored community would take the stand of kendall seminary the problem would be solved over night those ruffians who vaunt and prowl like fiends infernal do so only because they are sure that their lives arc secure i do not believe in insurrections as evidence of this i call to witness my neighbors whom i sent to defend their own homes my estate will be defended only by those who resided there

i have already mailed my reply to washington your offer too i must reject it you were to offer me the whole of south america and india and africaâif such were yours to giveâid have to refuse them i must stay ill sell a farm ill sell a horse a house an automobile or the like but mr goodrich none will barter the immediate jewel of his soul id sell my life for fifty cents a day if it would benefit humanity but worlds on top of worlds cannot offer me the price of liberty

i workt for the farmer didnt i inquired william the mayor nodded assent i purchased from honest toil those buildings and implements i use nobody in seaton gave me one cent that farm represents my lifes blood the land was honestly got the buildings were honestly erected the title to all is clear isnt it mayor goodrich

assuredly the magistrate admitted faintly they are yours so they are duly recorded

no man mr mayor has ever been able to run me from what was mine my reputation and honor cannot go down now i have not had the proud privilege of going to france to die for world democracy but i do have the privilege of falling for it in america i have spent some rather joyous days with books and young women but never have i rejoiced as i do now the opportunity has come for me to die not in france but in america to help make america safe for democracy this is the happiest moment of my life

you need not offer me any protection i have but one request tell your friends ill kill every man who sets foot on my estate after sundown

the mayor lookt in amazement at this man this black man comely and selfpossest tho desiring no harm to come to his fellow townsmen he could not help admiring this attitude

good day said the mayor shaking his hand i hope all will be well

good bye said william i may die but not in dishonor i will not sell the immediate jewel of my soul

the morning following williams call upon the mayor just before sunrise the colored people who lived upon farms bordering on our heros estate or who had been directly influenced by his operations started for the home of wendell hill to hold a prayer meeting men women childrenâall assembled the work of the previous evening was almost undone for there was not aman at his post

believing every detail would be well carried out thelma finally went to sleep at a very late hour she deemd it proper to seize a few hours rest as she might have to stay on her feet fortyeight hours or more after the dawning of the next day she wanted to have a maximum of energy for she knew she had much work to do

tho the watch was faithfully kept during the night yet every man had been able to get about three hours rest this happened because of the careful arrangement and alternation of the guard long after our lady had gone to sleep however the idea occurred to hill a man of unusual religious persuasion that before entering upon any serious undertaking there should be prayer his mistake was not in having prayer but in having a prayer meeting in a crisis and leaving all the possessions of these people exposed to an unrelenting foe thinking that the lady from the city was accustomed to rising late like other townspeople who had visited her mrs turner had not informed thelma what was about to occur but left her undisturbed

she hurried to the assembling place because she dearly enjoyed prayer meetings others were just as interested as she so many came that the leaders were at a loss where to place them they finally left the matter with the people

as the front room would not hold all the guests many assembled on the outsideâall firmly bent on serving their god whether they were within or without no unusual preparations had been made to appear in one s finest everyone wore working attire as they tript along charting and smiling one would not have thot a storm was rapidly sweeping on

wendell hill opened the meeting by saying trouble is brewing the devil is mighty busy but god can make him stay in his place

amen amen burst forth vociferously from many mouths

it never hurts a man to take god with him for gods a captain that never loses a battle continued hill swaying the throng

no he dont talk on hill said one of the women hill would not wax eloquent he merely said well open the meeting with scripture he read as follows from the tenth chapter of matthew behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogugesand the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved

and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hellthink not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword l or i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughterinlaw against her motherinlaw and a mans foes shall be those of his very householdhe that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it

as hill read the faces showed various states of emotionâ anxiety doubt consternation it was difficult for some to believe the passages were genuine the doubt however was very evanescent for when each recalled that hill was their greatest bible student that he was most fervent in his religious zeal and of unquestioned integrity they speedily changed their minds when the enthusiast began to utter the opening prayer and gave his fertile imagination free play all doubts subsided jesus was christ and god was lord of all

turner then began to sing i want to be ready to walk in jerusalem just like john then followed rhytmic hand clapping cadenced to the time of the sound there was likewise a patting of feet to reinforce the joyful emotion slight at first but later more vigorous as the leader became more enthusiastic prayer followed prayer with hopes that god would intervene to prevent the spilling of blood then came the song come on lets go to the camp meeting this was followed by a number of songs im going to live and never die little david play on your harp honor honor my lord when these were sung the people marcht and shouted the leader of the song performing many antics waving his right hand as if a choir master stooping low and at times leaning back with his hands to his mouth as if making a speaking trumpet he would walk from group to group waving his hand as if trying to draw forth more powerful sounds from those who seemed to let up from the exahustion of marching or shouting then he would place his left hand on his jaw bend his head to one side and holler or shriek these gesticulations kept the spirit alive

in the thralldom of this deep religious emotion with cares all dispelled who thot of thelma the kingdom of heaven was at hand sorrow and sighing had past away

in the zephyrs of the morning thelma peaceably slept on unaware of any plan miscarried that night somehow she could not understand she had had an unusual dream she saw a hare dart out of a copse and run toward a pack of hounds which turned from pursuit of a fox to chase this bold little creature soon appeared the hunters in fine breeches on fiery horses at great speed seeing that hunt had changed they checked their pace and hallowed to the hounds to retake the scent the dogs quickly responded bounding once more for their original prey but both hare and fox escaped

when our fair lady awoke she found herself very much fatigued she seemed sleepier than ever and pondered on remaining there longer for another doze this however was only a first thot she sat up in bed musing then she lookt about the room the sun was well up as she discovered from the heat and light forcing their way thru the windows her attention was now attracted to sweet harmonious strains joyfully rising in the distance what could it be she listened more closely where could it be the words were entirely inaudible tho the tones were rather distinct at last came one conviction the singing was from the colored farmers for white people did not sing that way she was eventually reminded by the minor strains of the fisk jubilee singers for she recognized some of the songs those minstrels were wont to sing im gwine to jine de great sociation i couldnt hear nebdy pray go down moses

she sprang from the bed happy as a lark fresh as the dew at early morning she quickly proceeded to arrange her toilet while engaged in this she heard a vigorous knocking thinking that it was only the morning call she shouted mrs turner im up as the knocking did not cease thelma observed with greater interest the sounds did not come from the bedroom door as she first surmised but from that room next the kitchen upon opening her window and looking down she saw andy clarkston and at a little distance from him a motorcycle

do you know where mr turner is or do you know where i can find his wife to learn where he is i have a letter for him from rev smith which i must give him in person such was the inquiry of andy who showed signs of eagerness to execute his business and return to the estate without delay

what are the folks out remarkt thelma with great surprise where can they be what are they doing what do they mean by leaving me alone how long have you been there were her incoherent utterances

andy paused awhile wondering which questions to answer but eventually solved the dilemma by responding to her i suppose ive been here about three minutes we both seem to be in the same situation you as well as i wonder where are the folks i had expected to see somebody on guard of course the estate is well cared for but if the other people are defending their farms it is being done by the old grandmothers that means that there is practically no protection at all 

thelma immediately showed signs of anger for a while she was silent for the thots that thrust themselves upon her at the very instant would have been uttered but ineffectually due to the absence of those who should hear them mr clarkston can you wait for me a few minutes without arousing the ill feeling of rev smith

miss haskell i could wait a life time he replied bashfully to stop for others would displease him but to remain for your sake im sure will give him hours of ecstacy thelma blusht and said excuse me then ill be back within five minutes she hurried to the task as soon as she reacht the landing she heard strains of camp meeting in the wilderness the people must be there she thot she returned at once to the window and said those people i vow are holding a prayer meeting during these perilous moments mr clarkston do you hear that singing

yes he said it seems as tho its in the direction of wendell hills you know he is strong for his religion in season and out of season the truth is it should always be in season yet theres more ways to serve god than one one need not pray all the time

i dislike to detain you from your errand she interrupted but those people must come back on guard she wondered why she returned to the window she had become greatly disturbed

by the way broke in andy rev smith told me to say to you not to worry the neighbors about him that hes well protected and so he is

tell him i understand i appreciate your kindness extremely she smiled and clarkson felt happy in her sunshine i want you to direct me to mr hills just the same ill be with you presently she spoke and left the window on this occasion there was no chance for finesse

within three minutes she returned ready for the days work even tho she had not dined andy wondered what to do with the cycle seeing the difficulty thelma said you may go on ill find the place just give me the directions

ill take you to the place where you will have a straight road to the house then ill go rapidly on so quickly will i attend to this business that i shall seem not to have lost any time

youre quite obliging mr clarkston thelma smiled again

andy was almost frantic with joy dont mention it miss haskell dont mention it he said with great embarrassment the honor is all yours he took her to the main road so thelma found the place easily

as soon as he had left the tender visitor andy hastened to his motorcycle which contrary to his apprehensions was in front of turners door unharmed almost in a twinkling he had started the motor and sped away he reacht hills house at least ten minutes before thelma calling turner aside he delivered the letter wait a moment for an answer said mr turner

rev smith said you need not wait for a reply he mounted the cycle and in an instant was out of sight

turner read the letter at once it expressed disapproval of any combining of all the people urging again that each go to his own home and defend it what was he to do what were the others to do they had given their word to a great lady that they would unite to oppose a common foe could they not be mistaken was there a common foe nobody had come against them yet

turner went back to the meeting and as soon as possible prayed emphasizing this utterance they that use the sword shall perish by the sword several other prayers followed to the same effect the sentiment was prevailing that god would fight their battles for them

at the door now stood thelma listening to it all at the same time trying to devise a means of addressing the people unwilling to disturb the solemnity of their worshipâfor she respected with great reverence the sacred heritage of her peopleâshe determined not to lose her temper for she knew that once her impetuosity held sway she would violently disperse the throng such an act would only teem with evil consequences  it would destroy at once all her popularity and make her organization of the people absolutely of noneffect

she thot of getting word to turner or hill this strategem would have been easy if singing had been on but the people were engaged in a chain of prayers as soon as one finisht another began in this way much enthusiasm was kept sustained there was only one wayâit was to be a link in the chain after there had been uttered several other prayers damaging to her plans thelma was able to intervene she might have interrupted earlier but she wanted it to be done smoothly with reverence and perfect accord there was no delay in grasping this sort of opportunity

thelma had not prayed in public for some time this was one of the first thots to come before her she knew that even in praying practice makes perfect if one wants to be coherent fervent and sincere without vain repetitions it was useless to engage in extended hesitations williams safetyâ the safety of the man she lovedâwas in jeopardy the safety of all those people attending that meeting whom she now considered warring against themselves was at stake above all the honor of a loyal race and a grand republic was endangered

most important now a courageous stand by these very people would save everything

our father she began somewhat bashfully but yet firmly who has been our dwelling place thru all generations help us in this dreadful hour heads began to take an erect position and look for the tender voiceâsomewhat familiar and yet rather strange this did not last long for with the remaining thot that they were worshipping their maker the accustomed reverence again prevailed father i pray for these people here assembled i pray for the young man who has greatly helped this community i pray for the good white people of these parts i pray for the scoundrels who despitefully use us asking thee to give us sufficient sense not to let them despite fully use us any more

father i pray for this nationâindeed a great land a land which will be greater if we use thy word and fight thy battles

amen amen came from many hearts pray on sister 

one brother said father those who use the sword shall die by the sword

but father father father oh father she pleaded havent some used the sword and lived did not thy avenging angel use the sword on sennachribs host of a hundred and eightyfive thousand men  didnt abraham use the sword to drive away the enemy that captured lot didnt david use the sword on goliath how did joshua take the children of israel into canaan except by the sword didnt george washington use the sword and become the first president of this great nation

yes he did he did pray on sister were the loud acclaims

father almighty father did your son not say whosoever shall save his life shall lose his life and whosoever shall lose his life shall find it

the people at once thot of the scripture that opened the meeting they especially remembered this passage because wendell hill had given it emphasis amen she is telling truth came a response

now father just hear me this time she continued for if you deny me now ill find death tomorrow a prince has come to this community like unto christ he has given not his worst but his best and as the culprits did unto christ so would some do to this kind manâkill him for his goodness father is this to be hed give his life for them for any one of them will they not do as much for him father i know they will they are going back on guard right now father i thank thee for answering my prayer amen

before anyone could utter a word thelma said men return to your posts maintain the same line of communication even unto the home of rev smith let the women and children go on at once accompanied by the advanced guard all were surprised thots of the approaching danger seized them the meeting had served one good purpose anyhow most of the participants were ready to die few were going to tarry now all must act with initiative and speed the men designated aware of this took up their weapons at once and went to the defense thelma spoke with the authority of a general her suggestions carried mothers she said as they started away remember your children you experienced the throes of death that they might have life have no fear of another defend your children with those weapons you possess you know how i believe better than i

when they had gone thelma remarkt gentlemen gentlemen she spoke curiously that they considered themselves undeserving that distinction

i know you are ashamed of yourselves arent you she inquired

ashamed to serve the lord put in hill

ashamed to serve the devil she replied ask yourselves this question am i my brothers keeper if you let those dirty scoundrels harm a hair on the head of rev smith youre betraying the race dont think that theyll stop with him they wont when hes out of the way you are next

if you let scoundrels harm innocent men youre not serving the lord youre serving the devil and youre as guilty as they if you compel them to be good not to harm the little ones of god great is your reward here and in heaven if you dont do this thus offending godâyou get no reward  either here or there

do you know what happened this morning no you dont mr garkston didnt stop to tell you as he started from the post office having taken the mail from rev smiths private box he noticed several groups of white men whispering clandestinely these men mostly scoundreds and ruffians were approacht by some individuals you know well tom howell robert white and sandy james one group was in the post office while mr garkston was there several individuals came in and went out without attracting their attention in the least when our friend passed however they recognized him and thinking that he must have overheard a part of their conversation they called nigger come here where you going what youre doing down here so early anyhow mr clarkston had started his motor and was enroute speedily for rev smiths estate they called several times if you dont stop youre a goner our gallant young man paid no heed they fired several shots at him but none hit the mark he was soon out of range

mr turner then began all the men should know this well well see that they get it they will be ready then for anything

how you feel about it men he inquired of those present

just fine remarkt one i see now why dr smith had those shooting matches men lets not stay here lets do our duty

do your duty dont let all the democracy be in europe lets bring some to america thelma smiled

with all determined to resist the enemy if they were opposed the majority were stationed near williams estate that thy might aid him and not be killed thru avoidable mishap turner seized the opportunity of intense enthusiasm and went to the estate leaving miss haskell as a sort of generalissimo he was somewhat uncertain as to finding william readily for he was confident that his friend would not keep in prison this fear however was soon dispelled he found the distinguish gentleman at his desk busy with papers as if nothing extraordinary had occurred

observing who had come william laid aside the papers and heartily greeted his dear neighbor so suddenly had he turned from his task that he was somewhat uncertain where to begin he wanted to know first of all of the security of the people were they on guard or were they trusting to chance where was thelma what could she be doing yet his concern for her was less than that for his neighbors as he was sure of her being sufficiently spirited and equipoised to conquer any situation the thots of her therefore cannot be construed as solicitude but a curiosity born of a deep admiration for her supreme adaptability to the crisis

a few minutes past in attention to a plan to operate a community store then they returned to the matter of most importance mr turner at length began rev smith after many moments of reflection what are the people doing are they aware of what is going on or do they since no one has come against them regard it as a joke

turner felt somewhat abasht when he recalled all the circumstances of the morning more was he ashamed because he regarded himself as having failed in the trust committed to him

seeing that his neighbor made no reply william began to laugh you make me think that somethings gone wrong am i right inquired william

tmner shook his head yet unable to speak because of his consciousness of guilt no remarked rev smith then tell me whats going on

making a superlative effort to suppress his deep emotion turner said slowly with hesitation everythings all right nowâthanks to miss haskell

miss haskell what did she do his curiosity interrupted

she has done everything the people did well last night but hill influenced them to have a prayer meeting i even listened when they once started they forgot the purpose of the assembly and turned it almost into a protracted meeting had any one come then we all would have been lost

that was serious i told them by no means to leave their homes i wonder if theyll be capable of holding out he spoke and then paused after which reflection he askt turner to proceed

well we just listened to wendell hill but thank the lord miss haskell came among us prayed a prayer that brot us to our senses now were on guard to stay till the war is over

rev smith were not going to pay any attention to your letter at all we keep in touch with your watchers

thats just what i dont want you to do i want these people to see that i will fully respect the law even if they do not

youre not doing this rev smith were the ones he defended thus their decisions

those white people will say im leading you persons so base as to kill an innocent man in cold blood will do anything will say anything and their courts will not bring them to justice i cannot somehow believe that this is your work for youve generally seen situations as i have yet it is possible for differences to occur at some time and probably this is the parting of the ways thus he tried to reconcile himself to the action of his neighbors in behaving contrary to his desire yet he had to admire them for their conduct could have been prompted only by love i certainly wish you had not done this well if you will not follow my suggestion i will partly control the situation anyhow i can at least keep my men within the law you may suit yourselves thank you rev smith were so glad youve given us this permission came from turner who least desired to get the illwill of the young divine

i havent given you any permission interrupted william showing his ire by a sharp grimace do not misunderstand me you have taken the permission i merely suffer it then as if this were a holiday he said but come lets go to the garage i haveâ

turner broke in youve forgotten about the folks i better make my rounds you know those scoundrels may burst in at any time and id better be going unless you need me particularly

no you go on whatever you do do not fire the first shot it may mean the death or the wounding of one of our race but be willing to make that sacrifice are you well supplied with arms

yes sir we can handle the situation

all right success when mr turner had gone william returned to his papers he lookt at them for a while then went to an opposite window and watched turner slowly crossing a field of corn he followed him as if in a revery until the beloved gentleman was out of view then he moved along the side of the room toward the next window after having gone a few steps he stopt and gazed at a picture in a frame of ebony it was the sphinx as he lingered beholding it for the first time he noticed its negro features certainly tis because that was the dominating race of that land he thot it was indeed an inspiration if that structure which has been a mystery to all subsequent ages could be the work of his ancestors he himself would be also a mystery his foes would not fathom his whereabouts more than they could solve the riddle of the sphinx he pondered long on africa and allowed his mind to drift with sweet orientation to his forebears he saw it as a land of gloom and then of pure delightâwith the end of exploitation on the part of other folk nations were not greedy for gold nations were not there to mutilate the savage had become cultured the jungle was only a dream stately schools and buildings churches in the grand style resplendent avenues and vistas had made a paradise then how sad he was that his ancestors could not enjoy it

while thus his thots moved on like the song of a bird at the return of spring his attention was distracted by the call of rev smith rev smith as it was a sudden awakening and since he was not at first composed he ran quickly to the desk seized his rifle and started out when he reached the parlor he met an outburst of laughter it was thelma who had come to wish him good morning

put down your gun you know i wouldnt harm you for the world dont you she smiled

he did not speak at once but wiped his face as if trying to restore emotional equilibrim thelma continued to smile in her winning way have a seat tell me the news i was thinking what an ideal day this would be for a picnic those wickd men had to spoil my dream you havent told me about the letter for washington you havent been hospitable a bit this time i think id better go back to williamsburg at once she arose to go

william took her by the hand and courteously bowed her back to her seat at the same time saying thelma you know it would have broken your heart to go you know you wouldnt leave me now

she rusht to the door and said now i cannot stay good bye william stood silent admiring her august presence the sweetness of her speech the gracefulness of her steps he heard her open the hall door then he called thelma thelma very softly she heard thelma he called again who let you in here any way i told mrs brown to call me in case of any danger that surely was her voice awhile ago and not yours

miss haskell returned moved close to him with a vindictive stare and began reproachfully i came hereâi came here then she said tenderly william why do you ask i wasâi was just dying to see you she went quickly to the sofa again

william blusht then sat in a chair near the center table ornamented with a japanese vase of flowers

now you have it i suppose youre satisfied open confession is good for the soul at least they say so was her taunting remark she lookt at william maschieviously and started to move towards him

he waved his hand for repression and said no remain where you are im glad to see you anyhow but you ought to be in williamsburg i was going but you called me back

you know you must not go now besides your going was only pretense

do i pretend william

certainly everybody pretends sometimes that was one of your instances

i better go back toâno i wont

i thot you wouldnt

but william

thelma you must tell me what you have done to my neighbors they have actually refused to do my bidding they have rebelled against me he affirmed he took a rose from the vase and offered it to her with a bow i have no rosemary for remembrance i wish i did we have been friends so long and may have to part something is going to happen before the sun goes down i feel hence i speak accept this rose for remembrance my foes will spare you but i may have to go

thelma held her head as if abasht then lookt at him appealingly turning to one side she noticed a pillow covered with a design after the seal of his alma mater she put it from her and moved to the other end of the sofa now there is room william come sit down he accepted the seat then she took a pin and gave it to him with this remark take this pin it here she pointed to her left breast not for remembrance tho dont think you will go and leave me here thelma you must not be this way men it seems must die but women must live he remarkt with resignation

no she said impatiently that has been true long enough either men and women both must live or both must die i can shoot ill show you  quickly she had seized his rifle but he was soon at her side

no thelma you must not fire that my helpers would think i was attacked i believe you so you see proof is unnecessary he placed the rifle on the table where it was then both returned to the sofa you have not told me what you did to my neighbors

you did not permit me

well im listening now

you said the people had rebelled against you it isnt so they have rebelled for you do not scorn them scorn me they were obeying your commands but i shamed them into rejecting them they were about to let their religious enthusiasm leave them defenseless but they are determined now i was asleep when they played that joke on me but im awake now besides i have foresworn sleep until we have fought this thing to a finish she wanted him to be pleased with what she had done yet she feared to go into details to be frank he put in knitting his brow im sorry yet you have taught those people a valuable lesson the sight of a woman sensible and fearless calm and resourceful was something new to them clarkston says they almost worship you

i rejoice in the fact that they appreciate the situation you must know tho that i was selfish in doing so she pleaded

i cant understand you he remarkt appealing insisting upon an answer how could you have been selfish 

dont you see william i did it for myself she continued pleaded anxious concerning the effect of her admission i thot of the people i thot of the nation and our race overwhelmed with the impulse that we should be willing to give our lives rather than have either the nation or the race humiliated i determined on this course

that does not make you selfish it enables you you were moved by the strongest pulsations of generosity thats why the people almost worship you he declared and waited her response

she paused a while then lowered her head but soon it was erect again now her entire being pleaded she lookt at him inquiringly then took his hand william was thrilled he tried to push her hand away he wanted to get up and leave the house he had to stay he had not toucht her hand since childhood how easy it was then how difficult during the last years as her hand pressed his lightly he held her firmly new impulses new ideas and hopes seemed to rush from her to him and permeate every fiber of his being william william do not despise me i have not done this for people race or nation true i thot of them but i did this for myself

thelma thelma this was all he said great was his emotion

i love the people but first of all i love you she now more firmly pressed his hand nimbly tossed her head and quickly leaned towards him

he took her in his arms and kissed her twice then broke away thelma i am too happy he said when he had reacht the center table

come william sit down be happy again she said and smiled triumphantly i am not going to harm you youre not going to harm me certainly youre not afraid of a woman especially of her who made you happy

its not that thelma came forth with a sigh from his true breast i shouldnt have sat on the sofa beside you

i wanted you to william and you came willingly she said cheerfully

yes i know i did but i wonder if i havent done you wrong and probably someone else wrong

susan thelma remarkt when she noticed his wavering

yes what would she say how would she feel if she knew this

do you love her william askt thelma with great sangfroid

yes i do thats the trouble

why not end it by marrying her i know shes wild about you

its not easy for a conscientious person to make a decision about a matter so serious as this he replied beginning to defend himself i wanted to marry until those dastardly outlaws sent me that threatening note i had thot of going to susanâ here he broke off

youre not hurting my feelings put in thelma suppressing her emotions it was not perfectly pleasant to listen to the disclosure but she had staked her all on this interview if she lost it would not be her fault when she saw him pause she knew that she could not be successful unless she thoroly understood his attitude accordingly she urged him on were old friends anyhow you can tell me anything she put in

i believe i can i was about to say he continued taking her into his confidence i had strongly contemplated going home and asking susan to beâmyâwife several times before i had thot of going only to say i have plenty of time yet then when i was threatened i rejoiced that i was single thus i put it entirely out of my mind now you come and force my thots in that direction again

i had refrained from asking because of the life i leadâ ostracised by the ministers of the state and now attacked by gangsters and felons when i began this work i lookt forward to this i believed that some day my life would be in danger id marry if i thot id have some days of pleasure but why marry to make a widow and probably an orphan it is not my wish to make my wife miserable but happy

i am afraid my dear you dont understand a womans heart we must take life as it is many things are done for us anyway and we must be resigned she affirmed

but susan is a home girl her child would need a father if i were to be killed as her husband i fear she would die also true i have called upon her more than any young woman ive met but i have made no overtures for us to part single would not be so calamitous as for us to part married he said sitting down by the table which sujported the vase of roses

have you allowed her to answer you on this point she inquired made hopeful by his last remarks

no i havent askt her point blank but our conversations on varied matters have sufficiently convinced me as to this he said

william ill tell you what to do let me help you out of the difficulty sometimes i become very unconventional she said with a smile that had its effect if many women had come here as i have they would have been seeking you and leading you to a proposa they would have shown they wanted to marry you by smiling as i haveâhere she smiled againâby coming ostensibly to visit the farm and see the town by making you thousands of little advances they would have done all the proposing and a year after you were married your wife would have said you wouldnt let her rest until she had married you

but thelma

dont interrupt me at this moment please please wait until i finish he nodded assent occasionally i am retiring and conventional par excellence at other times i am frank and unconventional this is one of the unconventional moments william i can help you solve this problem she proceeded to move toward him

stay where you are he cried

she went on to his side and put her arms about him he did not repulse her then she said with penetrating sweetness william you love me tooâno youre not going to run away ill be your widow and to the child ill be both father and mother i pleaded for susan as long as i could but im a woman i love you for myself i came here to tell you this

william arose drew her to himself and said thelma id like to kiss you you have made me so happy but kisses mean so much when i receive another it will be from her i must wed

and who will that be she pleaded

at this moment the bell rang as it was not an alarm he did not respond at once

can you suffer the worries and anxieties of my situation can you bear the disquiet of my being subject to attack at any time he askt

havent i already done so

yes you have

am i not ready to defend you even at the risk of my life

thelma you shall have an answer

when william

before the sun goes down

what youre doing with that rope shouted a culprit disgusted at the very sight of it

i thot we might want to swing the coon up to a tree was the reply

hangings too good for a nigger get those irons there said the first speaker did you get tom the plummers blast you know we got to heat those irons if were goin to gouge his eyes out right when it comes to lynchin a nigger i believe in doin a good job

i got it all right was the response

well lets join the bunch were late now we should have finisht this little job and been back to work was the cold utterance

how can they do this how can they be so devoid of feeling as not to value human life some say they do not treat white men this way yes they do but not so often

the recent years have seen even white men victims of this modern barbarism can persons maltreat the negro and not abuse their own people a man is a man

the court house was the rendezvous for the reprobates bent on this devilish pastime there were the paved street and granitoid sidewalks before the municipal building with its artistic statuary there were the many business houses groceries notion and department stores confectioneries restaurants hotels furniture shops drug stores hardware stores there were the pedestrians going in and out men women boys and girls there were the sheriff and his assistants while some plied their trades and others pursued the even tenor of their way the mob assembled with hilarity and profanity for this was to be a gala day no colored people were cn the streets except for business only here and there a few could be seen in the shops shining shoes washing cuspidors hauling trunks or moving furniture it seemed well understood mutually that this was an occasion when fiends would dance in triumph

tad temple jr a boy of twelve evidently the son of a wealthy or welltodo citizen passed by the mob ben caldwell a lad of ten stepped on his foot so many had crowded before the court that jostling seemed unavoidable this young fellow did not seek into causes he yelled damn you what you doing stepping on my foot ill knock your damn block off im no nigger if you do it again ill make dad lynch you

the other replied i didnt go to step on your foot you curse me because i aint your size if i was your equal id treat you worse than a nigger your old man cant do nothing to me

tad temples boy slapped the little fellow began to choke him took some twine from his pocket and put it around ben caldwells neck ill hang you myselfhe said

before more could be done attracted by the cries several men parted the youngsters when tad temple recognized his boy and understood the situation he said to robert white did you see what my youngster tried to do strangle that little fellow and hang him when our children start doing this i think it time we should have stopt we shouldnt be so public anyway

mr temple said bob youve always been against this fellows upstart ways now that youve got a chance to get him surely you aint a going to back out you know we want an orderly mob we want some decent folks with us he pleaded

all thats well and good bob put in mr temple but when a man sees his child treating another white child as mine did you know its enough to make a man shiver if it had been a nigger id enjoyed it but he was on a white kid

what the hâl what you waiting for this is a hâl of a mob said newton young are you ever going to get started that nigger ought to be in hâl by this time

dân it youre right remarkt luke crabtree we dont take all day for just one let us have our fun and get back to work

on the other side of the street stood the president of the national bank mr pitts beside him was the sheriff mr simpson cant you do anything to stop this  he called

not a thing you know they will have their way said the sheriff with perfect contentment have you tried inquired the banker

no whats the use 

this thing is a disgrace to the nation it can be stopt why dont you order troops of the governor persisted the banker

he wouldnt take time to send them to save the life of a darkey if he did instead of stopping the mob theyd only join it

well i suppose you can prosecute them when this is over cant you

we never can get all the names of course they never tried

mr simpson you and i know at least seventyfive of those men if you want other names ill supply them said this brave citizen

i couldnt get a jury that would convict them so its not worth bothering your head one way or the other declared the sheriff with nonchalance let the darkey die we wont miss him we have enough of them anyway

mr simpson you dont deserve your position you disgrace it the banker spoke vehemently for he was both irritated and disgusted this is no common negro these scoundrels are after its one of our best citizens rev smith the only crime that he has committed is that he has honestly acquired a bank account and helped others to do the same you know that there have been fewer criminals since he came than ever in our history if you can get ten men wholl join me ill break up that mob they have well nigh a thousand going to take one man the cowards ten good men can bring them to their senses go quickly and see what you can do if we start in time we can get ahead of them we dont want it to go all over the country as a big headline of the newspapers seaton a place of lawlessness mob lynches an upright negro for acquiring a bank account see what you can do

mr pitts it wont do any good im sorry he said

you wont help to put this down he inquired sternly and paused then i will good bye he went into the throng then upon the courthouse steps and shouted men men some of the members of the mob paid heed others were utterly unaware of his anxiety so occupied were they with cursing and abusing to inflame their passion for dastardly deeds of brutishness and savagery savagery ah worse than savagery those of the mob who were attentive tried to bring their nearest associates to listen to the banker mr pitts has something so say said one

hâl this aint no time for speeches said the associate with defiance lets get the nigger and listen afterwards this attitude was fairly typical

dân it remarkt another are you goin to stay here all day if you dont mean business dân it why dont you say so

men men citizens of great america called mr pitts trying to make at least those nearest him take caution the shouting fuming and hubdub of the assembly made his utterances unintelligible even to those nearest seeing sandy james however over whom he could exert some influence he called to him he even went to him and urged him to quiet the people in order that he might remind them of their duty in that great hour

the lawyer tho a pettifogger knew he had to obey accordingly without any ado he spoke to several near him and particularly the leaders whom he dispatched thru the crowd with these words tell the people they must listen to pitts but not do what he says if he tends to talk long we ll run off ill give the signal you know my whistle remember you listen but you do what i say

the men delivered the communication as directed it was received however with various responses some said they would go home and have nothing to do with it others indulged in prolonged profanity others received the suggestion kindly tho dissatisfaction and spleen ran high in many parts of the crowd all stayed to listen the few who were most ready to rush on without the rest became somewhat more temperate when they recalled that they never had fewer than three hundred when such an important job was to be done they had to have security you know three hundred or a thousand against one what hideous warfare why not a man against a man who ever heard of such the odds would be too great

when the mumbling the shouting and the swearing at length subsided and practically all faces were turned to the top of the stone steps the venerable banker with his vigorous character lines and his grizzled hair somewhat curled up in the rear with his splendid physique and august look set off by a penetrating eye bespoke the honorable gentleman of the new south the statesman the twentieth century man he reminded one of cicero at the forum of demosthenes at the areopagus

men of the south american citizens he began and when i say american i mean all that the word implies our glorious land our noble heritage the honor of our fathers who died to make it free do you love this country

yes certainly we do was vociferated in many parts of the crowd and like expressions we hate the niggers tho

you ought to love them he continued if you realized that the south never could have developed without them if you realized how you profit by their labor now you would be better towards them

is that all you have to say burst forth from one embittered by the previous utterance

shut up came from one near him we aint going to pay no attention to what he says anyhow we know our business were going to get the nigger dân it aint that enough 

the solace tho crudely put accomplisht its aims the mob was soon quiet again continuing his remarks the banker said lynching should never have occurred even tho it has been tolerated we can not afford to have it now have you forgotten that our country is at war can you not recall that on april   that the president gave us a motive for entering the war by saying let us make the world safe for democracy gentlemen that is an awful responsibility democracy means that you are as good as i am that other people are as good as you that those who govern shall have the consent of those they govern this is what the president aims to accomplish

we have undertaken to make the world safe for democracy while there is very little democracy within our own gates the germans oppressed the belgians and we cry horror the russians have a pogrom of the jews and we cry horror the turks massacre the armenians and we cry horror our own citizens murder our most loyal citizens in cold blood and what do we do nothing what do we say nothing

american citizens i plead with you to do no wrong attorney general gregory puts this better than i can hear what he says in his recent speech before the american bar association he says we must set our faces against lawlessness within our own borders whatever we may say about the causes for our entering the war we know that one of the principal reasons was the lawlessness of the german nationâ what they have done in belgium and in northern france and what we have reason to know they would do elsewhere for us to tolerate lynching is to do the same thing that we are condemning in the germans lynch law is the most cowardly of crime invariably the victim is unarmed while the men who lynch are armed and in large numbers it is a deplorable thing under any circumstances but at this time above all others it creates an extremely dangerous condition i invite your help in meeting it those are his very words as i read them from this clipping say what you wish but lynching a man in america is not different from lynching one in belgium or france forâ

ah hâl thats enough of that bosh shouted several interrupting the speaker lets move where we re going if were going

yes dân it shouted another ive stood it just a minute too long im so dân mad if he dont stop im likely to put a ball thru him stop your dân gab or illâ

a shrill whistle arose which was reinforced by similar calls from various parts of the mob with rifles pistols cudgels irons ropes and others things the throng moved at a rapid pace amidst turbulence shrieking oaths and vituperation to seize the great pioneer of race adjustment whose crime was that he served his people and his nation faithfully

the banker in great dismay lookt on the mobile throng as it hurried away to him it was a calamity a man was to be lynched a soul sent to heaven or hell he thot of the slaves who defended his mother during the rebellion he thot of those that bled under the lash toiling in the wilderness to make it blossom like a rose he mused how the toil of these humble people had created the wealth of the south afforded him and others opportunity for leisure study and enjoyment these people had become poor making their landlords and employers millionaires then he recalled rev smith who had associated with him on many occasions in improving the lot of the farmer and had stimulated more friendly relations between the races why is the laborer unworthy of his hire why should honest and persistent thrift be unrewarded even scorned so he mused as the spectacle faded in the distance

at this point a negro very unkempt a braggadocio and a bully passed out of the saloon with an unwrapped bottle of whiskey in his hand the banker recognized him at once as the shiftless individual who worked spasmodically on a nearby farm

we dont see so many of those now he reflected rev smith has changed many of them to steady workers they are savers now and work regularly some of them are even buying farms

i suppose thats the trouble as long as a negro is trifling hes all right he knows his place as soon as he shows himself a man a valuable citizen we dont need him what mockery he became stirred to disgust and indignation he left the steps and started for his bank somehow i cant give up that shilly shally sheriff has refused to interfere is the case hopeless i believe i can get ten men who will help me stop this outrage to get them soon enough is the trouble the telephones the thing

when he had gone a few paces he was met by his bank messenger what is it frank he inquired

there is a gentleman waiting for you at the bank he replied with a slight bow

how long has he been there

not long

couldnt someone else look after his business i have a very important matter to adjust

he said he would have to see you

well i hope it will not be long

when he entered the bank he cast about in the lobby to see his caller as each person there was transacting business he rang for the messenger frank he said when the energetic employee responded bring the gentleman to my office please

yes sir he bowed out

within a few minutes mr pitts greeted the visitor davis he said cheerfully shaking his hand vigorously if i had known you were here i should have been here long ago say you never told me how much wheat you thresht on your place the other week

five hundred thirty bushels he remarkt with obvious pride

have a seat davis began i could say much but i have only one thing to talk about this morning as i came down the road i met a mob trailing behind them were many women and children going evidently to witness a gruesome sight and these were dressed in their finest and carried lunch baskets as if going on a picnic this thing must stop we call nero cruel but what about our own people

i just left the court house steps that was their assembly place i might have been here before but i watched them out of sight and reflected upon the terrible times in which we live think what those scoundreds are hoping to do while our president is trying to bring peace to europe the banker declared with great feeling

pitts we must stop this

thats what i say davis i was just coming here to reach some men over the phone to help me i believe ten or eleven brave men can turn the trick i spoke to the reprobates from the steps and they listened but i alone couldnt do much if ten or eleven determined men meet them theyll listen i do believe spoke the banker optimistically

but when you go into a mob like that to be sure of success talk alone wont do you must show guns i shouldnt stop at ten or eleven id get a whole army pitts

well the more we have the surer we are of success

to think of having women and children looking on a murder you know how cruel those fellows are they dont believe in painless death at all they lengthen it out they torture their victims then our women and children go to see it and the cowards pride themselves on taking human life in this way davis affirmed with disgust

then they are going to kill an innocent man if the fellow was some scamp or idler it would be different but to kill a man who has done so much for the community said the banker

yes rev smith is a very fine man remarkt davis i can always get laborers now who will stick right to the job and i know it hasnt always been so besides if i need extra help and ask him to find some one he can always get some one there that means something these explosive orators who have said keep the darkey down dont know what theyre talking about i believed that stuff once but i see now that intelligence makes even the negro a better worker this man has stood by us now we must stand by him whom were you going to call

townsend hardy mc kinley and have them mention some others who they think will join us was the response

call them see what they say

mr pitts called the three persons he named and found them ready to cooperate they were all engaged in important matters but because the honor of the south was at stake because the honor of the nation was at stake they decided to do the more important thing as he expected they suggested others who should be called when he finisht telephoning he had the promise of thirtyfive men who could call others and come to the bank at once

thats encouraging isnt it inquired the banker

it certainly is he replied if we can just stop this at once then prosecute the offenders we will have made a long advance in ridding the nation of the lawless if other towns learn that we have put it down they will follow suit i found tho that nailor has been working hes organizing the farmers who are not with bob white he has helping him henry and james mitchell daniel martin and fred dean how did he miss you the banker askt

well i have been quite ubiquitous of lateâeverywhere you know was the jovial response but im glad the outlook is hopeful did you tell them to bring their guns

no i did not it was unnecessary remarkt the banker what fool would come without one in an affair like this how are we to get there you know well have to use automobiles said davis asking and answering his question

there will be cars enough the banker assured him and at once called for all available automobiles to be held in reserve for him

how many can you get asked davis

more than we need replied the friend

the respectable white men of seaton soon began to pour into the bank weapons in hand as most of them owned cars few had to be ordered when all who were expected were there they numbered about seventyfive no delay was lost in exchanging greetings the question on every lip was wholl lead wholl address them

since nailor is best as fighter and organizer let him lead said the banker all agreed i spoke to the men this morning so i think it would be better to have a different person he feared selection

probably youre right said davis

then i suggest that lawyer jones will address them

you handle children can you handle men the banker askt

i think i can anyhow i have to try was the lawyers reply

then all is settled

alls settled lets meet at nailors said one

all right was the general response

they boarded the automobiles and sailed off

after william had promised thelma that he would decide his fate before sunset he became silent for a while and only lookt at her then he began to ponder concerning the wisdom of his utterance but when the thot came that since he could support a wife today was as excellent time for a decision as any other he made himself satisfied at once he turned to her and askt childishly are you satisfied now are you happy 

she answered with all pleasantness william im just as happy as a lark just as happy as i can be how are you

well i suppose i am happy too i certainly have been thrilled by your courageâbut someone rang i wonder who it can be said smith becoming practical once more

clarkston came in and bowed

pardon me he said but there is a lady who wishes to see you mr smith

a lady who can she be william questioned himself

well i know its time for me to get back to duty said thelma starting to go

you know as well as i thelma that you cant go right now meet the lady and then go i always insist upon my guests becoming acquainted yet i wonder what my visitor wants here at this time when blood is likely to be shed i shouldnt be surprised at all at your doing suchâbut for a stranger probably its one of the neighbors well no use wondering about her let us look her over he remarkt flippantly show her in mr clarkston

william stood by the table thelma sat on the sofa each lookt at the other inquiringly but kept silent while they were in these attitudes the lady walked into the drawing room it was susan william and thelma were overwhelmed thelma sighed william was speechless for a while both had lost their equipoise

susan placed her bag on a chair near by and was on the point of extending her hand to william when she saw thelma you here she said well i expected it she was rather nervous i wantedâi wantedâhere she broke off and sat down oh its so hard so hard j what susan inquired william eager for an answer oh some day ill tell some day ill tell it from the house tops ill shout it to all the world she screamed yes all the world shall know

william took her hand and said susan youre either ill or very nervous your hand seems to be feverishly hot and you are breathing very rapidly thelma he entreated his face showing great anxiety go back to the kitchenâyoull find it thereâthe smelling salts he indicated the direction ask mrs brown to come here we cant get a physician at this time becauseâ william all that is unnecessary and if i did need a physician right now i believe id rather die than to have thelma go seek one no you neednt go its not necessary ha ha

ha she laughed sadly and disquietingly it seemed as tho she would go into hysterics then with a suddenness that surprised them she stopt william and thelma were completely overawed im all right she said rising and moving towards william pardon me for setting your nerves on the rack but i felt so miserable pardon my manners shake hands with me william how have you been william greeted her warmly

ive been very well im so glad to see you he said

are you really she inquired jubilantly i was afraid you wouldnt beâbut i mustnt forget you thelma pardon the hard things i said of you just now i almost hate you for some things but weve been playmates and classmates and friends so long then i didnt shun you but you avoided me shake hands with me thelma when the townslady showed hesitancy susan went to her took her hand and greeted her warmly they then embraced thelma felt ashamed i want to be good now even if i have to be wicked later on i want to love you now even tho i may have to hate you tomorrow i wish we could be permanent friends again that we could run to see each other once more each evening but there are some things we must understand first are we friends now she askt william thelma are we

i am your friend you may rest assured william affirmed

and you thelma inquired susan

susan i dont know what to say i have certainly tried to be she said honestly

i ask this because what we are to settle can not be adjusted by enemies we must be friends to do it you can be my friend she pleaded for a half hour cant you

iâi yes susan yes susan dear i can i can she remarkt with great effort she could not throttle the impulse of her heart with its womanly instincts that a few minutes since had gained the mastery had forced her to reveal her soul to the man she loved without affectation or arrogance she loved susan but she loved william too she could act a part even in real life but not that of a hypocrite therefore to say she was a friend and at the same time a rival seemed to thelma a little inconsistent as every woman desires the man she loves so thelma longed for william there was to be no concealing it yet if he chose her friend she would suffer but she would live

interpreting susans plea as a bid for calmness she could consent

were all childhood friends we played and grew together but now we live apart in view of the fact that fate or providence has thru the heart brot us once more together let us be joyful she said and laught wholesomely the others reflected her sunshine with broad smiles sit down thelma thelma went to the sofa sit down william she resumed she lookt about mirthfully and said are all seated she sat abruptly and remarkt with equal brusqueness yes we are

susan i can hardly understand you today spoke william the various moods rapidly shifting were a new sight to him the calm equipoised susan lee quiet and patient had given place to an aggressive personality not easily labeled

sometimes i can hardly understand myself she remarkt as one confessing sins to a priest im nervous william and you thelma have i made you nervous taking for granted that she had been the cause of all the trouble she exclaimed i wish i hadnt come i started not to

why did you come susan inquired william thinking of the crisis that would have to reach a head that day if the blackmailers kept their word

why did i come why would a woman steal from parents and friends and risk abuse and calamity to see a man  why did thelma  has she told you  i came for the same purpose was the outpouring of her troubled soul thelmas heart throbbed violently as susan spoke childhood memories flasht across her mind and even days of youth and early womanhood each had been the life of the other was each now to be the death of each 

your parents dont know you are here susan  pleaded william

i suppose they know now i left a note within easy reach but i could not let them know i was coming mother would have come along whether i wanted her or not and i knew she would be entirely out of place this is a matter for us three do you blame me for coming if you do i know what that means declared susan

no i do not condemn you he remarkt he was condemning himself in all other matters he had acted with tact and expedition this matter alone of all the interests that had absorbed his mind he had bungled he thot

can you praise me she askt not satisfied with what seemed a subterfuge her question was the prompting of her womanly instincts

i must admire youâ susan you have come thru timidity im sure thelma squirmed what did he mean had he not used the wrong word was it not supreme courage in the supreme hour of a womans life that brot her there neither thelma nor william had deemed her capable of it when crises arise in human affairs we all may change

susan observed and was glad i wondered just how i could get away i found it so difficult the chance came at last when mother went shopping it was my longsought opportunity so i am here

you little thief exclaimed william affectionately thelma heaved a sigh should she go or remain  she would remain should she speak or keep silent she would speak in her turn but in the main she would say nothing these were incruciating moments tho how she had prided herself on having been unusually blest possessing the best of the womanly virtues with a strong admixture of the masculine many hard situations for some women sad predicaments many of which would have had no solution at their hands were for her but as ordinary difficulties and embarrassments this dilemma however was entirely new and in handling it she found herself only a woman for the first time in eight years she sobbed then tears began to flow

when she took her handkerchief and wiped her eyes william and susan noticed her youre crying he said shame on you

i cant help it she sobbed go on and talk dont bother about me ill be all right soon

this was another of the surprises thelma had carefully planned what she was to do but as she had not at all expected susan she was disconcerted affection for both susan and william made her distress more intense

im sorry i came and made you nervous thelma i had it and you had it watch out william youll be next she said with a tauntâby the way i havent moved my hat i mustnt be formal im at home am i not william at least i may pretend so may i not already she had removed her hat and placed it on the table near which william sat now i feel all right now thelma became more composed to help the situation she took up a magazine and examined the illustrations she was trying to remain out of the conversation

im glad youre feeling fine now i hope you wont become excited again for as you said you may make me lose my equilibrium affirmed william

of course im a little fidgety at times and occasionally im impulsive but dont blame me for it william please dont my nervousness today has been due to several circumstances you know when i was here two days ago i wanted to talk to you alone you wanted to do so too but we were never to ourselves you could not run away from your gufests so there i was your intimation however gave me hope that i was not waiting in vain that soon you would come to me and at least end suspense one way or the other she spoke rather energetically

i meant to come right after the wheat harvest he put in by way of corroboration

william said susan tenderly i meant to wait but you remember my letter stating that i might come i wras going to wait but thelma came to see youâim not blaming you or abusing you thelma rather i rejoice that you highly value what i also admire you have paid me a compliment in loving william thelma was rather uneasy only with quite a struggle in this instance could she refrain from speech returning to the point thelma told different people about the farm she did not come to see me i divined that she was not visiting the farm but you

then the other day i came home from the excursion here without having accomplisht my purpose which was to have a talk with you that would reveal our very souls when i learned the following morning that thelma had left town again i thought she would be only around seaton im not angry now but i was almost mad then i veritably raved mother couldnt understand me she had dr holmes to come who said i was on the verge of a nervous breakdown so he recommended a weeks rest there then several weeks in the country i tried to urge mother not to have him come but she would have her way

of course matters will arise at times to displease us all but we need to be calm we cant tell what the end may be he spoke tritely

well i couldnt be calm when i wanted to finally i did become somewhat resigned then i determined to be my own physician so i came here for my health she smiled shall i live or die if i am the physician i suppose i ought to know

and whats the remedy william askt of course only to tease

you know as well as i she affirmed carelessly another thing which unsettled me was this i feared i might not find you or if i did i would find you dead

do you know all he inquired

yesâno i better not say all yet i read in the newspaper of your being threatened and that you went to the mayor heres the paper in my bag a few moments were enough to obtain it

knowing this you came here

yes but it almost carried me to the ditch i dont believe i could do it again thats what made me so upset when i came then to find thelma here as i had suspectedâwhat else was there for me to do she fondly askt

you have suffered much he said with a sigh

what enigmas crowd themselves upon us requiring a solution what questions we must answer what sacrifices we must make what sadness we must know what deaths we must die

william obviously loved both these women each was beautiful and noble and accomplisht each loved him solely he would have chosen one almost as soon as the other if both had not absorbed his life very early and for a long time tho they were more alike than different yet the dissimilarities and not the likenesses would decide the issue he would make an analysis into their characters he had already done it thousands of times he knew them as he knew his booksâvery thoroly

yet jie must choose an equal friendship with them he deemed impossible for it is characteristic of love to make a claim in order that when it will it may shut the world out and have the object of its affection all to itself likewise he thot their merely being friends would not evoke the highest qualities of his own nature to reach human perfection man and woman must wed and become one life to have never too much harshness and never too little tenderness he knew he had to come into the most intimate relation with one woman he reflected that a man can never thoroly know even his wife human life changes so rapidly how can a man then thoroly comprehend two women it just can not be done he was thinking strenuously

yes ive gone thru much but im paid ive seen you william ive seen you medicine could not have accomplisht these results oh i feel so happy she said her heart was quite full and free now william one other question i have to ask you must answer come here thelma she said tenderly there are only two women in this world that you loveâthelma and me am i wrong she askt

youre right he knew what she was coming to but would not interrupt her

thelma dont be bashful come here she said when i command you obey she stamped her foot playfully thelma came to her hesitantly stand here william now you have us both one on either side you know youre going to marry and we do too its no use having both of us suffer looking across to thelma she said old friend can you suffer

yes i have learned how she said but id rather die

so would i said susan yet i believe i can suffer you understand i waited for you to ask all the events of his courtship swarmed before him as he now comprehended it both he and susan had proposed and each had rejected the other this situation he desired ended as well as susan tho the decision would be painful he should no longer delay so to some extent he was glad when she said you men choose anyhow make your choice now

you know that i am not happy im suffering more than ever before in my life i thot the censure i bore from the ministers and the people of williamsburg was the greatest ordeal of my life oh father may i choose properly he prayed

youre not going to make any mistake said susan

at this point mrs brown rushed in exclaiming rev smith rev smith the mob is coming andy brought the news and hurried back so im doing as you said i brot you word

thank you mrs brown will you watch over the ladies he said taking his gun and starting out girls i cannot answer the question now but if i live ill keep my word ill tell you before the sun goes down

whats this william cried susan abruptly it was to her as if the malefactors had already done their mischief tho she expected such when she was in williamsburg she came yet when the danger anticipated was at hand she could not make a stand against it her former self now held sway is it really the mob you must not go they will kill you you have men scattered all around the place theyll protect you

i know they will susan but id be a coward to remain behind i must inspire my men im not going off my estate im going to wage the battle entirely in selfdefense if the enemy doesnt fire ill not fire if the enemy does fire he declared heaven only knows when ill stop

good bye he said starting out again but susan clung to him

oh william ahâah william i could stand your refusing me but not to see you any more she wept bitterly oh william ahâah she sighed then she began to laugh hysterically thelma thelma youre not going to let him go are you stay william stay i must go susan the men are waiting for me try to be calm see your nervousness has returned theyre not going to kill me he said firmly

kill you kill you she spoke somewhat wildly no no no noâah she gave a long sigh dont kill him dont kill him dont kill him then she fainted in his arms

mrs brown look after her please he said and placed susan on the settee thelma youll help too i know

certainly she replied if she soon becomes composed however i dont promise to remain here understanding william thoroly she knew he would stay upon his estate besides she believed that his neighbors needed the soft import of her spirit she might fail in an amorous interview but not in a public activity she was resolute

but you must thelma he spoke with alarm you must not go out

i heard you say you were going to remain on the estate but whats to be done concerning the other people she inquired

theyll come here first thelma stay with susan and mrs brown he said rushing out

as long as possible anyway she replied but william she called he turned and listened give them only justice we dont get even that

you may depend upon me he remarkt in an instant they heard the door bang he was en route to face his foes

while william and thelma were talking mrs brown went for water and remedies within a few minutes she had returned and started to work thelma was fanning her friends by applying smelling salts and bathing susans head with cold water they were able to hasten consciousness at first she was perfectly still save for the heavy breathing as she began to breathe with more ease she tossed her head from side to side and rolled then she uttered unintelligible sounds groans and sighs not long after this however she became quiet and then opened her eyes a few moments later she sat up and lookt dazed

sue sue said thelma in the old childish way how are you

has he gone she askt pitifully has he gone

yes susan he couldnt stay the only manly thing to do was to meet those scoundrels she declared with a sympathy that did much to calm her friend

but i fear that they will kill him yet it would be so great a pity to take our best generals remain behind in their quarters william should have stayed here she said slowly more and more gaining composure at this point she arose

where are you going inquired thelma

susan lookt at her friend a few moments and said carelessly ohâjust to the parlor window i was wondering if i might seeâseeâwilliam do you suppose i could

i think not from our location put in mrs brown you might try tho this was said more to give the young woman satisfaction

susan tried but in vain well i suppose i must wait she went to other windows on that floor but in each instance failed to see anyone returning to the drawing room she said desperately i give it up she stretched out on the settee is this a quiet place to rest mrs brown of course today im allowing for what may occur on the outside

yes it is generally very quiet here id suggest however that you go to my room you will be more comfortable she replied

i have not slept at all for several nights i was thinking that a little sleep would do me good if i keep awake i shall become probably more disquieted for should i feel that the mob was very near id be entirely unnerved she continued she wanted to throw attention from herself in order that the energies of all the fighting forces could unswervingly be devoted to the one aimâto help the nation maintain the law

come this way please requested the motherly mrs brown ill give you a very mild opiate when you awake im sure you will be better youll be yourself once more

youre coming with me arent you thelma inquired susan somewhat childishly

yes ill come said the friend

they all went upstairs to mrs browns commodiously furnisht room susan took the opiate and lay down within a few moments she was fast asleep her rest was quiet as soon as thelma saw this she took mrs brown aside and askt are you going to remain here till the men return yes be they white or black she replied

then i must go out to see whats going on said thelma

miss haskell the idea dont think of it declared mrs brown

mrs brown i must go take care of susan in an instant she was gone

when the mob left the courthouse grounds it proceeded very much as would a parade except for the boisterousness the profanity and general disorder there were the spectators who stopt their work to look from the doors and windows of the shops and homes cheering of women and children however was absent for these were not along the line of march but trailing the column of the chief actors thus they proceeded until they were quite near to the outskirts of williams estate

as they walkt out of town into the country they also spoke of various things but chiefly of being an orderly mob of doing a good job and getting back to work some however were condemning mr pitts and the entire moneyed class

tom howell on the other hand reporter of the seaton gazette as soon as he could maneuver his way to newton young began to discuss lynching as a means of keeping the negro in his place well what do you think of the mob askt howell looking here and there with profound admiration

quite a lively bunch i should say newton young replied with evident satisfaction very decent and genteel

well they certainly are orderly remarkt howell ill have to congratulate these men and prepare a fine writeup for the paper by the way i saw a lynching at hollow plains the other day it was one of the finest things i ever saw in my life a darkey named sam addams was given six months for shooting a rabbit on forbidden land he broke from prison and went into some woods

i wonder how they could be so lax as to let a nigger escape it wouldnt happen down this way declared young with great sectional pride

well i must go on interrupted howell this nigger shot the constable and a deputy in his break for freedom they succeeded tho in wounding the coon finally he was captured by a posse

when the town learned it they stormed the jail even tho there had been a quick trial and the nigger sentenced to hang

what satisfaction does hanging give when it comes to a nigger young sneered

well ill tell you those people knew what to do a crowd of something like two thousand saw it of course many of these were women and children addams was so badly wounded that he couldnt walk but not too heavy to be carried he laught

young was enjoying it immensely

so they carried him gently almost to the very spot where he shot those fellows and prepared for him a funeral pyre when this was ready they chained him to a hickory tree a short distance away they made another fire with which to heat some soldering irons as soon as these attained red heat two of the men took them out and went for the coon they jabbed these towards his body as his hands were not tied he grabbed hold of them he soon released them but not before the odor of burning flesh filled the atmosphere the scent was nauseating for the first time the murderers will was broken he was scared to death he gave away absolutely at once he began to scream hideously

they ran the irons to various parts of his body the rigger continued to grab fiendishly then he shriekt so mournfully that for a time the children and women were frightened

did they stay there askt young now extremely curious to seize every detail

yes indeed said howell arrogantly they remained thru the entire scene some people say women cant stand to see this and that women can stand anything at this point his attention was called to a little altercation between two members of the throng who were to be among the chief actors in the contemplated performance as soon as he had adjusted this he resumed his narrative when it seemed once that the murderer would get an iron and probably hurl it into the crowd one of the men plunged it into the fellows eye the other followed suit then the coon did shriek and yell

after these few minutes of torture he spoke with sangfroid men piled the wood about him then they poured coal oil on his feet and trousers not forgetting to sprinkle some on the wood the nigger begged to be shot or hanged but the men applied the match yells and shrieks of scorn and derision were hurled at him the flames as if in pity speedily singed his hair and destroyed his clothing the nigger shriekt no more he didnt even groan he writhed and soon he was dead

well id like to have seen that said young

thus they talkt until they came within two hundred yards of the most outlying farm on williams estate here they halted to decide on the leaders and the direction of their attack some wanted to rush ahead but luke crabtree said that they should wait that every man should know his business and nobody be in anyones way after a brief consideration they decided upon bob white who had always been the chief promoter silas jones and hugh granvilleâall farmers others of the conference were to help where it was necessary

all the remaining members of the mob were to obey these young howell sandy james and luke crabtree slunk to the rear to keep the women and children back they planned to join the fray later

it was at the time the conference began that an outpost reported the approach of the mob to turner who quickly got word to those on williams farm he had in accordance with thelmas plan prepared to keep the mob even from setting foot on williams estate it might mean death to all of them but thelma had steeled them to do it and they were not going to turn back

as soon as turner had sent word to william he rallied those who were to resist the mob do you think we should rush out inquired moses lampkins

not until i give the signal fool turner affirmed but they must know we are here and understand that we i mean business

when must i shoot askt another

wait for the signal replied turner impatiently and when i give it dont stop then looking about to see if all were there he askt is there anyone here who doesnt know what he is to do he paused a while for an answer all understand all right whats the slogan

rev smith shall live our lives for it was the acclaim

add this to the other the negro stands at bay he remarkt lets hear you say it

the negro stands at bay they shouted

say this and then the other as loud as you can say them thus he commanded and gave the order of the slogans

the men responded with vigor the negro stands at bay reverend smith shall live our lives for it

once more commanded turner and once again he called for it several times they havent heard us he said for there had come no response of shot or voice

lets move on towards them said wendell hill who now was ready for any venture

there seem to be about a thousand of them jim lane declared with some degree of fear

what are you afraid said hill absolutely disgusted with lane take god with you what does he say he tells us if we take him along one man can chase a thousand and two can put ten thousand to flight do you believe the scriptures 

every word of it replied lane now consoled if god says go ill kill myself trying im ready lets go ahead

some folks say never give the first lick but roosevelt says if you see a man going to hit you strike him first in selfdefense and when you hit dont play with him put him to sleep  said turner there they stand arguing making up their minds i suppose lets go nearer he continued and keep up the slogan till they take notice

the mob did soon notice the sounds all were inquisitive the sounds became louder and more distinct until they were very intelligible what had happened where you coming came a shout from the woods you may shoot if you wish but thank god we can shoot too about five men appeared behind trees with rifles which flasht plainly before those in front

the mob was disconcerted some hastened to carry the word to the women and children that they should hurry away lest some of them be killed the niggers had arms they said and are scattered in the woods theres no telling what theyll do the mob was furious because it had met opposition yet not so furious that its members could not keep their presence of mind the rifles aimed at the attackers presented the sufficient reason meanwhile wendell hill who somehow seemed to consider himself the wearer of a charmed life protected by god and who was therefore foremost said if you move another step youll sleep tonight in hell with your master we dont care to shed any blood but as surely you touch that fence some of you will go back corpses

dân it fumed crabtree and others like him this comes of waiting so long

lets go after them anyhow what do i care about dying shouted a bully

come on then responded the defiant hill if youre seeking a grave well give you one in double quick time

man dont be foolish urged crabtree whats the use of white men getting killed 

the situation is easily understood hundreds and thousands had been wont to murder one helpless individual there was no questions of the attackers being killed because their victim generally was in prison or already deprived of arms by the sheriff now for the first time the victims were armed and in ambush how many were there they did not know yet they were well aware of the numbers that workt his farms and the hosts he had brot to theirs they began to wonder whether all the people were in arms when a coward knows his life is not in danger he can fight like a devil incarnate when however he thinks that he may be killed likewise his friends relatives and children he is less ready to take human life

while the mob was thus unsettled automobiles began to sound on the crossroad the clicking of the motors suggested they were coming at a very rapid rate then the horns gave a blare which was being so discordant instinctively construed as an important warning heads were turned in various directions to localize the noise and be prepared to avoid any calamity it was not long before the vehicleâ were upon them and the faces of the occupants clearly discernible these were their own friends and associates even members of their own race what did this mean why were they there

the manner of approach had been carefully workt out nailor who had been chosen as leader was in the first car as he was a man of much initiative and great adaptability he modified his plan somewhat his party was armed to stop the mob from carrying out the attack however when he saw the mob disconcerted he was convinced that it had already met resistance he inferred this from the conference of the group that comprised the chief promoters the first part of his plan was therefore not necessary accordingly he instructed his men to keep their rifles out of sight tho near them where they would be readily accessible in case of need

nailor then turned to one of the men and said drive that carâthe one in which he cameâright into the crowd

with considerable maneuvering and at a very slow speed this instruction was accomplisht

when the car was in place he had lawyer jones stand in it for the purpose of addressing the crowd then he bade his associates who were trying to prevent lawlessness to surround the car other persons arranged themselves as they wisht this done he clapped his hands to get attention here and there distemper arose and much swearing but this he did not hear when he had the attention of the majority he said men i know some of youre sick

in different parts of the mob there arose cries of shut up

bob white however a well meaning individual who took everything he did very seriously who believed in demanding what he thot was his and was always ready to profit by whatever the wellinformed had to say shouted men this is no way to act we understood this was to be an orderly bunch lets hear what the other fellow has to sayâ thats my word all the time when you do that you dont make no mistakes when he has finisht and all of us want the nigger we can get him but you have to count the costs lets listen it aint going to do you no harm go on nailor

the crowd ceased to show signs of being disgruntled then nailor said men id like to tell you how i feel but im not i dont pretend to be a speaker but i have here a man one we all love who does a lot of talking every day when people fly up in anger they need some calm person to talk to them i cant do it what i might say might anger you so i turn this matter over to our distinguisht friend lawyer luther jones you know him hear him

had lawyer jones arisen upon a platform to speak in an auditorium these very persons who were urged to listen would have greeted him with prolonged applause when the issue was of unparalleled moment they gave him a chautauqua salute on this occasion all this was absent they merely awaited his utterances in silence when an individual becomes expectant of an accustomed demonstration and fails to get it even if he is an orator of matchless eminence he becomes somewhat disconcerted if he has had long experience he is ready for any mood of his audience so was lawyer jones on this occasion he was not certain of success but he was confident he was brimful of optimism

in this spirit he approacht his audience and said gentlemen fellowcitizens isnt this a beautiful day isnt it fine to have such pretty days here while rain is falling constantly in france isnt it fine to be living at this time fine to have others living about us while in france each day that passes makes hundreds and thousands of widows and orphans arent you glad youre not suffering those things that such does not exist in america arent you happy that we are not murdering children violating women and torturing men shouldnt we rejoice that such is not among us i tell you i myself am overjoyed this is the happiest day of my life

the suggestion carried they had not listened to banker pitts but they were listening now they began to see what their wives and children would suffer and to wonder if they would not be criminal to carry on their premeditated mischief

the speaker continued some of you have sons in france and want to see them should they return by this time a number of the colored farmers emboldened by thelma went into the open to hear what was being said turning in that direction he saw those gallant men and a stately woman among themâall armed then he said friends you want to see those and i want you to have that pleasure notwithstanding this natural desire without thot as it were you were going fo expose your lives some even to die to lynch an innocent man i say to die because the colored people are armed and ready to resist any attack if you go against them what would be the result you might probably lose your own lives and make many widows and orphans

if rev smith has wronged you bring a case against him in court ill offer my services free to plead your case besides you know judge randall is a fair man and he will give you justice consider the urgent request of president wilson that matchless son of the south he says no man who loves america no man who really cares for her fame and honor and character or who is truly loyal to her institutions can justify mob action while the courts of justice are open and the governments of the states and the nation are ready and able to do their duty at present so far as i can see this man you would attack is no enemy but a friend you know yourselves that you would not send your sons to agricultural schools tho we urged you on many occasions this man whom you sought to destroy has been and profited you too have profited by his going because of his minding his own business and working his farm successfully for big yields you wanted to know how he obtained his results many of you who now would do him a malice he showed how to increase your dollars yet the man who has made your pocketbooks swell who made it possible for you to accomplish more than you have for many a day you would string up and torture

were you able to get even laborers so easily as you have since this man came

the mob was listening very attentively and as they listened they weighed the speakers words and thot strenuously of the significance of what they were doing

we arrived somewhat late he continued we meant to end any violence because your victim is innocent and our country at war but let us be thankful that those people had sense enough to make a stand and prevent the disgrace to democracy

we should praise these people they take many insults from us and yet they are always loyal while on this point let me remind you that what they have done this day is no disloyal act for the law permits a man to defend himself

do you remember when france was being harassed with triphammer blows by the germans when she was warweary needing instant relief and we had not time to train our men it was then that the government called for volunteers to go into the breach at once if necessary tho she hoped that the moral effect of their presence would inspire sufficient endurance in the french to have them hold out until our men could be well seasoned in that crisis the call came to camp washington which received many of our boys you know the story those colored boys who went from here offered their services tho they had been but two weeks in camp dont you remember when they passed by didnt you cheer them yes you did you honored them then honor them now by not assaulting their brothers at home

then he paused a moment waved his hand to the right this was the signal for davis to make his appearance within a few moments davis came forward and planted a large american flag in the car and stood beside it lawyer jones wiped his face during the interval and then continued fellow countrymen this flag is flying in france all the world is watching it will you hold it up will you keep it from trailing in the dust

yes they shouted stand by the flag

i wish we could sing the starspangled banner  he said thrilled with the greatest throbs of emotion lets try it he led off with his beautiful tenor the people listened for a while and then joined in as they uncovered and sang this grand anthem in the grand style there returned that old respect and love for the nation

when they had finisht he askt will you do something for meârepeat a flag salute

yes yes certainly were the replies

then repeat this i pledge my allegiance to the flag to do no lawlessness in the land one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all

they obeyed all faces were brighter than they had been all day

noble countrymen i close with an utterance of our gallant president i deem it most befitting he said in making his public appeal that mob action cease we proudly claim to be the champion of democracy if we really are in deed and in truth let us see to it that we do not discredit our own now let us go to work he urged and let the world know how well we have behaved ourselves when all the rations learn especially when our own native land learns what seaton has done multitudes will praise us always

the people turned and orderly went home

when susan awoke late in the afternoon she heard a noise of mingled voices that seemed to come from the drawing room there was so much laughter and hilartiy interspersed that she was at a loss to fix the cause of it they are happy she thot am i so too at least im feeling very well how fine it is just to have a sound sleep and not to dream  raising herself and looking toward the door she saw mrs brown absorbed in a book she called to mind how she enjoyed a good story and desired to remain undisturbed while perusing it she did not want to interrupt her but more than this she did long to know what had happened while she slept ill call softly she said for it hurt her to disturb the dear lady ill call softly she wont mind susan then lookt away as if trying to banish the idea then spoke gently mrs brown the lady did not notice mrs brown she called louder

what is it miss lee now was the reply do you mind laying your book aside for a moment to talk to me i hate to interrupt youâis the story interesting

yes very it is dunbars uncalled have you read it she said and then lookt away somewhat abasht how silly of me of course you have

mrs brown she broke in for she did not care at this time to discuss the book id like to know what has occurred today why all that hubbub downstairs where is rev smith where is miss haskell she was here when i lay down why did she go away

i tried to keep her here for her own sake miss lee when shots are flying id rather be indoors but she said she had to see for herself what was going on was the reply of mrs brown unaware of what emotions might be stirred in her hearer and so unconsciously indifferent

thelma went out said susan with astonishment and with such sad feeling as marks ones beholding a calamity how long did she stay did she come back

yes she returned about half an hour ago she has been so busy talking of the affair with the others downstairs that she has become upset too im afraid you should have seen the big white men from town shaking hands with rev smith and they askt to be introduced to miss haskell she did something for which they were praising her i dont know as yet what it is

thats enough replied susan leaping from the bed i must go down and gather up all the details with dispatch she proceeded to dress help me please mrs brown she requested anxiously some day ill do as much for you with all her solicitude and haste she remembered every article with an accuracy and acceleration that caused her assistant frequent moments of amazement for she was comparing the susan of the morning with the susan of the afternoon such moods to her were unexplainable she tried to analyze the situation but as increased thinking brot only additional complexity she soon acknowledged herself baffled

while susan was dressing the hilarity did not cease it seemed to increase and at times to border on boisterousness these outbursts put her in a reflective mood which at those moments retarded her preparation de toilette it was not long however before the task was done prepared at last to meet her friends she lost no time in going to the drawing room

william had wisht that susan was there to share in the jokes and tales that were related learning tho that she was asleep he would not disturb her he had told his guests to subdue their voices and had practically decided to go outdoors but the visit of lawyer jones nailor and davis together with others who had shown a fine spirit in the affair kept him on the inside

when susan reacht the drawing room william was on the point of going upon the lawn indeed many were already there seeing however that susan had appeared he became promptly aware that he must yet remain within at once he greeted her warmly

susan was thoroly a woman keenly discerning in matters feminine she knew that mrs brown had not thot of her at all and her ambitions towards william to be not temperamentally but physically asleep when your rival is on the qui vive to be forced to step aside while your competitor runs is not in the nature of things desirable food for a healthy mental digestion thelma was on the outside while she was securely entrencht within the idea was not at all inspired what had thelma done to merit praise at least she had left the house

william she said as soon as they had exchanged greetings im so glad to see you i feared so much that you would suffer harm that my nerves were completely unstrung but im all right now she smiled am i not gay she askt abruptly

im glad to see you happy he responded with keen enjoyment you must try to keep composed now have a seat he offered her the one he had occupied in the morning then seated himself in the one she chose at that time his action was purposed he wanted not to suggest those strenuous emotional moments would you like to go outside he requested thinking that thus the affair would take a new aspect already the guests were going out and grouping themselves on the lawn

seeing this susan said no i think i prefer to be in here right now she wanted to talk to him alone and this was her opportunity in a few moments they were left alone save for the lively suggestion of a presence behind the lively conversation in progress outside

susan now thot of the task she had to perform and wondered how to begin at length she commenced not with perfect calmness nor yet with an uneasiness that might cause alarm she thot why she had come then she mused upon the recent events that gave everything a new coloring i was just wondering what to say first william she uttered in a very mellow tone which attracted one by its very loveliness but i suppose i might as well start at one place as another

certainly

then here i start she remarkt playfully tell me sir she pointed her finger at him as if reproaching tell me sir all that has occurred since you left me this morning and dont you dare to omit anything

may i not omit just one insignificant incident he askt merrily

no not one

well this is how it was to be brief i had organized my helpers to defend this farm but never had a chance

why was that

knowing that i was in a delicate situation and that i might be misunderstood even if i started an attack in selfdefense i decided to fight only when my assailants had set foot on my property or had fired upon us that this might be carried out i had instructed my neighbors not to interfere i believe in remaining within the law the people however at my suggestion were defending their homes this was all they were to do

the plan didnt work not because it might have failed it could not for we easily could have destroyed them from ambush as they would pass along the lanes to my displeasure the plan was not permitted for thelma somehow convinced them that they should defend me even against mr wishes this they did i didnt even see the mob the report came from some of my neighbors and my white friends who had formed a sort of counter mob to uphold the law and keep disgrace from the nation before they could get there however my neighbors had made a stand then followed my white friends who poured in reason and finisht the job but during the speech of lawyer jones thelma with some of the men was within hearing distance now ive told you all he smiled are you satisfied as william reviewed the events which had just occurred susan felt as if she were upon the wrack

in reply to his question she said quite quite she spoke carelessly and knitted her brow

i tell you that was something wonderful how proud i am of my people i didnt want the people to do this because the nation is at war some might have said we were stirring up strife but i tell you i feel happy in that they made the stand they did i even reproacht thelma but i could not help greatly admiring her courage she could make the people dare and she braved as much as they he did not notice the change that had come over susan she lookt at the roses upon the table and proceeded to enjoy their fragrance in an effort to shake off her wretched feeling

william now spoke almost absentmindedly when a man walks erect people look up to him they look down upon the man who stoops and any man respects a person who is ready to die for his rights are we radical to seek these thingsâlife the right to property and justice in and out of the courts these things were radical seven hundred years ago but not now

but where is thelma inquired susan who had hardly heard the latter part of williams remarks her soul was permeating the universe to get all possible help to meet a supreme test

oh said william collecting himself really i dont know she said she was going to some of the neighbors but would return very soon

shes getting her congratulations i suppose but i musnt be jealous i shall congratulate her too she remarkt with difficulty

by the way exclaimed william now that the excitement had worn off are you hungry i am i havent had a bite since early this morning you must be hungry too

on the contrary im not she replied almost monotonously

any way we must have dinner soon excuse me a moment please while i see mrs brown and have everything arranged if she hasnt already done so

youre excused dont be long she said plaintively

what perplexities confront us we start and all is gay we utter commands and all the world listens we say we want to live that we must live and all the machinery of man is shaped to accomplish this end why do we have to leave this period of rapture and innocence it is not without some sorrows but our wants in the main are satisfied we live as king or queen

soon however we become impulsive indifferent or dream dreams a man or a woman becomes the chief friend we no longer live entirely within ourselves we need a mate a mere friend will not suffice how deficient we are it was not always so but so it is now and often it is a sad truth where can i find the golden complement of my existence east or west north or south knowing best what is right about us we look next door we see the gold we adore it we take it even in our hand but can we have it now and always that remains for others to say

such were some of the thots that ran thru susans mind as she waited for william when he returned he said everything is being prepared dinner will be ready within half an hour i was thinking we might meanwhile take a walk wont you go

before she could answer thelma had come in how are you susan i hope you rested well she said friendily embracing her susan now arose

i slept too well thelma i didnt even dream she remarkt seriously accept my congratulations thelma you are a brave brave girl will you lend me some of your courage im afraid im as timid as a deer

youre just saying that you could have done it too she replied you came here after reading what was said in the paper you are just belittling yourself unnecessarily

i want to go home tonight william said susan somewhat abruptly with a sigh she lookt at him and then at thelma to glimpse the effect of her remark

dont think of it replied thelma

no came from william it isnt wise with the disturbance which came today we should have been taught to be cautious tho confident that a permanent adjustment has been made between my people and those who came this morning to work us ruin we can not afford to be off our guard were not looking for trouble but if it comes it must not find us unprepared but of course if you insist upon going well see you off you know however that you should avoid excitement at this time or anything which might give it birth stay here with me requested thelma well have a jolly good time

dont you see its impossible susan said firmly i believe i must go home tonight tonight

i shouldnt have had you come during this crisis but as youre here i wish you wouldnt hurry away at least you should stay untilâwe know this storm is over urged william write a letter or better still send a telegram ill get it off for you at once besides the country is generally recommended for persons suffering from nervous strain well that depends upon the particular country she replied she arose and started to ask for a pencil let me have aâno i believe i should go

susan i cant understand you thelma interrupted you dont understand well now you shall understand she said with sad affection for a moment she was silent then she took thelma by the hand and called william come let us be confidential come join us he approacht suspiciously as he was at her side she said here we all are whose souls throb for one answer when william will you decide 

would that i had said nothing he replied with bitter anguish beforeâthe sunâgoesâdown

it is far on its decline now susan remarkt dont you see already the streaks of red and purple

dont susan dont he cried

thelma started toward the window she was beholding the sunset

dont go thelma susan spoke sorrowfully when her friend proceeded to put on her hat we must have it out put down your hat thelma and come here just for a moment thelma obeyed when thelma had come quite close susan said see what maturity brings here william take her i will not ask you to choose for you have done so already she took thelmas hand and put it in his you won him this day what god hath joined together let no man put asunder take her in your arms and kiss her sweetly he followed her request now will you kiss me once you never have since ill love none but you will you do that much  may he thelma for he is yours now 

yes susan said thelma in tears

william kissed her gently for he was thrilled he got the burning message of her soul

now im going william she affirmed overwhelmed with the burden of her grief she took her hat and bag

stay susan they both cried

but susan left to ease her troubled breast

happier or not less happy im trying to decide whether wed be good companions i think the dispositions of the man and wife should be such as to make capable the blending of ideals none will injure the object of his affections

my ambition is to lift my race regardless of all opposition i am ready to defy any organization which obstructs my way im practically a reformer as such i must from time to time change and i will change too rapidly for those about me consequently i may occasionally be ostracised could you bear this could you share in this work or have you been educated to stay aloof from society my work will frequently be hazardous indeed at time perilous if forced to protect your home could you do so of course i should supply you with abundant arms and ammunition

i mention all this for i would not have a woman marry me for one thing and get something else i believe in letting her see the worst of it as well as the best you know im able to give you a living not in the least inferior to that you now enjoy there will be romance but also stern realities i do this because i believe in marriage as a contract as such the terms should be fully known to both and a breach of faith should make divorce speedily obtainable

william i have thot and i believed we could be truly happy you are indeed more radical than i but wouldnt my love offset that

susan im ready to give my life to make you happy but i will not give it to bring you sorrow thus i love
