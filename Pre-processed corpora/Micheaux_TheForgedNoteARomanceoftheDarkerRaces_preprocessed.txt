forged note the a romance of the darker races micheaux oscar  novel
unusually wide thoroughfare filled with the accustomed traffic beyond lay the harbor for the city is a great port and the same was then filled with innumerable vessels from far and near a huge manowar arrested his attention for a while and then his gaze wandered further

a wind had risen from the way the water was dashed to spray against the windows the sound of a clock striking five resounded through the damp air and echoed in stentorian tones it was latewinter but due perhaps to the overcast skies twilight was rapidly fading into darkness

failing to hear any further sound he presently resumed his tired position and a few minutes later was lost in a sickly slumber

there could be no mistake now a step sounded in the hallway it was a light step but firm and brisk and forward it was unmistakably that of a young woman

onward it came in the direction of his small office

there was a brief pause when the footsteps reached the door and then a knock but without response from within

presently the door was pushed open and the intruder entered the room lightly still sidney wyeth unconscious of the presence of his visitor did not move or speak

the stranger paused hesitatingly when once inside and observed him closely where he sat with his face buried in his arms

she was an attractive colored girl trimly dressed in a striking darkblue tailored suit cut in the latest fashion

a small hat reposed jauntily upon her head while a wealth of dark hair was gathered in a heavy mass over her ears her delicately molded face set off by a figure seemingly designed by an artist were sufficient to captivate the most discriminating critic

a thin dark strap extended over one shoulder at the ends of which a small case was attached presently she drew a book from this same case and crossed the room to where the man sat

good evening she ventured pausing at his side and fumbling the book she had taken from the case in evident embarassment he mumbled something inaudible but remained silent his outwardly indifferent reception had not a discouraging effect upon his visitor however for no sooner had she caught the sound of his voice than she fell into a concentrated explanation of the book

soft and low in spite of the rapid flow of words her voice fell upon his ears and served to arouse him at last from his apparent lethargy but it was not that alone which made him rise to a half sitting posture and strain his ears it was a peculiar familiarity in the tone as he continued to listen he became convinced that somewhere in the months gone by he had heard that voice before where was it he whispered but in his sluggish thoughts he could not then recall there was one thing of which there was no doubt however and which added strangely to the mystery she was explaining his own book the tempest

at last in his morbid thoughts he gave up trying to connect the voice with a person he had once known and with a tired long drawn sigh raised his hand wearily to his head and grasped it as if in pain the flow of words ceased at once and the voice now cried with a note of pain and plainly embarrassed you are ill and i have disturbed you oh im so sorry can you overlookâpardon such an awkward blunder she clasped her hands helplessly and was plainly distressed and then as if seized with a sudden inspiration she cried in a low subdued voice  ill make a light and bathe your forehead you seem to have fever

turning nimbly and before he could object had he wished to she crossed quickly to where a small basin hung from the wall above this was an electric button which could be seen in the semidarkness touching this whereupon the room became aglow with light she caught up a towel and dampening one end she recrossed to where he sat strangely stupid and without hesitation placed the wet end over his burning forehead and held it there for possibly a minute

now she inquired softly in a tone of solicitous relief do you feel better

as she concluded she stepped where she could see his face more easily and sought his eyes anxiously the next moment both recoiled in sudden recognition as he cried you

she was likewise astonished and after only a fraction of a moment but in which she regarded him with an expression that was akin to an appeal she likewise exclaimed and you quickly she became composed and catching up the book as though discovered in some misdemeanor with a hurried parting glance without another word she abruptly left the room

she was gone but his brain was in a tumult

and then the illness that had been hovering over him for some time like a sinister ghost suddenly came into its own and a moment later with a convulsive gasp he fell forward across the desk deathly sick

it had begun in cincinnati more than a year before

wyeth accompanied by an assistant had come down from dayton for the purpose of advertising his book the tempest in that city it was just preceding an election that resulted in a change in the city government and it was then he became acquainted with jackson

now being of an observant turn of mind wyeth took an interest in the state of affairs he found the city very much worked up on his arrival he had not yet secured accommodation but while standing on a corner after checking his luggage in a nearby drugstore he was gazing up and down the street taking in the sights

gentlemen said someone and turning wyeth and his companion looked upon a man he was a large mulatto with curly hair small eyes a sharp nose a firm chin and an unusually small mouth for a negro he was dressed in a dark suit the worse for wear while his shoes appeared never to have been shinedâin fact his appearance was not altogether inviting and yet there was something about the man that drew wyeths attention and he listened carefully to what he said you seem to be strangers in the city and of cose will requiah lodgin heah is my cad he said extending the bit of paste board upon which sidney read at a glance the jackson house first class rooms transient or regular open day and nioht im the proprietor and the place is at yo disposal

supposin you stop with me while youah in the city

ill sho treat y right

sidney believed him but his appearance made him hesitant he looked questioningly at his companion

the others expression was unfavorable to jackson so after a pause and a prefunctory nod they dismissed him and proceeded to look further in quest of accommodation

an hour or more was thus lost and being unable to find a room that satisfied them they at last with some reluctance found their way to the jackson house

inspection still left them dissatisfied but it was getting late so they decided to spend the night jackson showed them to what he termed his best room wyeth looked with evident disfavor about the walls that were heavy with cob webs while the windowsill was as heavy with dust jackson following his gaze hastily offered apology and excuse

evething needs a little dusting up and the reason you happen to find things as you do is because ive been so busy with politics of late that i have jes nachelly neglected my business

ah that was it thought sidney he had felt this man was in some way out of the ordinary so youre a politician he queried observing him carefully now

you hit it son he chuckled yeh thats my line sho turning now with his face wreathed in smiles he continued big lection on in a few days too

so i understand said sidney i shall be glad to talk with you regarding the same at your convenience later and paying him for the room they betook themselves to the street

election day was on and jackson was the busiest man in town he was what may be called a good mixer

to say the least and sidney and he had become good friends so said jackson that morning

got a big job on tday kid yeh a big job

so 

yeh gotta vote thirtyfive ah foty niggas n f youah quainted wi ouh fokes you cn predate what im up aginst

jackson chuckled again the fust and wost difficulty is the dinges ignance drawing a sample ballot from somewhere he displayed and explained it at some length

now we gotta puty faih line up on this ticket this tripâcose thes a lotta suckers on it that id lak t see scratched but we cain affod to take the risk cause its lak this niggas so ignant n pig headed theyd sho spile it all f we tried to have them do any scratching

so the only sho thing is to instruct them t vote straight

wyeth listening carefully nodded and for a moment a picture of the titanic struggle of a half century before rose before him its cause its moral and more its sacrifice jackson was speaking again

now we sho gotta win out this time this lection has got to put in ouh candidates cause f we dontâand this is between me n you n that can a beahâthings sho gon break bad wi me but f things slide through o

kân my candidates walk in it means a cole hundd fo muh think of it he repeated a cole hundd ah

and smacking his lips after a long draught of beer he emitted an exclamation to emphasize what it would mean to him that wouldnt look very nice in print

what do these others get if your candidates are elected asked wyeth when jackson paused

aw them suckers gets theahs wether my mens leeted a not thats always my goat f i could get them t vote  so much ah nothin i could make a who lot mo but we gotta fok out two dollahs a piece win or loseâand a cose plenty of liquah but we don give a damn bout that as the saloon men furnish that gratis

and you can depend upon them to vote as you wish ârather instruct ventured wyeth at this jackson gave a low short laugh as he replied thats whe i plays the high cad n gets a hundd

and laughing again in that peculiar fashion he would say no more

the polls had closed darkness had settled over the city the saloons had opened their doors from the streets came forth hilarious sounds where the many hundreds now steeped in liquor reeled about this confusion mingled with the crash of heavy wagons and horse hoofs hurrying over the cobblestones filled the damp air with an almost deafening noise

sidney wyeth lay stretched across the bed in his room listening idly to the sounds that echoed and reechoed through the frame building presently his attention was attracted by another noise familiar but more noticeable on this day

tclickilickilickahâha dice tclickilickilickahâha dice

silence for possibly a minute a muttering began to go around as they schuffled about

me too said another

aw be patient jacks all right argued one

sho echoed another

 yeh dat all right s fur it goes but in handle mah money betn anybody else

a heavy step sounded in the hallway and presently a door opened into the room admitting jackson

all heah boys eh he said in a voice that revealed high spirits goodâwhats this havin a little game already say looks like ymight awaited fo old jack ha ha

well he resumed after a general laughing did eve body vote straight

sho they cried in chorus

just then wyeth heard someone rap at the street door enter and presently the counting and the clink of coins came to his ears then the door closed and a moment later retreating foot steps were heard in the hallway

it was the lieutenant and now the gurgle of throats could be heard plainly and the game was resumed with jackson in charge

in the other room wyeth stripped himself and retired and ere sleep came to him that night he again had a vision of that titanic struggle and its human slaughterâ and it had all been to give those black men the right  far into the night he thought it over and when sleep did come at last he went into slumberland at a loss to know whether to condemn or to pity those poor creatures who that dayâand beforeâhad sold their birthright for a mess of pottage

weeks had passed over all the north country snowladen fields frowned zero weather was felt in many places sidney wyeth was about to quit it for a place far to the south and at that moment sat in the union station at columbus a man marked with a chalk upon the bulletin board the following train for cincinnati and the south two hours late and it was only then it occurred to him that a letter might be at the postoffice for him forthwith he betook himself returning shortly with a small envelope with his name written daintily across it in a feminine hand it was from mildred latham the girl he loved and the heroine of our story

mildred my mildred he whispered softlyas he gazed fondly at the epistle and then broke the seal and read it tonight my dear he dreamily whispered i shall ask you to become my wife for i love you love you love you

as he sat waiting his thoughts went back to the time he had met her and the place

it was in cincinnati and before the election he had while canvassing come upon her in the doorway of a house with two stories and a door that opened upon the street she stood in that doorway and he had approached her with much courtesy and after his usual explanation had sold her the tempest he had been struck at once by her appearance and something about her expressionâher obvious intelligence she seemed possibly twentyone or two and such features he breathed unheard she also had he quickly observed a wonderful skinâa smooth velvety olive with round checks where notwithstanding the slight darkness a faint flush came and went as to size she was not tall and still not short nor was she stout or slender but of that indefinite type called medium serenely perched her head leaned slightly back she had a frank face and rounded forehead from under which large lustrous soft dark eyesâ somewhat sadâgazed out at him and as he continued in his subtle observation he was pleased to note that her nose was not large or flat but stood up beautifully her lips were red as cherries the chin was handsomely molded and firm but slightly thin and protruding

her hair was the most captivating of all done in the fashion it was coal black and wavy it was of a fine silken texture and apparently long from the size of the knot at the back of her head all this he observed with favor he had never seen a figure so clear cut the girl was furthermore dressed in a plain dark silk dress with small feet the toes of which at that moment peeped like mice from beneath the trimly hanging skirt now before he had gotten far in his dynamic spiel the sun all red and glorious as its rays slanted in the west came suddenly from beneath a cloud and played hide and seek upon her face and in that moment he saw that she was exquisitely beautiful

after this he had seen her when and however it was convenient and they had talkedâthey always talkedâon so very many subjects as time went by he always felt good cheer for at last it seemedâand this meant much for sidney wyeth had had much experienceâhe had met the one woman

one day she said to him and it was in a tone that was very careful you wrote the tempest didnt you she had guessed his secret although the book had been published anonymouslyâand he had always been guarded as to its author so he replied somewhat awkwardly that he had

i felt itâwas sure when i began reading she said

because there is something in it about you that you never tellâin conversation but you did in the book

he was silent for he knew not what to say at that moment she resumed yes and it is that which makes the book so interestingâand so sad she fell silent then for a time apparently engrossed in deep thought but with worried and sad expression

there were other times she had appeared sad times when he felt she could have been happy and cheerful and gay and that to him was ever a mystery he wished he could help her out of that wayâat any time  

some day he would too he was firm in this   

then came the time when he was to leave and he passed her way that day from across the street she saw him and came at once with hands outstretched but when he made known the fact of his proposed departure she was downcast and sorrowful and sad

im so sorry she saidâand meant it he was too and said nothing

i shall miss youâoh ever so much

i will you too he whispered she looked up quickly but what she saw in his eyes made her as quickly turn away v they entered the house and the parlor where it was dark for daytime and sat together for a long while in silence presently from the next house came the notes of a piano and some one sang sweet genevieve o subtle art it made them both feel sad

impulsively he arose and caught her in his arms when the music had changed to the blue danube around then and around they waltzed lightfooted to the sweet old tune and as they danced both seemed to become strangely infected with a wild exhilaration entranced he unconsciously sought her eyes with an awakening passion and saw that she had been transformed by the music and perhaps the dance into a wild elfinlike creature and he looked away

minutes went by like seconds and after a time he dared seek her eyes again only to see that she had grown more elfin still and as abruptly as it had begun the music stopped and their dance ceased they stood however as though forgetting the embrace and thus heard each others hearts thump violently one moment they stood thus and then a breath of wind through the open window lifted a stray lock of her hair and laid it against his cheek he was intoxicated by its effect and then suddenly he had lost all composure he crushed her to him close closer and in bold defiance of all conventionality he kissed her lipsâonce twice three times she was not angry but struggled nevertheless to be free she heard his voice then low strained palpitating and with soul on fire mildred again he cried mildred o my mildred she swayed helplessly i but she got no further he had caught sight of her eyes helpless but with a weak appeal as her lips faltered please dont and in spite of his mad desire and the words he could have then sung like the poets he hesitated and for some reason for which he could not quite fully account allowed her to disengage herself

freed now she took several steps and when at some distance she paused and regarded him with forced defiance but behind it he caught again that sad distraction what is it he uttered almost aloud and then intuitively he knew she was unhappyâaye miserable i must help her said he beneath his breath but before he had decided how he seemed to hear a voice saying no not yet becauseâwell you cant

the strains of music again came floating through the open window he was not aware of his gaze but something in his expression seemed to inspire her confidence for involuntarily she turned and started in his direction

she took only a step or two when she abruptly halted paused hesitatingly uncertainly with her thin lips compressed hands clinched and her head thrown back in an obvious effort but her throat swelled almost to choking as she withheld something she seemed mad to say an expression of superhuman effort seemed suddenly to be exerted and suddenly whirling without a word she silently quit the room

he was aroused now from his revery by all aboard cincinnati and the south and an hour later he was whirling southward over snowladen fields to his arcadia

cincinnati rose about him at eight oclock that evening as he emerged from the union station and started on his fateful quest the snow ground to slush by thousands of wheels made the hard streets filthy he scurried across and caught a car that took him within two blocks of where she lived progress was slow but only seemingly for he was so impatient it seemed fully an hour before he left it although it was not fifteen minutes along the poorly lighted street he rushed in breathless haste his heart kept up a tattoo that disturbed him and he heard himself muttering sidney wyeth whats the matter

why do you feel this way pshaw you ought surely to be happy calm and imperious mildred latham loves youâand she needs you but much she does with such nerves he braced himself as he neared the house and pictured himself in the next hour she would be in his armsâand all would be overâbut the happiness this picture became so vivid that for a time it served to make him forget his nerves

and now he had come unto the house the house of his treasure and within all was silent strangely a feeling came over him of an approaching doom before him shivering in the cold night sat an old woman a hag she looked at him out of one evil old eye and he shuddered noticeably she was uncouth and unwelcome whats she doing here he muttered

doesâahâmiss mildred latham live here he ventured at last

yes snapped the hag and appeared more evil still

thank you he murmured with forced courtesy but very uneasy drawing his card he held it out to her with kindly take this and inform her that a gentlemanâa friendâwould be glad to speak with her the old hag crushed it in her bony palm and spat out five short words    but oh what mean cruel hurting little words

he reeled in spite of his strength then stood like a statue frozen to the spot

the night was cold and dark and dreary but to sidney wyeth it was hotâsuffocating in those next moments his jaw dropped as he started to speak but the words failed to come after a time the elements began to clear but left him weak he turned with a savage gripping at his heart and stumbled back in the direction from whence he had come

oh mildred he wailed mildred mildred i cant believe it  i can never oh neverand i loved you so on and on he went at times walking other times stumbling but always uttering incoherent sentences it cant be trueâit isnt true that old hagâspiteful creature he now growled distractedlyâ lied ill go back curse her ill go back and prove her the liar she is he halted staggered drunkenly against a building and then abruptly turned his face in the direction from whence he had come but ere he had gone far he desisted believe those words or not something forbade this step weaker than ever torn distracted and mentally prostrated he paused and leaned against a building and for a long time gave up to utter misery

our pen fails here to describe fully those conflicting moments all that he had lived for in those days and all that he had recently hoped for seemed to have been swept forever from him in that one moment after an interminable spell of mental blankness a sentence he had once been fond of quoting and which he had taken from haggards pearl maiden came back to him out of a remote past it was this with time most men become used to disaster and rebuff a colt that seems to break its neck at the crack of a whip will hobble at last to the knacker unmoved from a thousand blows rained upon him so presently with a tired wearied sigh he gathered himself together and with a last despairing look in the direction of the fateful number he passed down the dark street and disappeared in the direction of the jackson house

wonder whats the matter wi d kid tnight said jackson to his consort as she looked up inquiringly when he reentered the room after showing wyeth to his bed

i wonder she commented thoughtfully hes always so cheerful and pleasant when around he walked in here like a ghost tonight now i wonder what is the matter

it was late the following morning when jackson chanced to be passing and peeped into the room occupied by his friend who had acted so strangely the night before the coverlets had not been turned back altho the bed was sunk in the middle as if someone had tossed restlessly about over it the night before jackson wondered again

but at that hour sidney wyeth was on a train that was speeding southward into dixie

so it happened that the hero of this story went forth into a land which is a part of our country   

a part wherein people and environment are so far different from the rest that a great problem is ever an issue this is the problem of human beings versus human beings a land wherein one race vies with the other that other being a multitude of black people and as one who reads this might know a people who once upon a time had been slaves chattels and who for fifty and a few years have been free that time however has not been as we might appreciate sufficient to eliminate many things hereditary

and what came to pass upon this journey the things he discovered the one he again met of what had resulted due to the machinations of a pious evil genius is the story i have to tell

attalia heah heah dont get on that cah cried the conductor the following morning as sidney wyeth was climbing aboard the jim crow car of the palm leaf limited bound for attalia he backed up and looked about him in some surprise and than demanded the reason why he shouldnt get aboard that cah

i thought i tole you once we had an extra heavy train and no colored passengers allowed but since i see yu now i see you aint the same fellah that was here awhile ago and then in a few words he explained that owing to the rush of people to the south during those first days of january the jim crow section of the train had been dispensed with for that day he explained further that a second section of the same train would follow shortly as it would in all probability pass them at lexington sidney with a mumble of thanks gathered up his grips and returned to the waiting room catching the same an hour later

kentucky soon lay before him as far as eye could see a snowy mantle covered the ground for it was winter

presently countless rows of frame buildings appeared

a new brick station which extended for some length along the track gave the traveler welcome

when the train came to a stop sidneys attention was arrested by the sight of a creature that may have been called a man but gave every evidence of being an ape

i wonder said he to a fellow passenger do those things grow round here

they both enjoyed a laugh

he was now in a land in which a portion of the people apparently possessed little sense of humor judging from the way his jokes were accepted

on the car were two women among the half dozen or so colored passengers sidney overheard one of them say to the other im from noth clina but i ben in oklahoma two yes im gon back home t stay whe you from

tennesee knoxville im livin in bloomington illinois now

they looked inquiringly in the direction of wyeth and presently he was drawn into the conversation the latter possessed fine sense of humor and when he found these people so serious he took delight in joking

whe you from they inquired with all that is southern and hospitable in their tone

from the rosebud country south dakota he replied

their faces were a study somewhere in the years gone by they might have heard of that state in school but the rosebud country was greek to them

ooh they echoed and then looked at each other and back at him presently one of them inquired where is that

in africa he answered but they did not catch the joke and to this day they speak of the man they met from the dark continent

at that moment the train was crossing a stream over the highest bridge sidney had ever seen with possibly one or two exceptions it seemed a thousand feet to the crystal water below and every eye was fixed upon it

the porter a long lank laughing creature scion of the south and some porter seeing an opportunity to draw attention rushed up in a shakesperian pose and related dramatically the incident of an intoxicated man who while crossing that very stream fell of a sudden smack dab overboard right into it in concluding he looked about him more dramatically than ever as the many oohs and mys greeted his terrible story and sidney wyeth with eyes wide open inquired if he got wet

 jes listen at that they cried in chorus and the joke was lost

down down the train whirled into the bowels of dixie

far away to the east rising gray and ghostlike above the mists the pine covered cumberland range appeared and reappeared in the distance outlined like grim sentinels the scene to the hero of this story recalled the many tragedies of which those mountains were the background

the moonshiners the feudists the hillbillies and the roughnecks always had a haven there

the puffing of many many locomotives the sight of buildings and the glare of electric lights gave evidence that they had reached a large city chattanooga city of southern trunk lines and railroad center now greeted his eye

he spent one night there and the next day resumed his journey toward that most conspicious of all southern towns attalia it was a hundred and fifty miles and more by rail the train became more crowded as it neared his destination while the people grew more cosmopolitan

one of these a black man entered at one of the many stations and greeted wyeth pleasantly inquiring where he was headed for wyeth answered attalia and his companion became very sociable

understand said wyeth after a momentâthe other had possessed himself of a portion of the seat upon which he satâthat attalia is one of the best towns in the south and has one of the finest stations in the country

lagest n finest in the wold said the other with a show of pride he was a resident of the state of which attalia was the capital and was furthermore a preacher

wyeth didnt care to argue so let it be the largest and said thats wonderful i hear also that it is a great commercial center as well and that the city is growing like a mushroom

oh yeh said he outside noo yok its the busiest and best town in the united states yes yeh

he went on thoughtfully attalia is sho a mighty city

eve been theah

not for more than ten years replied sidney

indeed well well i mus say youll hadly recognize it as the same

they were now approaching the ernbryo city clouds of smoke and the whistling of innumerable locomotives filled the air wyeth began making preparation to leave the train when the other touched him saying no hurry my deah suh no hurry bes a long time yet befo we rives in de station bes a long time yet

well well the other exclaimed in some surprise

oh attalias a mighty city a great city wait until you see plum street n the skyscrapers

meanwhile the train had arrived and stood outside the station through which it had just passed it was indeed a large and imposing structure as it rose behind them under the bright sunlight with its many cornices glittering as so many diamonds it was truly a city pride from where the train stood the city lay like a great scroll and vanished in the distance smoke and dust filled the air and hovered over the medley of buildings like a dull red cloud rising in uncertain lines as if to escape the gloom a line of skyscrapers appeared in the background those must be on plum street mused sidney as he looked about for a conveyance

besides being the capital of the state and the greatest commercial city southeast of the mississippi attalia is the city of conventions the southern center for insurance a progressive journalistic city and a uniform town it is also a center for the education of negroes since it has a number of colleges supported by northern philanthropy

yet the city is unable to maintain a proficient and complete course of education for its many colored children

unfortunately for the negroes when the white schools are amply provided for not enough is left for the proper training of its black population which constitutes onethird of the whole

sidney did not fail to take note of the fact as he passed through the station that contrary to previous reports the colored waiting room was cleanly kept almost as well as that of the white race whitecoated flunkies flitted about nimbly in prompt attention to the weary traveler in spite of an air of sleepiness

presently wyeth made inquiry regarding conveyance

no sooner had he done so than he was deluged with solicitations from a score or more cabmen who seemed literally to raise out of the floor they would take him in jigtime anywhere he wanted to go

but thats it he said in a confused tone i dont know exactly where i want to go

deed suh i cn take yu any wha jes any wha f youll jes name de place

not being able apparently to make him understand that he was a stranger unacquainted with the city he presently settled on the charge bundled in and ordered to be taken to the best colored neighborhood and in a few minutes he was being trundled on his way

they turned into a street after a block or two that happened to be one end of the leading business thoroughfare on a corner post sidney read walthill the cab took him up this street surrounded on either side with the many busy shops and people and it continued until a viaduct was reached attalias broadway was just ahead it was a wide street and yet not wide enough

it had been made wider recently and in making it so the sidewalks had perforce been made narrower they had not been sufficiently wide before and now this threw many pedestrians into the street where they walked along much slower than in cincinnati even as the cab rolled along sidney observed that the street was considerably wider after some distance and this was the business section to the right and to the left in fact in every direction buildings brick and stone concrete stucco and an occasional frame stood here low there high and still higher even to twenty stories as he looked the setting sun played subtly about the topmost peaks presently the cab turned into audubon avenue

this street sloped down hill for many blocks and when the cab had made its abrupt turn further on sidney observed a large red brick building with stone cornices rising skyward adjoining this he caught a glimpse of the outline of still another building apparently unfinished

strangely enough he felt this to be the property of black people on down the street the cab rolled

it was a street quite wide enough and paved in part with cobble stones and further on with asphalt glancing from right to left as he proceeded he saw that it was given over largely to business conducted by negroes jews italians and greeks

presently his wandering gaze took in the proportions of a small book shop before which stood a tall lean negro whom he surmised rightly to be the proprietor

in the window displayed conspiciously and artistically were numerous books by negro authors which he had read and of course some he had not

and still he was trundled on his gaze met the sight of a mammoth stone church where he saw many colored men standing about the front some were brown while others were yellow and still others were almost white

they were preachers he knew for all were fat only preachers were always so he recalled and thats why he knew across another street and on the same side they came abreast of the structure that had arrested his attention before the first portion rose to only two stories but was so artistically constructed that it caught his attention and commanded his admiration next to this the other portion reached to six stories and as he came to the front he viewed it very carefully

on one side of a wide entry over which was written many words which he could not decipher was a first class barber shop where black men were being shaved

on the other side a bank occupied much space and this he observed for the first time in his life was conducted by black peopleâno they were between and betwixt but that does not matter they belonged to that race

at the rear he saw elevators moving to and fro while the entry was filled with these same folk his bosom swelled at the sight for he was proud of his people

heahs a place you might look ovah deah brudder

said the cabman at last as he halted before an old frame structure across the front of which was written in large letters the bixley house sidney was not favorably impressed

how you lak it asked the cabman

nix he replied try another

the horse was turned about and they journeyed back over the same street from whence they had come two blocks were thus covered and then they turned into a street that intersected and stopped before another place less impressive looking at this point the cabman suggested a lady friend of his who kept nice rooms and to this he was straightway driven he was satisfied at last paid his fee and in due time was fairly well installed

sometime later sidney went forth on a tour of inspection the first place he decided to visit was the book store where he had seen the serious looking man at the front he turned out to be so very much so as sidney learned in after months his name was tompkins and he was very affable even pleasant

ahem glad to know you mr wyeth he said accepting the introduction when sidney stated the nature of his business he answered his many questions very pompously and further said that the colored people of the city had an inclination for literature

sidney however began to feel after more questioning that tompkins was stretching things and that his statement that the colored people were great readers was largely exaggerated it was as we shall see later but for the present he thanked tompkins and promised to drop in again

when he had dined at one of the many little restaurants he wandered back into the business section of the city

he failed to recognize any of the places he had once known which proved conclusively that attalia had progressed he found himself on plum street again through which he walked and reentered walthill and after seeing many of the sights entered a large book store where he inquired for a volume he had long desired to readârather he inquired of a large fat man whether he had it the other looked around a spell then replied we sho god has and stood waiting undecidedly

presently he held it toward wyeth who somewhat hesitatingly looked irrelevantly through the pages he was not sure whether it was customary to take it in his hands

all right he said and reached in his pocket for the money

do youahâwish it the other inquired still hesitating

sure sidney replied thats why i called for it

he was obviously surprised and expressed the fact in his eyes the other observed this and made haste to apologize cetainly cetainly beg yo padon not many cullud people buy works of fiction or anything besides an occasional bible school books and stationery that is why i was undecided whether you wanted to buy it or not

 indeed  echoed sidney taken suddenly aback then said i read a great deal myself

the clerk observed him closely for a moment and then said you dont live in these parts

no

and you read a great deal where are you from

he was told

that accounts for it said the other proceeding to wrap up the book

accounts for what curiously

your being a reader

i dont understand   dont the colored people down here read a great deal also

no said the other simply

well i declare said sidney in surprise i have only two hours or less ago been told by a bookseller that they do

lordy me who told you that

tompkins theâ

tompkins is a booster hes all right though said the other with a low amused laugh but sidneys curiosity was aroused and he continued theres a multitude of teachers and preachers and i should think they would buy lots of current literature to keep themselves informed for their work but perhaps they are not so well paid and get it from the library

the other appeared perplexed for a moment hut said presently without looking up they have no library of their own and the city library is not open to colored people but they do not seem to be very anxious for books the teachers and the preachers â he threw up his hands in a gesture of despair youll find out for yourself you are i see a keen observer and youll find out

sidney left the store in a reflective frame of mind

i didnt believe tompkins he muttered as he walked back in the direction of audubon avenue just then he glanced to his left into the largest barber shop he had ever seen it was for white people but conducted by a colored man it was not only the largest he had ever seen but the finest the most artistic he forgot for the time what he had just been told and which was causing him some concern and again he felt his breast swell

there was much to be learned about his people that he now realized he did not know and yet surrounding it all was a peculiar mystery that he decided to solve for himself he did so but that remains to be told

next dayâdiscoveries at eightthirty the following morning sidney set forth carrying a small case containing a half dozen books his purpose was to feel out the city from a practical point of view he had been told that the better class of negroes could be found by walking down audubon avenue as far as the residence section so he followed it until the business had been left blocks to the rear at the end of the paved street he turned into a house it was a very sumptuous affair with an attractive lawn before it he was told by a passerby that it was the home of a club waiter he ventured up to the front door and upon its being opened by a mulatto woman apparently the waiters wife he turned on his spiel she listened to it patiently even speaking some words in praise as he explained the narrative in brief but he failed to make a sale he tried more subtle arts but in vain and then she told him frankly that their finances would not permit her to purchase the volume this excuse always made wyeth desist from further effort

he turned into the next house and the next and the next until a half dozen had been made but with the same result since he had invariably sold to threefourths of the people whom he approached he was not nearly so confident by this time these people lived in and owned homes that were a pride and it was not that they did not wish to buy people so easily approached can be expected in a large part to fall victim but ere long it became more clear to him they were not able it was well that he perceived this for hope of success was small if it depended upon purchasers here most of the people he found in these homes were dependent upon a very small salary the cost of living was as high here as in the north in fact the ordinary commodities were higher the sums they were receiving would not be considered sufficient to care for the same people in the north therefore why should it here this was contrary again to what sidney had always been told

presently he happened upon a letter carrier no time was lost here this man was paid for his work so he forthwith became a victim of the most artful spiel and bought the book cash this served to spur sidney to renew his efforts and he attacked those he approached more vigorously for a time he met with no more success

he had a lunch at a nearby restaurant of pigs feet and sweet potato custard after an hour he resumed his efforts and this began his discoveries

entering a yard he came up the steps of a house from the back way he passed a refrigerator and crossed the porch to knock at the door butâa bottle of kentuckys john barleycorn calmly rested upon this same refrigerator

the door at which he knocked was opened presently and he was invited to enter which he did but when leaving by the same way after selling another book for cash john was gone

at the next house his customer was a tall woman of middle age and dark skinned she drew him adroitly into a prolonged conversation and then bought the book

now attalia is a prohibition town in a southern prohibition state yes it isâand it isnt when sidney wyeth left that house that afternoon he had spent part of what he received for the book for beer and whiskey

moreover he was told that more than seventyfive places on audubon avenue were engaged likewise and in the city allâbut that is a matter for conjecture

obviously prohibition did not prohibitâbut more of this later in the story

that evening while dining he became acquainted with ferguson and thurman who will for a time occupy a part in the development of this plot

ferguson was a preacher but at this timeâand for some timeâhad not preached he admitted painting to be more profitable from a financial point of view he complained however that if the new freedom continued in power much longer at washington and with the way things was agoin he would have to give that up and go back to pickin cotton

they ain nothin in preachin no mo thats a sho thing

i do not agree with you on that score said sidney for from what i have learned already in regard to these parts there must apparently be more money in preaching than anything else judging from the number of preachers

and how fat they all appear ferguson looked up quickly at this remark and as quickly down at himself

i didn get this flesh preachin i assuah you he retorted with flushed face and after a pause he went on with some heat but thats what don spiled preachin too many lazy niggas agraftin offa de people but ferguson as wyeth learned later was something of a pessimist and predicted all kinds of deplorable things and it was at this moment that a dejected creature made his appearance

he was bald headed bowlegged but notwithstanding these possible deficiencies in his makeup aggressive

his name was thurman and said he between bites of sweet potato pie aw niggaâyouah alius apdictinâsomthin awfulâtoâheah you tell itâsince the democratsâhas got int powahâcawse a buneha crazy niggasâdidn know how t voteâat dat aih convention in chicawgoâthe world isâliable to end tomorra

it moughtâit moughtân f it didâyou be oneâa d fustât bun in hellâtoo but dont you dress me lak dat no moâin sech distressful terms you autta be shamed ayo sef

and he munched pie for a time uninterrupted by speech

thurman only grunted unconcernedly

what are the prospects of the colored people down here at the present time inquired sidney hoping to relieve the tension but he could have rested easily on this score for as he learned later they carried on that way every night that was their diversion but thurman was now heard from

hell he answered calmly

good lawd man cried ferguson shocked whats comin ovah you

lyin n stealin drinkin cawn liquah n gittin drunk bein run in locked up and sent to d stockade n chaingang he resumed ignoring fergusons shock entirely whereupon ferguson looked more distressed than ever but only wrinkled his face in a helpless frown and said nothing

gee cried sidney but thats an awful prospect

all this time thurman had not smiled but accepted everything as a matter of course from the way he partook of sweet potato pie

you must not pay any attention to mr thurman mister said the proprietress from across the room

she was a patientfaced sleepy short woman and now for the first time thurman moved in his seat and took exception to the words said he somewhat loudly and emphasizing his words with a raised hand pay no tention pay no mention wull i reckon yud bettah hump he deliberated pausing long enough to fill his mouth with more potato pay no tention when yu know yusef that jedge lyles s a sentincin mo niggas to the stockade n chaingang than hes eve done befo n a good reason he has fo doin so too lyin doity stinkin stealin niggas he ended disgustedly

presently before anyone had time to deny his sweeping assertion he resumed mis mcoy yu know dem taters i got frum you tuther night

i rember them quite well mr thurman she replied resignedly

i took them taters home n put m in muh trunk locked it n put th key in muh pocket s i alius do

now what yu think happened he halted and surveyed the atmosphere with serene contempt that low down lil nigga in th room wi me sneaks int that trunk wid a duplicate key n steal eve last onem jes think of it he emphasized with a terrible gesture stole eve las one uvm then talk about niggas

we didn say nothin bout niggas wouldn steal man complained ferguson you jes nachelly went offa yo noodle widout casion

during all this conversation a girl sat opposite sidney

she was a dark sweetfaced maiden with an expression that was inviting sidney happening to glance for the first time into her face smiled and nodded she smiled back pleasantly ferguson and thurman continued their harrangue

they are a pair ventured sidney to no one in particular but the girl smiled and inquired who are they

i never saw them before he replied

she observed him closely and said presently in a very demure voice indeed ahâthenâyou dont live here

no he answered and told her

ooh my she echoed tremulously it must be fine away up in the great northwest andâdo you expect to be hereâer some time

for a few months at least whereupon she inquired as to his business and he likewise inquired of hers

i am employed in service she said

now it happened that sidney had a few months before met an agent in dayton who persisted in canvassing nowhere else but among this class he thought of this and made inquiry he was told in reply that practically all the domestics were colored

i would like to see the book you sell she said presently if you could bring it to the number where i am employed and if after seeing it i am pleased with it i would buy one he could not have wished for anything better and told her so elevating his eye brows in pleased delight he said i most assuredly will only tell me how i may get thereâill make a note of it and he immediately did so

catch a plum street car she directed and get off at west eleventh street walk a block and a half west until you see a large house numbered  they are jews so should you lose the number inquire for hershes

you may call any time after two p m

 i will be there tomorrow at that hour if the sun rises and if it doesnt ill be there anyway he laughed

she was amused

all right she said and took her leave

the next day was beautiful the sun shone brightly and the air was soft and fragrant plum street besides being the leading business thoroughfare is likewise the most imposing resident district at its extreme end

large cars modern and built of steel thread their way not only to the city limits but they penetrate far into the country beyond

and it was aboard one of these modern conveyances that sidney wyeth reclined observing the size and grandeur of the many magnificent residences that stood back from either side of the street in sumptuous splendor

magnolias and an occasional palm adorned the yards while green grass and winter flowers filled the balmy air with a delightful odor

he alighted and found himself very soon in the rear of no  success was his for he sold to the girl and three more at the same number and the next and the nextâand still the next until darkness came thus he came in touch with people who were more able and positively more likely to buy

a few days after this he dropped in on tompkins

hello my friend that worthy one said why havent you been in to see me ive been thinking of you

indeed said sidney in glad surprise ive been too busy he concluded shortly

too busy echoed the other in evident surprise

and then he waited expectantly

oh sure sidney smiled looking over tompkins supply of books mostly bibles for such was the most tompkins sold as he learned

been selling lots of books   

hundred and sixtyfive orders in eight days

great goodness tompkins exclaimed he dropped all work for a moment and stood with mouth wide open

then he inquired artfully have you delivered any

fifty copies last saturday and monday

man are you telling me the truth he exclaimed dubiously

i sell books sidney replied calmly

tompkins resumed his work in a very thoughtful mood

presently as sidney was leaving he called say drop in and see me some day when you have time to talkâa long talk im interested in you

and he never knew weeks had passed mildred latham could be seen sitting dejectedly by the window of her small bedroom gazing down a street that led to the river every day since that next day when she had been told that a man had called to see her and instinct told her it was sidney wyeth she had sat thus on this day however things were different there had been a changeâa great change in her life for she was today and henceforth free in a sense but this is further along in the story

presently she picked up the tempest this was nothing unusual although she had read it in two days after she had received it she had in the weeks that had just passed picked it up and reread certain parts of it but as a change had come since the last time she held it she read it today with unusual interest after reading for a few minutes she laid it aside took from the table near a map of south dakota and for a time studied the part of it across which was written the rosebud country

she allowed her mind to wander meditatively back to the past she saw this land as it was when the country was young when the bison and the native indian held sway when mighty herds roamed across those plains molested little by the red man she picked up the book and read a little more for scores of years they had lived and died and at the end of this regime came the inevitable white man the greatest race of conquerers the world has ever known without doubt and behold the change of a few short years nature in wild profusion then materialism in the extreme they these conquerors had almost changed the world and among those thousands that crossed the densely settled prairies and made conquest of the rosebud country were only a few black men

judging from this book they could be counted upon the fingers of one hand one of these was sidney wyeth

yes he had gone forth hopeful and happy and gay and had become a negro pioneer so he began and did a mans part in the development of that now wonderful country thus she imagined it and felt it must have been it could not have been otherwise because only men went west to the wild and undevelopedâand stayed he had stayed for ten years how he spent those years mildred latham could imagine through the pages of that narrative she had followed his fortunes to the climaxâthe culmination of a base intrigue what a glorious feeling it must be she felt to be a pioneer to blaze the way for others that human beings ever after to the end of time may live and thrive by the right of others conquest he had plowed the soil turned hundreds of acres of that wild land into a state of plant productivity which should bear fruit for posterity and if sidney wyeth had in the end failed in a way it was only after he had done a mans part in behalf of others

but then came the evil

in the lives of all men the greatest thing is to love

sidney wyeth had hoped at some time to gain this happiness the love of a woman had he earned it

apparently not from anothers point of view that was all so singular she thought time and again for the evil creature evil genius was a preacher a minister of the gospel i cant quite reconcile myself to that part of it yet i should she mused now aloud for my father is a preacher

mildred lathams thoughts drifted from sidney wyeth for a time and reverted to her own life and that of her father who was a preacher soon they wandered back to sidney to his life of hellâthe work of an evil powerâ the torn soul upon its rack of tortureâand finally the anguishâalways the anguish followed by the dead calm of endless existence

yet during their acquaintance he never spoke of the past no word of censure or of unmanly criticism passed his lips

so mildred latham could feel in a measure relieved for she had secretsâand she kept them all to herself too

directly she shook off the depression and rose to her feet

it is all settled she said half aloud and going to her trunk laid the book in the tray lifted the latter out and reaching to the bottom took up a small steel box and set it on the dresser she then inserted a small key opened it and took therefrom a heavy legal document

examining it for a time she put it into her hand bag locked the box returned it to its place replaced the tray and locked the trunk again this done she slipped into a street suit and gathering up the handbag firmly left her room locked the door stepped into the street and caught a car that took her up town where she alighted before a mammoth office building she entered this took an elevator and got off on the twentieth floor entering the office of a prominent law firm this visit had been prearranged

an hour later she left a large bank on the ground floor returned to her room took the box from her trunk and replaced not the legal document but a long green slip of paper

all is now settled on that score she whispered drearily and then busied herself mechanically about the room again she fell into that fit of meditation she could notâtry as she mightâshake off the despondency

and always in the background somewhere lurked sidney wyeth was this because she felt she would never see him again she couldnt she knew as she recalled her secret

suddenly she threw herself weakly across the bed and sobbed for hours sidney my sidney a careful listener might have heard her lips murmur but she was alone perhaps that made it so hard for she was alone now always alone

at last she got up and bathed her face as she had done many times before

always too she had a presentiment down in her heart that somewhere or somehow some day fate would be kind and send him again into her life and then would she be ready

o that persistent question

now mildred latham was not a weak woman far from it in spite of the secret which was ever her burden she was not the kind to give up without struggle this was perhaps the cause in a degree of the suffering she endured it was this sorrow which sidney wyeth had observed and wished to dispell if i could only have permitted him to do so she said so many many times

but always the barrier

i will sell his book henceforth for my living she said to herself at the end of that day as she had often said before and in doing that i shall ever live with his memoryâgod bless him for mildred latham loved sidney wyeth

and he never knew

b j dickson when sidney wyeths work among the domestics was an assured success he decided to rent desk space in the large office building referred to get a typewriter do a little circularizing and concentrate his efforts upon securing agents elsewhere for the purpose of distributing his work

accordingly one sunday morning after being told that the custodian of the building could be found in his office on the fourth floor he betook himself thither

but let us pause for a moment and retrace a long span of years that we may interest ourselves in the history of this same structure for it has a fascinating tale to tell

before freedom came to the black people of the south pious worship had begun despite the fact that it was an offense to teach negroes during that dark period or in any way to be responsible for allowing them to teach themselves many nevertheless did learn to read and perhaps because the slaveowners were inclined to be godfearing people they did not in a general sense openly object when they found many of their slaves worshipping so it happened that since men were in the majority of those who learned to read the first channel to which they diverted this knowledge was preaching

and since as above mentioned they were not always forbidden worshipping the christ among negroes had been practiced long before freedom came therefore after freedom preaching became the leading profession among the men

the reader is perhaps well acquainted with the pious emotion of the negro our story will not dwell at length upon this but the fact that to become a preacher as a professional pursuit was the easiest and most popular vocation and from the fact further that negroes had become emotionally inclined from fear in one sense and another so that it is inherent preaching and building churches swept that part of the country like wildfire

of the different sects the baptist seemed to require the least training in order to afford the most emotion

all that was required in a measure to become a baptist preacher was to be a good feeler and the practiced ability to make others feel

history proves that people of all races when still not far removed from savagery are inclined toward display

this is an inherent nature of negroes indeed negroes of today in many instances those who have graduated from the best colleges seem yet largely endowed with this trait as this story will show later

so shortly after preaching and shouting became the custom another feature entered which permitted these people more feeling and this was lodges secret societies and social fraternities these like everything elseâomitting possibly the extreme feeling exercised during religious worshipâwas patterned after white custom but insofar as the negro is concerned a great deal more stress and effort and feeling was put into the things mentioned in a sense they were the negroes all

naturally these many lodges etc must have some object and that object for years was irrevocably to care for the sick and bury the dead

our story will be concerned with the united order of the aaassssbbbbgg which for the purpose of this story will answer as well as the real name and will be much easier to refer to

the aaassssbbbbgg is one of the oldest lodges in dixie having been in operation among the black people for generations and its great object was until a few years ago to ceh fo the sick n buy the dead

in the course of events there had been elected to a very conspicuous position in this same lodge a man with a square jaw he was of medium height and build but aggressive very much so in fact a born fighter happily the latter trait was peculiarly necessary to the one who held the office of grand secretaryship in this lodgeâ and to this office dickson fell heir

now dickson was no ordinary negro he was ambitious not the kind that is likely to be satisfied with the past duties of the order because and it might be well to mention so strange a coincidence this lodge had not been able to spend all the money that had come into the treasury for burial purposes so the reserve totalled  cash it was confidentially whispered that the officers a united click preceding dickson had calmly planned when this amount reached  to grab it all and start a colonyâfor themselves of course in africa  but alas enters dickson the determined the ambitious and if anything can serve to disturb an order like this it is ambition in all the years of its existence the slogan had been to crucify ambition religiously but dickson crucified them at this time at least they were relegated to the scrub timber where they lay dreaming of a time never to return for the old order changeth

in addition to the office of grand secretary dickson was an editor and before the mossbacks had realized it some years before he was editing the official mouthpiece the independent they thought little of this in fact they didnt care because in the first place no one else cared for that job it required too much thought to edit a paper that the members would be likely to read the independent had come out at spasmodic intervals reporting in detail the death of miss sallie doe a member in good standing who had met her jesus on the altar of evermore or that jim johnson another member had been incarcerated in the county jail along with many others for disturbing the peace or that at the revival at the antioch baptist church of which brother jasper was the pastor a soul stirring revival is going on with scores gittin right with jesus etc etc etc but its greatest ambition apparently had been to come before the people guaranteed not to be read

so fancy when after getting control dickson did it all over the independent became some paper it fairly ripped and snorted it took up the instances of officers that were sluggish and backward and slow and made great headlines whew the members cried who had never read the paper before while others declared ah alius knowed dat niggas crazy but everybody began reading the paper they objected and scrambled and stewed about what was said called him the biggest liar bulldozer and everything else but read the paper so the circulation doubled and trebled and quadrupled and then doubled all over again until it was reaching every live member of the order dickson didnt care whether it reached the others or not and he told them so moreover he saidâin not so many words but it was read between the linesâthat they could go to hell they took the paper then

there came a time at last when the treasury was reeking with sams good gold and dickson had more enemies than could be counted readily but dickson was wise he had looked deeply into the condition and inborn weakness of these black creatures and had surmised that they only patronized each other when they mutually hated if they loved one another they were allowed to starve to death undisturbed

he saw that negroes would only build and occupy an office when the white man refused to rent him anything but the atticâand not even that sometimes so with a flare a blaze and a roar out came the independent and said that the aaassssbbbbgg lodge had decided to erect an office building of its own it was to be six stories in height of brick with stone cornices and what not

moreover a picture of it completed appeared on the front page of the independent that finished it they prepared to send him to the madhouse and forthwith gathered for that purpose which was what dickson wanted they arrived in twos threes and fours and then in droves to the tune and number of thousands they came and were met  by a brass band and away went the music taraâtaâtatiripitatatatu it got into the negro blood music of all things always has effect before they were aware of it they were cakewalkin and doin the grizzly bear and it has also been whispered confidentially that two preachers high and mighty in the order balled the jack the music stopped for a spell through the crowdâthe black crowdâcame a cry arrah arrah for the negro the greatest race since the coming of christ and it was answered arrah arrah so we is who said we wasnt the white man came back the reply

hes a liah went back the words heatedly if so then came back why do we continue to do our business in his attic why this was a shock but before recovery sayetli the cry  odd we have in the treasury to care for the sick and bury the dead with  more we can have a building all our own with elevators and mirrors and a thousand things with our own girls to tickle the type and scratch on the books

a wild dream flitted across the minds of these black men the underdogs the slaves for a thousand years their wives the cooks and the scrub women their daughters the lust of the beast and then from somewhere came another cry it was soft and low but firm and regular

it came from a body of women black women with our hands from the white peoples pot we will give unto thee thousands and back again to the pots we will go and slave until our old bones can slave no more and pay and pay until a mighty building the picture of which we have seen shall stand as a monument to the effort of black people

and now there was a scramble to the front it was a scramble as had never been seen in attalia before

 was fairly thrown over the heads of one another to b j dickson the grand secretary

six months and a year had elapsed and the monument stood serenely in the sunlight as sidney wyeth came down the street that sunday morn to the side of this monument stood another imposing and grand not yet finished but soon to be and it had all come through the indirect efforts of b j dickson they were not satisfied with the one when they learned they could do things but needed anotherâso they subscribed the necessary funds without effort and built the other

before entering sidney walked across the street and viewed the structure from the other side

thus he saw his people as others see them

for his life had been spent for the most part in white civilization

as he surveyed it carefully he was relieved to find that to a stranger there was nothing to indicate that colored people occupied the building

an intelligent looking man came out of it and crossing the street bowed casually to wyeth the latter returning it inquired regarding the building and dickson and he was told the following yes while there are many who do not give dickson the credit he is nevertheless the man who has made all that possible

everything is well kept apparently said wyeth

that is unusual for our people

thats dickson said the other and then aside he inquired have you ever been through it

i am just going said sidney

you should have done so during the week any time before one oclock saturday

why one oclock saturday

because everything ceases at that time

indeed wyeth commented in wide surprise

system

thats it thats dickson

indeed does he have charge of everything

 indirectly yes that is he does not own everything of course not but its like this do you observe how everything is in order wyeth did and waited

well resumed the stranger you can bet your boots that it would not be that way if it were left to those in the buildings altogether no they wouldâsome of themâget into a fight knock out a window or two and bring a pillow from home to stick in the hole the first time it rained and blew in at the window the plaster would fall then others posing more than anything else would have a crap game going on and sell whiskey on the side as for the letters in gold which you observe on the windows they are dicksons ideas negroes would use chalk naturally but dickson wont stand for anything like that when anything is amiss he goes at them as for instance those stores in the front many of the proprietors when they empty a box instead of putting it to the rear would stick it in the front right up where every passerby could see it to augment it further they would allow dust and dead flies to collect cobwebs too and perhaps pile a few old rags up on the top of it

but b j goes to them as i said invites them across the street and shows it to them he takes them up to one end of the building and walks them to the other and allows them to see it as the casual observer would if he dosnt think or consider this sufficient he takes them up town and allows their gaze to compare it with the way things are conducted by the first class white people

and then he says now just look at it thats niggas

niggas proper you conduct your place so that every stranger seeing the city and the sights when he gets before this building realizes at one glance that negroes occupy it 

sidney laughed a low amused laugh the other continued  thats why you see things as they are our people are not bad to handle they are in fact the most patriotic of all races and are surely anxious for the success of each other only they dont know it they are like a herd without a leader dicksons a leader over there ah thought sidney thats where it comes in

the race needs leaders again the other was speaking

of course we have a great many that would be leaders oh yes indeed over there in that building are many who are pining their lives away they are confident they are leaders and are exasperated because they have no following they hate the people because they are not awake to the fact they declare that they have even been to school and graduated from college and know everything which alone should put them at the head for some peculiar reason they cannot realize that leaders are born not made

now you leave the building and wander about over the city and you will find a score or more of these wouldbe leaders all with the same delusion in regard to themselves they include for the most part teachers preachers and doctors they are so wrapped up in this idea that they are utterly incapable of appreciating what the race is actually doing and trying to do of these perhaps the worst are the teachers this is probably because they are paid by the county and do not have to cater to the masses for their support he paused and extended his hand glad to know you stranger and goodby

sidney wyeth watched him disappear and then crossed the street to the building and entered

oh you sell books

one beautiful day the palm leaf limited carried another passenger southward aboard the jim crow car

it was mildred latham and her destination required a change at chattanooga turning her course however she went west and alighted at a town happily located upon the banks of the mississippi it was a large metropolis a facsimile of a sister city attalia

miss latham left the depot at once and proceeded to beal street which was entirely occupied by negroes

she entered a restaurant but soon came out and started in search of a room however the landladies all told her they preferred men so she decided to look elsewhere

a car put her off at a corner far removed from beal street she passed down a clean quiet street lined on either side by comfortable homes occupied by colored people she paused before a small but handsome stone church it was the first presbyterian so the cornerstone read to the side and back from the sidewalk completely surrounded by vines was the parsonage at least she took it for such and so it proved to be she hesitated a moment then with an air of finality she opened the gate entered the yard and mounted the steps

the door was opened by a kindly lady whom she judged to be the pastors wife

pardon me please began miss latham demurely but i am a stranger recently arrived in the city and have been unable to secure lodging i noted the church next door and surmised that if this is the parsonage and if the pastor is in he might assist me she hesitated and for a time seemed at a loss how to proceed in the meantime the other surveyed her critically strange women were always regarded with suspicion finally she replied kindly swinging the door wide come in my dear child you look tired and surely need rest you must have come a long way the pastor of the church you refer to is not in for the present and i regret to say is out of the city and is not expected back for several days i am his sister however and will help you all i can she paused as she placed a rocker at the disposal of the stranger and relieved her of coat and hat

you are very kind said mildred gratefully i hardly know how to thank you

please do not speak of it my dear as i am alone you may stay with me until you have found the kind of place you desire she was silent and thoughtful for a moment and then asked softly where are you from

cincinnati

i do declare exclaimed the other in mild surprise

i have relatives there but i have never seen the city myself

the stranger appeared relieved

and do you expect to be in the city long

i cannot say i am here to sell a book the tempest a western story by a negro author and of course it depends upon that as to how long i shall stay

oh you sell books mildred did not correct her

i used to sell books and indeed i liked it i am fond of reading i am anxious to see the book you speak of when it is convenient since i have observed advertisements of it

it is a nice book mildred commented and as soon as i can have access to my trunk at the depot i shall be delighted to let you see and read it

i shall indeed be pleased i assure you the other smiled back sweetly i am always so interested when it comes to books that i wish when you have had something to eat you would tell me the story of the tempest

it will be a pleasure but you need not fix me lunch for i just ate a short time ago as i came from the station

so if you now wish i will tell in as few words as possible and as best i can the story of this book

the story opens up on the banks of the river near this city  it concerns a young man restless and discontented who regarded the world as a great opportunity

so he set forth to seek his fortune    thus it began but shortly it led through a maze of adventures to a land in the west it is perhaps the land of the future a land in which opportunity awaits for courageous youths strong men and good women    this land is called the rosebud indian reservation it lays in southern south dakota and slopes back from the banks of the big muddy stretching for many miles into the interior beyond it is a prairie country no trees stumps rocks or stones mar the progress of civilization so the white men and only a few blacks unloaded at a town on or near the frontier i think it is called bonesteel and then the mighty herd of human beings flocked and settled over all that broad expanse claiming it by the right of conquest

among these many conspicuous at the front was the hero of this narrative he came into a share a creditable share and although far removed from the haunts of his own and surrounded on all sides by a white race he was duly inoculated with that spirit which makes men successful

time went on and in a few years there was no more reservation but it became the rosebud country the land of the optimist

then of course came to him that longing that dream the greatest of all desires the love of a woman

but of his own race there were none and he did not feel it right to wed a white wife but at last he found one of his own blood she was kind good and refined but in conviction she was weak without strength of her own

she loved himâas such women love but to her father a preacher she was obedientâsubservient they lived for some months in happiness until that otherâher fatherâcame to visit them these two her father and her husband differed both in thought and action and naturally out of sympathy in short they disagreed upon all points including the daughter the wife and at last the mother for in time such she became and that strange to say instead of being the birth of a new freedom was the end of all things

so oer this land of the free there came a change a sad change that led to the end the end of the tempest

she paused and allowed her eyes to remain upon the rug before her while the other listened for more presently she said and was it her fatherâwho stooped to this

the other nodded and remained silent with downcast eyes

mildred latham could not have said more had she wishedâjust then a peculiar feeling came over her and her mind went back to a night not long before

the office of the grand secretary when sidney wyeth walked into the office of b j

dickson that sunday morning he found him alone engaged in reading when a step sounded at the door he laid the paper aside and glanced searchingly at the intruder wyeth saw before him the man of determination the square jaw the determined set of the neck otherwise he would not attract any particular attention in a crowd but this was b j dickson of whom he had heard much since coming to attalia and even before

mr dickson he inquired respectfully the other nodded and pointed to a chair

you have charge of the renting here so i understand 

yes

id like to get desk space for the present and later on perhaps i might require an office

i see mused the other surveying him meditatively

well we have nothing left in this building but i think there are two or three rooms not yet rented in the building you have observed in course of construction what kind of business are you engaged in

books replied sidney simply

mm well i cant give you any information as to desk space you can however see morton tomorrow

his office is on the second floor the board of trade he can enlighten you on that score

what do you receive for the rooms

 a month

that is quite reasonable said wyeth the other looked up with a pleased expression

youre one of the few who have made such a remark

he commented

indeed that would be considered cheap in my section of the country said wyeth

where is that

wyeth told him

oh well you come from a place where the people are accustomed to something these down here have been used to nothing but an attic or an old frame shack a fireplace with wind blowing in at the cracks and of course cannot appreciate steam heat electric lights first class janitor service and other modern conveniences that go with such a building

at this point several men entered the room most of whom were distinguished looking compared with the average negro wyeth was introduced to them and learned that two were physicians one a dentist another a lawyer and still another was a letter carrier the stranger was soon the object of their many questions

they were answered deliberately for sidney wyeth was well informed

what do you think of the colored people in the south now that you see them yourself he was asked he noted the pride and air of dignity along with the question

i am considerably impressed with what i have seen i am sure wyeth began cautiously it is unnecessary to say that this is probably the most commodious structure owned and occupied by our people in any city and i have noted with a great deal of pride that you have in the building also some half a dozen large insurance companies owned and conducted successfully by members of this race all of this and other creditable things too numerous to mention count for much in the solution of the race problem much more could be said in praise but i do not consider it necessary and still with so much to their credit there is much also to their discreditâvery much i refer to this since it is a thing that can be remedied and positively should be to begin with the people as a whole do not read nearly as much as in the north and are poorly informed in matters of grave concern and of general interest he paused and saw that they were puzzled they were all of them taken aback they looked at each other and then began to gather color and heat as well

sidney wyeth had stirred by his last words his criticism the hornets nest

and what may i ask inquired one of the physicians icily has given you that impression

well many things sidney resumed calmly for instance i am in the habit of buying the climax which is as you know published in new york and edited by a man who used to be professor of sociology in one of your colleges now in all the places i have been he didnt refer to the north realizing that it would cause more argument not bearing on the discussion i have found this magazine much in circulation among our people but here at only one place have i found it you appreciate that the negro population of this town is to exceed without doubt sixty thousand it receives but fifty copies a month and does not sell all of themâof course there are annual subscribers but so there are everywhere else as well

nowâ all began with upraised hand but sidney stopped them with ive made this remark so hear me out that i may show that i am justified in making it

they were quiet but impatient

you have several large drug stores doing a creditable business in the city omitting a few operated by white men in negro neighborhoods you will hardly find one that does not carry a goodly stock of magazines for his trade not a colored drug store carries one tompkins other than the climax does not sell any now gentlemen with such a population as you have he was very serious now is it consistent to believe that these black people read in proportion to what they should when there is so little current demand for literature

the outburst that followed this was too intense to describe the composure that was in keeping with their appearance and training was for the time lost everybody had something to say to the contrary and at the same time

i have five hundred dollars worth of books in my house cried dickson

i take the climax and have since it began publication cried still another

derwin its editor is a traitor to his race and i can prove it persisted another

theah ain nothin in it nohow yelled another whose english was not the best

its the only magazine edited by and in the interest of this race retorted wyeth and has a circulation more than double that of any other publication by negroes since freedom 

you northern negroes think a whole lot of derwin and are imbued with his point of view cried dickson but we had him down here before he went north and we know him for what he is and he looked about him meaningly

the others gave sanction

hes the author of the only book in sociology that stands out as a mark of negro literature the book is a classic and is one of possibly two or three from the pen of a negro since dumas

it is difficult to foretell where the argument may have ended but sidney slipped out as the door closed behind him a mighty roar of indignation came over the transom

hes a liar hes crazy like all from that section

when these men met wyeth afterward and for some time they did not recognize him he was not surprised

they are and the best of them in a measure still incapable of accepting criticism as it is meant our story will go to prove this more conclusively later on but for the present sidney wyeth had made friends   

henry hugh hodder weeks had passed and a touch of spring time was in the dixie air sidney wyeths canvass was now assisted by another while from over the country he had secured here and there an agent to sell the book he found desk space in an office on the second floor hired a stenographer and filled the country with circular letters

perhaps fifty or more replies were received a few with a money order and requests for further information

although most of the letters were sent to preachers and teachers throughout the south twothirds of the replies came from the north from boston new york chicago and centers where literature is obtainable from the libraries which are open to negroes more letters by far came than from the south where such is not always available and out of these a few agents were secured

but it seemed almost an impossibility to interest those at the south in a subject of literature

one day there came a letter from a small town in florida that amused wyeth it was from the secretary of the board of trade in reply to the circular inquiry requesting the names of the negro preachers in that city it ran thus my dear sir replying to your favor of recent date relative to the names of negro preachers of this city in regard to this i am compelled to say that i cannot fully enlighten you for this reason everything with trousers appears to be a preacher or any one who can spell ligon

my gardener is a preacher although he finds my work more renumerative apparently but you could however write to him and he would i feel sure give you the desired information

when sidney appraised tompkins of his failure to get the cooperation of southern preachers in his exploit he was advised that the preachers were working that side of the street

we cannot appreciatively continue this story without including a character that is very conspicuous in negro enterprise that is the undertaker he is always in evidence mortality among negroes exceeds by far that among whites this is due to conditions that we will not dwell upon since they will develop during the course of the story but in attalia there was one undertaker who was particularly successful he had the reputation of burying more negroes than any man in the world he had a son a neerdowell to say the least and they called him spoon

sidney who at this time shared a room with thurman became acquainted with spoon one sunday night it was at a tiger of which as we now know there were plenty

spoon had a reputation in local colored circles as well as his father but spoons reputation was not enviable

he was booziogically inclined and reputed by those who knew him to be able to consume more liquor than any other ordinary society man moreover spoon was some sport too could play the piano in ragtime tune and could also ball the jack he would lean back upon the stool play the latest rag as no other could and at the end cry give me some more of that sparrow gin 

wyeth and spoon became close friends following their first meeting and sunday nights they would roam until one or two in the morning spoon knew where every tiger in town was and moreover he proved it

thurman although two and fifty was no poke

but was a sport too his began early sunday morning

one sunday morn as they lay abed after the light of the world had come back and claimed its own thurman called to sidney where the other lay reposing in the pages of a best seller say kid how bout a little toddy this mawnin

im there came the reply

good exclaimed thurman guess tho ill haf to go after it s see you lost in a book all time gee

looks lak youd lose your mind areadin so much

no comment guess thats why you got all these niggas aargun roun heah though cause you read and they dont mm yeh yeh that makes a diffnce

mm

wull reckon ahll haf t git in muh breeches and crawl ou and git dat stuff t make it wid mm old mis roun the conah ll be glad t git dis twenty cents dis mawnin mm wull kid be back trectly

he was sooner than expected he didnt get outside

he peeped out what met his gaze would send any southern rheumatic negro back

it was snow

jesus christ he exclaimed returning hastily from the hallway hell has sho turned on dis mawnin out dare kwhew f thes anything in this world i hates its snow

sidney stopped reading long enough for a good laugh as thurman skinned off his trousers and clambered back into bed

aw shucks thur this is a morning for toddies

a mawnin fo hell yes hu hu wow

after a spell he peeped from beneath the coverlets

say since ah come t think uvt we cn have them toddies widout getn froze out in doin it

hows that asked the other

ill get dat liquah from john

and who is john

john wull didn you git quainted wiim when i brung you heah johns the man we room with he sells liquah

say spoon said sidney one day im going to cut the tiger kitin out

aw gwan kid what you talkin bout

im going to church in the mornings and in the evenings i hope to find a place that will be more in keeping with respectable people announced sidney

come on lets go up here to old lady macks and get some of that sparrow gin  spoon suggested temptingly

to prove that i am not likely to keep my resolution

youve none to keep as i can particular see i have never seen you drink anything stronger than beer when youve been with me you seem to go along with me to see me and the others act a fool sometimes you impress me as being a strange person  i wonder

now i wonder   

where is a church that would be likely to appeal to you and myself

up on herald street is one that i think will appeal to you youre serious meâim quite unfit for any but ill take you up there and sit through one of hodders sermons if you care to go my people are members of that church and it is a progressive one

we will attend services thereâsunday morning

wyeth became a regular visitor

the following sunday the pastor appraised the congregation of the fact that on the following sunday they would have with them the reverend w jacobs the energetic young man who was doing such great work for the training of wayward children and this takes our story into a matter of grave human interest

coincident with better educational facilities and the more careful training of the children time had brought a change that was slowly but surely being felt by these black people in the south it has already been stated that the baptist church required little literary training in order to preach but in this church it is quite different and no man would be tolerated as a minister who had not a great amount of theological as well as literary training

henry hugh hodder was a man not only prepared in the lines of theology and literature but was fully supplied with practical knowledge as well he had at the time sidney wyeth became acquainted with him gathered to his church a majority of attalias best black people

his popularity was moreover on the increase and his church was filled regularly with a class of people who listened studied and applied to their welfare what he said each sunday in the pulpit

his church stood on a corner to the edge of the black belt and near a fashionable white neighborhood and it had at the time it was constructed caused considerable agitation when sidney and spoon came to the door prayer was being offered and when it was over they entered taking seats near the door

it was a nicely ventilated church with large colored windows arranged to allow air to pass in without coming directly upon the congregation at the front a small rostrum rose to the level of the rear and contained in addition to the altar only four chairs sidney was told afterwards that due to a practice always followed in other churches particularly the baptist of allowing journeymen preachers to put themselves before the congregation uninvited hodder had removed the chairs in order to discourage such practice

apparently he had succeeded for on the sundays that followed sidney saw only those who were invited facing the congregation

directly over the rostrum hung a small balcony which contained the choir and a pipe organ following a song the pastor came forward he was a tall man with width in proportion perhaps two hundred and twenty pounds

not unlike the average negro of today he was brownskinned his hair a curly mass of blackness was brushed back from a high forehead his voice as he opened the sermon was deep and resonant and for his text that day he took does it pay

not since sidney wyeth had attended church and heard sermons had he been so stirred by a discourse back into the ancient times to the history of judea and caesar he took the listener and then subtly applied it to the life of today never had he heard one whose eloquence could so blend with everyday issues and cause them to react as moral uplift for he knew the black mans need pen cannot describe its effect upon sidney wyeth

it seemed as the words of the pastor came to him revealing a thousand moral truths which he had felt but could not express that he had come from afar for a great thing that sermon it lifted him out of the chaos of the present and brought him to appreciate what life and the duty of existence really meant

having in a sense drifted away from the pious training he had received as a youth sidney wyeth was suddenly jerked back to the past and enjoyed the experience on account of his progressive ideas he had been accused by some of his people since his return to live among them of being an unbeliever he was often told that he was not a christian they meant of course that he was not a member of a church which to most colored people is equivalent to disbelief sidney wyeth saw the life the instance of christ as a moral lesson

when the sermon closed wyeth had one desire and fulfilled it and that was to shake henry hugh hodders hand moreover to tell him in the only way he knew how what the sermon had been to him

he did so and was received very simply

as he approached the rostrum at the foot of which stood the pastor shaking hands with many others who had come forward in the meantime he was like one walking on air he recalled the many sermons preached to satisfy the emotion of an ignorant mass and which in hundreds of instances went wide of the mark causing a large portion of the congregation to rise in their seats and give utterance to emotional discordance the same being often forgotten by the morrow

hodder was not only as he was just described but he proved to sidney wyeth to be a practical informed and observing man as well when he had received the card he inquired of the country from whence sidney came and related briefly the notices he had followed regarding its opening a few years previous

at that moment a large man almost whiteâthat is he was white although a colored manâwas introduced to him as mr herman he proved to be the proprietor of the large barber shop on plum street which had caught sidneys attention the day he came after mr hermans introduction he met many others prominent in negro circles including the president and cashier of the local negro bank and thus it came that sidney wyeth met these the new negro and the leaders of a new dispensation

two hours after the services had closed he passed a big church on audubon avenue a church of the old style religion and which most negroes still like it was then after two oclock morning service was still in orderâno the sermon had closed but collection hadnt

out of curiosity he entered the pastor had during this period concentrated his arts on the collection table he was just relating the instance of people who put their dollar over one eye so closely that it was liable to freeze to the eye and bring about utter blindness so now

he roared brandishing his arms in a rally call  we jes need a few dollahs mo to make the collection fotyfo ill put in a quata wholl do the rest whereupon the choir gave forth a mighty tune that filled the church with a strain which made some feel like dancing

the following tuesday an editorial appeared in one of the leading dailies concerning the sermon and the instance of henry hugh hodder it dwelt at some length on his work for the evolution of his people and concluded by praying that among the black population great would be the day when such men and such sermons were an established order

sidney now in an office to himself read it to a man next door whereupon the other said oh that is nothing unusual they often speak of him and his work in the editorial columns which might account for his having such a fine church

wyeth was silent apparently at a loss what to say

the silence had reached a point which was becoming strained when another who happened to be in the office relieved it by spitting out sneeringly white fokes ll give any nigga plenty money when he says what they want him too he was a deacon in the big church referred to this was not investigated

wyeth called him a liar then and there

sweet genevieve

wilson dear said constance jacobs to her brother the pastor on his return from attalia effingham and other places where he was required to go in the interest of his work coming up to him in her usual manner she kissed him fondly for she was not only fond of this her only brother but she was proud of him well she could be for wilson jacobs was a hard conscientious worker in the moral uplift of his people i have a surprise in store for you she said and if you are comfortable i will tell you

little sister he said as he kissed her fondly in return and gave her his undivided attention

i hardly know how to tell you but i have with me someone who came during your absence the most unusual to be a usual girl i have ever known she then related the instance of mildred lathams coming and the circumstance including the book i have read the book that she is selling and with which she seems to be very successful in fact she is so successful that i am almost persuaded to take up the work myself the story is interesting but it is not that which has caused me much thought it is the girl herself

she is a beautiful girl intelligent kind and winning although she does not as i can see practice or exercise any arts to be winning she is single and does not appear to have any interest in the opposite sex nor does she appear to care for any society in fact besides being nice and kind to all whom she chances to meet she does not have any interest beyond the book she is simply foolish about it just as much so as though the author were her lover and depended upon her for its success

there is something peculiar that is oh wilson there is something just something that i cannot understand about her thats all she gave up trying to express herself for a time and then he spoke in love no doubt and has had trouble

yes she said then shook her head it might be that but if it is it is an extraordinary love affair but i am confident it is deeper than that i catch her at times looking into space as though her mind were far away and at these times i have taken notice that she is sad very sad my heart goes out to her when i see her like this because for some peculiar reason i have fallen in love with her she found a place to stay and was going to move but i could not think of it she is the sweetest companion i ever had

i wish you would become interested in her dear i want you to perhaps you can get at the bottom of the mystery that surrounds her i cannot and it worries me because i want to help her and it hurts me when i feel that i cannot she has become very much interested in your work and has been helping me in the correspondence relative to the same

when can i meet this strange person you speak of constance i am curious from what you have said

i gather already that she may be able to help us in some way in our work

she went down the street for a walk but will return shortly since she never goes far at that moment steps sounded on the porch and a moment later mildred entered quietly and was on the way to her room when constance met her with oh miss latham please meet my brother who came since you went out miss latham my brother wilson jacobs

my sister has just been speaking of you miss latham said he after the exchange had been made

indeed cried mildred smiling pleasantly upon constance your sister does me too much honor

not a bit i am glad to know you and shall be pleased to become better acquainted as time goes on

i am told that you are selling a good book i have observed advertisements of the same some time ago and will be delighted to read it 

mildred smiled pleasantly hesitated and then said every one i sell to report that they love the book i do myself i think it is such a frank and unbiased story and told so simply that anyone can understand it yet with a touching human interest that is in a measure vital to us all even persons more highly gifted can learn something from it and be entertained as well

she has sold over a hundred copies in three weeks which i think is extraordinary dont you said constance at this point whereupon mildred looked slightly embarrassed she always did when anyone spoke in praise of her

extraordinary excellent i should say her brother smiled where does she find such good customers

i work among the women in domestic service

mildred explained wilson looked surprised

indeed and do you find many readers among them

you have not been to many of the teachers

i have yes but they do not seem to take much interest in work by negroes so far as i have been able to gather i could not say for sure of course not but i do find the women in service in great numbers to be fond of reading and full of race pride of course there are multitudes of ignorant ones who are not capable of appreciating literature and its value as moral uplift but as a whole i am highly successful 

wilson jacobs was greatly moved by his first conversation with mildred and found himself thinking about her more than once in the days that followed his sister became so deeply interested in her that after a week had passed she had taken up the work also

 do you ever play miss latham  inquired constance a few days afterward and late one afternoon when they had returned from their work

a little mildred admitted but it has been so long since i have touched a key that i am sure i should be very awkward if i attempted it i think you play nicely

the other laughed i only play when i am quite sure no one is likely to hear me there is one piece i can play and of which i am very fond i heard you humming it the other day as soon as the parlor is comfy i shall ask you to condescend to listen to me play it

what piece is that please tell me mildred inquired

sweet genevieve

oh yes   

why what is the matter dearest cried constance hurrying toward her

nothing nothing said the other hastily mopping her nose and eyes

well im relieved but i thought i heard you sob but of course you didnt of course not really i begin to feel that if i dont get married soon ill become a nervous cranky old maid

please dont say such things about yourself entreated mildred you were not mistaken i didâahâ i sobbedâi mean i coughed i had something in my throat she concluded nervously

im relieved smiled the other and going to the piano she struck the keys and sang in a high contralto voice o genevieve id give the world to live again the lovely past

the rose of youth was dewimpearled but now it withers in the blast

i see thy face in every dream my waking thoughts are full of thee thy glance is in the starry beam that falls along the summer sea

it was in the small hours of the morning when mildred lathams eyes closed in sleep all the night through the strains of sweet genevieve and what it recalled tortured her memory until it was from sheer fatigue that she did at last fall asleep

she hoped constance would play sweet genevieve no more

do something and youll find out

in attalia there is a street which includes all that goes with ethiopian it is called dalton street and along its narrow wayâfor it is narrow and one of the oldest streets in the cityâoccurs much that is deplorable

on this selfsame street an incident took place in which sidney wyeth happened to figure as more than the casual observer

it was in late afternoon of a cold wet day he had been delivering books and had a considerable amount of the proceeds of the delivery in his pockets when while on the way to the office he chanced to be passing down this street he looked up and found himself before a large odd appearing structure a uniformed man stood at the front and in passing wyeth paused a moment took in the proportions of the building with a critical gaze and inquired of the man what it was

the other looked at him with an expression which seemed to say you ought to know but grinning he replied do something and youll damn quick find out its the police station

mmmm you wouldnt be likely to find out if you didnt i suppose he laughed as he continued on his way

during sidney wyeths bachelor life on the rosebud he had been a victim of the habit of going to town and loafing the night through occasionally there had in the beginning been a great deal of gambling there and to watch this was an absorbing pastime it served also as he then felt as a diversion to break the monotony of his lonesome life

now there were placesâif not gambling densâin attalia also where one could loaf at night when his correspondence was completed that evening he felt a call of the wild in his blood and went forth on a pilgrimage of this kind in company with a chauffeur he left for his room about one thirty a m the following morning they had not however gone far before the clouds had gathered they didnt see the cloudsâat first âbut the clouds saw them they happened to be a pair of meddlesome bullcops it has been stated that the hour was about one thirty but the cops said two moreover they wished to know what business occasioned two young men to be out at such an hour

sidney felt slightly insulted and stepped aside to let them by thereby wishing to avoid any argument the cops stepped aside also but to see that they did not get too far out of the way said oneâand he was the burliestâwell boys where have you been where have we been said wyeth to himself now wouldnt that frost you what business of these men was it

they had positively not been acting suspicious nor were they seen fighting and neither were they drunk so then what right had two burley cops to get in the way and ask such impertinent questions sidney felt like making an indignant reply he felt like fighting then he did some quick thinking and decided to be patient answering the questions in an offhand way and so be on his way for he felt sleepy and then again he observed that they wore great big sticks with which they toyed idly as they waited for reply

aw knocking around it was wyeth who made this reply

aw knockin roun said the big cop who had now grown ugly in the sight of wyeth and he repeated this mockingly and now spoke the chauffeur who had grown up in those parts he was diplomatic said he im jes gettin off frum wok capn and despite his look of truth and sincerity he trembled perceptibly

sidney observed him with a touch of disgust

is that soo said the cop more sneeringly now than ever sidney had enough and started to go by but the bluecoat blocked his way roughly and cried out with club grasped where yu been nigger

wyeth was shocked beyond speech evidently he had not as yet come to appreciate that he was otherwise than on the rosebud where you been nigger

came the terrible voice once more

wyeth woke up moreover he became obviously frightened he repliedâand lo he was trembling also as he cried what do you mean mr policeman he was now wildeyed im not breaking the law i have done nothing i am on the way to my room and to bed why do you hold me up this way i dont think i am obliged to answer such questions as you ask but i have been calling i cannot see that it matters where sinceâ

aw dont talk to the man lak dat whimpered the chauffeur

ill knock your damned head off nigger whatn hells got int you to talk to a white man like that

he turned his face to the other who had not up to then said anything and said lets arrest them the other acquiesed come on he roared grabbing the chauffeur by the belt of his trousers and whirling him about the other caught sidney likewise but was more civil in the act

good lord mister said he to his cop why are you arresting us we have done nothing

got orders to pick up everybody after one oclock who looks suspicious and cannot give good accounts of themselves he replied soberly

i wish i had known it wyeth sighed wearily but im at least glad that i didnt have him lead me

he said pointing to the cop who had the chauffeur

you made him mad grinned the patrolman you must not live here

no lord and i wish at this moment i had never come

when a white man speaks to you down here always answer him sir  he advised

i most assuredly will if i meet any more like him

said sidney meekly after a moment of silence as they stumbled along he said thoughtfully i hate this ive never been arrested before in my life will they lock us up

oh sure the other laughed

mmmmâm

 jes lemme go this time mister  whined the chauffeur ahead n i won neve be out late no mo

im sorry son said the bullcop a little kindly but its impossible i on think you are bad tall but that other niggers crooked n i know he is he said pointing back at wyeth he was overheard and despite the precarious condition wyeth realized he was in he smiled

hes sho got a bad pinion ayou son laughed wyeths cop

ill go t bed eve night at nine clockâeight f you say so begged the chauffeur as they neared the patrol box

while they were waiting for the wagon the copper with the chauffeur in charge turned that worthy over to the other cop and ran across the street to intercept another negro that one happened to be a waiter who worked at night and was accordingly allowed to go his way but he had been off work since ten oclock wyeth and the chauffeur had left him at the palm garden when they departed but that was no argument now the other went his way whistling cheerfully while they stood prisoners of the law

it was a dreadful experience for sidney wyeth

a mighty but familiar jingling of bells proclaimed that the wagon was on the way and in an incredibly short time they were pushed inside as the door closed with a bigger cop than the others between the culprits  and the door these words came to wyeths ears idling and loitering

youse the cause athis accused the chauffeur angrily

wyeth laughed outright

how cn you lafn us on the way t the lockup

wyeth laughed in earnest now while the bull smiled naively

i wish id aneve seen you said the other wearily

its vain to make such wishes now and then something occurred to him he had been to the bank but had fortunately not deposited all he had say governor he cried if a man should put up money when he is taken before the clerk or whoever it is that receives us would they allow him to return without locking him up his inquiry was eager the other replied most assuredly

good how much will i have to put up to keep from being locked up

about ten dollars and seventyfive cents

wyeth did some counting i have ten fifty will they let me out on that

i think so

what you goin do bout me put in the chauffeur

do about you said wyeth what you going to do about yourself im not your guardian

but i ain got bu fifty cents he wailed despairingly

then methinks you will sleep on dalton street tonight

they had arrived at the station by this time wyeth recalled a few hours before with a feeling of awe as he recognized the place and the words the man had used

whats your name demanded the clerk of the chauffeur

boise demon

yours

wyeth gave it and as the clerk made a record of it he made inquiry regarding a bond

all right ten seventyfive

i have but ten fifty

see the sargent

whats the charge inquired that orderly coming forward

idling and loitering

let him off for ten

pay me out pay me out trembled the chauffeur

shut up commanded sidney havent you heard me say i had but ten fifty

then don go don go stay with me

like hell i will exclaimed wyeth with a laugh

the officers standing about laughed also and said dont be fraid honey youll have lots acompany

wyeth handed over ten dollars and a moment later passed into the street where a soft rain was falling

jesus he muttered im sure glad i kept that money and then ere he had got far he heard a cell door clang and thought about demon at the same moment there came to his ears the music of many throats singing dont you leave me here

jedge lyles cot

wyeth sneaked into the room without waking thurman that morning nor did he inform him of his good fortune when the other arose two hours later to go to work he did not sleep any that night and since he had to be to the court at eightthirty or forfeit his bond he arose early dressed and in due time he sat in the large theatre

perhaps if sidney wyeth had suspected what would come to pass that morning he would have forfeited the bond by not putting in his appearance but when he put up the collateral the night before he had observed a mark of respect in the officers he was sufficiently acquainted with the courts from a distance to realize that the average negro brought before that tribunalâ with the possible exception of a bootleggerâseldom brought any money or had any at home and invariably went in great numbers to the stockade moreover the sargent and the clerk too had advised him that he might not possibly be fined at all therefore when he left for the court he had no thought other than that he would go free and have his money returned

it will of course they had said depend upon how judge loyal feels when you appear

he had heard something regarding this feeling

before he meditated as he made his way in that direction and still he recalled more of what he had heard which was to the effect that if his stomach was upset look out

he hoped judge loyal didnt suffer with dyspepsia or indigestion   

as he neared that place he now remembered so well he was overwhelmed with memories he recalled this same court more than ten years before it was in a leading magazine it was moreover he recalled an interesting story too wonder if it will prove so today he mused silently   

and now he was inside the court room he was early and so were many others he recalled with another twitch of the memory that judge loyal had presided ten years before he would see him today there he is now he said to himself as an old man with white hair came upon the platform and took a seat behind the bench

but it was the clerk judge loyal came later so did others many others

and now all that he had read in that article many years before suddenly came back to him clearly it overwhelmed him the article concerned that courtâ and negroesânegroesânegroesâa court of negroes

and now he was a part of them although on the outside he felt guilty he was supposed to answer when his name was called

the court room was filling rapidly they were herded behind huge doors to the left of the room black men and a few whites a mass of criminal humanity he shuddered he wished now to be over and out of it as soon as possible and then he experienced a cold fear

it became stronger it developed until it became a chilly premonition that judge loyal jedge lyles as these negroes called him would be feeling badly that day

this feeling persisted until it became a reality

it was now eightforty in ten minutes court would begin but still others came and came and came

women and men boys and girlsâeven children and eighty per cent of them were negroes his people would they never quit coming what manner of business did these people conduct that brought so many into court

and at last came the judge he was in all appearance a young man evidently he was not because sidney had been told that he had been on that bench for twentyfive years

court was then opened inside a fencing many white people sat in chairs who they were or what part of the proceeding they represented he could not tell prisoners were then being arraigned from somewhere he did not see but it was not from the detention room where the great herd was a young negro of striking appearance was led forward he was tall and slender and what caught the attention of sidney wyeth was that there was nothing criminal in his appearance he was about twentyfive years of age and wore shackles about his ankles as well as upon his wrists he made a pathetic picture sidney listened carefully as he stood before the judge while talking in an undertone he could not hear what was said but presently the prisoner was led outside and away he never learned what charge was made against this young man although he would have liked to know

on a table that stood to one side of the bench behind which the judge and clerk sat were several cases of liquor

evidence against some poor devil was strong thought wyeth

the gavel fell

the first prisoner brought forward and placed before the judge was a negro of medium size and height and about middle age he did not possess the look of a criminal either in fact not all of these people or any great part of them appeared to be criminal if sidney wyeth had observed criminology correctly yet there was a charge himself for instance this one was charged with having been drunk and making a big noise

he admitted the charge

 where did you get it demanded judge loyal

wellâwhat was it

oh gin   

sparrow gin

ten dollars and cost next

there was some delay before the next ones were brought forward when they came there was some anxiety

they were white men from one of the suburbs as to how they happened to be in this court was a matter for conjecture but the charge was fighting

a witness mounted the stand by request

your name isâ

bill sykes

william sykes very well william sykes what do you know about this affair tell it to the court

case nolleprossed several negroes were brought before the bar for various misdemeanors were fined and few dismissed while a great many were bound over the next case to arouse any special attention pertained to two white girls who were brought forward with drooped heads and made a picture that attracted the attention of the crowd

the recorder frowned as he observed then questioningly

whats the charge he inquired of the officer who presented himself as prosecutor

soliciting all right prefer it

your honor judge i found these young women hanging around dewitt and carlton streets this morning about one oclock and advised them to beat it they disappeared for a spell but at a quarter past two they were out again and i heard them and saw them accost several men who happened to be coming from work

presently a couple halted and a few minutes later the four disappeared within a rooming house i had been watching this house and was positive it was crooked

i followed them a little later and when i was inside i looked about for a clerk and register that i did not find

then i overheard talking in low tones in a couple of the rooms when i knocked on the door all was quiet and the doors were not opened i then demanded the doors be opened in the name of the law a scrambling followed i heard windows go up and a little later men hit the ground below when i entered the rooms i found these young women alone and put them under arrest

the court room was very silent all eyes were upon the prisoners the fact that the girls were both beautiful seemed to provoke the judge and he was very cold of demeanor

what excuse have you to offer for such acts of indiscretion he inquired presently and eyed them severely

they both burst out crying and clung to each other which made a very pathetic picture we wasnt doing anything mr judge not anything we lived there and the men were our husbands said one while the other cried woefully the recorder eyed them critically before speaking in a tone of extreme severity why then did they jump out the windows and run away    dont you think that was very cowardly for husbands 

ooh they cried now like two poor souls about to enter purgatory they almost made others cry too

but the judge was unbending he looked forbidding and as cold as steel as he said young women like you two should exercise more discretion if you must conduct yourselves to the disgrace of the community in such manner you should keep off the streets with your men at such ungodly hours

i am therefore going to impose a fine of  and costs upon each of you for delinquency next

boise demon and sidney wyeth called the clerk with his eyes on the docket

the pair now stood facing the court

your honor began the officer whohad wyeth in charge the night before preferring the charge we found these fellows at two oclock this morning going in the direction of warren street and since as you know we have orders to intercept all people whose appearance is suspicious and since they failed to give an account of themselves that was satisfactory we considered it expedient to place them under arrest

the recorder nodded his acquiescence

your name he inquired of the chauffeur

boise demon

and yours of wyeth

whats your occupation demon

im a chauffeur n woks fo mr baron ciders

you know him es mah boss es got a office in the â

why werent you at home in bed ten hours before you were charged with being on the street he demanded

demons jaw fell sidney looked discouraged

it was a selfevident fact now that judge loyals stomach was out of order   

demons excuse was a variation that failed to impress the judge as being the truth wyeth languidly resigned himself to the inevitable

what is your occupation wyeth he now turned  his gaze upon sidney

he was told

whats your excuse for being upon the streets at two a m

nothing calmly

the judge regarded him in silence while the pair waited for the sentence still the judge paused as he did so wyeth heard him belch slightly as if decided

a moment later came the words fine you fellows  and costs you must keep off the street loafing about all night next

they were turned about automatically and then wyeth found himself looking down on a low deformed creature

he had been told about him also and why he was deformed

it had come about during a terrific race riot of a few years before and the incident will ever live in the history of attalia it was then this creature became crippled

he was at the time one of the strongest and most capable officers on the force but upon being sent to make an arrest he happened onto a bad negro run amuck he was to say the least however far more fortunate than a dozen others for they had been sent to their happy hunting ground before the riot was quelled

since then he had acted as a sort of bailiff

peeping up at wyeth he said you have up collateral do you not

pay me out pay me out cried demon at this point

wyeth nodded

then you step aside and follow the officer downstairs to the clerks office he instructed

pay me out pay me out from demon again

wyeth frowned and pinched him good i wish to confer in regard to this fellow said he to hunchy as they were being waited for

in the detention room demon secured a loan of fifty cents from another miscreant and a moment later they stood before the clerk

when the fines had been paid the officer said now demon you can go but i am ordered to hold wyeth as a suspicious character

well ill be damned was all wyeth said

take me at once before him he cried when they were again in the court room at the same time flashing his check book which he had placed in his pocket for precautionary measures demon had followed them gratefully back up the stairs and now stood about muttering in a low tone ain that hell am that hell wyeth motioned him aside resolutely

once more he stood before his honor upon recognizing him the recorder looked at the officer with a question his face had cleared of the frown it wore some time before and wyeth concluded his stomach was better

the officer preferred the charge whereupon he looked at wyeth keenly wyeth made a motion it was granted

i dislike very much your honor to be kept in this court room so unceremoniously i am no criminal and my time is worth something now if i may be permitted to put up more money i have just paid a fine for being out late for myself as well as for another and go my way until this thing is done with ill appreciate it

very well twentyfive dollars

wyeth paid it and never returned to take it down

when he got back to his room after it was all over thirtysix dollars to the bad he opened the book of resolutions and recorded therein resolved that to give heed to the call of the wild in attalia is a very expensive diversion albeit a lesson therefore henceforth twelve oclock will find me in the land of nod

a jew a gentile a murderâand some more look here kid they tell me they had you jollied spoon when he saw wyeth that evening at hatfields ice cream parlor

youre breaking into print laughed bubber hatfield unfolding a green sheet the searchlight a sensational fourpage afternoon affair which made a specialty of court news and which most colored people read

they are fond of such news

frowning while all those standing about laughed he took the sheet and read negro from the north was surprised in a few colored paragraphs it described his appearance before the recorder and in conclusion it had these trite words purported to have been said by him dey don have dem kind of laws up norf

the following saturday he dropped into tompkins and was introduced to a man who impressed him considerably at the first glance he could see he was not a southerner before he made his acquaintance he overheard him discussing books with tompkins and when he heard him speaking of the latest works of fiction he opened his ears to hear a negro in attalia discussing novels the late ones was something new to him in fact he had heard the most of those he met discuss but one a salacious one from the pen of a noted english author and playwright and which cannot be had at the libraries but is nevertheless a masterpiece

he grasped his hand cordially and they at once entered into conversation his name was edwards

this gentleman explained tompkins is the author of the book you and your friend were looking at this afternoon edwards eyebrows went up with considerable pleasure as he cried in a voice that was to say the least cordial indeed i am honored to meet a real author sidney however was much embarrassed he disliked to be pointed out as an author among his people the most of those he met had impressed him with the feeling that an author must be something extraordinary and were usually disappointed to find them only human beings like themselves edwards however was not only an individual of good breeding but one with perspective and quite capable of appreciating an effort regardless of what the attainment might be

sidney had met few of his race but who seemed to feel that to write was to be graduated from a school with a name that was a fetish and to be likewise a professor in some college in order to get material and color for a work they had not yet come to realize that it was best and much more original as well to come in contact with the people and observe their manner of living

this may account in a large degree for the fact that so many whom he met were impractical even badly informed

edwards and he became agreeable acquaintances at once  come take dinner with me this evening edwards invited grasping wyeths arm and leading him into the restaurant next door where he had already ordered dinner and such a meal wyeth had not realized that it was in the range of possibilities for the little place to prepare such a one moreover to say that edwards knew how to order would be putting it mildly he spared no cost obviously since the meal came to  wyeth felt guilty when he recalled that he ate three times a day at the same place the kind termed half meals and which came to fifteen cents per

before they had sat long edwards friend came to the table and of all the negroes sidney had met this one was the most extraordinary the son of a japanese mother and a negro father he had been educated abroad

he spent his youth in asia lived a portion of his life in japan the remainder in america and was a buddhist

one negro at least who didnt spell ligon

history and science from the beginning of timeâbefore adam whom he scorned astronomy astrology meteorology the zodiac and the constellations in fact he seemed to know everything sidney anxious always to learn what he did not know could only sit with mouth wide open while the other declared jesus of nazareth noah the flood adam and eve and all the rest the biggest liars the world ever knew

when sidney had occasion to speak of him to religious negroes in aftermonths they would say shucks he couldnt aconvinced me gainst mah jaysus and he would then be sorry sidney believed as much as any one else of moderate intelligence and his acquaintance with the unusual negro had no effect whatever upon him as a believer but he knew that many of those who professed so much faith in jaysus and cried we is god fearin fokes were mere feelers who had no thought of god whatever in the sense he should be regarded and respected indeed they did not fear him

they feared but one thing these black people and that was the white man which belongs to another chapter

i grant all you say to be quite possible my dear sir

said he when the other paused in his serious discourse but having been raised to the christian faith i am therefore a hopeless believer i do nevertheless respect your point of view and your faith and am glad indeed to have met you which ended it

edwards proved to be a graduate of yale and was well informed in every way as sidney suspected

he had always found it this way the great fault he was finding daily with those of his race was that they did not read did not observe and were not informed in the many things they could just as well have known

as the days went by sidneys friendship with edwards developed to the point where edwards insisted upon paying half the rent for the privilege of loafing in the office whenever he was at leisure sidney did not inquire his business or what he was engaged in but his curiosity was aroused nevertheless his friend always had plenty of money and spent it not foolishly but freely he never permitted wyeth to pay for anything and he never ate a meal that came to less than two dollars

after a few days another fellow joined him who while surrounded with an air of mystery did not happen to possess so much apparent education his name was smyles and he purported to be from boston at the same time acknowledged alabama to be his birth place

he still carried the accent he was dark of visage had long legs and wore trousers around them which appeared never to have been pressed wyeth wondered why some of the many pressing clubs did not kidnap him alive his head was small and obviously hard and he wore his top hair so closely cropped that no one could quite describe what kind it was

now smyles was a sport likewise a spender and moreover with money aplenty to spend and as the days passed and wyeth became better acquainted with him he learned that he was mashed on the girls to a considerable degree for instance there was lucy who waited on them at miss paynes cafe who got crazy about him he did about her too for awhile at least he pretended to then he became interested likewise in another who had better hair than lucy

thereupon lucy became mad with jealousy and threatened to do something awful she didnt so we leave her to her fate and go on with smyles who becomes for the present the hero of this story

smyles is a great fellow remarked sidney humorously to edwards one day

isnt he the limit said edwards with a touch of disgust

all the girls are liking him resumed sidney enjoying the conversation and discussion

takes with all the kitchen mechanics and anything else that wears a skirt edwards had dignity a great deal of it wyeth had come now to know he was plainly disgusted sidney went on

has lots of money to spend which makes it exceedingly convenient

hes the luckiest coon in town said edwards thoughtfully

indeed

shoots craps i think

and wins evidently

that wyeth might not gather an adverse opinion of himâor rather a questionable one edwards had informed him that he was connected with a northern philanthropic organization wyeth assumed that he was connected with something of the kind and that he was actually the recipient of plenty of the dispensation

every monday he would go uptown and return with a roll most of this would be spent by the next monday which was unusual

he didnt gamble but better light will be thrown on this later

about a year before there had been committed in attalia a most dastardly murder a man a jew he was had killed a little girl a gentile this murder had occasioned more comment in those sections than had anything in the way of crime for a decade we stated that the jew had killed the girl it should have been said that he was accused of having killed her

this was the state of affairs in regard to the murder at the time of our story notwithstanding the fact that the jew was accused of the murder the charge against him and the public sentiment in particular had reached a very serious stage it would have been very serious for any one to be accused of such a crime in those parts be she gentile jewess or anyone with a white face

the body of this girl had been found in the basement of a factory at which she was employed at a very small wage foully murdered it was a mystery at first as to who was the murderer a negro had been arrested and charged with the crime it appeared that he was surely guilty but he wasntâat least so it was decided shortly afterwards it was confidentially whispered about town to this day and may be for all time that he was a lucky negro too because with the way they treat negroes accused of doing much less serious things in a part of this country he was fortunate to have been accused in attalia where protection is quite ample now and not in some of the smaller placesâbut we are digressing

evidently he was not felt to be guilty and moreover since suspicion was quickly diverted to the jew

and yet he the negro had been discovered in the back yard of the factory washing a bloody shirt such incriminating evidence for some reason the people could not seem to bring themselves to feel that the negro had sense enough to kill the girl had he wished to he was put through a severe examination of some length and finally confessed to having helped the real murderer dispose or try to dispose of the body after it was all over

it was of course duly found and as duly buried it was thereafter exhumed two or three times as evidence for the state the jew was discovered acting very peculiarly a few days after the murder so they had taken him into custody to ascertain the cause of these actions accusations followed and he was in time brought before the high tribunal on a charge of murder convicted and sentenced to be hanged until dead however long that might be the date of execution was set for a day which happened to be the same day a year later than that upon which he was supposed to have committed the deed

thus our story found it

sentencing a man to be hanged and hanging him however are two very different things yet the court persisted it was determined to carry out the decision of the jury of twelve good men and true this jew scion of jacob of israel of solomon and job and others had money at his back plenty of it as we shall see presently and they were spending it lavishly to save his neck which was long perhaps that explains what came to pass later

the counsel for the defense hired a detective a great detective the greatest detective in all the world

no one can deny this since he said so himself at least this is how he was quoted by a paper which for the purpose of this story we shall call the big noise

it was a noise too but to get back to the detective the great detective

the leading papers corroborated the fact that he was the greatest in the world and so he shall be in this story as well we are compelled to quote the big noise

again it claimed very urgently that these papers were paid to corroborate the detective so be it

the leading dailies and the greatest detective in the world got together with a view to obtaining a new trial for the jew after which they hoped of course in some subtle manner to extricate him from his very embarrassing predicament

the detective did the posing and he was some poser and the papers did the rest the most obstinate proposition which they were up against was that the people believed the jew to be guilty but naturally read the papers

now the great detectives picture had been seen by almost everybody who read or ever had read anything so we must appreciate that he was a familiar figure but in addition to what had occurred in regard to the detective more came to pass pages of the sunday edition were devoted to his cut and other pages to his ability as a mystery solver from the way the papers wrote of him and reproduced his pose he made sherlock holmes raffles arsene lupin and even nick carter look like thirty cents with the three invisible

he began in opening the case a series of angles at first of course he viewed it from an attalia angle

forthwith after this he went to chicago and viewed it from a windy angle from st louis he viewed it from a show me angle and while he was out that way he chased across to kansas city and saw it from that angle

and ere anyone was aware of it he had crossed the prairies to denver and viewed it from a mountain angle

behold then upon picking up the morning paper where the great detective has reached new york and was viewing the case from that angle but space will not permit of recording further these many angles indulged in by the greatest detective in the world for the defendant in the case of the state versus the jew

all of these angles were followed with much color by the attalia papers moreover papers elsewhere mysteriously took up the jews cause by following the angles of the detective all except the big noise it was busy viewing the detective from its angle but it was not of course endowed with such an abundance of readers therefore for the time it was not noticed much

it was later however

now we come to the most extraordinary phase of the case leaving the prisoner in his cell for the present

while all this angling was going on witnesses who had testified for the state and whose testimony had resulted disasterously for the defendant began to come up mysteriously with affidavits to the effect that what they had sworn to was a falsehood no a lie many of them declared in these affidavits that they were inspired to make these statements that they might face their god with the truth on their lips the city became chaotic

no one had even suspected that the city possessed such people this renouncing of testimony developed into an almost everyday affair everybody was doin it so it came to pass in an incredibly short time that almost every one who had supplied damaging testimony against the jew had renounced it

the newspapers were the most interesting things to read in attalia during this spell but more mysteries followed in due order every one who produced or had produced an affidavit renouncing his or her previous testimony became automatically prosperous no well have to change this statement they did and again they didnt alas some had not received all they had been mysteriously promised it seems and still others unaccustomed to wealth and feeling that money is rightfully the medium for the good things they had never been able to enjoy including liquor proceeded to fulfill this long felt desire so many got drunk and trust john barleycorn to do the rest they imparted secrets to their near friends and then of course the friends imparted such illuminating information to their friends whereupon it was duly imparted in time to the people through the paper

truth combined with a conscience is always a danger a menace to falsity and of course not every one possesses the strength to stand on a falsehood thereforeâand in an incredibly short timeâaffidavits began to be voluntarily offered by these many to the effect that the renunciation was a falsehood the original testimony was true quite true accompanying many of these latter affidavits was money

we are reminded at this point of judas and the thirty pieces of silver

conspicuous throughout the trial and conducting the prosecution was one doray the solicitor and he was there very much so doray became quite busy about this time he had ambition and was being mentioned for the governorship so the state with its many poor people and slim treasury labored relentlessly in the prosecution while the purse of the jew seemed to have no limit

we return to the great detective the greatest one in all the world

naturally when he began with the reputation he possessed with the notorious angling with hundreds of newspapers all over the country supporting him and from the fact that he had uncovered many dark plots many people took notice a half dozen extra editions was the average per day but some days they reached a dozen all replete with subtle mystery the populace lived in an ecstacy of expectation they were hurdled between so many conflictions until they knew not what they were expecting but as the days went by and the mystery deepened they glared dryeyed at the headlines of the many extras expecting at last that the greatest detective in the world would lead forth a diabolical creature otherwise than the jew declaring and subsequently proving him to be the murderer

he did but he was not a man of mystery

the announcement came in a blazing morning extra

shops were forgotten people gathered upon the streets blocked the corners and everything became a medley of excitement as the news became general

the real murderer of a little innocent girl has been found

the population waited in abated breath in the order in which he had reported or as had been reported by the papers the detective set a day upon which he would point with the forefinger of his right hand straight to the murderer

the day would never come everybody seemed to feel

all the anxiety attendant during the trial before as well as after for it must be understood that the jew had not been seen to kill the girl was lived over again during this spell but at last the mighty day came it was a dark drizzly gloomy forlorn day just the kind for what was now the order in attalia on this day the people now felt the real murderer would be placed in the lime light

the detective had declared a few days after he had been retained and put on the case that the jew was innocent

moreover he declared that the prosecution abetted by public sentiment had been affected in its decision by the worst of all that is inherent in our advanced society race prejudice he lied hereâand knew it there is no prejudice in attalia against any race but one of which we will pass in addition he flaunted in the face of the people the idea of perversion on the part of the jew of which the latter had been accused this accusation had been advanced as the only excuse for the murder of which he stood accused but the real murderer was that day announced as per reports

jim dawkins cried the detective killed that girl

so now free this poor man thou hast persecuted these many months and hang that murderer that beast that pervert for he is guilty

it was some time before the people recovered many of them had to pinch themselves to be quite sure they were awake for it was positively incredible after all this waiting after all this angling after all the mystery that this detective the greatest one in all the world by his own admission and that of the press should come right back to where the case had begun

jim dawkins was the negro accused in the first instance

and now we hear from the big noiseâand it made some noise now moreover the public with a relief from their long tension began to hear it its editor had once run for president on a ticket we cannot recall moreover he had the reputation of being opposed to every man elected to anything in the state and the united states this included the democrats of whom he although a southerner was not one

the people now bought and read his paper with as much eagerness as they had the others in the beginning

the great detective was absent for a week following his sensational discovery  then he returned but alas

the day of angles had become contagious as we shall see presently

following his return he happened to go to a nearby town to view the case from that angle this town happened to have been the home of the murdered girl so when the great detective whirled into town seated in the tonneau of a huge automobile they proceeded at once to entertain him with true southern chivalry  a night extra told all about it before he had returned to attalia which was marvelous when one considers this place was only twenty miles away and from reports the car took its highest speed on the return at least it did in leaving the other town but lest we forget the eggs used at this entertainment could not all have been guaranteed as the freshest and with a few more words we leave this story

shortly after this edwards and smyles took their leave wyeth missed them considerably for he had grown very fond of them about the office when they were far far away the mystery connected with their occupation was still unsolved then one day while sidney was folding up an old newspaper his eye happened to fall upon an article of two paragraphs it related to an incident that cleared up the whole thing and was to the effect that while doing some sleuthing on the ground floor smyles had after refusing to explain the occasion of his mysterious action been arrested and locked up for an hour at the end of which the great detective had come forward and got him out

well ill be blowed exclaimed sidney for it revealed that his two friends were detectives in the employ of the noted chief and hired no doubt to view the case from a dark angle but the most extraordinary part of it all was that their names were not smyles nor edwards either butâi guess it doesnt matter

cause niggass gittin so rich

in the building to the furthest end from where wyeths office was now located he observed a man one day he was standing in front of the bank he was a white man and was tall and slender while his complexion was sandy his hair red and awry his eyes were keen and piercing

a collector thought sidney for there were so many about the building especially on monday and this was the day he lurked in the entry on tuesday when wyeth passed that way must be a contractor the way he is studying the inside of the bank mumbled wyeth as he took the elevator upward

wednesday came gray and gloomy and then it rained

it was four oclock and thirty minutes in the afternoon

sidney passed through the entry to the elevator on his way to the office of dickson and again the man stood there he had drawn no conclusion as to what was the occasion of this presence when from behind came a sound he did something else then so did others about him

throw up your hands nigger and get into that vault came a command

it was from the man he had seen and he was holding up the bank

there was a silence followed by a scuffle then a lull and a shot and still laterâfor the shot went wild landing in the ceiling where it cracked the plastering and made bits of it fall upon a score of frightened negroesâa thud this had not gone amiss there was a groan and a dull sound as some one sank to the floor

this part was witnessed by wyeth and others it was the teller and the son of the banks president on the floor he lay bleeding while the other was standing frightened over him then he looked up openmouthed like dumb creatures negros of all shades including the green stood about and then the man seemed to awaken to the emergency and the danger

those negroes would not be dumb for all time he sensed this aright and then he took initiative action

with a flash he fired off the huge gun and with a leap and a bound he came forth while negroes black and brown yellow and green and some white fell back upon each other in a hurry he had plenty of room for a time and made use of it out into the hallway he must perforce come on his way to the street and freedom he started but one little moment he hesitated then firing again he made his great rush through the hallway he dashed and entered the street through a side door that was open before him a moment later he was gone

but so were the others

they were led by a barber who shaved black faces next door he was a mulatto with a flat nose which made his appearance grotesque with a roar like that of a mad guerilla he ran in hot pursuit away they went all of them now including wyeth

the barber led the others by far and in his hand open for action was a razor it seemed quite large to wyeth as it glistened in the sunlight for the day had cleared perhaps he was seeing double but he followed while the victimâwhich we shall call the otherâpreceded the other only slightly the barber was breaking wind now but gaining nevertheless

as wyeth followed in that dark pursuit a picture of the possible consequences rose before him this negro scion of two races embittered by an instance in our history that will never die was wild blood blue blood it was he thirsted all the hatred of a thousand or more years was now privileged by the unwritten law to give vent this other has attempted crimeâthe robbery of the peoples wherewithall to kill him now was to get revenge revenge upon those who have long since diedâ and go scott free

perhaps the other appreciated this point of view

he rushed pellmell wildly through the street he came into and turned at the end up another that led whither he did not take time to think or to consider it seemed impossible for the man to escape dire consequences as sidney wyeth saw him now he wished he could save him but he did not know how only a few steps ahead the culprit led the other it was only a question of minutesâa minute and thenâhorrors

up this new street which happened to be herald they went and closer and closer the negro came to the victim

he was breaking wind fearfully a block had been covered when ahead to the left stood a laundry with doors wide open then suddenly when abreast of it the victim plunged into it but so did the barber others followed and workers fell back amazed to the rear the chase led and then lo a brick wall faced the victim with a closed door only this door could not be opened in time that appeared to settle it the poor creature frightened out of his wits fell to the floor and then rose to one knee with hands stretched heavenward at last the end had come the negro now the picture of which our pen cannot describe stood over him with razor upraised and eyes dancing with murder like huge coals of fire dont cut me with that razor mister the victim whimpered he pushed the other back until he was against the door for the first time in his life sidney wyeth was to see a man killed one moment he looked

the sunlight played through a transom window falling strangely upon the blade of that poised razor he closed his eyes to shut out the fearful sight the next moment he opened them as he heard a noiseâa momentous instant it was the opening of the door against which the victim had been pushed

a moment later the two went over the steps atumble below but the razor had flown in a direction which they had not gone and the tension was relieved

soon the victim emerged from the rear and another chase began but the razored negro was then far to the rear he eluded his pursuers for a moment during the mixup but suddenly in chorus they cried dere e goes cetch im

the crowd had now grown to a mob a sullen mob

they cried out in loud tones for blood blue blood but the culprit was illusive a street car was passing and into it he vaulted ive shot a coon he cried and the niggers are after me the car lunged forward as the mob reached the door whereupon they looked into the muzzle of a revolver held in the hand of the conductor as he commanded stand back they did but ere he had gone far there came to his ears from the crowd in the rear  s robbed d bank  es robbed d bank

the conductor immediately rang to stop the victim rang to go forward the motorman obeyed the former and the car slowed down the victim leaped off before it came to a halt while at the rear the mob howling like a bunch of savages came on in mad fury

then he tore across the street to where an old man with bent shoulders and flowing white beard sat half asleep in a buggy he rushed to the side of this and permitted the old relic to smell the muzzle as he cried unload the old man did in a pile the victim jumped in and jerking the whip from the socket brought the old horse half asleep also to appreciate the state of affairs by dealing him a blow that made his tail stick out as his legs speeded up the street the crowd roared diabolically as they saw themselves being left to the rear but many on bicycles gave chase and followed in close pursuit he suddenly drew his revolver and let go the trigger which made a flash point blank in their midst that settled it one fell to the street with a sad sickening cry an arm limp at his side the others gave up turned back and quickly went the other way

and then he disappeared

wyeth had returned to the scene of the openingâso had the rest and the crowd combined with those who had gathered about the bank in the meantime filled audubon avenue the entire length of the building a block and a half on the side all was uproar report followed report and each flashed through the crowd with much comment he had so the news ran been captured here and everywhere as it stood he had not been captured at all opinions expressions conclusions and rejections were in order on all sides one was to the effect that the big banks uptown conducted by whi fokes had conspired the deal on account of fear  cause niggas s agittin so rich n apositn they money in the cullud bank ontell dem whi fokes done trigued and got dat low down po whi man t come and tri t frustrate us spectable cullud fokes and again there came to the ears of sidney another report and this was one of graver concern

robbers roun astealind money gon be fus one dare in d mawnint draw mine out

gwan you fool nigga yu ain got nothin in dere n yu aut abe run outta town fo talkin lak dat

 who dat obber dare da whi man dressed so maculete wi du soft hat

dats judson d porter on d jounal

who dat udder one wi a big nose n dark plection

ain you ebber been rested nigga n up afo jedge lyls n seen im ahangin roun dats jempsy d putective

lisn lisn wha dat dey has captured im

forthwith to another point they rushed through a bunch collected around the barber who was then telling and retelling  ow close ah come n gittin im

it was not a report this time but the ambulance that was taking the wounded teller to his home the sight of him with bandaged head as a result of the attempt served to renew the local race animosity

ah shos gon kill me a whi man so elp me jaysus

muttered a dinge as the carriage passed him by while all about dark faces scowled ominously

darkness was approaching when an authentic report came at last to the ears of the crowd the wouldbe robber had really been captured and it was the papers that gave forth the news

his name so he said was rhynata a vaudevillain

who hailed from denver his capture had been thus when he had eluded the mob by holding up the old man for his horse and buggy he followed that street for only a block when he turned into another after the crowd was lost he left the buggy and walked hurriedly up the street turned a corner and disappeared in the basement of a house

a plainclothes man some while later happened to pass that way in trying to locate him and followed him therein when he got to the second story he came into a room where a woman was bathing with a damp towel the head of a man in bed he backed up begging pardon and turned to leave as he was passing a dresser in a half open drawer his eye espied a revolver which his hand forthwith touched the barrel was warm which told the rest of the story

the settlement began the next day before judge loyal

his court room was filled that day but the greatest crowd was outside the man was duly identified as the culprit by many including the negro with the razor was as duly bound over under a bond that no one cared to go and a few months later was brought to trial convicted on two charges and subsequently sent to the chain gang for five years

he should have much of that yet to serve but he escapedârather he walked away a few months later and has not been intercepted at the time of this writingâ but this is not our story

and then came slim wintertime had flown and over all the country springtime had blossomed on one of those beautiful days slim came to the office of sidney wyeth his real name was v r coleman but since he was so tall and slender to wyeth slim seemed more appropriate particularly when the other did not object this name however was applied sometime later and not on this particular day

in dixie there are many original characters and this has made it the source of humor undoubtedly the negro is the background of most of it and justly plays the part conspicuous among these original characters there is a particular class of men who will work from the time frost falls in november until the birds sing again in the last days of march when the smell of the honeysuckle and the buzz of the bee become a part of the day they succumb to an inevitable longing to mingle and become human bees themselves so by the time may has arrived and spring chickens are large enough to fry they go forth to the open choosing many varied waysâ but always an easy oneâof living until the leaves begin to fall again

most of these men preach for since the beginning of the present order this has been the easiest way no learning of course is required so long as they can spell ligon and preach dry bones of course if the character is a good feeler with the magnetism sufficient eloquence and a severe frown with it he gets by much easier conditions it must be observed are changing even in dixie and it is a fact that a negro preacher is beginning to pay for a meal occasionally

you certainly did fill brookville with it i must say he admitted

wyeth smiled

wish you hadnt worked that neighborhood though he said regretfully

others are yet to be worked   

but i know everybody in that neighborhood

so do iânow

slim laughed a low sorrowful laugh and then was thoughtful then he inquired what comission do you pay

forty per cent sixty cents the book

do i have to pay for the books before i can have them to deliver

i can of course trust you professor wyeth replied but the last one i trusted and who took eighteen copies out for the purpose of delivery has not shown up since

indeed did he send the books back or leave them somewhere

he left them somewhereâseveral wheres

then youâahâgot them back

not yet

but you will

not likely the people he left them with paid him  a copy therefor but i have charged that to the dust and it has rained since you think over this proposition and come back tomorrow morning and we will get down to business should you decide to take it up i shall be glad to have you accompany me an afternoon and hear me spiel it

the following morning full of book selling slim was on hand moreover he wished to begin that morning but as sidney had made no arrangement to that end he was compelled to wait until the afternoon

i used to sell books in south carolina he said later as he was looking through the book

you have had some experience then commented wyeth

wait until i commence ill show you a thing or two

oh i have a hunch youll clean up  said wyeth with feigned admiration

you sold a book to somebody i know on fourteenth street    he smiled

i thought you said i sold to many you know i think i did said wyeth innocently

i know this one a little better than the rest he admitted now showing his teeth despite his effort to keep his upper lip stiff

ohâho i see now laughed wyeth good naturedly

after a pause he said who is she come fess up at what number does she work but at this slim only laughed and left his friend curious

that afternoon at two oclock sharp they sallied forth going to dalton street they entered a cafe conducted by some people in the last stage of hookworm hustle

whatll you genamens have asked the waitress who looked so tired and sleepy

sidney scanned the greasy billoffare while slim inquired what have you as she drawled out the list sidneys ears came attentive to the orders being given by others

snout

 yos mistah

pig tail n swee taters

n yos

stewed haid

ah wan some magetti sang a small boy on a stool with papers under his arm

gimme a yeah sanrich from one with a very loud mouth

slim was very hard to please as it now appeared and was having some difficulty in being satisfied

what is your specialty here

ah don tole you du olulahs already we has hog year n hog snoot n pig tail n collap greens nâ

give us a pair of feet interposed wyeth

after the meal they turned into a side street crossed a back yard and entered a house from the rear ahead a flight of steps led up through the basement to the kitchen up this they went and rapped on the kitchen door it was opened by a woman presumably the cook

wyeth raised his hat while slim did likewise whereupon she was very much flattered said wyeth yes maam howdoyoudo you will pardon our interrupting you but i suppose you are the lady employed herein and gazed into the kitchen before him

yes she replied embarrassed i work here

very well thank you then turning he revealed his honor bending almost to the floor this is professor coleman their prospective customer was very profuse as she accepted the introduction and then was curious to know to whom she was indebted presently unable to withstand the wait she inquired are you preachers

wyeth looked at slim who had his hat rolled up and was showing his teeth then turned back to the lady and replied that they were not he then without further ado began his spiel putting more dynamite into it than usual since he wished to make an impression upon slim as well

i presume from your english madam that you are literarily inclined in fact i feel certain you are he bestowed upon her a hypnotic smile which he had cultivated for the purpose of impression and then went on with eloquence this is the tempest a tale of the great northwest in which we follow the fortunes of this young man and he showed his picture on the frontispiece in this same picture people seldom recognized himself as the hero

before long he had her order and a half dozen more and slim was enthusiastic when they were on the street for a time again slim said with much admiration man but you are a salesman the spiel and look you turn on these cooks and maids and house girls and everybody is guaranteed to make the dead take notice

i can never get over laughing when i think of the old lady back there the one who said i am not decided yet as to whether i shall take it then you said and as serious as she was let me decide for you in this 

and then he gave up to laughter for some minutes

think you can learn it said sidney

i want you to let me take this house said slim halting before an imposing structure

all right said wyeth ill wait for you dont get struck on the house girl and stay too long

slim disappeared a moment later a noise and the barking of a vicious dog came to wyeths ears accompanied immediately by a scuffling a moment later slim emerged from the back way in very much of a hurry with a bull dog in close pursuit when he was safe outside once more he looked about him dubiously

i dont like this neighborhood he said

you mean that neighborhood laughed wyeth did you make a sale

make hell cried slim still breathing heavily from his nervousness talk about making a sale with a bull dog barking at my heels they had by then reached a street that led across town and they turned into this wyeth took a few orders but slim decided to dispense with further canvassing until the morrow

several times wyeth tried to steer him into a yard but always he observed that his eye wandered around toward the rear and since nearly every one kept some kind of a dogâthe most of which would rather play than anything elseâit was hard to reconcile slim

at last he managed to get him through a gate that was close to the rear door and while he explained his mission to the cook slim gave the house girl a good talk but she smiled on him and said i purchased one from the other gentleman already

this served to relieve him at least and also encouraged him to a more concentrated effort later

when they returned to the office slim was again full of the book business the next day he went out for himself after a few houses had been made however he must have met another sociable dog for shortly afterward wyeth saw him depart

that afternoon when they met again at the office he was surprised to learn that slim had taken several names and was in the highest of spirits wyeth was too but from other causes he had taken about eight orders when he came into a back yard from an alley through a screen he caught a glimpse of a girl working in the kitchen he approached the house and presently knocked on the door she opened it with an inquiry he looked up into her face from where he stood on the ground

she looked down into his and blushed as she looked away she made an impression and he was for a moment lost in a maze of delight soon he was serious however and said he wished to speak with her on important business this was his style he had observed that agents the minute a door was opened began a spiel without getting the attention of the prospective customer so he made it a practice to get their attention first and leave them in doubt until he did before disclosing his business if he failed to do this he usually went his way without letting them know what he was selling

but to get back to the girl

she declared that she was very busy at the time but would be glad if hed come back shortly  in about an hour she advised as she watched him walk toward the gate he went his way with a subtle swimming of the head

he passed the next hour mechanically made several sales of which he was hardly aware and at the end of the hour he returned she was waiting for him he smothered his interest and told her the story in brief

oh thats fine she exclaimed in an ecstasy of delight when he had finished when do you deliver

any time he replied but i have several in this neighborhood for the first could you take yours then

as he finished he looked at her strangely his thoughts went back to a place and a person he had almost forgotten  she looked back at him smiled became uneasy apparently she did not know how to take him then she asked softly why do you look at me like that

and then he came out of it and replied candidly i dont know he started to say because you remind me of one i once knewâand loved the very thought of it however now pained him however he dismissed these thoughts from his mind and was normal again

she appeared as though she would like to say more on the subject but instead she added have you been selling the book long

ever since publication he admitted frankly

the past lingered with him for some time but it was temporarily forgotten when he had returned to the office and noted slims success

youre there professor he beamed while the other assumed an air of modesty

a few days laterâand he was apparently successful in the meantimeâslim said to wyeth i want you to go with me tomorrow ive found a nest 

a hornet nest asked wyeth humorously slim looked uncomfortable he had a good memory

im serious out there around the colleges man are some of the finest people you ever met and rich they own homes that will open your eyes

mm are these orders from them or have they told you they would think it over and you could drop in when you were in the neighborhood again slims face fell for a moment then he said while wyeth thought he detected something

these orders are from good people in and around that neighborhood he paused for a spell and resumed with a frown i have been thinking very seriously that you could do much better among the people in their homes and wouldnt need to go snoopin around to the rear

i must confess mr wyeth that i have never been overly anxious to confine the most of my work to domestics as you seem to choose

again sidney smiled while slim paused disconcertedly

now this list i have here should convince you that you have simply been overlooking the best people for the kitchens so if you will go along with me tomorrow i will convince you to your own satisfaction

wyeth kept out of going with slim in different ways and ere long the day of slims first big delivery came

only about forty copies of the book were on hand in the office but more were at the freight house with the billoflading at the bank and a sight draft attached for the cost of the books sidney did not have the amount available to pay it on that day he reckoned however that the number on hand should have been sufficient but slim didnt think so he was moreover insistent to a point that moved sidney to make effort to get the others out

i think we have books sufficient for todays delivery slim he argued and then monday we will get those at the freight office

it isnt business it isnt business i have taken these peoples orders for this book to be delivered today

there are fifty i have promised faithfully to bring the book this day and when i was in business i did a thing when i promised so i wish you would get the books you have at the freight office down here at once so that i can fill every order and have no disappointments

wyeth looked distressed but smiled all to himself

if he had learned anything about selling books to colored people and had forty copies to fill fifty orders he could figure on having a goodly supply left but slim must have fifty copies or a book for each order

the books he had at the freight office would cost a pretty sum to get and he did not have the amount convenient he went to the bank and borrowed it slim went with him to the freight office to be sure there would be no failure he must have fifty books

when they arrived sidney was chagrined to find he had one dollar less than it took to get them it was only fifteen minutes before the office would close its being saturday sidney was up against it slim was in a stew he deluged the other with why didnt you get them yesterday or you should have known this office closes at twelve oclock today and in the end he gave up entirely wyeth employed his mind vigorously hoping to raise a dollar in fifteen minutes

theres no use deplored slim hopelessly i will lose  or  through your business carelessness just then sidney observed a drayman coming toward the freight house a thought struck him and he hailed the drayman in a few words he explained the circumstances while the other nodded acquiescence pulled out a dollar and a half hour later the books were unloaded at the office

slim breathed a sigh of intense relief he was a business man and told wyeth so

wyeth admitted it glad to be affiliated with a gentleman of your ability and you know it professor

you will always find me right up to the point in business mr wyeth thats always been my reputation and if you dont believe me you can go over in south carolina and find out from the people there yourself he said very serious of demeanor

thats all right professor ill take your word for it

at one oclock p m slim was ready he had a cab hired for the occasion and with fifty nice clean copies wrapped deftly at the publishing house before shipment he sallied forth

wyeth was nodding in the office when about ten oclock that night he heard some one coming up the stair

from the way he halted at intervals and set something down he judged he must be carrying a load

he was

presently the person reached the landing and halting again dropped something heavy then breathed long and deeply a moment later he heard him pick up whatever it was and come on toward his door it was burst open in a moment and some one stumbled in behind a big package

it was slim he dropped the package as soon as he was inside with an air of disgust and fell apparently exhausted into a chair he was silent while he got his breath when this had become regular he got up and moved to the desk where he figured for some time

wyeth remained silent but quietly expectant it came presently

liars dirty liars stinking low down dirty lying niggas damn all of them damn them

wyeth was still silent slim looked about himself wearily and then did some more figuring presently wyeth heard him again

lying niggas onry niggas doggone the bunch

wyeth was impatient he wanted to ask very innocently what the matter was suddenly he saw slim looking at him savagely wyeth made an effort to look innocent and not burst out laughing after awhile he heard slim again

im done im through selling books to negroes now he then arose and strode back and forth across the room in a terrible temper

wyeth started to say you mean you are through getting orders but he waited

the first old nigga i come up to looked up when he saw me and then just laffed keha then when i held the book toward him he said yu betta gwan way frum heh wi dat book and then just laffed again like it was something so funny i got mad right then but kept my temper and said

 whats the matter with you didnt you order this book from me two weeks ago   he paused at this stage and looked at wyeth again with a savage glare but that old devil just kept on laffing like a vaudeville show was before him instead of me with the book he had ordered and which he told me to be sure sure to bring today my nigga was rising now but just then i heard a little halfnaked kid uh misteh oo mights well ferget it cause th ole man there pointing to the old sinner orders sumpin from eve agent what comes long puvidin i don cos nuthin t give th odah and all the time that old coon was just laffing keha 

he gave wyeth another glare and went on the next one i come onto looked at the book as though it was something dangerous and then he squints up at meâi think he must have been nearsightedâand says sah i decided since i give you that odah that i want gon take th book when he saw my eyes he could see i was mad enough to kill him on the spot

he saw danger in them too because nearsighted or not he began edging away but again i held back my nigga and says what in hell you mean by making up your mind like that  he must have been drinking sparrow gin when he gave you that order suggested wyeth with a twinkle of the eye

what inquired slim listening

id advise you to take along a little corn liquor the next time you go to deliver pour a little juice into them get them drunk theyll take their books then

slim kicked a piece of paper on the floor before him viciously and said ill take along a club and knock their lying heads off their shoulders s what ill do

did you have enough books inquired wyeth ignoring the big package slim had brought in

you seem possessed with no sympathy mr wyeth

he complained and then grew thoughtful presently seeming anxious to tell more of his experiences he went on one woman i had an order from when i knocked on the door she opened it and said im so sorry but my husband wont let me take that book and then she handed me a nickel saying so im going to give you this for your trouble i could not of course be ugly as much as i felt like it but i had to say something

so i inquired as kind as i could under the circumstances what am i to do with this she looked distressed at first then brightened with a thought and replied as though she were doing something wonderful why you can use it for car fare you wont have to walk back 

shoo fly

wyeth had not been able as yet to awaken much literary interest among his people in the south but he had a great many agents working all over the north of those he had secured in dixie he was deluged with complaints to the effect that so many people failed to take the books they ordered so he began shipping only fifteen when an agent sent in an order for thirty books

this worked better and the office was not the recipient of so many complaints thereafter

as for slim he went with the cook on fourteenth street ate two meals there out of every three and canvassed whenever he felt so disposed he had some cards made only one hundred four hundred more would have cost but little additional he handed them about advertising that he would conduct a singing class at his residence beginning any time any one wished lessons

he was successful in delivering more books when he returned to work among the domestics but not so many that at any time afterwards was wyeth put to such strenuous efforts to secure books in order that he might have one for every customer

when the colleges had closed for vacation wyeth hired the matron to work in the office and upon finding her very interesting slim became more in evidence about the office

just about this time the auditorium was completed which was begun two years before by the lodge of which b j dickson was the secretary it was decided to ask the head of tuscola the great negro educator to speak at the dedication services he was secured and this fact caused thousands to gather for the occasion it gave wyeth an opportunity to hear the noted negro for the second time in his life the first being twelve years before in chicago

the day came at last it rained in the forenoon but was calm and clear in the afternoon the night was fit and the mammoth place was filled to overflowing while thousands unable to gain admittance loafed outside where they were entertained by a band that served to keep them quiet for dickson fully acquainted with his own race was aware that they would disturb the speaker if some diversion was not resorted to for their amusement

the speaker looked very tired and worn and wyeth felt a pang at his heart when he saw him his years of service were beginning to tell upon him he had returned recently from the west where he had gone for the purpose of raising  for his school and had as he did in everything else succeeded beyond requirements he was not only an educator but a practical business man as well to one who sat near him sidney wyeth said that evening and no one of these odd ten millions is competent in the publics favor to take that old mans place when eventually he will be called the other sighed as he made reply there are many though who feel that they and not he should be in the confidence of the world and have wasted themselves in uselessness and inactivity as a result of their imagination the speakers eyes at the distance wyeth saw them seemed dazed and his voice was strained but he did not soon forget the words he spoke to those black people in dedication of an instant that had been inspired by his work b j dickson came in for a worthy praise which wyeth knew he justly deserved

it was some two weeks afterwards that a convention was held which brought together a class of men who were largely leaders of this race they were the doctors the dentists the pharmacists and all men connected with physical and surgical dispensation and they came from two adjoining states also sidney wyeth had therefore opportunity to see his own people from a professional point of view and was cheered to observe the most refined set of men of his own kin that he had ever seen dickson thought so too and wrote as much in the independent the following week but he wrote of something else connected with the same men and served to show sidney wyeth something he did not know could not have believed but dickson made it plain to the thousands of readers of the independent of which wyeth was a constant reader

in the building conspicuously located on the best corner was a drug store acknowledged to be the finest drug store operated by black people in the south the new building included a street front on another side street the drug store and many other trades on the ground space with a row of offices to the number of about twentyfive especially fitted for physicians and dentists all these encircled the auditorium and were regarded as the most artistic arrangement in the building

moreover this was advantageous in many ways at all events it happened to be convenient for the men gathered on the occasion referred to in addition to being used as a gathering place this auditorium could be conveniently cleared for the purpose of dancing and was employed for that purpose on the night the convention closed and this was what b j dickson wrote in the following weeks issue of the independent color line drawn at physicians ball last week there was held in attalia the annual convention of the tristate medical association as was stated in last weeks issue of the independent never before has this city been graced by a more refined and obviously intelligent class of colored men from all over the state and the two states adjoining which are members of the league came physicians surgeons dentists and pharmacists representing the highest body of men in the negro race they were entertained in sumptuous splendor by the same profession of men in attalia

this was facilitated by the fact that the new buildings and the auditorium were employed for the occasion and the members were not compelled as they had been in the past to house their social function in some old deserted hall in a deserted part of the city

it is therefore with deep regret that we are called by the bond of common sense and race appreciation to mention a narrowness that prevaded this great occasion

it may be recalled when the leader of our race spoke at the dedication a few weeks past that on the committee were numerous doctors some of them successful leaders and some who were not yet it is and always has been the custom of our people to honor these men in the best way we can for we have long since come to appreciate that they are a part and an important part of this new dispensation surely it is in order and keeping with the uplift of black people to help men whose training has fitted them for such an important place that perhaps is why their conduct of last week has constrained us to make this mention

they drew the color line plainly and irrevocably

at the ball at the stag party and during the entire proceedings of the convention not a black person save oneâthe wife of one of the local physicians who married her for moneyâwas invited such an example shocks us so to speak it seems incredible in view of the condition of our race both morally and mentally and still though we have forced our pen to ignore it it has been and is shown right along at the ball not only was the color line drawn but a white orchestra gave the music

imagine such a spectacle in the bourbon and always democratic south our people hiring a white orchestra at a fabulous sum for since long before we were free negroes have made music for the richest white people to dance by

surely the old order changeth

negro doctors live by the patronage of their race positively the white people would not hire one to doctor a dog in the dark ages when it was felt that a negro was incompetent for anything else but to act as a slave some excuse could be given for negroes to hire white doctors but today all race loving people give their practice to their own except those who are nearly white and wish they were but more than half of those at the ball have white doctors and wouldnt hire one of those with whom they danced but negro doctors expect negro practice and deplore it terribly when negroes hire white physicians on the heels of this too they say shoo fly to negro musicians who are competent to play for the whites but not for negro doctors like everything else that relates to our peopleâexcept their moneyâour professionals wrinkle their faces and conclude without trial that no negro orchestra is properly trained to play for their balls and negroes who conduct newspapers do not know enough to write a part of what they read books of negro authors are not read by them because they dont know enoughâin the minds of these hypocritesâand so it goes in everything they could not have held their convention in the white auditorium even if permitted to because that would have cost more than they were able to pay

now if negro orchestras are incompetent as musicians and are therefore relegated to the rear and a white orchestra is hired to give music and if negroes as authors and editors do not know enough to write a part of what they should read and moreover if negroes who happen not to be the scion of some white man and therefore possessed of a yellow face are not good enough to mingle and associate with them then the negro doctors are not fit to kill us why not let the white man do this

admitting that the white orchestra and the white editor and author have more advantages than do the negroes in the same vocation is it not credible that the same applies in regard to the doctors is it not to be appreciated that while the white man often and mostly the son of a rich parent is taking a postgraduate course abroad the poor negro boy is slinging hash in a cheap hotelâmost of the best ones hire white help nowâto get the wherewith to go back and finish school

oh we have thought this brave in our people these many years and our very hearts and souls and sympathies have been with them in this great effort

and we are repaid in these terms

the blackskinned people who pay them their hardearned money that we might have a representative set of men as our leaders have been scorned for their pains

they the doctors set up what they silently look upon as society  blueveined people  how they must deplore that they are colored in a literal sense we are the best people they cry the insurance companies started and led to their present position of success by black men use every means subtle and otherwise to throw business to these men likewise do the lodges

and with all that not more than a dozen or so are making a decent living in attalia we are still very poor people

yet when society comes before us the black ones are not good enough to play for we must close it makes us sick

why do you look at me so strangely

the first books came and among the many o ders to be delivered was one for the girl who had reminded wyeth of a person who now belonged to a closed chapter of his life he carried her the book

my madam has not paid me yet she said regretfully but if you can bring it back next week i will be delighted to take it

he did so and she was as good as her word i hope i shall enjoy it she said as she paid him

i hope so too said he practically all i have sold to told me that they liked it he added he looked at her and while he was not aware of it in that moment he had an insane desire the past and the one connected with it rose for one brief se ond before him as he had known it she noted the strange look and was embarrassed presently she recovered from the effect it had and said why do you look at me so strangely

i dont know he replied noncommittally

she did not understand it but blushed as she said you are indeed a strange person  i have thought about it more than once since you were here and took my order do you look at all your lady customers like that she looked full into his eyes as she said this but what she saw there made her hastily retract

i was only joking you are singularâstrange andâi do not know what to think of you but you are more than an ordinary agent for the book im sure of that he remained silent she looked keenly at the picture and then at him a small mustache and a different style in the trimming of his hair but she inquired suddenly did you write this book the picture resembles you he looked innocent and said do you think so

indeed i do she insisted then you wrote it

oh no indeed he lied earnestly

she appeared dubious and then said thoughtfully maybe you have some private reasons for not wishing to be identified as the author but i feel positive that you are she smiled appreciatively for a moment as she surveyed him carefully  i think you must be smart and know a great deal to be able to write such a big book i shall always recall with pleasure that i had the honorâthough he did not acknowledge the factâof meeting a real author she extended her hand which he took as she said i am glad to have met you and if you write another book please try to remember that i would like to have a copy of it goodbye

slim was lolling in the office when sidney returned

mrs lautier the clerk and exmatron found him very much to her humor as did sidney and he was appreciated in the capacity of mirth

well he said cheerfully im doing a little better now delivered six copies today and almost took wyeths breath away by handing him 

say he cried suddenly when they had settled up

 i happened upon something today in which i am deeply interested and have been very anxious to tell you he lowered his voice to a whisper while sidney looked surprised but listened

its a grocery stock that can be bought at a bargain

well   

a chance for you and me to get in right  

what do you mean

well buy it

but i am not in the grocery business books

but you are out to make money

i dont gather what you want or expect me to do

well ill explain he seated himself comfortably and then went on in that low tone of voice a fellow is in partnership with another who is up against it for cash and offers to sell his share which is a half interest at a bargain he paused again briefly and then went on  i as you know having recently quit working in a grocery naturally know all about the conducting of one

wyeth nodded understandingly and remained silent and patient

i see in this thing the chance i have been waiting for and am ready to consider it favorably big money is to be made can be made out of it for me and i can at the same time and in the same enterprise become a man of affairs

mm breathed his listener how do you propose to conduct it

well artfully first it should of course be incorporated and then a competent manager and treasurer are necessary

mm do you propose to increase the present stock

not at once i think the stock as it stands at the present is quite sufficient to care for the trade which i have observed is good

mm

i thought as a favor i would tell you and give you a chance you could put in an equal share along with myself which would give you a fourth interest and you could become vice president

i suppose you will of course quit selling books should you take over the affairs of thisâerâcorporation said wyeth with well feigned regret

well said the other meditatively i have not fully decided as yet it depends largely upon whether you can be brought to see the great advantage you would gain by coming in

but what little i representâwhich surely isnt muchâis tied up in the book business how much will this thing cost slim winked wisely held his head low and whispered it into his ear

twentyfive dollars

ill think it over said wyeth feigning seriousness

the next day slim had forgotten all about the grocery business but tore into the office in an ecstasy of delight and secrecy he had discovered something else it was a soda fountain rather it was some old fixtures when the drug store below had been moved into the new building they had stored their old fixtures in an empty store room near the same had been vacant for ten years but slim happened by and saw a grand opportunity at a glance

he told this to sidney with much feeling its the greatest proposition of a decade we can buy those fixtures for a song rent the place they are in cheap move the office up there and conduct a book store and soda fountain in connection his eyes opened wide as he revealed the magnitude of the proposition

cant do it slim its too big guess ill have to stick to books the other took on a disappointed expression

its the chance of a life time he said with plain regret and continued to look the part i thought you were down here to make money and when i go out and find something thats an eldorado i cannot enlist you

you are making a serious mistake and will regret it some day

that was all for that day but the next day he was mysterious he didnt however put wyeth next to this but on the quiet he met others on the street below where at some length they discussed a restaurant and hotel business to be duly incorporated and an office and a management to be appointed mrs lautier made known to wyeth the inner secrets of this the next day

im certainly disappointed in you mr wyeth said slim one day soon after very grievously

hows that professor inquired the other with assumed concern

you never seem to consider seriously the many good propositions i have discovered and have offered to you for investment

do you yourself

i could make a bunch of money if you would come in he repeated artfully but ignored the direct question

the next day he was more artful than ever he was indeed full of another proposition he smiled as he told his friend

im going to marry that woman out there he said low and confidentially

on fourteenth the other echoed cheerfully returning a sincere smile thats where youre a man

thatll sure be dandy when

oh not yet awhile not until i get a divorce from the last one

ohâthen mm so youve been married already rather you are

i have never told you much of my past life except from a business point have i he smiled naively and taking a chair he became seated placed his feet in the window and proceeded to narrate a part of his past

ive been married twice he began

oh twice    yes my first wife died we lived on a farm in south carolina and were as happy a couple as you ever knew i owned a twohorse farm and raised plenty of cotton and corn and some hogs while my wife raised plenty of chickens and garden truck we had two boys whom i kept in school in town during the winter and then after my crops were laid by my wife looked after the place while i went out and sold song books and pictures and preached

then youre a preacher too said wyeth when he paused a moment  i didnt think you were a preacher

he continued looking him over

well not altogether i preach sometimes but not much since i married the last woman

hows that

to tell you the truth that woman almost made me lose my religion she was such a devil

wyeth was silent but attentive slim went on

didnt you meet my brother he was here not long ago i had him up here in the office you might have seen him about the building here you could not have mistaken him for any one else if you had seen him

does he look like you

lord no slim exclaimed with a laugh not at all and you would not have believed it but ten years ago he was as spare as i am then he went to preaching and since then he has become the fattest thing you ever saw

wyeth smiled naively coleman proceeded with his interrupted narrative

well getting back to that woman i married her four months after my first wife died and took her to live in the same house we got along less than three weeks in peace then things began to warm up she was a devil if there ever was one on top of the earth but i persisted faithfully his appearance was now very pious the first big row we had was on sunday it was in the morning and i with my bible under my arm was starting to church she didnt want to go that day and had tried to keep me from going but i always led the prayer and preached during the pastors absence so as i was saying i was starting for church when i passed a room in which she had enclosed herself to pout she suddenly opened it and hit me in the side with a big rock if it had not struck the bible i think i would have been hurt seriously but it hit the book and my arm and rolled upon the floor

well after that the devil was to pay she kept me in hell and hot water and we got along like a cat and a dog each day from sunrise until long after it had set i asked jesus whether i could hold out to the end i had declared to his holy name that i had taken that woman to live with for better or for worse but surely i was getting the worst of it and then at last it came to the point when it was beyond human endurance she took to shooting at me for the fun of it

good lord exclaimed wyeth you dont mean to say that she shot at you

no he replied calmly she didnt shoot at me she shot at me and not once but any old time she felt like it which was more than once by many many times he soliloquized grimly

good night

yes she shot at me as though it were no more than throwing hot water on a bunch of rats save me jesus

then one day i shot at her

hush

yes i shot at her and tried to hit but i am thankful the good lord was with us both against ourselves i missed i think i was too much excited

deliver me

it was a few days after we had had a big row for sure and she had declared she would kill me

wyeth looked helpless slim smiled grimly and went on it was about my first wife i had an enlarged picture of her that hung on the wall and this devil had been eyeing it with apparent disfavor that day she stood directly under it looking up at it with a double ax concealed in her skirt i knew she had the ax and watched her i swore to myself that the day of pentecost had come if she touched my dead wifes picture i would kill her on the spot

be merciful coleman

yes yes he said in a terrible voice i would have done so too you can bet your last dollar on that

she kept looking up at it and muttering in a low tone i heard her say ive a notion to tear you to pieces i decided that i would tell her and in so doing give her one chance a last chance to continue life in this world so i said woman woman if you touch that picture get ready to die for just as sure as im a nigga im going to put your lights out those were terrible days terrible days he sighed wearily and for the first time since wyeth had known him he felt a pang of sorrow for him he was serious presently he resumed she went out without a wordâshe was always dangerous when she said nothingâand returned presently with a brand new great big pistol and without a word she began shooting she and i then had it she with the gun and me arunning while she pulled the trigger and run me all over that farm

after this i armed myself and got ready i took the children to my mother sold off the stock and everything else but the furniture i asked the lord to spare my life and not let one of those bullets from that gun she always carried push daylight through me and i would try to fulfill my promise gods will be done i offered her half if she wanted to quit but she didnt no after she had shot at me and scared me out of my wits she was ready for me to take her in my arms

for awhile things became a little better but suddenly she went off halfcock and pulled the trigger of that big gun on me again then she got her surprise i had a gun too she had a smith and wesson and i had a lefthand wheeler kidoi kidoi my old gun barked and the magazine would whirl around cleverly automatically she stood frozen to the spot for a minute then taking fright she dropped hers and flew with me right after her shooting that old cannon at every leap

across the country we went i loaded and emptied it a half dozen times and shot away twentyfive shells i shot at everything in sight

after that i finished selling out and went to arkansas where i was getting along all right until i was fool enough to let her come to me again we got along very well for a time but she got to cocking her pistol where and when i could hear it so i set out again just lately she came to brookville and went to raising cain trying to force me to take care of her so as you see she made me quit there and thus you see me

for a long time both were silent the noise outside came to their ears clearly and distinctly while the ticking of the clock seemed louder than ever before

presently sidney to relieve his own emotions arose from his chair and went outside

slim spoke of marrying the woman on fourteenth street every day for the next week one morning he came in his face beaming all over with smiles and pleasant anticipation was plainly evident

well he began we talked it over last night and she thinks it will be all right so i want you to write a letter to my brother who owes me some money and tell him i must have it since i am engaged to be married and must have it to use in paying for my divorce

wyeth did so

thats fine he cried gratefully when it was handed to him you certainly can say a whole lot in a few words

when i get married to this woman i think i will have a mate like my first one said coleman wyeth tendered his sympathy

well he said as one put to a task he would like to avoid i must get around and see a lawyer about a divorce he was thoughtful for a moment and then resumed wonder what they charge for divorces in this town

depends upon the attorney and the case said wyeth i think twentyfive dollars is the usual fee or amount of cost slim hesitated thoughtfully and then said ill go down here and see this nigga lawyer he ought to be willing to get one cheaper than a white lawyer dont you think so

possibly

he went out about a half hour later he returned looking downcast and sullen he was silent for some minutes and then said as if addressing himself that niggas crazy

whos crazy sidney inquired looking up

that nigga lawyer

how do you figure that out

i went in there and spoke to him in regard to the divorce and what do you think he wants for getting me one

i havent the faintest idea

fifty dollars what do you think of that for highway robbery

perhaps your case is a bit more complicated than the average and therefore justifies a larger fee wyeth suggested

aw that what he said too but hes a blood sucker

he cant gouge me

oh well said wyeth in an offhand manner you wont quibble on a matter of twentyfive dollars additional when you are getting a good wife consider that as a treasure

well i dont care if shes willing to pay half ill give the sucker fifty wyeth bestowed a terrible look upon him whereupon slim withered well shed be getting as much as i so whats the difference he tried to argue wyeth continued to glare at him

the idea he declared presently with undisguised contempt to wish a woman to pay for your release from another im too shocked to say how ashamed i am of you

slim laughed sheepishly

twentyfive dollars for a pair of legs like you if i were a woman i wouldnt give twentyfive cents for you as you sit there now wyeth added with subdued mirth

the next day his atmosphere had changed perceptibly

he was in an ugly humor presently he gave words to its cause

that nigga womans fooling me and i know it

whats the stew today

shes got another nigga ahangin around her ive been suspicioning it for some time

youre the limit

i gave her a ballin out last night about it too

mrs lautier came in at this moment and that was the end of it for awhile

ill never be anything but a vagabond

sidney wyeth had about filled attalia with the tempest by this time and had anticipated going to another city almost as large about one hundred seventy miles west he made known the fact to slim and suggested that he might leave him in charge of the office if he did so as a precaution or rather to get some idea of his ability to dictate letters he had him compose a few when the typist handed them to him to be read and he had done so he decided to allow him to continue his canvass and to hire some one more proficient

say he cried the next day ive been thinking it over and maybe ill be going along with you

that so well i do not see any reason in particular why you should not go

theres only one reason he said thoughtfully

what is it

mrs king

oh yes thats so whens the wedding going to be

he glared at wyeth a second and then exclaimed doggedly im not going to marry i wouldnt marry the best woman in the world

from what you have told me it seems that you did marry the worst laughed the other

ill stay single henceforth and be safe he growled and busied himself through some papers

stay single eh and let the nice lady go without a husband its incredible that you can be so regardless

i do not care to discuss marrying today he muttered ive something better its a business proposition

oh i see what is it this time going to buy the first national bank or the southern railway

oh you neednt try to kid me besides i have not asked you to come in though if you did you could pick up some big quick money if you were of a mind to be serious

oh well if it doesnt take more than a million i might be brought to consider it wyeth smiled with assumed seriousness

i can see you lading in your sleeve so i dont tell you anything you see he ended it angrily and left the office

it was too good though to keep to himself so he told mrs lautier who in turn told it to wyeth

mr coleman had me write to ames today in regard to some song books which he says he used to sell lots of

she said when it was convenient

wyeth grunted

 he is very much provoked at the way you treat him

he says if you would go in with him you and he could both make lots of money but that you only laugh in your sleeve at everything he proposes she went on replete with gossip

he proposes many things said wyeth

she giggled

hes going out to liberty street baptist church to sing and sell them sunday providing he gets them in time she typed a few letters and then said he says he would like to go to effingham with you and sell books but that you want too much for it that the book is too high and you want to make too much

he says the book ought to sell for a dollar and he should be paid seventyfive cents for selling it

he wouldnt make a living selling it then retorted wyeth somewhat impatiently then he thought of mrs

king who fed him most of the time

the following monday wyeth thought he had fallen heir to a fortune he passed him in the hallway with head high and as serious as zero

mrs lautier imparted the reason for it when sidney had taken out the letters

mr coleman had a great day yesterday so he informed me she smiled he said you should have been out to liberty street baptist church and heard him sing and sell song books afterwards he said you were not a christian however which made it bad

how many song books did he sell and what did he receive a copy for them

i think six and he received fifteen cents apiece

she replied he entered at this moment his face wreathed in triumphant smiles

well my doubting friend if you would have taken the trouble to come out to liberty street baptist church yesterday i think you would have been convinced that i am something of a salesman after all

ive just been told that you mopped up said wyeth heartily slim swelled perceptibly he seated himself crossed his legs and resumed when i used to live in south carolina i was considered one of the best salesman in the country

you must have been a great man in south carolina

said wyeth slim observed him a moment sharply

presently he went on i would go to the camp meetings and festivals sing a few songs get the people warmed up with a good sermon and then sell hundreds of song books in the end

wonderful from sidney

i am going to the hnrtyu convention at timberdale thursday and i thought youd like to go along

he said artfully

 couldnt very well do it unless you got them to hold the convention over until next week

you will not take me seriously regardless of my success he complained now yesterday i sold a pile of song books and today i am sending the man his share of the money i could do you some good with the book you are general agent for if you would increase my commission to seventyfive cents a copy and lower the price to a dollar

if you wrote the publishers they might give you the books free of charge providing you agreed to pay the freight on arrival and not let the railroad company come back on them later for it soliloquized sidney

he went to timberdale the next day and the office saw no more of him for a week

 when will mr coleman return mrs lautier would inquire every day  i certainly do miss him

hes our mascot our jest i miss him also said sidney and they both spoke of him at some length

mrs lautier was also a sociable person about the office sidney was coming to appreciate more each day

she was from new orleans and a creole she had personality and a way that won all who were near her

she was slender and very dark and although only thirtynine was almost whitehaired which contrasted beautifully with her dark skin her eyes were small and beadlike while she was affectionate by nature her makeup was in keeping with the position she held as matron at one of the local negro colleges when she spoke her voice struck the ear musically she was a widow

why have you never remarried mrs lautier

wyeth ventured one day she colored unseen for a moment before she answered perhaps theres a reason

what reason you are charmingâvery charming i think said he earnestly although he smiled

she hid her face for a woman of her age she was most extraordinary i have been told that creole people have a most frightful temper pursued wyeth enjoying her manner is that quite true

yes she admitted surveying him now

and do you happen to be endowed with such an asset also

i wouldnt be a creole if i were not she advised still smiling

thats too bad said he a trifle sadly you seem too kind and sweet of manner to be liable to those angry wild fits they tell me they have

perhaps you will see new orleans while you are in the south and the creoles and then you can be better prepared to understand them in the future she said

perhaps i will he said after some thinking yes perhaps i will i had not thought of it before

mr coleman will be back tomorrow cried mrs

lautier entering the office a day or so later i received a postal from him announcing the fact so we will not be so lonesome now

i am anxious to see what he did in timberdale i guess he succeeded in turning it upside down and covering the whole town with song books

the next morning early he was back he entered the office and sat around in silence seeming to be in an introspective mood wyeth waited for what he knew would eventually come it did not as early as it usually did in fact he sighed wearily and looked so peculiar until wyeth to break the impatience he was laboring under presently turned his gaze upon him and said well i see you are back    the other sat up and looked about him suddenly as though awakened from a trance

i suppose you have more money now than you can conveniently use for a while wyeth tested made a bunch in timberdale

like hell spat the other grumblingly lucky to be back here alive

mm what did you run up against a freight train or the madam

i left the day she arrived he said in a heavy tone then added after a pause theyve been lynching and driving niggas out of that town this week so the convention was a fizzle

i suppose you sold out before they got after you

how many song books did you sell

didnt i tell you the white people was raising hell and akilling and burning negroes like barbecue out there he exclaimed impatiently i never sold any song books but i sold one copy of the tempest

how many song books of the amount you received have you still on hand

all but six

i thought you had sold them all but a dozen when you left for timberdale

aw that old nigga that i left them with and who claimed he could sell them at his church and more slipped them back into my room while i was away he didnt sell any

you dont seem to be getting back into your oldtime selling form very rapidly suggested wyeth

ignoring him slim said suddenly when you all going to effinham

next week

i dont know whether ill get to go with you or not

mrs king thinks id better stay here this summer

what do you think about it

i agree with her

just then mrs lautier came in and greeting coleman very cordially wyeth left them and went out on business

he happened to have a delivery on fourteenth street and when he had filled it he stood talking with the girl a moment are you acquainted with mr v r coleman she inquired

sure he is a sort of agent for this book sidney replied

i thought so said she and i was wondering what kind of an agent he must make when he spends so much time in this neighborhood he goes with a certain party next door and he was there all last week i think he scarcely went outside

good morning said sidney

goodbye said she i hope ill enjoy the book

the week arrived in which wyeth was to depart and preparations were made to that end he decided to leave the ofiice in charge of mrs lautier slim came in the day before he was to leave looking frightened and terribly upset always given to joking with him wyeth hardly knew how to accept him as he apparently was that day he was trembling in every limb as he cried that woman shes after me great god i wish she would leave me alone i wish she would leave me alone shes followed me all over the country shes like a ghost on my trail and now she is at this moment down in the street looking for me again wyeths sympathy went out to him and he cried quiet yourself youll surely go to pieces trembling like that after all why should you become so excited

you say you have advised her that you are not going to live with her again

aw but you dont know you dont understand

shes got it on me on me so strong until i dasnt make a crooked move or resort to the law the only chance i have is to keep out of her sight he paused a spell now and his appearance was that of a man under sentence of death then he said she has vowed to kill me and i know if she gets a chance she will

i will go with you fellows to effinham he said more calmly ive got to get away from where she can see me if i hope to live every moment i stay where i know her to be near will be moments of fear i dont want to kill her even in selfdefense god no i dont want murder on my hands he paced the floor at some length pausing at intervals to peep into the street in evident fright

she was out to mrs kings night before last mrs

king was not in so she walked up to the front door of the white people and rang the bell when the door was opened by the man of the house the expression he wore got her goat she made some excuse to the effect that it was the wrong house and went her way then yesterday or last night rather she came back we were eating supper and it happened that my seat was so i could look out the window and up the alley i saw her slipping up this alley near the side of the board fence with a big gun and it cocked i rushed out the front way and avoided her but she is bent upon forcing me either to live with her and submit to her tyranny or shell kill me and prevent me from living or being friendly with any other

you seem certainly up against a bad proposition v r said wyeth helplessly

if it wasnt for a certain little deal back in south carolina i wouldnt be so afraid but owing to that i dare not do anything but keep out of her way he trembled on woefully im going to try and slip out of town unbeknown to her and go along with you fellows to effinham ill be safe there for a while but as soon as she learns i am there shell take up the trail and ill have to beat it elsewhere

gee it must be dreadful to live in the fear that somebody is thirsting for your blood said wyeth shuddering

ill never be anything but a vagabond a rover drifting over the face of the earth until death comes he cried despairingly

he was calmed presently with the prospect of going to effingham wyeth went uptown attending to considerable business in connection with the office preparatory to leaving when this was completed he went to a movie and returned to the office about six oclock he went to another show that evening and after that had closed strolled about the town until tenthirty there appeared to be a gathering of women for some occasion at the auditorium which was breaking up when he returned mrs king and coleman were leaving the building when wyeth came up they started up the street with the crowd as they reached the corner there was a sudden commotion wyeth ran up and was just in time to see a woman dash after coleman from around the corner he saw her before she got near him and jerking free of his escort he tore into the street she was a dark woman with coarse black hair and of an indian appearance with a cry she flew after him as she cried in a diabolical voice at last vance coleman i have found you and in anothers company i am forced to stand aside although your wife down the street his steps could be heard as he tore along in mad haste she stopped when she saw that she could not catch him and drawing from some invisible direction a gun she levelled it with deliberate aim at the flying figure the crowd stood frozen creatures

and then suddenly a terrible cry rent the still night air just as the gun went off but the cry had disconcerted her aim and with a cry she turned toward the crowd but wyeth had the arm of the hand that held the revolver which he twisted and made the weapen fall to the ground she was led away presently by an officer while still far down a street the sound of hurriedly retreating footsteps came to wyeths ears he listened until they died away in the night wyeth turned and disappeared in the direction of his room

he never saw slim again

end of book one effingham ill take that change now whispered the porter nudging wyeth as he lay trying to sleep as the train roared westward toward effingham the iron city and greatest industrial southern center

raising up he reached in his pocket while yet half asleep and handed the porter two dollars i paid fifty cents for the ticket to spruceville as you know and the charge was to be two fifty the other nodded and pocketing the money he melted away noiselessly

a few hours later wyeth raised the shade and peered out the train was flying through a valley that spread away from either side of the single track smooth and unobstructed except for comfortable farm homes set back from the roads he looked back in the seat behind him observed young hatfield whom he was bringing with him dozing peacefully then he looked toward the front of the car for the first time and observed another with whom he had become acquainted in attalia he had never learned his name in fact he had never inquired it but since the other possessed such long legs and was tall and goodnatured into the bargain he had called him legs which had brought no objection on the part of the other and it is by that name we shall follow him in this story

hello there he greeted cordially when their eyes met and where did you get on and call yourself going

hello books the other returned as cordially

he rose from his seat shook himself as if to start the blood jumped about for a moment rubbed his face and then came back to where wyeth was and sat down

say he cried a little liquahd go good right now wouldnt it i had some but like a pig i emptied the bottle last night oh yes he cried suddenly im going to chicago where are you going

to effingham but i wish i were on the way for old chi along with you said wyeth the other smiled blandly stretched his long legs in the isle then got up went to the end of the car and looked around for a cup out of which to drink and of course not finding any he lifted the lid of the cooler turned it over and finding it had a disk drew it full and drank from it replacing it he came back and reseated himself since we shall become quite familiar with him and very shortly a description is quite necessary

he was tall over six feet and a mulatto his shoulders were broad while his chest was thin and flat his head was small and straight up from his back while he possessed a pair of small ears that fitted closely and oddly against his headâso oddly that when one observed him at a glance he reminded one of an elf he appeared to be smiling always although there was no great depth in the same his eyes were small and danced about playfully in his head while his hips were arched and broad between which was a full stomach which made him resemble a pickaninny

you see its like this he began confidentially he lowered his voice almost to a whisper and held his mouth close to wyeths ear the reason you did not see me when we left attalia last night was because i had the porter lock me in the lavatory i didnt come through the gate at the station but went out to the yards where he concealed me when the train was out of the town i came out but you were reading and didnt look up when i came out and took that seat

wyeth observed him now wonderingly he could not understand this unconventional manner of boarding a passenger train he was not however left long in doubt

in fact before he could give words to the question his eyes asked the other enlightened him is havin a little game sunday night and the bulls run in on me it was now all clear to wyeth he recalled the others occupation he had become acquainted with him through spoon and recalled that he kept a rooming house for questionable purposes in addition to this he sold liquor and ran a game on saturday nights and sundaysâor any time a crowd gathered with enough money to start

mm did they arrest you

no that is what is goin t tell i got away but they got the rest of the bunch every damn last one of them the fools you see he explained warming to the narrative it was not altogether my fault it was like this i had a nigga watching that is i had him hired to watch but the dn fool was a whiskey head and had t have a drink eve ten minutes claiming of course that it was necessary that he have plenty of booze t keep himself awake

wyeth laughed quietly

well i was head a the game and winning right along and didnt give a damn so i fed him all he could pour down the result of this was that he got good and full by and by went off t sleep and the bulls walked right in on us without a word of warning

we were shooting craps on the bed and the game was going along nicely i was sitting at the head holding the lamp and getting the cuts at least fifteen dollars was in the betting when on hearing a slight noise to my back like some one creeping i looked aroundâand man the room was full of bulls with dark lanterns which they at that moment flashed upon us

i didnt know what to do for a moment up with yu hands niggers they cried all the shines looked then into the barrels of a bunch aguns dont try no monkey business there you big nigger the sargent cried as he observed me shifting about all the time though i was edging toward a place i knew none ovm didnt see

suddenly i drops the lamp and there is some tall cussin

a little pupâi think he was a supâput a star on the back of my headâhe turned and wyeth saw it i staggered about now like i was knocked out they were all over us now ahand cuffin the niggas like a lot of cattle with halters by this time i sees my way clear t make this break one sucker spots me and cries look out that big nigga but they were too late i had my hand on the knob of a door that none ovm have seen and swinging it open quickly i ducked out as i did so one of the bulls takes a shot at me but missed

he was determined to have me though if possible so he comes after me in a hurry thats where i am wise and he wasnt there is a fence a few feet from the door that he didnt see out he came after me in a blind fury and bing he ran full into the fence and knocked the wind out of himself i saw my chance

i was mad and scared now too so i rushed upon him while he was staggering about and bingo i landed on him and knocked him cold then i beat it i had his gun and club and peeper and i flew out the back way i went like a race horse in the rear two or three bulls were aworkin over this bull that i done knocked stiff i entered the alley and ran until i reached bell street an onry bunch of dogs kept barking away at me as i hurried along and kept me scared because i s raid id be located by other bulls i ran down one a ittl i pugnosed bull he was game and tried to bite

 reached down and gotm by the head whirled him over my shoulder three or four times and when i turned him loose he landed beside a second story window and fell to the ground a dead dog i didnt try to see i then began to jump fences i bet i jumped a dozen fences and then got hung on the last one which held my shirt

i fell off at last and liked to have bust open my face was bleeding and my head while my shirt was soaked

i looked like the devil i at last tore off the shirt and tried to tie up my head then went to my brotherinlaws

gee exclaimed sidney but you certainly had some experience

aw man i done some runnin believe me he declared and looked grim

they had plenty aliquahâthe bootlegs tooâ sos soons is cleaned up with my head bathed and a clean shirt i took a few drinks and went to bed feeling all right

i laid around town hid away until he could slip me my clothes and a few dollars so i happened to know this porter and arranged to come over tonight and here i am and he breathed a sigh of relief

how did those they arrested come out and how come the cops to be next to your little game wyeth inquired casually

oh yes cried legs i forget to tell you that part of it you see there was a guy in the crowdâor had been rather whose wife didnt want him to gamble

now he came down there and lost what little he had and went home drunk his wife of course learned that he had lost his money and got sore he was a damned tramp and told her the whole story with tears perhaps and you know a nigga with tears so she went and put the cops next

now bout them other shinesâthe ones who got arrestedâthey came before judge loyals the next morning and got ten seventyfive each

i thought it was fifteen seventyfive for gaming

they were let off lighter owing to the fact that i was not brought if theyd a caught me it would have been fifteen seventyfive for them and about a hundred for me

wyeth laughed amusedly

you dont gamble or drink liquah either do you

he asked and then answered his own question no i know you dont youre lucky for using such common sense it doesnt pay even if four niggas outa five do

yeh he went on wearily only the straight and narrow path leads to happiness in the long run and with that he turned on his side and went to sleep

say he cried suddenly raising up what did you pay then looked around quickly to see if he had been overheard

two and a half the other replied how much did you

legs held up two fingers i toldm twas all i had and i didnt have but a precious little more

are you acquainted with any one in chicago

wyeth inquired

aw yeh a plenty but i am not going on through now im going to stop in effingham for a while it depends

hello red cried young hatfield coming up now rubbing his half closed eyes i see you got out all right

say man cried legs didnt i get out of that thing in luck

bet your life on that you did commented hatfield

if theyd have gotten you the devil would have been to pay he laughed a low hard laugh and then added those church people have had their eyes on your elace for some time and the chances are if you had een caught theyd have appeared against you

they certainly put old jack bell out of business proper legs commented thoughtfully that old nigga conducted such a rotten dump and tiger though and all those dirty little girls around on top of it i dont wonder

wonder whether he had any money left when they got through with him hatfield inquired

hard to tell said legs they fined him out of hundreds that i do know

by this time the train was entering the city from the car could be seen an incomplete mass of varied buildings little shacks that faced alleys and at the front of which played dozens of little unbleached pickaninnies

wyeth viewed the city as the train crept slowly along and his impression did not agree with what he had gathered from reading of it it was not he felt positive the city attalia was although claiming almost an equal number of people

you see those two brick cupolas extending into the air he heard hatfield saying thats a negro baptist church he was mistaken however for the same proved to be the large new station the pride of the city

soon the train rolled into this and a few minutes later they stood in the waiting room

its going to cost like the dickens to get all these grips of your hauled said hatfield with a frown

only had to pay thirtyfive cents to get them to the depot in attalia he walked to the lower end of the platform and began a series of inquiries relative to the hauling of the same he soon came upon an express man who agreed to unload them for fifty cents at whereever they found a room

the three walked down a level street paved with brick on either side a lot of houses appeared behind a row of trees dense with foliage it was a calm soft morning and the sun red and glorious was just peeping out of the east the street they followed led from the depot into the business section perhaps eight blocks ahead of them several buildings of extraordinary height stood outlined far above those about them wyeth counted the windows of two and found them to total sixteen

there are two or three buildings here higher than any in attalia said hatfield following his gaze i think the ones you have been noticing are twentyfive stories high

the other whistled thats going some

soon they were well into the business section lets go by and look at that hotel they have just completed and opened suggested legs for just then a little to the right the outline of that beautiful structure arose

it was a grand affair to say the least and stood as a monument to the enterprise of the populace it was claimed by them to be the swellest in the south

i think i can get on there after a bit said legs

im a head waiter by trade but i havent done any hotel work for some little time now

i hear they brought all the waiters from the north

said hatfield

well said legs ill be from the north when the time comes so i can make a fit if there is an opening

youll pass red laughed hatfield as they walked onward now in a different direction

as wyeth saw effingham he observed that it lay very differently from attalia it had been built up recently so to speak and had therefore broad spacious streets unusually so he thought as he now found himself in the heart of the business district perhaps they may have seemed wider because he had become accustomed to the narrow highways of attalia in addition to the wide streets the sidewalks stretched back from the buildings they fronted from twelve to twenty feet giving pedestrians plenty of room to walk unconcernedly along

as they continued on their way he further observed that the business section covered an unusually large area and it was hard to tell which might be called the main street

as the street cars clanged by him he noticed another feature also the position occupied by the negro passengers they entered and left the car from the front instead of from the rear as was the custom in attalia

negroes do lots of business in this town said hatfield as they came abreast of a large new building that reached five stories into the air this now said he pausing and surveying the structure is the dime savings bank building wyeth having read much about the bank observed the building carefully to one side through the street door there was no entry or rather the small entry was to one side of the building and not in the middle and one elevator was in operation

straight back from where they stood the open doors of the bank which the janitor was now sweeping revealed the inside of the institution

a few hours later their wanderings brought them back again before the bank which they entered it proved to be a busy place and at that hour was filled with black people depositing and withdrawing money and attending to other business in connection therewith

he observed in the first glance that the furnishing was elegant behind the first desk enclosed by an oak office fence sat a black man the cashier he thought since the insignia was plated conspicuously before him and still to the left of him behind a grating with the insignia of collections before it was another man and he was blacker still and then in the next cage over which was labeled boldly receiving teller worked still another black man

he was younger and he worked rapidly counting the money that was continually being thrust to him there was another cage to the right of him and this was marked paying behind this worked another black man young and intelligent and seeming perfectly efficient as had the others in the rear working over books he saw the first mulatto another brownskinned this time worked near him and these made up the active members of the bank

no blue veins held sway here it was truly a black mans bank it was as he had long since learned the largest in the country conducted by black people and the footing exceeded a half million by almost a hundred thousand dollars

young hatfield who was a student in one of the colleges of attalia had been to the city before was well acquainted and pointed out the many places of interest and in particular those conducted by black people

the president of this bank dr jerauld he explained is in failing health and is substituted by the vice dr dearford

i see acknowledged the other so the president then is a physician

no corrected the other a minister

wyeth recalled now that reverend or elder was almost a thing of the past among negro preachers

they were all called and called themselves doctors

but he did not then realize to what extent this title was usurped beyond the instant of medicine and dentistry he had noted that doctor was an honorary term conferred upon men who had done something notable in the evolution of mankind but he was soon to learn that the title had become a fetish with his people sought after and preempted by any and everyone without even the remotest right to claim it

everything that has ever been started down south has been done by the preachers a negro preacher down here in the past in particular has headed everything

of course that would be natural granting that almost every man with ambition to be before the public has been a preacher hatfield explained now for example the largest insurance company in attaliaâthat is with offices there and conducted by our peopleâhas for its president a preacher located in this town

ive heard of him his name isâ

dr walden he explained hes the pastor of a big church on the other side of town dr jerauld before he retired was pastor of the sixth avenue church

and what denomination do these preacher business men represent

oh baptist of course as i said they are at the head of everything including and he smiled humorously a great many wives of other men they both laughed and legs who was almost forgotten joined in

by this time they were wandering aimlessly down a street that finally came to an end and ran abruptly into a brick wall changing their course into another street they continued their indefinite pilgrimage presently they paused before one or two neat looking houses and inquired regarding rooms both were full a convention of preachers was still in session which explained the state of circumstances so on again they went until they paused at a corner a middleaged woman sat on the front porch of a house that rose to two stories and was decorated with two vineladen porches the house appeared to contain possibly seven or eight rooms

hello mis exclaimed legs in greeting so familar that wyeth felt he surely must know her

howdo she answered as familiarly and smiling

three tramps we are from attalia and without a place to roost do you happen to have a spare pole or two

sho has come upon the poch and be seated she invited

ahem thats when you said something smiled legs eh mis she joined in the humor

well boys said legs when they were comfortably seated this looks good to me supposing we just hang up here and send for our stuff

it was agreeable to the other two and they were therefore duly installed three in a room legs being the longest was given a bed to himself while hatfield and wyeth agreed to share another together it was fortunate for both that it was arranged thus since legs proved to be a dreadful night man and from his apparently restless way of tossing required a halter

any saloons around here mis he inquired shortly when she reappeared on the porch a few minutes later

sho is she exclaimed yeh most sho go right down this street turn the corner and across the street near the other corner is what you want she laughed taking them all for granted wyeth and hatfield followed legs to the inevitable fountain he now sought energetically

got t have a little liquah before i cn feel like myself he grinned as they sauntered along

hello called some one from the rear turning they observed a medium sized negro walking rapidly in their direction and beckoning to them they halted and presently he stood before them introducing himself

pardon me gentlemen he began very properly but the mis back there pointing in the direction of the house they had just left was telling me that you have just taken a room with her and since i am the man of the house i wish to offer my name and make you welcome

he was very cordial his name was moore john moore he said and to describe him our pen fails to a degree he had however an odd looking face his cheek bones were high slightly indianlike while his face was broad his nose was not flat nor was it high or medium it wasâjust a nose thats all he held his head forward aggressively his eyes were twinkling and possessed a cordiality that to a careful observer was distrustful and still his appearance in general was that of a negro who might be expected to bluff but not to fight to steal when the opportunity was ripe with enough cunningness to keep from being caught otherwise he was apparently harmless

they acknowledged his welcome and joining them they all went toward the place of happiness by proxy

im buyin this said moore as they lined the bar four abreast

let me do the buying this time insisted legs who proved himself a sport and a good mixer

ive paid him already said moore as if in dismissal shoving at the same time a half dollar across the bar

whiskey nodded legs familiarly to the bartender

little liquah too from moore

beer

beer

drink whiskey insisted legs and moore of the other two something that has the kick

these are my sons said legs teasingly

hold on heh george argued moore with the bartender you know how i take mine a halfapint n two glasses the bartender obeyed

here wyeth observed was diplomacy albeit economy

moore paid twentyfive cents for the half pint wherein he and legs had six sociable drinks three apiece whereas the same would have totalled sixty cents otherwise

hows this town for gettin hold asomething

inquired legs of moore when john barleycorn was doing his duty

best town in the south to get it if youre wise

moore winked

legs responded with a big wink im the man that put w in whiskey he smiled in get mine when its in the gettin

whats your line from moore pouring more whiskey

anything from heavin coal to sellin liquah and operatin a crap game and a little skin when the crowds right

i see said the other thoughtfully then added and your friends

this lad here is going to school to learn how to get his without workin while the other boy pointing to wyeth is already doin it

well men began moore as he opened a fresh half pint that legs paid for as i said f youre wise effingham is the best town in the country for pickins it is as you should know the greatest industrial center in the south

so i have understood interposed wyeth waiving the bartenders invitation aside i am anxious to learn something everything about the town and the colored people

are they employed in considerable numbers at the mines steel mills and furnaces about here of which the city possesses so many

thousands upon thousands he was informed

and how are they paid from a personal standpoint id be glad to know went on wyeth

all kinds of wages and at various times some receive as low as a dollar and a quarter while others make as high as seven and eight but the average wage runs from a dollar fifty to three dollars

hows the crap games from legs with the usual smile

niggas will shoot craps yu know grinned moore

i shoot a little myself when the moons right he winked

i want t find a good game as soon as possible and win about a hundred said legs beginning to show the effects of liquor hatfield and wyeth left them to their cheerful diversion which was now to all appearance warming to the superlative

the former went toward town looking for certain friends wyeth went back to the place where he was going to stay and retired they had called up for their luggage before they went to the saloon wyeth was sleeping peacefully when he was aroused by an argument on the porch he tried to close his ears but the same was persistent it was between the landlady and the expressman who had arrived with the stuff

that little trunk is as heavy as lead he heard that worthy saying

that has nothing to do with it from the landlady

they left fifty cents here to pay for it and you must have agreed to that amount or they would have left more

seventyfive cents seventyfive cents that little trunk is like something filled with bricks

my trunk mumbled wyeth coming to himself and listening to the argument and that sucker is trying to work her the dirty cur he now cried angry for two reasons one for being disturbed when he was sleeping so peacefully and another for being worked or trying to be with a bound he was on the floor and in a jiffy he was in his trousers and upon the porch

well t y ain gon pay it ill haf t take th stuff back the expressman said as wyeth came up the other did not see him until he mounted the porch then he looked into his eyes which were fighting and recoiled

whats this you are going to do he demanded filling the doorway and bestowing upon the other a look that corresponded with his feelings

well stuff i brung down heahs morn i thought twas so ill haf t have a quarter mo

what kind of a proposition did we make with you in regard to hauling it at the depot awhile ago

you said yud give me a haf adollah fo haulin it but i didnt say id do it fo a haf he sulked evasively

wyeth glared at him but the other refused to meet his eye then he began when you took hold of it and loaded it into your wagon you subsequently agreed to my offer and now i want to see you get more

ill haf t take the stuff argued the other shifting about but keeping at a safe distance something in the eye of the other did not offer welcome

give him a quater more called legs who had returned in the meantime and had been trying to catch a little sleep

i dont intend to pay him one little dime more

exclaimed wyeth stubbornly

then ill haf t see n officer bluffed the other and turning he started briskly down the street wyeth learned later he was sure he could not have found one

he was not looking for any but the landlady and legs made up the quarter and calling him back paid him

books is stubborn when he thinks hes been worked

mm said legs going back to bed yeh comes down to a show believe hed fight

these negroes in effingham are niggas proper

the next day dawned calm and beautiful and sidney made preparations to begin his canvassing in one city in ohio and which was also a great industrial center he had found much success in selling his book to the multitude of workers employed there therefore with what moore had already told him he was anxious to get his work under way

the first thing necessary of course would be to secure agents school had closed recently and he had intended coming to the city to enlist some of the teachers for that work securing a number of names and addresses he began calling on them but without any immediate success late that afternoon however a teacher a settled woman gave him the name and address of one whom she felt she assured him would take up the work

at least she said she always does something during vacation her name is miss palmer so thither he went

she lived not far away and near the center of a block in a small two story house rusty and somewhat ramshackle he mounted the steps which were perhaps a half dozen and asked for her she was out they informed him but was expected to return shortly before they were through telling him she came she was a brownskinned woman although in the fading twilight she struck him as being a mulatto of medium height and size she gave a welcome that played about the corners of her small mouth her chin was long and tapered to a small point which made her appearance unusual her eyes were small very small and playful

they were very soon in conversation and he was pleased to learn after he had talked with her a few minutes that she was a woman with the strength of her convictions although there was something about her he did not and was not likely he felt to understand for some time to come and he didnt

presently he stated the object of his visit and suggested that she take up the work during her vacation

she shook her head dubiously and said i dont mind canvassing but i dont want to sell books

why not books he inquired in a tone of surprise and then added it would seem that being a teacher selling a nice book would be preferable to something else

yes that may be said she thoughtfully now

but niggas here dont read at least they wont buy and pay for books sell them toilet articles or hair goods something to straighten their kinks or rub on their faces anything guaranteed to make their hair grow soft and curly or their black faces brighter

he laughed long she now observed him with something akin to admiration then the people of your communityâthe black peopleâdont consider feeding the mind an essential to moral welfare he suggested mirthfully

naw lord she replied flatly these negroes in effingham are niggas proper they think nothing about reading and trying to learn something they only care for dressing up and having a good time

he was silent and resigned for a time they now sat together in a swing that hung suspended from the porch

directly when he had said nothing for some time she looked again at him and with something in her demeanor that was anxious

what book is it she inquired

he told her

thats a good title and should take if anything will

she said a little more serious now than before she did not impress wyeth as being much of a literary person as he now observed her for a moment he felt the interest wan that he had experienced the moment she came up

she was speaking

i sold books one summer up from bondage by the greatest negro the race has ever known and i had a time i never want such another experience they told me a thousand lies and had me trotting after them all summer whereupon she shrugged her shoulders disgustedly

well said he im confident there are people and plenty who do care to read and will likewise buy when the book is properly presented so of course the duty of a distributer will be to find these people and it is for this purpose i am here i do not of course know what kind of a black population you have but it is reasonable to suppose that if i could and did personally sell twelve hundred copies in attalia in a matter of five months i should be able to find a few readers here do you not agree with me

oh of course said she but you cannot as yet appreciate the fact that effingham has the orneriest negroes in the world i am frank when i say that i do not have any confidence in them but wait she admonished youll find out

they sat together now and conversed on topics otherwise than books and literature which he observed could be engaged in with more success moreover as the minutes wore on he also came to see that miss palmer was somewhat sentimental she smiled freely moved close at times and then away artfully saw him at moments out of liquid eyes and said her words with a coquetishness that came by careful practice

and so sidney wyeth a man free to practice the arts of coquetryâif a man may do soâaccepted miss palmers attention and to that end he soon became a friend

when he departed that evening she had taken the agency and had agreed to go with him on the morrow

that night it rained a heavy rain and when he went forth the following morning the streets were heavy with mud wherever there was no pavingâwhich was in this part of town almost everywhere moreover it showed signs of raining more it had been one of the dryest springs the south had ever seen and it was now probable that the deficiency in rainfall would be eradicated by an excess in moisture

wyeth however was impatient to begin as soon as possible he wished to ascertain to what extent intelligence and regard for higher morals was prevalent in this town

miss palmer was not ready when he arrived and it was two hours before she was  thought since it rained

she explained that you would not perhaps go out today

wont know the difference this time next year he jested with a cheerful smile nevertheless surveying the threatening elements anxiously

if we go into the quarter districts she advised we will most likely get our feet wetâmuddy

are there no sidewalks out there he inquired

they had decided the evening before at her suggestion to begin in one of the many little towns inhabited by negroes employed in the mines mills and furnaces that made effingham what it was these little towns encircle the city proper laying many of them at a considerable distance to be incorporated as part of the city

some years beforeâbetween one census and the nextâ this city is recorded to have trebled and over in population it had but in doing so it gathered all these little burgs for miles around some of them were even beyond the car lines which were built to them after the city had incorporated them and counted the people as a part of the population of effingham wyeth perhaps as well as the world at large had not known this the population at this time was estimated to be one hundred sixtysix thousand of this amount twofifths were negroes only a portion had been born in effingham the rest came in the last few years in great ignorant hordes from the rural parts of the state and from the states adjoining and as wyeth soon came to know they included some of the most depraved and vicious creatures humanity has knownâbut of this our story will reveal in due time

the most extraordinary part of effingham was its staggering number of churches that is among the negroes notwithstanding the fact that the city was the resort of every escaped convict and the city where every freed one headed for which of course naturally made it the scene of excessive depravity there was apparently a great amount of pious worship wyeth recalled as he became better acquainted with the city and the people that a year before in a northern city he had one day gone to the library where he found the directories of all cities of any significance he was preparing a circular campaign and in going through the various directories chanced to look through the part of those of the southern cities that had recorded the churches effingham had according to an old one almost a hundred negro churches

but having digressed at some length we will return now to miss palmer and sidney wyeth preparing to spread intelligence among a people who greatly needed it

sidewalks miss palmer exclaimed in derision lordy they hardly have streets in some places

a few minutes later they were sailing through the countryâalthough it was counted as part of the cityâto a town a suburb nine miles distant a suburb of mills

i used to sell toilet articles out there on and right after pay days and did quite well said she as the heavy car thundered along at a great rate of speed for an interurban i am skeptical in regard to books though because these are bad niggas with the exception of a precious few good ones

they were just then passing through a district that was well kept and apparently quiet we are now in a part of the town where a large number of the better class of our people reside she said and i am going to point out the homes of some of them

there is where mr judson paying teller at the dime savings bank lives she pointed to a handsome bungalow setting well back from the street and surrounded by many young trees with a well kept lawn upon three sides  now over there is where paul widner contractor and builder has his home following the direction of her finger he was moved by the sumptuous and imposing structure that met his gaze that is the finest residence owned and occupied by one of our kind in the city she said with evident pride still though here is dr jacksons which is almost as fine and she pointed to another that was a credit  he is the financial secretary of one of the church denominations of the south

see that long house over there she pointed to another that is dr waylands he runs the drugstore

a preacher

no a pharmacist

they were now in the wood a deep forest with great trees all about that darkened the inside of the car the picked over and slim pines mingled with large water oaks rose gloomily against the heavy clouds that now rumbled ominously overhead before long large drops of water began an intermittent patter on the car roof while the windows were spat upon occasionally and then of a sudden the very heavens seem to open and the rain fell in torrents through it the heavy car pushed resolutely forward the line was one recently completed and facilitated travel between the city and the suburb wonderfully built of steel the cars were long and heavy with doors that opened near the center allowing the colored passengers to enter on one side of the conductor who operated the doors from a convenient position near the furtherest side of the opening

we will surely get soaked today grumbled miss palmer but not lightly for she trembled on observing the terrific downpour

how much further is it to this place we are going

he inquired to him it seemed they had been riding an hour you do not mean to tell me that all that stretch of forest and open country before we got to the forest is a part of effingham

we will soon be there now she evaded and then added effingham includes everything that electric cars operating in and out of the city reaches and laughed

he believed her

at last the big car came to a stop they alighted in the downpour and rushed to shelter beneath the porch of a small grocery store conducted by a kindfaced little colored woman

oh howdo mrs brown cried miss palmer when the latter upon seeing them opened the door and bade them enter  im certainly glad to see you whereupon they kissed and miss palmer cheered the dark atmosphere with many cute words

permit me mrs brown to introduce mri forget your name you see mr wyeth said miss palmer with a delightful smile i taught out here these past three years and mrs brown is one of my many friends yonder is the school she pointed to an old frame building that could barely be outlined through the storm they have transferred me back to the city again she turned to mrs brown so i regret to say that i shall not be with you next year

miss palmer had a way of finishing her sentences with a show of her fine little teeth and her chin at such a time reached to a fine point which at first amused sidney she would bestow upon him a coquettish smile when she found his eyes searching her mysteriously

mr wyeth said she with her arm linked now within mrs browns is general agent for a new book by a negro author the tempest and for which i have accepted the local agencyâwhy not she broke off suddenly show mrs brown the book

she is clever and suggestive at the same time

thought sidney almost aloud but he forthwith obeyed the suggestion with much pleasure and took mrs browns order amid the rainfall collecting twentyfive cents as a guarantee of good faith in addition

it had ceased raining as suddenly as it had commenced they turned to leave the store and as he was passing miss palmer he bumped against her roughly

she was looking at his picture on the frontispiece now with apparent suspicion he pretended not to see her or her suspicion that had now grown to excitement she was yet apparently in some doubt as she tried to make connections

look here look here she exclaimed at last in subdued excitement this picture this picture it is you you she held the book open and looked at him in amazement he waved her aside depreciatively and passed outside while she continued gazing at the picture in a state of excitement she followed him and they were alone

why didnt you tell me this she cried unable to stem her tide of excitement she had lost interest for the present in all else and pursued you the author of this book she now saw him as another person entirely feeling much put out he felt something should be resorted to to dissipate the spell

im not the author he said with straight face

where shall we go now his demeanor was calm and imperious

stop next doorâno thats mrs browns house she said as she followed him in a meditative mood the next house he heard her say as if speaking from far away miss palmer was now serious and very thoughtful

disturbed by her discovery and in a measure disconcerted wyeth concentrated himself upon the demonstration of the book to a creditable degree that morning and one by one with his voice and look charged with dynamite he secured those black peoples orders and the deposit wherever they had the amount available miss palmer merely followed him insisting upon the point of authorship until with a touch of impatience he admonished her that their purpose on that occasion was to sell the book the author therefore insofar as they were concerned was a matter of secondary consideration

going to be angry with me so soon she pined looking into his eyes with a feigned appeal in spite of himself he smiled back disconcertedly

you are the author though arent you she asked softly

he ignored the question

we have eleven orders and have collected a dollar and seventyfive cents in exactly an hour and a half

she informed him at the end of that time whether you did or did not write this bookâsay what you will im convinced you didâyou do know how to sell it i never heard a man talk so fast and so effectively in my life

i must leave you now he said i have agreed to be back in town for the afternoon and help start my young friend

please dont leave me she whispered artfully and smiled in her winning way then suddenly hurried into the next house

thought you had quit me for good books complained young hatfield when he saw wyeth on his return to the city when we goin out

as soon as i have fed my face and the car will take us toâwhere or what is that place you spoke of where the girls work in service

south highlands he replied

they followed the street until they came to the main street or rather to one of the main streets and caught a car from the front end that took them to the north highlands and not to the south as they were accustomed to go

youll have to pay carfare back books said hatfield i have only fifteen cents left

go right over to where you see that girl that little colored girl standing on the steps that lead to the rear and tell her the tale of the tempest and get her order

said wyeth when at last they had come to the right place

i thought i would go along with you this afternoon

he said with a frown but obeyed the command nevertheless

two hours later sidney found him where they had left each other what have you done he asked holding back a frown because he felt the student had succumbed to a lack of confidence but he was cheered in a degree when the other replied i got four how many did you get

eight and they went on their way rejoicing

i have been married said she thirtyfive years ago effingham was an unsuspected factor that was before somebody had demonstrated that the chain of red hills encircling the then small town contained immense deposits of iron ore and coal and other mineral matter that could be converted into practical purposes

effingham lay at that time in the valley where as yet most of it is found then it was regarded as only an ordinary town without any expectation of future greatness it had to be exact thirtyeight thousand fourteen years ago fifteen thousand negroes and the remainder white population including a few chinese

today the city boasts of approximately one hundred seventy thousand

thus the city had developed regardless of circumstances which our story will unfold

but sidney wyeth our erstwhile observer and literary contemporary had not been long in effingham before he had come to learn that it was not the city attalia was in spite of its great industries and its million dollar payroll which was employed in advertising the iron city

to begin with capitalâhard cashâwas a very expensive thing to use toward the development of its extension when the city incorporated the many little towns that make up a large part of its present population it began to run in debt a great deficit was customary at the end of each year and now at the time of our story it was still energetically engaged in the same taskâpiling up a deficit the many little towns that are a part of the city and where most of the great industrial concerns are located are practically controlled by the interests but when the tennesee coal and iron company became a vested interest it took over all these various concerns and merged them into a trust which is a problem to every congress and now as sidney wyeth saw it the company owned everything it almost owned the negroes and thousands of foreigners who were employed by the company

but there was one thing the t c i company did not own and that was train loads of liquor consumed by its black help and of course the whites also to a degree but not in such proportion drink was very popular in effingham exceedingly popular it operated to an alarming degree everywhere and about pay days held sway in certain portions of the town and made everything run riot and yet there were not nearly so many saloons in effingham as there might have been it cost too much for the privilege at three thousand dollars a year only about one hundred fifty saloons were in operation but some years before while the state was under prohibition tigers became the order and now many of them still operated especially on sunday and after closing hours they were busy they dealt in a liquor known in general as busthead and to say that it deserved such a title is saying little enough

it was miss palmer who became at once a personal friend of wyeths and who first told him of these conditions from her before he had time to observe of his own initiative he also learned a great deal in regard to the black people

he was waiting on the porch for her when she returned late that afternoon in fact it was night when she arrived

she was tired but cheerful and greatly encouraged she had secured eleven orders for his book and collected considerable more deposits in connection therewith

i certainly did some talking to those negroes this afternoon she exclaimed drawing herself upon the porch when she arrived i talked a blue streak and believe me one after another succumbed she boasted

you work too late he said with a note of kindness and admiration in his voice i do not usually work to exceed six hours a day and quit by six at the latest

he added

thats the trouble with annie said her cousin and a teacher also she has so much ambition when she sees herself succeeding that she invariably wears herself out

have you met my roomers miss palmer inquired

he shook his head and waited while she with much ostentation introduced them one by one

this is mr jones who carries mail upon a rural route mr farrell is a student at tuskegee he is spending his vacation in our city and you have been talking with my cousin miss black

mr farrell was a small creature so black in the darkness of the night that only a gloomy outline of his features was discernable while his white eyes reminded sidney as he winked them of a pair of lightning bugs on a warm june night this was augmented by the occasional flash of his white teeth he was studying architectural drawing there was another student from the same school a west indian negro and who like his kind was always apparently desirous of learning and asked sidney many questions mr jones who happened to be another cousin of miss palmer and the aforementioned mail carrier was a suave creature who read books and discoursed with much practical intelligence

the following morning miss palmer and sidney were starting toward the car on their way to canvass when they stepped in a small drugstore conducted by a tall slender man of about thirtyfive wyeth had been in the store two evenings before or the day he arrived and overheard a big argument he had now come to know that this was a place for warm debate with the druggist ever conspicuous as one of the debaters

he had not displayed his book there or suggested a sale to the druggist there were certain classes of his race to whom he never made a practice of showing the book for several reasons the first and most significant of these reasons was that he almost always found the negroes who were engaged professionally including teachers not very appreciative of the work of their race although any of them would have been insulted if this were told them he had also made observation from other sources concerning the possible sale of his book

his decision to dispense henceforth with showing the book to certain classes had resulted because of a little incident the year before in cincinnati he had observed the same in other cities before he reached cincinnati

in dayton indianapolis and elsewhere but in cincinnati it was so evident that he was in a way ashamed to tell it afterwards this is what occurred the colored people were making great efforts to secure a y m c a and were when he left the city within fifteen thousand dollars of the amount they were required to raise the white people had given sixty thousand

he became well acquainted with the secretary and it was from him that he learned without inquiring that of twentynine colored teachers who were receiving a minimum of sixty dollars a month twentyone had not subscribed one dollar toward this small amount the colored people were strenuously trying to raise and of the eight who had subscribed five had grudgingly given one dollar each the secretary himself a former teacher admitted this with great humiliation

wyeth had always found the teachers profuse with excuses when it came to buying the book and he had found the doctors little better but to avoid what he had grown to expect and which he invariably met he had decided to ignore this class of his race he did not offer criticism upon the whole teaching staff because of the three teachers out of twentynine in cincinnati who had actually contributed toward the colored y m c a the professor had shown his sincerity and race appreciation by subscribing one hundred dollars and had paid it

so sidney wyeth would never have shown the book to the druggist with a view of sale but miss palmer did

in her insistent manner she urged him to buy now wyeth as was his custom always went to the leading book store in each town and had never failed to sell them a few books the leading store in effingham had purchased ten copies and had placed an advertisement of ten inch space in the colored paper that ran for a month and which the druggist had seen so when miss palmer approached him insistently he declared that he had seen the book advertised at that store and as was their custom sometime during the year they offered all books at fortynine cents he would if he wanted the book purchase it then of course he didnt want it and wyeth was provoked that miss palmer had even shown it to him but miss palmer had and upon being told of these conditions she at once ceased her efforts

of course the druggist was wrong and wyeth knew it but the druggist didnt he wanted to betâany amount that he was rightâthat one of the biggest booksellers in the southland offered all books regardless of best sellers sometime during the year at fortynine cents a copy it cost the druggist two dollars to learn that he could be wrong or mistaken at least even if he had been to school and graduated from college which in the minds of his august contemporaries meant that he knew everything

it was miss palmer who advised sidney that dr

randall for druggists were called doctors also among these people had been to school and graduated from college   

and miss palmer was much chagrined that wyeth had acted so hastily    for times were hard and two dollars was something  if he had caught her eye when she tried so hard to get his she would have gotten him outside for a minute one little minute and then she would have told him who the other was    she was almost in tears as she remonstrated with him for his hasty act   

miss palmer was sincere and meant it because for some reason she was unable as yet to account she really liked mr wyeth he has such eyes she told her cousin when she returned while the bet was being settled

well we have lost two hours so we will have to get a move on us now to make up for lost time of course

he said cheerfully ive made two dollars which is as much maybe more than we would have made in the meantime

you did what miss palmer was amazed

it was some time before she could be brought to believe it

we will go to a different part of the quarter today

she said after a time wyeth looked at her miss palmer was very kind and sidney wyeth longed for kindness

when he saw miss palmer as she was that day he felt something amiss in his heart she had said nothing today whereas yesterday she had acted he thought boldly

the car now seemed to be flying through space it roared like a mad thing and filled him with a peculiar feeling exhiliration overwhelmed him for one moment he forgot everything and he felt a burning desire to touch the woman at his side sat miss palmer she had been kind to him even though he had known her almost no time and then suddenly his hand found hers and closing over it one moment he crushed it a moment later the impulse had passed

the powerful car thundered on its way

miss palmer worked hard that day all the hours through she talked and talked she simply made those black people buy the story of a young man a young man of our race who had the strength and courage of a pioneer went alone into the wilds of the great northwest and there made conquest think of that as an example and incentive to effort for your children they nodded and joined her in seriousness though they knew not what it all meant but they did feel the strength of her eyes and the insistence held them

wyeth suggested the route

she offered no objection whither he suggested she followed meekly almost subserviently and always she sought whenever she could get his attention his eyes and into them she looked for something but it was ever something unfathomable she saw therein but the more she was unable to fathom those depths the more her eagerness to do so became apparent

she talked of her work as a teacher she told him then of her ambition and her hopes but miss palmer withal she felt that day could not somehow impart the secret of her great ambition vainly she tried in her most artful way to have him tell her somethingâsomething of himself

but he never did that made it harder for miss palmer for soon she felt she just had to know

over there said she pointing to a row of new houses uniform in splendor are homes that are beautiful and still economical it is my intention to begin the purchase of one of them next year all the people living there in those houses are personal acquaintances of mine and friends and as you will observe there is a school just around the corner which adds greatly to the value of the property i want also to buy another home in that neighborhood as soon as i have the first one well under payment and so have it paid for by the time my boy becomes of age

your boy

yes she admitted with a tired hard smile

oh   

i have been married

oh  

but am now a widow

oh   

but not by death

oh   

no he is not deadâat least he wasnt a month ago

she shrugged her shoulders and went on now somewhat doggedly i am a grass widow and you know what that means   

he made no answer but she knew he heard her and was listening she went on as only an unsuccessful and unhappy woman could yes when a woman marries a man that she loves and gives to him the best thats in her and after years is forced to give up the fight her very heart for a piece of paper marked divorce she is never the same woman she was and might have continued to be there are those who say oh i dont care but im going to tell you they do the woman lives on apparently gay but her heart is dead within her for a long time now there was silence presently she spoke again

 i am living entirely now for my little boy he is all i have and i am willing i feel to slave until the skin falls from my fingers that he may have his chance i am elanning to graduate him as early as possible and place him in a good northern school in the study of medicine

again sidney wyeth felt a peculiarity about his heart

his thoughts went back into yesterdays and he recalled all that he had lived and hoped for and then for one brief moment another stood before him miss palmer was talking but her voice seemed to come from far away

presently she touched him he looked up and she saw the something in his eyes and suddenly all she had been feeling passed as she now observed him closely her lips parted they started to say you strange man

youve had your troubles too and then something else seemed to say but youre game oh youre game

youve lived a bitter pill a very bitter pill look into those eyes study them and if you have suffered and by that suffering you have learned you can read that a secret lurks therein you say nothing but you feel nevertheless what miss palmer did say when her lips spoke was wed better be going mr wyeth its getting late hear the whistle of the furnace and across from that we hear another that belongs to the semet solvay but they both are right its one oclock and thirty minutes time to canvass we must go her voice was kinder now than ever

they went

eidder stuck up ah shes a witch

they now passed between two large industrial plants of the tennessee coal and iron company to the left roaring mightily was one of the many blast furnaces where the pig iron was made from the crude ore innumerable small cars upon which sat huge ladles whirled to and fro backward and forward they were pulled out of the great shed where they received their supply of molten matter from the largest cupolas in existence

everywhere the white heat flashed hundreds and thousands of men black and white although as they were now seen they were all black worked away

system was everywhere evident the cars with their loads of molten heat moved with systematic regularity while each and every man seemed to know and fill a certain place only a little carelessness a little disregard for established rules and regulation would lead to death of one to a score of men

to the right of them filling the hot summer air with sulphuric and gaseous fumes the plant of the semet solvay company was visible in all its activity it rose grim and forbidding with intense heat and stretched back for a mile seemingly from where they passed

even the dirt upon which they walked as they went into the quarters between the plants was hot and dead

no grass was to be seen a sickly little short weed struggled for existence in this medley of industry

and now before them rose a hill at the top of which were the quarters high above the factories as though seeking the air and as if to be as much as possible free from the sulphuric fumes that at times almost stifled one these houses stood dirty grim and forbidding

they rose sinisterlike in the dull sunlight and fell back beyond as they approached

when the two had reached the summit and viewed the place closer sidney was for a time awed by the sight

row after row of little red or brown shelllike homes they were with a thin board porch they made little resistance against the intense heat for it seemed hotter here than elsewhere

at this hour the inmates could be seen spread about on these little porches if it happened to be on the shady side or else they could be seen in the houses and some were even beneath them anywhere they could find a spot that would permit of a little rest for from one to three weeks they must work at nights twelve thirteen and fourteen long hours the furnace cupolas had not been cool in many instances since they were erected and only two shifts were employed they were predominantly black people

only here and there was a mulatto to be seen little children filled the grimy streets that are made to stink fearfully from the slag used in the paving and now as the sun beats down it was soft and stuck to the shoes much to the provocation of the walker notwithstanding the apparent lack of comfort evident everywhere in this little village of workers these little black children with an occasional italian seemed as cheerful and happy and gay as those of the aristocrats of the south highlands

they played busily while their little faces tanned by the heat were full of joy they were as courteousâmore so than one would expect under the circumstances

when sidney wyeth inquired he learned that the t c i company maintains and pays the teachers well in the schools for the education of these masses of little growing human beings unfortunately so torn and frittered by race law legislation the city and the county and the state are far in arrears financially and were it left to those bodies these little children would not all by any means learn the art of reading and writing for with all our boast as the greatest nation of civilized people there is no law here that compels the parent guardian and what more to send these children to school which perhaps accounts for the fact that forty per cent of the black population are illiterate and almost as large a per cent of the whites

they walked along together in silence miss annie palmer and sidney wyeth this silence was interrupted only when they drew near one or a number of these little human beings who smiled upon them and made eyes back at sidney who winked humorously and then made them all happy with a few pennies for he loved children they passed through this mass which our pen has attempted to describe and found themselves soon in a part given over to nature trees had made a brave fight for the right to exist against poisonous gases and some had succeeded in a measure while garden truck closer to its mother earth had apparently succeeded to a still greater degree fences were in evidence pride as well the children were cleaner the houses were not quartershacks any more but commodious even large homes and were occupied by a class while workers nevertheless they had employed their earnings otherwise than for liquor and dice and other frivolities the curse that submerges the more ignorant and prideless they were a kind people these were and when approached with a suggestion of literature they smiled and replied we are fond of reading thus miss palmer and sidney wyeth began work that day and until the sun was hurrying toward the west they talked and said words of kind sincerity to the many they met for these people deserved it what was more important some made effort toward their betterment

these were few in number for this reason such kind words of encouragementâay very often praise was necessary

so one by one they subscribed and hoped for the book soon until their orders were many the evening had approached until the hour was near six when they came upon another a black woman truly but pride apparently she had plenty while not the finest in point of value her house was one of the cosiest it was painted in two colors and reposed quietly behind a medley of small trees around which was a fair stand of blue grass the lace curtains all clean and white contrasted beautifully behind and below the pale green shades while within the furniture was artistically arranged

they were invited in and made most welcome yes

said the black woman i am fond very fond of good books and when it comes to one which my race has produced i want it for such are few so you may take my name and bring the book as soon as you can

they thanked her profusely and spoke as they had spoken many times that day kind words of encouragement and praise she appreciated it

yet some said of this woman before the two made this call shes a mean nigger and youll neveh be vited in da house umm she has no commadation bout her and shes eidder stuck up ah shes a witch whereupon they shook their black heads and went their way with a mutter

but ere long anotherâand he was himself a practical and successful manâsaid shes o k a fine woman but she runs a grocery store while her husband digs coal and well she doesnt credit tom dick and harry

and then wyeth and his companion understood

the days work was done at last and they were hurrying back to town they were tired both mentally and physically but their spirits were high they were moreover grateful and seemed to a great degree to understand each other their friendship has reached the stage at which they could indulge in confidences miss palmer especially she regarded wyeth out of her liquid eyes and smiled kindly confidentially im glad i took up the workânow

she smiled with more confidence than before yes i am really i have enjoyed it and still she smiled

he did too she smiled back and then in a voice that was so soft and kind and confidential she said you wrote it didnt you

he heard the car as it crashed along through the night for the sun had set long ago the trees for they were passing through the forest flashed darkly through the electric lighted car and miss palmer waited he did not reply after a timeâshall we say minutesâshe sought his eye she was languid and resigned to a degree  if you would only admit that which i am positive is true it would be so nice i would truly be satisfied

what matter could it make and then he stopped

she might be more interesting curious than otherwise  

he remained silent

oh why do you maintain this silence regarding the authorship she fretted moving restlessly about

cannot we go along and sell itâthat in particular is all that matters isnt it he tried to be reasonable

you will as you must now see he argued only need to go to the industrial people and success will be yours

she was oblivious to all this he resumed somewhat uncertainly if many peopleâespecially those in the class to which i feel you belongâknew or thought that i am the author of this book their possible interest might become doubtful whereas with no thought than the ordinaryâthat is the usual fetishâthey might after reading it be much impressed with its message dont you agree with me

he wanted to be reasonable but miss palmer was silent

she was still so when they left the car some minutes later when they had reached the curbing and stepped upon the walk they saw hatfield he had his suit case and was in somewhat of a hurry from the strides he was making

where is he going home inquired miss palmer

i dont know replied the other but i wouldnt think so at least he never said anything to me in regard to it when i left him this morning yet so he was though he never said so when they met him and exchanged a few words

im going to a friends house and he gave wyeth a number they told him of their success whereupon he secured a dollar and that was the last time they saw him he went back with the same porter they had come over with

it was legs who informed sidney that young hatfield was going back to attalia legs was having some experiences of his own before he related them to wyeth he inquired well books how goes it he was cheerful as usualâin fact legs was always cheerfulâwith one exception which we shall cite presently

fine legs wyeth beamed couldnt be better which is saying a great deal hows things with you

could be a whole lot better he laughed with dancing eyes but they have been worse ive been busy though working right along got me a gal now and won a little change today that i might lose tonight

he didâand more he lost all he had borrowed a quarter from wyeth wanted a dollar but wyeth halted him advising that he loaned only to purchase the means to fill his stomach and then only when it was begging for bread

after this and for some time to come legs fortune varied from near prosperity to going for a whole day without anything to eat and at these times he dispensed with his usual cheerfulness

one day he pawned his meagre jewelry for all he could obtain thereon which amounted to only a dollar and a half he ate a big meal at a cheap restaurant got his shirts from the laundry paid fifty cents on his room rent and went with the remainder to a game luck was with him as it is with all once in a while true it was only in a small measure but he had sufficient to finish paying his rent bought a cold lunch that he sensibly tucked away for future purposes and went to bed with a dollar in his pocket

sleeping peacefully at two a m he was awakened by john moore the man of the house who told himâsidney heard thisâof a great game close by and where hundreds were at stake so legs got up not too cheerfully from his comfortable bed and peaceful sleep dressed and a moment later followed moore out into the night and to fortune  he came back in about an hour he was drunk and broke angry with himself and more so with john moore

damn that nigger he cried terribly when alone with wyeth damn him damn him damn him

came in here and got me out of bed he roared brandishing his long arms when i was sleeping the sleep of peace niggas gotta big game on all kinds amoney

fn beatm know i cn and then like a fool and here he looked down at himself as if to see which would be the best part to kick i up and goes with him of course he must have a drink for himself so a quarter first went to get him right and then to the game

no sooner had we arrived than slip me a haf said he and like a damn fool i did he bet a quarter that a dinge who held the craps wouldnt hit and lost he repeatedâand lost again he wanted the last quarter declaring his luck would begin with it but i forestalled him and got the craps myself and threw them dancing clear across the table and they turned up wyeth waited eagerly âcraps

doggone that nigga f he comes around me again im going to shoot him in the headâright through the middle of the head and with this solemn declaration he went forthwith back to bed he slept peacefully and awakened the following morning hungry and madder than ever as the fact dawned upon him wyeth loaned him a quarter and gave him some good advice

quit it get a job work honest work come to the room with a book read and thereby learn something and save your money

i will so help me god declared the other feeling repentant all the way through

and rememberâin speaking of the godâhe helps those who help themselves

my father was a preacher

wyeth made no further comment but legs was a good rustler he did betterâfor a while he looked the town from end to end for the kind of work he followed but without success so it continued day after day his great problem was to get something to fill that stomach which was now flabby very much so at times he managed by diligent application to drop something into it once and sometimes twice a day and one night he came to the room with an exclamation that he had eaten three times that day and had a dime left in his pocket he drew this forth balanced it on the tip of his forefinger observed it long and earnestly and then said little one we are friends its true but such we cannot possibly remain for tomorrow you will have to go the way of the rest whereupon he touched his stomach with the forefinger of his other hand so tonight on a pilgrimage of fortune we must go you and i its more or lessâpossibly nothing so to the first crap game i take thee and once there in the glare i shall risk you against the rest therefore little one prepare thyself for soon i shall bet thee understand in the first crap game i come to a nickel at a time

he didâand won he continued then for some time to win and win and resumed all the cheerfulness he once possessed his winnings continued until he had redeemed his jewelry paid a weeks room rent in advance was clean and seven dollars to the good over all then it began to go the other way he quit however and deposited five dollars with his friend wyeth

im doing this said he because these roomers who shoot craps too would not allow me to be otherwise than broke thus the fortune of legs took a turn for the good for one day the next night he went broke

thus we will leave him for the present and return to sidney wyeth and miss annie palmer who sold books

a bigger liah they aint in town

john smith was a large man fat and bighearted as well so wyeth had been told previously sidney met both smith and his wife and she was larger still she too was a good kind woman with a multitude of friends whom they had made by kindness to others she was a full blood while he was not more than half together they would weigh to exceed five hundred pounds and of course he was a preacher

said he when he had heard the story of the tempest yes ill take oneâno you may put me down for two

and then he seated himself with as much comfort as was possible upon the greasy counter for john smith was a successful merchant who made his living by the sale of necessities to a multitude of his clan who were employed by the semet solvay company as he made the above remark he was ready as we can see for a long conversation

been takin many odahs he inquired

oh lots of them the other replied cheerfully

mm who all yu got in that list he went on

the other shoved it before him

mm said he running his eyes over the order list

ooh uncle cried a little one grasping his trousers and looking up the plice uz jes gone ova the hill wi lem jackson dey has rested im fo stealin coppa wiah

sadly wyeth drew his pencil through a name he had written not an hour before

im glad to get your opinion concerning these elder

he said gratefully the ones we have had down here have been pretty good and i dont wish to be cherishing expectations that are not likely to be realized so tell me if you dont mind who can be relied on

aw thats it hes chivalrous all right and would be gallant enought to subscribe to anything a womans carrying around but he wont be man nough t take it n he knows it at this point he laid the list down stuck his big stomach forward rested his hands thereupon and with his finger to emphasize he forthwith gave wyeth a lecture on negroology

i been runnin this sto heah fo thoiteen yeahs n lemme tell y brother i know these niggas fo what they is he paused a moment and surveyed the list again critically then laying it down said jump up on the counter and rest yosef i gotta story t tell yu

wyeth obeyed and john smith began

i was run outta geogi n i ain shame to admit it but notwithstandin the fact twas a mistake n aftwad the whi people found it out n was sorry n wanted me t return that however was afta i was ove he n doin business n mo busness than i had eve done befo so i jes thanked them fo admittin to the mistake n stays he well s i was sayin i came ove he n stated a sto i had owned a big fam back the in geogi n i received  fo it n puts most uv it in th sto n trusted cullud people in three yes is brokeâflat broke didn have nothin but my credit

i had opened that sto wi the finest stock of evething clothing boots n shoes groceries n hardware n s i said trusted my people

the one thats so drunk n noisy i got him out las week when he had received two hundd days on th gang n tday i got his brother out who was locked up friday

why can they not keep out of so much trouble

said wyeth seriously

whiskey the minute they get the pay the first thing they wants is whiskey n then a crap game

and women said wyeth

yes said the other but they wont spend any money on them no that would in one sense be too much like right

what per cent of them do you think who after giving their word as a bond would stand to it a promise you understand

im shame t admit it im shame t admit it but honestly i wouldnt estimate that more than two out of ten could be trusted to keep their word other than t buy a pint a whiskey or shoot dice until they didn have a dime

what effect is the white mans prejudice having upon him directly wyeth inquired

none none in the days of old and even yet the white mans prejudice was very hindersome but as time has wore on and the races have come to expect each other as they know they will be the prejudice of the white man is not near so hindersome as some a ouh people would have you blieve it of cose he added thoughtfully politics is in a way denied him but a great many more can vote than they do if they would pay the poll taxes all in all youll find so much ignorance and ignorance by preference among them and their minds are so polluted with the devil until politics as they are now would not make much difference i sometimes shudder when i look around me and listen to conclude what the race is sometime coming to

you have a large number of churches a hundred odd i think that should act as a great feature toward the moral evolution

very little very little he returned shaking his head sadly for this reason the churches while having of course many good men as their pastors are filled up with more grafters it seems and mean rascals as well until the calling is not fulfilled i dont hesitate t say that there are more grafters among the preachers than any other profession among the colored people in this town and the baptists have and still are building so many little churches until every dime available and unavailable too is used fo this purpose instead of some means to help the chillun

 dont you think figuratively speaking that there are too many negro churches

 course the is acourse why there are more than seventy baptist churches among negroes in the town alone that in itself is an example of the utter selfishness tha pvails heh

how does it come about it seems to me that the organization of the church system must be very loose to permit of such a wholesale building of churches all the time it would seem advisable that if they had fewer churches with better conduct in the administration of those few more good would result

well the baptists are dominated to some extent by the association but it is inadequate in many ways for instance when they rule a pastor out he claims to a handful of devouts and friends that he has been made the goat of a frameup starts him a church in some shack or any other place where he can concentrate a few shouters and continues

and what effect does all this have upon the children

he held up his hand in despair brother brother

that is the sad part the colored child in this town is lucky f he becomes anything else but a criminal before he does anything else his surroundings nâwhats that other thing he stopped short and held his hand to his head

environment

thats it his nvironment is so bad he is surrounded by eve thing conducive t crime n degeneration he sees hears n is brought in contact in his eve day life with all that is evil n learns t drink whiskey befo he gets into pants and now instead of the negro churches concentrating their efforts toward the raising of the child they put all the foce into the preachers lungs trying t convert ole sinnahs that nothin but hell itsef will effect

 a library and y m c a properly conducted might have some effect for the good dont you think

a dead investment fo yeahs t come fo the reason that they would have no incentive to attend either

without clean intelligent parents n better conducted churches such cannot fulfill the purpose

hadnt we better be going called miss palmer at this moment its getting late

the two shook hands as they parted as sidney went over the hill that sloped for a long way down to the car line he did not seem to hear miss palmer and he answered her mechanically

he was thinking thinking of what he had learned in the last hour from john smith merchant

yesmiss latham

three weeks had passed since mildred latham first saw the city she now called home she considered it the only home she ever really had because she had in one person a friend such as she had never felt she would have that friend was constance jacobs daily they went forth together in their work which was the sale of the tempest there was another who was apparently a friend also that was wilson jacobsâbut more of him later

where there is congeniality understanding and sympathy there is happiness to a degree when such is the case every dayâdespite even an arduous task within itself becomes a holiday such were the days which mildred latham experienced constance was like a sister one of those rare creatures whose happiness came in her honest and sincere desire to see that others were happy about her she had found mildred a girl secretive to an unfathomable degree and to say the least strange but withal a personality and a sympathy that was so sincere even devout that she loved her more than her own soul that affection seemed to grow and become more apparent when she saw slowly but truly nevertheless a cloud lifting from the brow of the girl who came to her door in quest of lodging not long since

wilson said she one day do you know can you appreciate how much it means to one to please somebody to make one feel happy relieved and in turn see that person come to know her and see how genuinely she can in turn appreciate what one does

you are dealing in riddles today constance i dont understand hut i will guess is it milâmiss latham

yesâmiss latham whereupon she smiled upon him and then looked away

yes she resumed looking out of the window upon a small garden she was trying to further it is she i think if i know her until the end of my days there will always be something strangeâsomething i do notâcan never understand but in addition to showing a kind regard for the little things it pleases ones heart to do she makes me so happy

she keeps me puzzled said wilson i can never make up my mind about her she is indeed a mystery

i do not as i can see have any clue in guessing who she isâand what she is nor can i even conjecture she is a lady but as you say and have said before there is something about her that one can never understand

he was thoughtful presently he heard his sister

she is an excellent saleswoman although i do not think she was selling the book until she came here i have not asked her she is one of these people who while not forbidding approach yet her manner does not invite questioning but she is a business womanâgirl

i cannot come to see her as a girl and yet in the sense we know her she is not a woman

i finished the book that young man had an extraordinary experience to say the least said wilson

mr carroll has finished the copy i sold him but his sympathies are not altogether with the pioneer he criticises him

hows that oh yes i understand i have heard the same thing from others they see it that the pioneer should have seen the evil and insincerity of the preacher and should have governed his happiness accordingly yes he went on but the pioneer did see that the preacher meant no good he was aware fully aware that he was about to become the victim of an intrigue

but regardless of this fact it must be appreciated that if this grave incident had not come to pass in the life of that young man we would not now have the book

men do not

and women

yes of course he smiled write that kind of book unless their lives have met with extreme reverses something in their souls has gone amiss and as a last resortâ i cant quite find the words to explain it but itâwhat they writeâis a brief of the soul while the public is the court and to this court as in the common court of the land they cry out for justice restitution

well sighed constance whoever this lochinvar is and regardless of his misfortunes writing the book has made one person happy that person is mildred latham

the book is her hobby i would give something to learn why she is so wrapped up in the work but it gives her more pleasure i am sure to show it to someone and tell them the story a dozen times a day than it does some of those levee negroes to get drunk and the work she is simply lost in it she makes the six work days of the week seem like one with her cheerful enthusiasm the very life in itself seems to please her to make readers out of multitudes whove never given reading a second thought seems to be her great ambition she succeeds too and at the end of such days more than at any other time she is like i fancy her to be feminine lovable sympatheticâhuman in all its depths

we certainly struck it rich when she condescended to play for the choir and she can seem to get more out of the organ than anyone has heretofore

she sings too i never knew that she could sing so sweetly until she led last sunday when bernice waverly was ill

she almost made me forget my text

shes coming now whispered constance as upon the narrow walk a familiar footfall sounded presently the screen slammed lightly behind the one of their conversation

ive been clear to the river walked all the way there and back thirty blocks in all she cried cheerfully surveying both smilingly

and after all the walking you did today in delivering constance remonstrated softly you mustnt overdo your good health dear we would both be terribly upset if you were taken down in any way did you know that the other was taken by surprise she was plainly embarrassed for a moment and to dismiss it she plucked childlike at her skirts presently she said lightly always saying something constance and suddenly she flew into the caress of the other i havent become used to such words yet and youll have to be careful in using them because and here she buried her head against the others shoulder i might be likely to boohoo the three laughed it away now

constance tells me miss latham said wilson that you are an agent sophisticated in all the arts that result in a sale his eyes now sought hers with unfeigned admiration

constance is too and did she not mention herself

she rated constance now the least bit severely you never give yourself credit for anything why dont you she frowned but it was too gratefulâher appearanceâto be accepted seriously

how many copies are both of you delivering weekly now he inquired

we delivered eightyseven this week so far and fortyfive last week replied mildred sitting very close to his sister on a small settee

have you ever thought mildred said constance that selling a book or anything for that matter is a task within itself calling always for initiative the average person has not the courage at least he has not practiced it that would make a salesman or saleswoman

all of us with possibly a few exceptions are chattels human chattels the ordinary person would stand on his head on a nail for an hour if someone told him that was right whereas to take upon himself the task of leading anything he is an utter failure

constance is psychological today dont you think

smiled her brother but mildred accepted the words seriously and listened for more constance had a turn of logic and was in the habit mildred had learned of saying some very serious things at times although she could not be regarded as entirely serious

that is why i think you are so successful mildred she went on you seem to be possessed with initiative it seems a part of your construction you seem charged with it and in addition to this is your kind regard and appreciation for anothers point of view

oh please dont tell me so many nice things i cant believe it i have never seen myself in the way you speak of and if you persist dear and her smile upon constance was the softest you might make me vainâ and i would almost rather be anything than vainâand spoil it all here she kissed her a long lingering kiss and then flew to her room

wilson said his sister when they were alone again when i think of the young man and his experiences in the story and his makeup and point of view i find myself connecting mildred she fills my dreams in that story as the one woman how successful and how happy that man could have been had he had a treasure like her for his own

well yes possibly no doubt but if taking the story as it is if he had her now after what has come to pass i judge he could appreciate her real worth to a greater degree dont you agree with me

she was thoughtful a moment before replying yes i think i do it would be different now she was reflective for some time before she went on again the other day i said to her if you had been in the girls place in the story how would you have accepted this father i shall not soon forget how strange she looked her entire being seemed to undergo a change

from the way i recall it her mind seemed to go back into the past and she was so odd for a few seconds that i was sorry i said it then after a moment during which she seemed to struggle with something she said  i would not you may be sure have been like the girl that was all and i said no more nor do i think i will again she actedâah i cant hardly frame it but frankly too peculiar

im going to bed sis said her brother now his eyes were evidence that he should go he was awake now for a moment ive been much interested in what has passed tonight sis ill be glad to talk on the same subject again he was silent a moment and then rising he said good night

good night wilson

then she heard his door close after watching him until he reached his door after that she fell into deep and serious thinking it concerned him he was all she hadâthis brotherâand his future was in her thoughts now a grave concern of hers yes and wilson jacobs was now one and thirty  he had no wifeânot even did he see women in that sense constance didnt think of herself nowânor at any other time apparently

and yet she was twentyeight but she felt if her brother was to be a happy man he should consider his life more seriously he was lost in his purpose mildred latham was a girl the kind of girl she would like to see him take notice of

and then she was jerked back into a sudden reminder

   wilson had been acting different lately how could she for one moment have forgotten it yes he had been acting very differently  he was all attention when mildred was saying anything he was careful never to disturb her and only tonight when they had spoken of her together he had almost called her by her first name

constance jacobs was now oblivious to what was about her she continued to think mildred was kind she was intelligent she wasâand here constance forgot the words mildred had said not an hour before  i cannot stand vanityâbeautiful

she retired presently but it was sometime before she went to sleep

it all falls right back on society

two negroes killed yesterday in the city is the homicide record for this town which makes thirteen killed in the last week said wilson jacobs the following morning as he laid the paper down to take up his knife at breakfast every day at least it is almost every day there is a murder of each other by our people in this town saturday night or sunday usually sees four or five such crimes

isnt it deplorable breathed mildred seating herself at the other side what accounts mr reverend

âshe somehow found it awkward to call him reverendâ jacobs for such acts that is such is to be expected but why does there happen to be so much of it here

 ignoranceâlack of intelligence in our people this city has a preponderance of ignorant polluted people among the negroes they flock into this town from all around and represent the low polluted and depraved element of our race they settle about the levee district spend their earnings for the worst whiskey give the remainder of their time to gambling and all forms of vice and murder is the natural consequence

is there no way there are so many churches it would seem that so many places of worship woidd have a good effect upon these people said the other anxiously

more than a hundred negro churches in this town but they are for the most part churches only seventy of these are baptist and they are building more right along

i meet it every day in my work she said always so many apparently good women mothers and daughters sisters who say i sho would lak t have that book but y see its lak this wes building a new chuch or a rally is on next sunday n all the women is axed t give five dollars n the men ten etc and etc but that is not the most i hear it is lawd lawd honey yu sweet lil chile i sho is sorry to disappint you

i sho is you walkin way up heh n bringin tha book but don you know honey that low down nigga man a mine went off satdy night un got drunk got t fightin and was rested i didn pay no tention when e didn show up asatdy night nor was i woied sunday but when monday mawnin come n no nigga den i knowed de plice done got dat nigga and dey had satdy night fo fightin n sturbin de peace so i done took yo money honey n got dat nigga out n now honey i jes cain say when ill be ready cause e done lost his job too so that means i gotta take cell a both uv us 

 if we allow our minds to dwell too long on it frankly miss latham said he we will become discouraged

where ignorance is bliss it may be folly to be wise but it is unprofitable from a moral point of view so as long as we have a preponderance of ignorance just so long are we going to have a dreadful homicide record in this and other towns

 i read an editorial in the paper recently with regard to murder and the record per city said miss latham

i see that the south leads and this town and effingham seem to struggle for the lead of them all it was not decided as to which had the most but it stated that more people were murdered in either one of them than in any other city in the world regardless of population

and that is not all in both of these cities no data is kept of the number the police kill i know policemen personally and see them on duty who have killed as many as half a dozen negroes

oh be merciful she cried can this really be so

it is so he maintained why last week i stopped a few days in effingham on the way from attalia and read on the front page of one of the leading papers and which was accompanied by a cut that an old policeman who had seen twentyfive years on the force and who had recently been made a captain had never killed a man it was this fact obviously that was the most extraordinary

cannot the city government do more toward the suppression of so much crime she asked forgetting to eat her breakfast

they cannot to any great extent because it is the task of society the very foundation upon which this crime rests is due to ignorance on the part of the masses

you cannot reason with a mind that has no training

have you ever seen it that way he asked more serious now than she had ever seen him before notwithstanding he was a serious person

she nodded

no one can the law of the land cannot it all falls right back on society he was too serious now for a time to say anything and he ate his meal with his face contracted in serious thought presently he said i am a minister of the gospel and have the highest regard for the presbyterian faith but honestly when i see the baptists with their loose system keeping the black population that make up their body and with little almost no effort whatever toward the education of the children and when i see still further the methodists with their better system in that they are not held back so much by splitters i sometimes regret that the world took martin luther seriously for say what they will the conduct of the catholics in regard to the children marriage and divorce has an encouraging result in our civic life

i believe that if there were a christian movement here as there is in the northern cities y m c a and libraries and if those who are leaders of the race would encourage the patronage of these places eventually it would result to the publics good she said after some thought

only one place in the south as yet seems to be making any effort along such christian lines and you would not believe it but the greatest barrier to this has been the preachers in their church effort they have the people fairly well under control but to their own end

in attalia they have almost come to appreciate the fact that a more intelligent and cleaner populace reacts to the welfare of the church everything seems favorable toward getting one

i am sure that would make a great difference in time said she heartily in cincinnati they expect to begin one soon they have almost all the subscriptions in now she was silent for a time and then pursued do you not think such a movement could be stimulated here

not at the present i think regardless of the great need of one and of the great good it could do it will be some time before the preachers would come to lend their supportâin fact i do not think it could be expected until they have been shown in a majority that such would react for the good of all

oh my cried constance entering at this moment you two appear to have worked yourself into a frenzy of excitement she surveyed both questioningly

we have her brother replied

where are you from

mildred worked hard that day as she went from the rear of one house to another she studied the people she met more seriously than she had done before by this time her work had become automatic and she did not find it hard or monotonous to say the same thing over and over again she had moreover become accustomed to the class of people among whom she worked she liked it now and for more than one reason but perhaps the greatest reason was because it brought her into the closest contact with humanity without regard to conventionality the people she met daily with few exceptions made no attempt to be conventional they were human almost all of them she met them in their vocations she studied their environment some she saw grown people with families but themselves like children they gave their word with apparent sincerity and did not make any more effort to keep it than the merest babe why did they not she asked this question and then studied them carefully for the answer it was ignorance it amused her to find so many who were positive they did not want it did not even read so how could they use it but you can read she would inquire sho would invariably come the answer

then came argument force of reason on her part and sometimes she guiltily felt it was by force of argument they were induced to buy she now paid little attention when they remarked that they did not want the book

obviously since the most stubborn ones were very often after argument the most appreciative buyers she found it reasonable to ignore their words of objection

mildreds life was a diversion that was much to her liking she was learning the greatest lesson a woman could learnâthe study of human nature

on sunday when she met others wilson jacobs church had for its members the more thoughtful and respectable negro element she was the recipient of many surprised expressions they were she invariably found surprised that she canvassed among the servant class she did not appraise them of the practical side of it in fact of the masses these were more able to buy

she saw as the sundays went by that much of the display was a pretense many of those who expressed such surprise were themselves unwilling to buy a book

always she found and especially among the teachers whom she thought the most pretentious some artful excuse most of them had a library which contained many books but few by their own race they had the works of a poet who had died some years ago they also had a copy of a book or so by the principal of tuskegee

and then one day she learned from a most reliable and unbiased source that those people bought the works of the now dead poet because his name had become a fetish the white people had accepted these mens work and called them great therefore the negroes had accordingly followed suit so the negro author must first get a white audience which will laud the greatness of his pen and then the negroes will buy calling the book great also

miss latham found conditions thus and governed her work accordingly but as time went on she met surprises they did not buy the tempest but they read it

she found it borrowed among them all they never offered to buy it but they read it nevertheless

she did not understand this at first

so she found the masses often amusing to say the least but often with more active race regard they had the many faults of ignorance easy to influence into giving an order they were still more ready to back out lie out of taking it some of those who took orders and even the books did not read she learned while others could read but did not but when she told them all the story the story of her hero for now she held him thus they were all thrilled and inspired thus it happened that many bought the book because it was by a negro and said as much

mildred latham succeeded in her work and with her success there came to her each day almost every hour thoughts of the one of her dreams this day and others as well she shuddered when she could not forget what he had been told it was worse and more because he had been told the truth it hurt her he was somewhere and he didnt know that she loved him but even if he did he could not accept this knowledge with any delight no he was out of her life or rather she was out of his he would never no never be out of hers

never because as she felt every day it was his memory that stimulated her made her feel and appreciate what great good a life can do and she did all she could in her way to assist others some day maybe she might be able to do more

when she undressed each night to retire she fell on her knees and offered thanks to him that is holy she asked for strength and conviction and courage to continue in the same on the morrow she struggled to lead a christian life and to be acceptable in the eyes of her creator    she was a believer

mildred was welcomed everywhere and treated with all the courtesy due to a lady when she left a house one day where two women had given her their order she overheard them say she was beautiful she felt her heart throbbing she was not vain but she loved to be called attractive then she thought of him he had called her beautiful also she wondered whether he at any time forgot the words he heard and remembered her as he had seen her that day the day they had danced and heâkissed her she seemed to feel still that kiss she hoped to feel it always she wondered if he knew she was working in his memory and made happy thereby would he be pleasedâand would he at least try to forget as much as he could what he had been told

he could of course not forget that made it hard

she did not expect him to forget

when the days work was done and she had returned to her place of abode she lay upon her bed and for a time she gave up to thoughts of him she knew not where he was she did not try to find out that would make it worse sometimes she felt that if she did perhaps it might help her in her picture of him then again she did not think it best that might bring him too conspicuously before her sometimes at night she would suddenly awaken and her very soul would be on fire she sat up at these times and almost declared it could not go on this way she must know his whereabouts he must feel know that she loved him and then when the spell had diedâwas killed for its death was inevitable she would lie down again and try to forget but she never succeeded in this

more than a month had passed since she came hither

she had with the assistance of constance sold more than three hundred copies of the book she had saved the greater part of her earnings she wondered one day as she left a negro bank where she kept it what lie would think of her if he could know she saw him viewing her in many ways as she was now but always she was left undecided never would what he had been told seem to leave her free and undisturbed

one day she returned home very much excited she didnt let constance see her though she had an adventure that day she encountered a man who looked at her strangely when she was offering the book she had seen him in cincinnati and she recognized him by a scar on his forehead but she had not known this until she looked into his face and asked him to give her his order then he started did he recognize her she thought not because she had not known he ever saw her when he used to pass by the house in cincinnati where she then lived when she recognized him this day she had bungled in her talk this fact made him suspicious

he regarded her with undisguised curiosity presently his face cleared and he said you remind me of a girl i once used to see and know in cincinnati where are you from she tried to ignore this question she pretended not to hear him despite this effort she choked he observed it and was convinced that she was the one he had seen and known then she was frightened and of course did the worst thing she could have done she asked to be excused and forthwith fled

she had not gone many steps when she heard him mutter well ill be damned and still before she got beyond the sound of his voice she heard him again the same wonder what kind of a game she is playing here

books hump well ill be damned

she didnt canvass any more that day she couldnt

she was too nervous and afraid then she was upset for other days she feared to meet him she could never again stand that gaze of suspicion all that she had lived suddenly stood before her when she recalled it

night came and she retired early the incident persisted in her memory she was exhausted and then she did what any unhappy girl is most likely to do

she cried all night

even if she felt sidney wyeth had closed the chapter of her in his life she wanted him she needed him to have felt now that lie loved her in spite of what he had heard he could and would protect her he stood before her now and she saw him as she had never seen him before how strong and brave and courageous he was

he was her hero she went to sleep after a time a troubled fitful sleep and when she heard constance calling her the following morning she awoke with a start and was rested although she could not understand how it was possible but she was calm after all she felt maybe her fear was premature

she worked that day with her usual good spirits

but smith is not his real name

owen beasely that was his name and sidney met him while waiting for a subscriber who failed to show up

he was a relative of smiths whom he had met the day before it was two p m the fourth day of july and the colored people as well as the white had retired to a day of delight it was hot and clouds rolled up whitecapped from the west it would rain before night

the weather man said and it did

and so you came from the west said beasely who had been reading the tempest wyeth had seen him working behind the counter and they put aside all formality of introduction wyeth was glad to meet someone to talk to that day he had come out to this suburb under promise of subscribers to take the book

and since every one of them had retracted he was discouraged which is a disagreeable feeling

yes he replied gloomily and the day i return will be one of great happiness i am not particularly in love with being down here anyhow and the sooner i see the plains again that much sooner will i be happy and contented

well drawled the other lazily having been born down here and never having seen the rest of this great domain i do not of course know the difference still i have always cherished a longing to go west i intended going to oklahoma years ago and getting in on some of that government land they were giving away but i put it off until it was too late and then too i had trouble in my family my oldest daughter married a worthless rascal who burdened her with those children you see playing about the store and i had to take care of them and her too since her marriage left her in bad health

the other listened without comment beasely however went on apparently in a mood to relate the past

smith has been telling me about you and i have been anxious to have a talk with you smith is my brotherinlaw and he too has had his share of trials

by this time they had settled themselves on the porch of an empty quarter house wyeth chanced to look around and seeing so many empty ones said how does this come to be so many empty houses

bulgarians lived in this row he said pointing to them hundreds of them and when the war broke out in the balkan states every last one of them left here and went back to fight and have not returned

some patriotism eh wyeth commented

it is singular about these foreigners he said thoughtfully have you ever observed them

the other nodded beasely went on

they come to this country without knowing a word of our language and from a poor country but they are not here ten years before they are able financially to buy a car load of our people negroes are certainly a problem to themselves these foreigners always have money and many of them return to the old country and retire after a few years of just ordinary hard work here while many of our people at the same job if they get sick a week are on the county

clerking in a store where the trade is of the kind we have he went on is an opportunity for the best study in human nature you can possibly imagine a man like smith for instance can succeed with the trade of his people when he can get it smith has succeeded on the heels of his own failure

it appears harder for one of us to succeed than for any other race now doesnt it commented wyeth

it does it does indeed said beasely somehow the money gets through our fingers despite our efforts to hold it

this morning said sidney i had an experience that amused me i had the promise to take a book to a certain fellow in averytown i called accordingly with the same but he had just left his family didnt rather couldnt tell me where i was likely to find him i came on up the street that leads here and made inquiries on the way every one who knew him gave me the same advice if they said he is not home just go to every saloon between here and there and you will be sure to find him i did so and found him at the second one

and did he take it asked beasely

oh i hadnt thought of it since no he didnt take the bookâbut i think he will he had no money and when i approached him he went to the commissary took a scrip and got some groceries these he took to somebody and sold them a dollar and a half worth for a dollar he then gave me a quarter and told me to bring it next pay day af ter a moment he said  smith is an exceptional business man for a negro and an interesting man to talk to

yes smiled the other but smith is not his real name he took that after coming here and since we have spoken of it im going to tell you the story of john smith alias thomas rollins he laughed as his voice very dramatic in what he had just said came back to him

the other listened and prepared himself to do so comfortably while beasely mopped his forehead drew his breath and prepared to tell the following story

beasely was a black manâa full bloodâand intelligent

nearly fifty years he seemed to be although at a passing glance he would have passed for forty he had been a school teacher and had some education wyeth had observed from his careful use of english

we lived in palmetto georgia where he married my sister he was then a farmer and pastor of the baptist church while i farmed and taught the local country school he had been in politics quite actively in the eighties and early nineties as were many other negroes during the reconstruction period and had served as postmaster for four years now in this town were what is called a bunch of pet negroes these were coons whom the white people used as local goats for their amusements

and so to speak they were a sort of privileged character but became too familiar as everywhere in the south this town had its herd of the poor trash that kept things stirred up in the way of lynching and other lawlessness

considerable incendiarism had occurred of late and some of these pets were accused friction had been evident for some time in this county and all around and with this burning and accusations a wholesale lynching took place about a dozen of these pets were herded into a box car and burned alive it was the most diabolical thing that could be perpetrated by human beings and created much comment all over the country it drove hundreds of negroes out of the county and you will find them scattered over the rest of the state and other parts now sometime after this a strange negro came to town and hung around smiths place for a while he secured a job finally with a white man who was one of the men who led the mob it seems one day he overheard him relating how they burned the pets this crazed the negro or it might have been that one of the victims was a brother of his who knows well this negro took an ax marched into the room and without a word split open the mans head

 he made his escape pandemonium reigned lynching by hanging and burning at the stake became common and a general state of lawlessness reigned for some time

now after this negro had killed the man he came by smiths and got the clothes smiths cook had washed for him he threatened her with death if she ever said anything about it well a lot of the poor crackers had become jealous of smith anyhow and they tried to implicate him in it while he knew nothing about it smith stood well with the best white people but when any friction comes up in these parts the cracker is supreme because he has the numbers so while the mob spirit was still prevalent they decided to give vent to their jealousy and called on smith with a dark purpose they charged him with having furnished this negro with an ax and instructions to kill the cracker so they were on the way to see him when i warned him at church one sunday morning preparing to preach a sermon he hurried home grabbed a few things and left the state as fast as he could leave it

that is how smith came to be in this country and doing business but there is another part of this chapter and which brings us up to the present

a negro worked for smith back there and after the thing had died out and people there saw that he was wrongly accused this negro came on here and since then this has been his home having known him back there smith trusted him in the store here and continued to trust him until he was head over heels in debt to him

there came a day when smith was tired of this and called him to account the negro then instead of paying like a man or making an effort to do so howled his head off and was surprised or professed to be he told smith that he was repaid from the fact that he had kept his mouth closed about his past his changing his name and all that in conclusion he threatened to tell the world or that part of it in which smith and himself were known now if smith had told all this in the beginning it would of course have been different but having deferred it so long he naturally hated to have it told and flaunted in his face by the negroes here you know too how negroes like to hear anything envious and spiteful as they are by nature it was a nasty affair and to hush it up smith let the bill go hang but this was not to be the end of it by any means oh no this negro had the nerve to come back into the store and ask for more credit then smith with his nigga aroused stood his ground the negro then got drunk fighting drunk he found an old revolver that had been lost for years in a trash heap and ran smith all over town it wouldnt shoot of course but smith didnt know that

the crowd finally got around the negro and held him while he raged and swore smith went to the phone declaring he was going to call the officers the negro yelled that if he didâhe knew smith desisted but then into it came my sister his wife she has spirit and was now thoroughly aroused and with a big fortyfive lefthand wheeler she sought this shine when the people that were holding him saw her coming they turned him lose and flew when they did she began to shoot and shot to hit she missed but she picked the dirt all about him and he did some running

after that the negroâhe had been doing fairly well outside what i have mentionedâbegan to go down

whiskey and craps got all his money and then he parted with his wife but he still had it in for smith and it had come to smith and me too that he intends telling it all at the ball game today moreover that he will kill his wife if she plays ball or attempts to today smiths nigga is up and he is going to the ball game and if that negro starts anything on that diamond look out

im afraid of these negroes down here myself said wyeth a few nights ago i was standing on a corner in effingham when one of them came up the street slapping his wife or woman or whatever she was something outrageously i felt constrained to punch him in the jaw the brute especially when she ran around a bunch of us trying to escape the blows he was raining on her face i didnt and some time later i was talking with a cop that patrols that beat i told him of the incident thats nothing he said i started to punch him i said youd better not punch any of these negroes he warned theyll shoot you down like a dog this is effingham  well said beasely im going to the game myself to have a hand in the affair if he starts anything

wanta go long

since he had nothing to do he decided that it would be a good outing and some diversion so rising he followed as they started a ragged dirty negro rushed up he wanted beasely being unable to locate smith to let him have ten dollars to get his brother out of jail who had gotten into a squabble down in a saloon and got run in

let him stay there until tomorrow and we wont have to get him out but once if he is gotten out today hes liable to be in again before the day is spent replied beasely carelessly the other went his way with mutterings

they had not gone far before they came upon another

he had a load a heavy load so heavy that he could scarcely make it however with a superior effort he managed to drag his feet along and join them

abe thomas remonstrated beasely you are a disgrace to yourself and the human race the other accepted the rebuke in good nature he declared that since it was the fourth he was entitled by the law of the land to get drunk and convince the public to that effect

the fourth don come but once a yeah he said

but im a good guy all the time n all the time fifty years ive been in this world and dont look forty he didnt which was an odd thing thought wyeth

say beasely lend me a dollar he exclaimed

wyeth was again surprised for beasely without a word but a laugh full of humor drew forth a silver dollar and handed it over

as they walked along leisurely wyeth remarked about the crops which did not appear to be doing much good in the highlands

you know why that is said their companion winking wisely thats because all this land about here is undermined and the water goes on through

wyeth looked at him he looked back at wyeth and winked you are philosophical indeed said he how far is it to the mines below

three hundred feet beasely replied

and between that is all kinds of rock hard pan and shale

oh sure replied the other but what has that to do with it

wyeth looked at him but the other didnt gather what the expression meant so he said jok you are full

they were passing into a cut and he saw at a glance the reason for the plant suffering about two to six inches from the surface was a thick layer of jip which as he knew prevented the water from going into the subsoil to come up when the sun had dried the surface and furnish nourishment to the roots further argument was not necessary for as they came out of the cut a saloon smiled before them and into this their companion disappeared

when they arrived at the grounds thousands had preceded them and the same was black with people enjoying a holiday the diamond had been cleared and preparations were in order for opening of the game

the contestants were a set of school boys and girls and women in fact any girl or woman that could be prevailed upon for the occasion the sun now in the west could be seen only at intervals as it hung suspended above the heavy treetops the air was unusually still and humid the heat was intense but notwithstanding the fact the future american negro seemed to be getting all that a holiday afforded

popcorn and crackerjack lemonade and cocacola barbecue and fried fish were being consumed by the crowd in every direction in large quantities and all seemed to be happy

at last the preliminaries were over the game was called on every base in the pitchers box the catchers and in the field stood black girls gayly they flitted about and caught the ball cleverly as it was thrown from one to the other

play ball called the umpire

everyone had his eye upon the game a strapping woman wound up like a professional and let drive a swift ball that went far to the right of a left hand batter

ball one cried the umpire

frow lak a ole maid cackled a bigmouthed negro who was immediately hooted down

strike one cried the umpire slapping his thigh giving vent to a big laugh as the batter swung wildly at the ball just missed

dat gals got some speed blieve muh cried another negro who was a good support

wno dat gal inquired another at this point

don you know er someone else replied dats bobb lees wife dey is pated y know

wyeth started bobb lees wife bobb lee was the negro beasely had told him about  and he had threatened to kill her if she played ball this day she was playing he felt a strange pulling at his nerves as he watched her and his imagination began to play he was afraid of these negroes even if they did nothing they could so far as he had learned be depended upon to commit murder no one perhaps paid much attention to a negros threat but he didnt feel just right in the stomach a chilly feeling was creeping upward and held him he looked about him for a moment he had forgotten the game the men were now on the bases while the girls were swinging in many ways at the ball

the wife of bobb lee was there at the bat around him the crowd watched her closely expectantly he did likewise

ball one cried the umpire the woman was a stout negress with square broad hips and was conspicuous in the green uniform two balls and one strike were against her when the fourth came whizzing across the plate she struck it with terrific force that sent it just over the heads of all and beyond the fielders making a clean home run as well as bringing in two girls that were on bases the cheering that followed was deafening

for a time sidney forgot the threats of the bad negro

again the wife of bob lee was pitching more speed had developed since last she held the ball and she was apparently more clever she hurled the ball across the plate so swiftly that the crowd could hardly see it nor could the batters whom one by one she fanned two balls and two strikes she had on the last one wyeths gaze wandering across the diamond observed john smith standing to the other side and again the words of beasely came to his memory he wished the thought and the threat would not so persist he tried to concentrate his mind on the game but the words lingered

during his whole life sidney now recalled he was peculiarly given to predestination if he had not seen anyone he had known for some time and happened to meet him he could always recall that he had just thought of him a few days before or it might have been only a few hours before strangely as he watched the game there came to him a premonition that something was going to happen he felt it so strongly that he stood waiting for it it was only a question of a little while

the wife of bob lee had raised her arm and was winding up for the last throw when suddenly from across the field in the crowd came a cry as of some one mad enraged in the still humid air the cry of a woman resounded and fell upon the ears of the crowd like a cry of death there was a shot and so quiet did every one appear at the moment that the noise it made sounded like a cannon a woman rushed upon the diamond and fell prone on her face with a last scream that disturbed the quiet

clouds had been gathering overhead for some time and now they overcast the skies the sunlight with all its brightness of a few minutes ago had faded it became so dark that the people could scarcely see across the diamond heavy peals of thunder added now to the darkness while flashes of lightning struck electrically all about the crowd stood awestruck the woman in the box had lowered her arm and was looking wildeyed at the woman who had fallen prostrate at her feet and then through the still air came again the cry of the beast

ah tole yu f yu played ball agin ahd kill yu

ahve killed yu doity sista in the stands you n the is john smith who run away frum palmetto geogi n whose real names tom rollins and with that the woman gave a long lingering cry that frightened all those about they turned in one great mass the revolver sounded another shot and with scarcely a groan the woman staggered for a moment and fell to the ground dead for just a second it seemed the crowd tearing wildly about halted and turned their eyes upon the two dead women and as they did so the murderer turned wildly in the direction of where smith had stood but he was gone in a blind fury the drunken brute whirled around dazed yelling whaishe damn him wha is he

im heah you beast roared smith in a terrible voice the other had just time to see him but too late to do further murder john smith was on him in an instant and all the strength of his powerful frame seemed to come to him in that moment he snatched the smoking weapon from the hand of the brute and raising it to the length of his large arm while the other at last sensitive to the moment saw it as it lingered one brief instant with eyes the sight of which sidney wyeth did not soon forget it fell crushing the skull a mad herd now the crowd rushed upon the fallen creature and did the rest

just then the heavens opened up with a mighty crash of thunder and there came a flash of lightning that made trees tremble while the rain came down in torrents

sidney returned to the city by the first car the incident rose before him again and again as the car crept along in the downpour he had seen the first murder of his life which however was an almost daily occurrence in effingham when he reached his room and related the incident it caused less excitement than when he once witnessed a gambling raid and related it

no one took murder seriously in effingham

they kill a nigga every day on an average in this town grinned moore when he read the papers the following morning he had about given up finding it at all when his eyes came across a small paragraph in the corner reporting that a drunken negro had killed his wife and sisterinlaw which added to the list of casualties making eleven for the day in effingham all were homicides no deaths from other sources were reported

as sidney wyeth now saw it the people might have prosperity and they might have happiness likewise they might suffer reverses and be in hard straights for a time but of one thing there seemed a certainty that as long as whiskey was available crime would be prevalent in effingham

sidney wyeth had never voted for prohibition as he saw it now in attalia where it was not sold legally and in effingham where it had this permit there seemed but one conclusion only when they stopped making it would these ignorant semibarbarous creatures quit drinking it

and thus we find conditions in one of our great american cities where there is forty per cent of illiteracy among twofifths of the populace

having sent for a considerable consignment of books and due to the inability to collect from a number who spent their money on the fourth sidney found his finances depleted room rent by paying in advance was due the following monday so taking himself to one of his subscribers among the servants he was able to collect only a dollar that day half of this he divided with his landlady promising to pay her the remainder on the morrow

he did so but john moore desired to question in regard to the same the truth of it was that john moore wanted the dollar and had figured on it in order to shoot craps on saturday night as was his usual custom

so john came into the room where sidney sat reading

it happened that wyeth was in no pleasant frame of mind and calling was thus not in order that evening

perhaps john moore did not know this but he did a few minutes later he wished to know what wyeth was going to do about the rent

wyeth looked at him it wasnt a very pleasant look to say the least and wyeth was one of these creatures who could not stand to be dunned since he had already made arrangement with the real person he regarded moore out of eyes now that narrowed with anger he said something sharp and quick and stinging thereupon a storm ensued

i aised you a civil question complained moore

and i tell you that i have already arranged with the landlady regarding the rent and dont want any argument with you

then i ais you to git yo things and get out cried moore with an air of finality

and i tell you that i will do no such thing moreover you insofar as im concerned cried wyeth heatedly can go to hell

look out look out cried moore im acomin im acomin

not very fast as i can see standing there in the doorway said wyeth now composed and reseating himself from where he had risen and yet he felt as he had never felt before like fightingâwith his fists

hole me mary hole me cried moore moving many waysâin the doorway the other waitedâin vain

come ova he from attalia a bad nigga n tellin me what i ain gon do n mah house he cried now derisively stay yes stay n be killed cause f you sleep in this house tnight you gon sleep ova mah dead body

oh but youre an awful liar smiled sidney grimly

he arose from his chair and moved in the direction of moore whereupon that worthy moved in the opposite direction a negro like you aint going to fight anyone and talk about your dead body hump if you had any idea i was going to kill you youd be a mile away by this time and still running as it is i am going to stay in this house until i get ready to leave or at least until i am ordered out by the landlady with this he jumped forward quickly and caught moore by the nose which was to say the least a difficult task

he pinched it hard and then with well directed licks he slapped his face with his open palm then giving his nose another pinch that made the creature scream with pain he pushed him with such force that he fell backward into the other room a moment later sidney slammed the door and resuming his seat picked up the book and began reading

they were good friends ever after

it was her delight to show them by a demonstration whenever she could she had proven all this to sidney wyeth and he had thought it practical in her he had said as much but he would have said as much to any other no doubt and of the many good things we now know of miss palmer let us not forget that she was selfish to a degree

unfortunately many of us are but when miss palmer became the recipient of such kind words from the lips of this man of mystery for as such she regarded him and believed it she was subtly delighted so she had done all she could as a saleswoman of the book she was positive he had written to prove further her ability to help him  today they would be all alone together

she had looked forward to the same with all the anxiety of the anxious and the day had come at last and such a day

she dressed in her best for the occasion we shall not attempt to describe her but when she appeared at the end of an hour she was a delight to observe  indeed

exclaimed wyeth frankly i didnt know you could look so well

why are you fiat she complained with a frown and then she added softly you could be otherwise

we will catch the tidewater and get off at jewell junction and take the relay that will take us to the summit of baldin knob from there you can see everything this state possesses for fifteen miles she said as they walked cheerfully in the direction of the car line

never had either experienced such a delightful ride as the heavy tidewater cars gave them that morning the relay unloaded them forty minutes later at the highest peak of which the red mountains boast below lay effingham the iron city a medley of smoke and many little points only the blast of the furnaces and the heavy smoke they belched forth met their gaze as they saw it now it seemed hardly possible that it was a city of so many thousands it seemed so small at this distance a mass of uneven timber appeared all about and below them and far away were a thousand peaks

broken by hundreds of ravines and draws that split and tore the mighty range they saw the city beyond a dull haze as of indian summer hung in the distance as their gaze sought the horizon

then they walked down a slope to a spot they had seen she stepped on a rock that lay buried beneath many leaves and turned her ankle so severely that he feared it had been sprained it hadnt but as a precaution he took her arm and that perforce brought them closer together thus they walked until at the foot of a pine lay a fallen tree conveniently they sat themselves thereon and leaning their backs against the tree for a minute possibly more they heard their own breathing

after saying many things that meant nothing she said now you are going to tell me all about yourself today arent you she ended this beautifully and waited likewise his reply was not gallant if such it could be but he merely added there is little to tell miss palmerâso little im sure telling it would be dull for you to listen to

you have beautiful ways of saying anything she said and gave him her best smile he looked at her now but without any apparent enthusiasm his smile was a little tired and weary and sad very often he was this way

do you know miss palmer now said you have impressed me wonderfully

i didnt im sure but you are complimentary

he was now a mite more cheerful in what way i beg have i impressed you in that i can sell books

i dont mean that and you know i do not she pouted and you can be so innocent when you want to be oh you are artful but i mean if i must say it and then explain why there is something about you that is unusual you are in disguise going through the country studying people yes people and what they are have been and are likely to be she was thoughtful now as she sat in serious mood for some time presently she said ive been reading that book and of course i understand you better is all that you say in it true

she was serious now and anxious too she waited eagerly for him to speak

he laughed then he said nothing in the affirmative but indulged in words concerning other topics

you are more than a book agent you have at least been a man of means really i would be pleased to know from your own lips she now sighed

i wish we could talk of something else that would be more interesting cannot you suggest something

he turned to her now appealingly

i cannot yourself is the most interesting thing i care to talk about i have been thinking of the terrible secret you disclose in the book wont you please tell me if it is all true

i suppose if the book is published as a true story then it must be so he said evasively

and she was a weak woman no strength and conviction nothing to protect a home you and she will not remain as you are will you silence there is nothing the matter with youâand her i sympathize with this fellow miss palmer was more serious now

because apparently he wanted tried to do the right thing and was not allowed  i know somebody else that wished to do likewise and was not allowed   

life is a strange thing isnt it

indeed so he agreed

and on this pilgrimage you study the lives of others many others and it reveals so much to you that would could not be possible otherwise

he agreed with her again

and on this pilgrimage you have met women and you have studied them and their way of seeing things

possibly they are all in the same category

yes but somebody said i bet that fellow has so many girls i didnt agree with them i dont think you have any you are too preoccupied to give them serious thought perhaps that is why the girl allowed herself to be taken away   

he now looked at her his lips for one moment had started to speak and then he seemed to think better of it and said nothing

everyone i sell the book to cries when they have read it if i had been that fellow id have kicked that old preacher into hades its what you tell in the last part of the book that arouses the people but they all think he acted with poor judgment in the end but if he hadnt allowed that to come to pass i would never have known you miss palmer was tantalizing

out in this rosebud country of which the story is told are there no colored people

none

i should think it would be dreadfully lonesome

why so the white people are kind and sociable

yes but i would prefer my kind still i suppose if one lived there and had their all there it would be different

yes he agreed it would be different

you will no doubt marry one of the many girls you meet before you return and then live happily ever afterwards

that is nice to listen to nice girls that is girls who are willing to sacrifice to an end that would help both are to say the least hard to find

yes in a sense but there are plenty and all want husbands of course when you have been widowed grasswidowed its different   

well yes but i see no reason if she is the right kind of girl why she cannot remarry and be happy in the end

oh you dont she essayed well there is a woman is never regarded as the same the looks she gets are not like the ones bestowed upon her when she or before she married they are looksâlooks that are not honest she sighed he was silent

and the men are the cause of it all of it sometimes i hate men

he saw her now calmly she was uneasy under the look he gave her and then he was silent again she went on of course there are some that are different yourself for instance

in what way

so many i hardly like to say so unassuming for one and then youâoh i wont say it

please do

not until you have told me more about yourself

has it occurred to you that you have told me nothing absolutely nothing about yourself she was looking at him now he winced

of course if a woman isâisâwell easy enough to go into the mountains and on an outing with the manâa man who has told her nothing of himself then itâhe cannot be censured she watched a pine squirrel now that played near and who regarded them out of eyes that made miss palmer feel guilty

you are like a stone wall when it comes to secrets

did you ever really love anyone

yes

oh you dont mean it she cried in feigned surprise who was it

you would be no wiser if i told you

at this moment a blast in a mine near which they did not see went off it broke the silence so sharply that both sat quickly upright in doing so their hands met his clasped hers in a moment the tension was released but the hands were not slowly their hands clasped each others tighter he was in some way conscious of the fact while she was dreamy he looked by chance into her eyes and they were more dreamy still

their shoulders touched she sat at his left and it happened singularly to be his right hand that held hers

in that moment they seemed to feel lonely very lonely

both had sufferedâand to a degree their suffering had been similar to give up and to be human unconventionally so for just a little while seemed a mad desire

she swayed perceptibly suddenly his left arm stole about her waist and encircled her body mechanically he looked down and into her eyes that were upturned

they seemed to tell the secret behind to be loved for one minute was what they asked he lingered a moment and then his head went down when it had retained its former position and was erect he had kissed miss palmer

he was standing now and was looking down upon effingham it lay silent and gray from where he saw it

in that moment he wanted to be back there he felt guilty he turned and beheld miss palmer he felt more guilty than before she lay against the tree with her face turned the other way he felt very sorry for her then yes miss palmer would he believed do the right thing she would he glad to do the right thing

oh she had had her troubles and sidney wyeth knew that when people had suffered especially when it had been their great ambition to do the right thing and be happy they would go through eternity to make happiness possible he spoke now

dont you think we had better be going miss palmer she heard him and his voice was kind she thought she rose and together they went back over the hill and caught the relay

im worried about mildred

wilson im worried im worried about mildred

something is haunting that girl something has been haunting her for days she says nothing of course but i can see i cant help but see she is worried almost to insanity so constance said to her brother some days after mildred met the man who saw her in cincinnati

i wonder what it can be said he thoughtfully

id give anything to know she sighed the only thing i know is that she is worried i dare not ask her she is not inviting in her demeanor when it comes to confidences she seems to be looking for something simply uneasy always and hesitant some days she seems to dislike to go canvassing in fact for some time now she has been nervous every time she ventures out

i wonder whether it would not be advisable to ask her to lay off a few days

i have thought of that said she but she has so many deliveries to make that she is almost compelled to go out every day and then if what she fears is to happen im sure she would be more worried if she stayed in

im willing to do anything to help mildred she looked at him but they were both too preoccupied to take notice of the fact that he had called her by her first name

the only time i can seem to get her away from that worried tired expression is when i play she listens and becomes at least for a time oblivious to her troubles

by day mildred when she was canvassing hourly expected to meet again the man whose recognition had frightened her but the days went by without further encounter and when she failed to meet him she began to relax she was worried constantly but she was relieved after two weeks the fright had passed and she was cheerful again much to the relief of her two friends

it had pained her to see that both were obviously worried on her account and she respected them because they were considerate enough not to ask her questions that would have annoyed her

you sang that beautifully miss latham said wilson one afternoon when she left the piano after singing a song that had been introduced lately into church services and which while sentimental nevertheless possessed more thrill than the average

do you think i can satisfy the congregation now

she asked sweetly she had been practicing it for several afternoons

i should say you could he cried enthusiastically

you could satisfy any congregation much less our little crowd he looked sorrowful as he said this she understood the great majority did not attend his services they went to the big baptist church two blocks away many of them even smiled when they passed his little church and observed the few people sitting therein mildred sympathised with him because she realized that he was a courageous young man willing to go to any extent so far as effort was concerned in order to help those about him they needed it too these black people

oh she cried so kind that he choked you will have a larger church some day i am confident you willâi know you will and she meant all she said  in time the people will come to appreciate your efforts

as it is now they dont think deep enough to do so

they want sermons as yet that make them feel by merely listening whereas it is necessary to study what you say    that makes it difficult now when the people become more intelligent more practical and more thoughtful they will appreciate religion in a practical sense he was overwhelmed with gratitude as he heard these words for a moment he couldnt speak

he felt the tears come

you are so kind miss latham you seem to understand and see below the surface and what you have said is timely i am one you may be sure who appreciates it he stopped here

a choking which he didnt wish her to notice made it necessary she was aware of the gratitude the sincere gratitude in his tone and her sympathy went out to him more than ever as she saw him sitting there with head bowed and face hid he seemed his mothers boy she felt strangely that other part impulsively she advanced to where he sat by the window with the sunlight streaming in upon him in the bright soft light his curly hair shone and seemed more beautiful than she had noticed it before she laid her hand upon it an hour ago she would not could not have dreamed she would do this

and then she spoke in words the kindest he felt he had ever heard

there now it will be all right just give yourself time oh its a great struggle this human problem

all these black ones of ours but you are pursuing the right course and some day they will see it then will come your success its going to come it will come

it must come these people cant keep on going along as they are this crimeâmurder its terrible someone will help to stem the tide of it someone will lead them they need leaders they are not bad people with all we see and now know of them they simply need some one to lead them into the light i feel you will be that person yes i am sure you are the person

she paused a moment and it was only then she became aware that her hand still rested upon his head

she removed it now and silently left the room

i love her i love her cried wilson jacobs oh god lead me for i know not whither i go

it was the first time in his thirtyone years that wilson jacobs had felt so but he was a man and the fact made him respect mildred latham the more not for anything would he have her know his secret after this she had thought of him in no other way but to help him

that was all he would have to go forth now with a secret from constance even

he studied his text for the coming sunday and prepared himself to preach as he had never preached before

here is an example of how much our people down here desire a y m c a miss latham said reverend jacobs later you may recall that last spring the colored people of grantville which had a population in the last census of one hundred ten thousand people almost forty thousand being colored made a great campaign to secure a y m c a he laid before her a negro journal published weekly at grantville she picked it up and read the whole article

it went into detail concerning the campaign that was made to secure a y m c a for the colored youth of grantville she had been interested in the campaign and knew that in a few days thirtythree thousand dollars and more had been subscribed the publishing house that printed this paper had issued a daily of sixteen pages during the campaign and had heralded the spirit of the colored people in their liberality they had been liberal indeed but it was only in subscribing the paying was different quite different

after six months only something over four thousand dollars of that amount had been paid in the building equipped would cost one hundred thousand dollars a millionaire jew the head of one of the greatest mail order houses in the country would give twentyfive thousand dollars the white y m c a gave an equal amount from other sources seventeen thousand dollars were forthcoming the colored people were expected to raise the remainder it had been oversubscribed but only four thousand had been paid in six months had passed and she knew although the paper was optimistic and had no other thought apparently than that the colored people would raise the amount subscriptions would be paid slower now than before she did not know what to say when she had read the article

do you realize what they are up against

yes she said resignedly

and they do not seem to know it

no

its discouraging

she nodded

it would be no trick at all for any of a dozen churchs in the town to raise four thousand dollars in sixty days in a rally she remained silent but listened and knew that he spoke the truth

they have hundreds of churches all over the south that have cost in actual money one hundred thousand dollars and they have paid the amount without assistance from other sources whereas the white people are offering sixty thousand dollars of this amount

and i gather said she in a voice that was listless that grantville with its many schools and much more intelligent colored people is far more likely to succeed in such an effort than this town

he nodded

but this place needs it it needs it badly it needs a y m c a worse than any town in the southâ

in the world he insisted

and you do not think it would be worth while to inaugurate a campaign for that purpose here before long

he sighed sadly and then grew thoughtful

last week the number of murders exceeded any previous week for two years   

and over one hundred negro churches have preaching in them every sunday

and from what i can learn these murders are rarely mentioned in any

i have been thinking for a long timeâbefore you cameâof a y m c a for our people in this town but i have never spoken of it but since i have known and talked with you miss latham and have seen the way our people are conducting themselves i have been constrained to take up the effort of securing one he said this very calmly with no undue excitement

have you mr jacobs she made no attempt to use the clerical term her tone was eager anxious

yes he repeated i have decided to begin at once regardless of the discouraging spectacle of grantville

oh im so glad she sighed relieved

he looked at her but said nothing he knew that she would be glad to hear it he was glad though that she had spoken

yes he resumed i have discussed the matter with the heads of three of the big trunk lines operating in and out of this town and all of whom have shops here that hire black men and as you might of course expect they are all in favor of it they have moreover advised me that they will bring such a movement to the attention of the board of directors they have further advised me however that i must not expect to exceed five thousand dollars from either and not to be disappointed if the board failed to give anything at all

that they explained and i understood without explanation was due to the financial conditions of the railroads i have met the same response from other local interests but by them all i have been encouraged

of course the white y m c a are agreeable to giving assistance as in other towns and have given me to understand that they will put in twentyfive thousand dollars

and then the chicago philanthropist of course has a like amount awaiting but the time limit expires in six months

from these i have gone to our people

you went she held her breath now

to those others the preachers

and they were

against it almost to a man

god be merciful

of course all of them did not say so in so many wordsâin factas you might expect yes brother this town sure needs a y m c a but when cooperation was suggested to that end quibbling began most of them not a bit original put forward the same excuse too busy all were preachers yet too busy to save souls

then of course the next excuse was their church was loaded up with debt they were now preparing a rally to raise such and such an amount and still others had just closed a rally which meant their flock was strapped and would be until another rally and there are three churches in this very town that cost equally as much as this thing all told

next i tried the teachers the professors of course were full of the idea i found only two however who had paid enough attention to the effort in grantville to know that the people were likely not to succeed

these i was glad to hear spoke of this fact and we then discussed the matter from a serious point of view

have you not found ignorance a great stumbling block she inquired

the greatest in a measure i think to be ignorant means that they will be easily discouraged when they discover the obstacles

when do you intend beginning the campaign

sunday i have prepared a speech to that end for that day but of course i would have to concentrate a greater effort before it can be started with any effect

i have however prepared an article rather several articles and which the newspapers the white dailies have agreed to publish conspicuously but before we can expect much from the white people we will ourselves have to show greater activity that is where the hard part comes it is hard to arouse the local leaders to any appreciation of such a thing there is so much surface interest and so little heart enthusiasm so many will say a lot of sweet things that mean nothing not even an effort to be serious but i shall open the campaign sunday and i was thinking of asking your assistance in singing and playing

oh id be only too glad to help in any way i know how but that is so little she said bashfully

we will start only in a small way i have thought it best to begin with my congregation i hatfe been to them all and have already secured liberal subscriptions all of whom paid a part of it in cash this i will employ as a means of stimulating others so sunday at three p m i will lecture on it and ask subscriptions detailing first those who have already subscribed

what is my balance please inquired mildred the next afternoon at the window of the paying teller

one hundred fifty said the cashier who looked surprised

i wish to withdraw it and you may make it into a draft payable to the colored y m c a

his mouth opened slightly he regarded her with a different look and then did as she instructed

a fairly good crowd greeted wilson jacobs when he got up to speak on the proposed campaign for a colored y m c a to cheer the listeners he asked miss latham to play and sing the song she had practiced and which was new to the congregation she did so with all the art of which she was capable and was pleased when she turned to face the audience that she had given both pleasure and satisfaction her eyes wandered over them for a moment and then rested upon someone she had seen before

where was it she mused in a half whisper wilson jacobs was speaking for two hours he spoke in behalf of the christian forward movement he made plain in so many ways the urgent need of such and did this eloquently he arraigned the high murder record which made all of those before him feel alarmed the time for some united effort was necessary eventually something had to be done plenty of churches it was true were open but churches were arranged for worship and not for clean sport pool billiard gymnasiums and other amusements in which young men might indulge would indulge and did indulge but in so many ways and places that were not conducted in a christian manner

and now he said at the close we have decided to start this movement today at home we will be pleased to make an example we hope the other churches will follow with that he read the names of the donners and subscribers among them one hundred fifty dollars by mildred latham the organist led in cash they were surprised very few had even become acquainted with her now all desired to when the meeting had closed many gathered about her and were introduced

then as she was turning to go the person she had observed when she finished playing approached his hand was extended while his eyes looked into hers with something that frightened her when she saw himâand recognized him as the man she had seen back in cincinnati and who now recognized her

when she went home that day she had reached a decision

and then she began to grow otherwise the week following miss palmers and sidneys outing was a week of conflictions for her she was torn by them considerably she hardly knew how to feel whether to be happy or angry with herself for having acted as she did he was kind to her he was considerate but that was all she had exercised all her wits to make him see her seriously but beyond that incident he had given her no encouragement whatever she felt guilty at her conduct she accused herself of having acted unbecoming in her attitude toward him although he would not admit having written the book which had aroused her curiosity she of course knew that he had she had finished it now and knew all he had suffered and as she thought it over time and again she almost concluded that his life as he had suffered made him hard and unsympathetic and almost in the same thought she rebuked herself for feeling that way because above all else he was certainly not selfish

he called almost every evening when he had finished his work and they sat on the porch in the swing if there was no one and when there happened to be they sat in the parlor on the davenport and when they did so it so happened they began to flirt and this continued to develop until it reached a point she declared to be outrageous and yet it persisted at such times moreover she became bold there came a time when she was almost disgusted with herself for being so weak

after a few weeks had passed she came to realize that her quest was in vain sidney wyeth had no affection beyond flirting with her and then she began to grow otherwise he observed the change and was sorry perhaps still miss palmer did not give up entirely she was not that kind of person after all to kiss him and to be kissed in return was some pastime it was better than not being kissed or loved at all so she flirted

after this became the usual thing in their acquaintance she began to assert other dispositions that had not before been evident she inquired boldly where he went when he didnt call in the evening as usual she dictated where he should go as well in desperation she continued her tacticsâeven to a point where our pen is constrained to relate

do you know said she one evening when they had flirted shamefully im beginning to care for you

she said this from his knee

i did not he sighed he was not the least excited by her acknowledgement

i am she affirmed more and more as the days go by she smiled into his face while he looked tired

have you anyone back where you came from who loves you and calls you her all she asked now as though she could think of nothing else to say

no no no he looked distressed i wish i had

he added

i know you tell what is not trueâfeel you do she corrected after a pause she said do you happen to have just a little only a little regard for me he made light of it by blowing her a kiss and tried to change the conversation but she had more to say

of course you wouldnt love an old grasswidow like me anyhow she pouted he was at a loss what to say so said nothing

why dont you say something she said put out

you should not make such remarks he said with a frown

but its true its true and you cant deny it she seemed angry now and didnt appear to care what she said she left his knee with a last retort and you men are the cause of it all

he leaned his head against the back of the davenport and closed his eyes which angered her and she cried go to sleep go to sleep you are the worst person i ever knew and forthwith she left the room

enterâmr tom toddy when legs had pawned and lost about all he possessed he happened upon a job at one of the hotels and went to work to do so however he had to secure a white jacket and a pair of black trousers this was somewhat difficult on account of his long legs but he managed to secure an old pair and too glad of the chance to work where he could fill his stomach regularly he gave good service and was soon on the good side of the head waiter

say books he cried one day soon after he had commenced work you should have seen me eat today

nice hot bisquits with butter and dripping out around the edges umum man the way i did eat i got all them niggas t luffin over somethin funny i said and then id slip back into the kitchen open the oven and get me a half dozen hot rolls and butterm good and eat and eat and eat

there is but one thing i cant seem to get over and that is that dollar this nigga moore got me out of bed to lose say that hurt me worse than anything in this world ive drawn the line on him now though he aint nothing but an old always broke coon amoochin around for somebody to stake him in a game i could have made it all right when i came over here if it hadnt been for him and he never won anything and kept me broke as long as iwould speak to him

in a very short time legs was on his feet as the saying goes he was making some money and spending it all his good resolution with regard to gambling had been laid on the shelf until further declarations and he shot craps whenever off duty and when he could find a game moore he ignored but that worthy was as fond of the game as a pig was of corn so they occasionally ran into each other nevertheless in fact as sidney observed them almost every negro shot craps with few exceptions whiskey and craps were so much in evidence everywhere he looked that he drew this conclusion soon

now a man lived overhead and rented from the landlady whose name was murphy wyeth called him smoked irish he was a creature with a dark record so wyeth was told and he hailed from a little town in the state adjoining some years before he had been a man of considerable importance but with women and other pastimes he had fallen into bad ways was sent to the penitentiary for fraud and had sought other parts after the expiration of his term

as wyeth knew him he was a bahba and shaved chins and sheared wool in one of effinghams fancy negro shops

murphy had seen almost fifty summers was about five feet eleven and a mulatto with coarse stiff black hair tinged with gray his features were set like a man with experience and he could tell some wonderful stories

the mis called them lies they might have been but it is to murphys credit that they were good ones and interesting to listen to

on sunday and week days also when he was home from the shop and in his loft murphy sold whiskey on the sideâor as a side line and operated a crap game in addition the law of course did not permit of this as we shall see presently butâwell it didnt matterâas long as the law didnt know it and murphy made money wyeth was told it was up there legs invested most of his earnings winning once in a while but losing more frequently the fact that murphy was so convenient with his diversion was in a sense helpful to legs because he didnt have to journey far to his bed

and always as soon as he was cleaned he would retire and sleep as peacefully as a babe until his work called him the following morning

john moore was a frequent visitor also legs put wyeth wise when he inquired why moore was up there so often since he appeared to have no money hes a piker a cheap piker that touts for murphy for the privilege of gambling and gettin a drink a liquah that he loves so well

much to the surprise of them all one saturday night about this time moore did make a winning legs informed wyeth to this effect when he retired from the battle clean

seven dollars and a half the dirty devil and hell be as scarce as hens teeth as long as he has a dime of it too he was mistaken that was on saturday night

sunday morning after he had risen and had some good whiskey moore dressed himself like a gentleman and made some of the losers envy him for a few hours then he went back upstairs to murphys when wyeth saw him again he was sitting under a shade tree reading the bible this was a selfevident fact that he had made an investment as further evidence of the fact that night at supper he offered a beautiful prayer he had failed to do so that morning which was further proof of legs contention

legs came up while moore was reposing sanctimoniously and said mm cleaned eh glad of it the cheap sucker hes dead broke too because if he had even a nickel hed be upstairs you can bet a nickel up there the only thing against it is murphys cut he cuts a nickel a pass and sometimes he cuts both ways going and coming so with men betting a nickel against a nickel murphy is liable to take it all

moore retired early that evening and slept peacefully

he had worked hard the night before and that morning

the following saturday night legs came to the room caught wyeth half asleep and borrowed a dollar with this he went for a joy ride and got drunk into the bargain wyeth didnt realize that he had loaned him a dollar until the other was whizzing down the street in the car and then he was angry with himself this disturbed him until sleep was impossible so rising he betook himself to the porch as he thought it over he became more angry with himself than ever because he knew legs had borrowed it for the sole purpose of getting drunk and joy riding while he was getting over it in the soft night air the mis told him legs had got paid that day and with the exception of what he paid her he had lost the remainder of his two weeks wage in a game that made him more angry and in seeking a diversion he rose and out of curiosity he decided to pay murphys den a visit

murphy had a good crowd that nightâhe usually did on saturday in a room that was near the middle of the apartment surrounded by a crowd of negroes stood a table over which was spread a green cloth at one side of the table sat moore and he called the points and fished the cuts while in another room to the rear of this with doors open stood a large refrigerator this wyeth surmised was where the liquor was kept it was for as he was looking murphy approached it opened it took therefrom several bottles of beer and served it to the many gamesters who were working hard and perspiring freely

the green cloth which at one time had decorated a pool table was as he now observed employed to deaden the sound of the rolling dice that slid over it from some perspiring palm not any large amount was upon the table but many one dollar bills could be seen in the palms of the gamesters another roomer downstairs and who read a great deal was on hand and shot craps too this was something of a surprise since he was apparently very intelligent but as wyeth learned later literary training did not make them ignore the game by any means as he stood watching the dice passed to glenview the intelligent roomer he made a point and then threw seven before he came back to it the winners picked up the money wyeth was relieved to see the dice pass to another negro who had been fidgeting about impatiently he caught them up and blew his breath on them as they were held in his palm before throwing them before him across the table wyeth advanced closer as the game became more excited glenview had thrown the dice much as wyeth had observed the white people did back in the rosebud countryâfor they shot craps there as well but now with a clea dy way im a comin he let them roll

throwed eight cried moore

raising his left foot he stamped the floor with it kicking backward viciously at the same time with the other

he caught a negro on the shins which made that worthy angry with pain whereupon he turned ahd let the other have a good one in the usual place for a time the game was threatened with a fight but murphy who appeared to understand them quite well interfered with success

tclickilickilick ah seben ah leben 

throwed craps

yaha makin all da fuss n lose d fus shot

dem dices crooket he muttered

yuz a liah cried one of the winners as if afraid they were and he would not get his bet

yuse a cheap nigga said moore stand aside

next came a little negro with a nose that began at the ears and peepy eyes which observed the dice suspiciously he was displeased with the looks of them evidently they were a large white pair and which so tis said can be loaded he threw them across the table without making his bet saying ah gotta paih mah own and produced from his pocket a pair of huge celluloid ones that were beautiful in the electric light

haf t use the houses dice caint substitute advised moore judiciously

why caint ah id lak t know why caint ah

he exclaimed beginning to perspire

moore started to say more but murphy came forward now with let me see them he took them carefully in his hand held them between his eyes and the light tossed them about and then threw them on the table theyre all right and walked away the little dinge grabbed them eagerly rubbed them together fondly blew his breath on them and then raising his hand above his head he made a peculiar rattle and threw them bouncing and jumping across the table

the negroes about had been observing him with ill omen and now as the dice jumped before them like little red devils they sparkled in the light and made their eyes blink

throwed seven cried moore

shoot it all five dollars was the size of the pot now it was like five hundred to the eyes that now saw it

whu whu whu he blew on them while with murder in their eyes the losers watched

ill take it said glenview calmly he placed a five dollar bill over the amount that lay upon the table

several had now gone broke while others declared silently that he was a hoodoo and feared to risk him

several little bets were made on the side but no one was willing to risk much against such luck as he had displayed

now anne jane bring home du bacin he cried as he let them bounce on the table it seemed an age to the lookers before they stopped somewhat to the far side

a six and a five eleven he had won again there was no comment now every one was silent and surveyed him as if he were the clouds

shoot it all he cried again a bit of muttering went the rounds before any one ventured to cover it

e cainkeep ut up e cain keep utup declared one who held only three dollars out of a ten dollar bill a few minutes before he threw a dollar viciously toward him after much parley others joined john moore saw murphys back eased a dollar from the cuts and added it to the pool twenty dollars was now the stake and it was like a million to those that saw it

the winner now uncoated himself he had on nothing beneath the coat but an undershirt he flung his hat in the corner revealing a little sharp head shaven clean and upon which the light dazzled like a smoked opal as wyeth observed him he was reminded of an ape if he had ever seen one he took plenty of time as though anticipating something rolling up his sleeve he exposed a pair of sinewy arms that made the crowd exchange glances sidney was standing near the window

at this moment he happened to look out from up the street came a sound of merry rollicking no other appeared to hear

the dice were now tumbling over the table in their fateful quest more than a dozen pairs of brown eyes blinked dryly at them as the red material flickered beautifully wyeth now looked carefully in the direction of the sound and finally caught the outline of legs

from the distance he saw that he was loaded he was covering considerable spaceâso much so that it would have been extremely difficult to have passed him on the walk which was narrow and behind him came another

he was about half the height of legs as they now appeared wyeth recognized him as the runt and his name was tom toddy at least that is what they called him about a hotel that was patronized by negroes and where he acted as a sort of goat and flunky wyeth had had his life threatened on one occasion by him it was because he had called him graveyard he was old baldheaded and measly so this epithet seemed quite appropriate and thereupon toddy had threatened to send him into eternity if he addressed him again in such terms he had a load also

on they came and for the time wyeth forgot the game toddy was now beside legs and they embraced like man and wife as wyeth smiled at the spectacle they began to sing

its a long long way to temporary

and as they came on they changed it to were a long long way from home

wyeth laughed now almost outright but those behind him never heard they heard only and saw with all eyes that the apish creature had won again and had strapped the crowd to cover the next bet he was now shooting for

legs and toddy had reached the curbing and not seeing it they tumbled over into the sandcovered street

as they picked themselves up they sang lowly you made me what i am today so i guess youre satisfied

on toward the house they now came singing at intervals presently they stepped upon the porch and rattled the knob the door was always kept locked during such proceedings from the lower end of town a rooster crowed long and loud while at the same moment a clock from some remote tower struck two

the dice tumbled onward to their fatal end and legs kicked the door a bang

in the still night it sounded like the discharge of a cannon

then here came a lull all became so quiet that the ticking of a clock upon the mantel sounded like the pounding of a hammer faces turned about and eyes looked into each other they were all colors and a sight to see the little negro coolest all the while eased the money into his jeans as the others cried all at once the bulls

and now began the scramble and it was a mighty one

under the table went many whereupon it turned over and revealed them all wiggling like so many eels to the room containing the refrigerator went a half dozen others and closed the door john moore stood in the center of the room where he had been deserted by the others his knees hitting together with a sound like rocks cold fear for he was an awful coward held him like a vise into the closets into murphys bedroom went some more and piled in a hurry into the bed whereupon it gave way with a loud crash mixing many in a nasty smothered mass where they tried to extricate themselves with much difficulty

and in the meantime the kicking continued let me in let me in what in hell cried legs and it was punctuated with a piping from tom toddy

yesâhe was very properâopen up open up

this is a hell uv a way to treat two gentlemen

john moore was still doing the dazzle but now upon hearing the voices he gathered enough courage to stand erect and then he turned hurriedly and running to a rear window put his feet out jumped out full upon the soft dirt below and landed without injury apparently for a moment later wyeth heard him running around the house in the direction of the kicking he didnt permit the miscreants to see him until he had made out fully that they were not officers when he had made sure they were not bluecoats he advanced on them from the rear and took them by surprise he appeared unable to frame words of denunciation strong enough but at last he made it his voice was subdued when he did speak he was so angry

yeu yeu yeu longlegged nigga yeu liver eatin bunch ameat and you you littel dried shrimp

git ready t die causes shos im a nigga im going t part you from this earth tnight

they turned now for a moment sober and looked at him he went on with his tirade

makin all this noise down heh n scarrin everybody t death n abreakin up the game this is wha you all n me meets our jehovah

legs was now too near the edge and suddenly with a catching to save himself which moore construed as an advance upon him he went overboard with a mighty tumble

to this day however john moore didnt know it was an accident he didnt wait to investigate a long pair of legs with a long body on top of them was all he cared to see and when they landed he was going around the corner of the house and into the kitchen

his hurry up ingress awakened the mis who bolted out of bed and demanded to know what was up

the devils upâon the front porch araisin cain

what are you talkin bout

that longlegged nigga from attalia acomin in heh akickin on the door and ascarrin everybody outta the senses he told her much excited and with his back against the door not failing to listen in the meantime

wyeth descended the stair now opened the street door admitting legs and toddy legs entered first while toddy blinking blindly followed suit with a grip on his coat tail

where is he cried legs i mean john moore

i want to kill him death for him is the campaign for tonight from this earth hes got to part where is he

show him to me now and in a minute ill show you his heart the skunk

in some way moore did not hear this but stood at the rear looking for legs from that direction and in the meantime declaring to the mis what he was going to do

im gon throw that nigga out tonight tonight or ill die tomorra so help me jaysus

legs who had entered his bedroom which opened into the kitchen overheard this last he now tore off his coat and hat which tom toddy held and forthwith sought moore with a mighty oath glenview put in his appearance now from the rear and kept legs out of the kitchen which fact sufficed for john moore to make words our pen fails to describe this in detail

git yo things n go cried moore near the door and positive that glenview was between them leave mah house at once

oh hush hush hush interposed the mis

leave leave tonight

just let me get to him just let me get to him i want to eatm begged legs

yeh let us have him were going t skin him

squeaked tom toddy

this is terrible cried the mis

just let me get my fingers on the tramp and itll be all over in a minute legs begged

all but the funeral assisted toddy

orderin somebody out of his house you ain nothin but the flunky anywhere if i was in charge here id make you sleep under the bed

id make him sleep under the house the lousy rat

cried toddy

ah said you leave this house now cried moore

these ah the orders from me from mee

the mis ain said nothin legs cried again

leave leave before i tear yu t pieces moore raved stamping his foot

at that moment legs gave glenview a push that sent him reeling and with a lunge he cornered moore

that worthy was frightened into hades he was speechless legs smiled on him as he reached out and got him by the ears grasping them tight he essayed a bumping process against the wall with his head

have you got him boy inquired toddy making sure before he ventured forth with a small knife what shall i do to the sucker now just tell me and ill proceed to take off his nose or his lips either one of them will make good dog meat

you shouldnt have come home disturbing everybody like this said the mis and seemed hurt this had effect on legs who was always considerate of the ladies

im sorry for you mis but ive had it in for this hunk a meat ever since he got me out of bed to lose my last dollar he emphasized the remark by another bumping

im a poor widow woman without protection and you are ruining the only way i have of making a living

that was enough he forgot john moore for a second and the next moment that worthy was locked in an adjoining room here he went into a tirade legs forgot the mis now and sought him but the door was locked and bolted

git yo things n go nigga he cried boldly now from his safe retreat

if you had called or knocked i would have come and opened the door as i always do there was no call for all this remonstrated the mis

dont lock me out dont lock me out legs raged

git yo things and go dye here from the retreat

legs now became angry with the mis

gimme a dollar mis and ill go if that thing in the other woom there is running this place i dont want to stay

git yo things n go

if i ever get my hands on you again you old cheap nigga you old broken nigga you moochin piker you pot aneckbone stew

say cried one of the roomers just then a pair of bulls are coming down the street

that was the end of it

the disappearing chin some years before back in the west and at the drug store in a little town near which wyeth owned land and where during the cold wintry days the more intelligent and pretentious as well as argumentative were wont to collect and discuss science politics and economics a subject came up one day that thereafter became the topic on more than one afternoons discussion

it concerned chins and grew out of the presence of an insurance writer who was booziogically inclined and being so and a man of no great means if any it was a puzzle to many how he could get the means to fill up on liquor daily and pay for it

the occurrence had remained in wyeths memory and afterwards he had a new viewpoint in observing people

fitzpatrick was his name and he was of course irish

his ability to get the wherewith to get drunk daily and have money for other purposes as well came up one day for discussion the more logical and nature study debaters laid it to the fact that he was possessed of an indefatigable will and that in addition was conspicuously evident in his chin fitzpatrick had a wonderful chin one was inclined to take notice of it the first time he met the man it extended some distance beyond his teeth and was square and firm a chin that was set in such a fashion and did not recede was they argued an evidence of will so be it

chins were carefully observed at once and lo the druggist was the only one with a chin that was inclined to disappear it was plain at first glance that not one of more than a dozen possessed a chin the equal of fitzpatrick

it was then that sidney began to see everybodys chin apart from every other the moment he met a person

when he had come back again among his own after eleven years his observation began to reveal chins which according to the argument related were to say the least discouraging almost twothirds of his people possessed the disappearing chin a bad sign he was positive but they had it and he now studied this race to which he belonged very carefully and from an every day and practical point of view he did not attempt a scientific study for in the first place he knew little of science and in the second place to understand life from a practical point of view and to apply ones thoughts and efforts to that end seemed to him a more profitable occupation in this research he met many of his people who had gone through college knew everything from the dark ages to caesar but many of them couldnt have bounded the state which they called home for they paid little attention to their surroundings as he became better acquainted with them he was disappointed upon finding them ignorant at the same time they had little appreciation for anothers viewpoint unless he had been to school and graduated from college

having digressed we will attempt to return to the story

the druggist was not an assuming person and admitted very gracefully to the fact that he possessed neither will nor determination but as sidney wyeth knew his people he did not expect many to be so frank

so it came about that when he met miss palmer almost the first thing he took notice of when she came out of the darkness to the porch was that she possessed a chin the point of which was far beyond the lips it was that fact more than any other that caused him to try in every way possible to secure her services as we have stated he had little confidence in chinless persons a fact which was so much in evidence among his people

so when he had known miss palmer a few weeks and had been convinced from a practical point of view that she did possess will in keeping with the set of her chin he confided the fact to her she smiled very modestly and of course deplored it but nevertheless he caught her studying the reflection of it more than once when a mirror was convenient

thatmiss palmer was determined vigorous possessed courage and had strength of her convictions was a positive fact when she made up her mind to do a thing if she failed it was because it was beyond the range of reasonable effort to accomplish it and it was shortly after this that wyeth discovered that such a fortune could be superabundant that is a person could be endowed with so many of these helpful qualities that it passed beyond the range of judgment to assert them

this happened to be what he discovered in miss palmer

he regretted it too because he had begun to admire her

the presence of these aggressive facts began later to result in a change in their regard for each other they disagreed in their point of view and still later they came to a crash literally

for miss palmer was in addition to the agreeable and admirable things he had discovered pretentious to an alarming degree and it was this which caused the trouble

our pen has not before had occasion to relate that the change in the life of sidney wyeth from the prairies to the present was due in a great measure to the evil genius of an overly busy person and yet such was the fact therefore being an observing character and realizing these qualities but not appreciating them in the creature whom he would always despise he did above all else wish to avoid a person thus richly endowed

he had declared many a time that he trusted the diamond back rattlers that infested the prairies more than he did an unduly pretentious ostentatious person

therefore when he came to notice these qualities in miss palmer it led to frequent disagreements and yet withal no one could altogether dislike miss palmer

there came a time when he felt that if she did not try to argue on everything that came up without first attempting to equip herself with a few facts bearing on the subject and which would serve to substantiate her argument he could have overlooked much of her pretense

but as he came to know her better she argued on everything and sought to force her conclusions upon the other when her knowledge was quite foreign to the question on hand she literally murdered facts and as time went on he saw that her aim was very often merely to dominate with no apparent regard for what might be learned by careful listening

in effingham as in every other town wyeth had discovered among his people a set who claimed to be the more elite they were the more intelligent and called themselves society on his pilgrimage he had never sought to become a part of this society

in effingham sidney came to see this phase a little clearer than before due to his acquaintance with miss palmerâthat is that side of it the womans side as for the men he met that at the drug store where he had relieved the druggist of two dollars and where the more elite gathered and indulged arguments were usually in process there he soon saw and when not so engaged they gambled and drank to an alarming degree in the back room and secluded where he was not invited

cards were the custom but soon craps he heard became more conspicuous the druggist was a shooter and won quite frequently so twas said

miss palmer took prideâas well she mightâin informing wyeth of the fact that she was a member of the colored society of effingham and proved it by entertaining until she was ever bankrupt she was always up against it for money and this fact no doubt brought her to selling books as a means to make ends meet during vacation but miss palmer did not could not of course be expected to admit such a thing she could have said nothing about it which would nave been as dignified but she made it a point to appraise wyeth of the fact that she only did it to help him at which times she would smile and show her little teeth i like you so much and she would smile again that it is my great and ardent desire to help you

sidney had never appreciated it in this way

at miss palmers could often be found a gathering of teachers of which effingham with its sixty thousand black people had many and these to whom the masses looked to for tutor he studied very carefully

he had as before stated never shown them the book but the surprise of it was that miss palmer had not done so either

in one of the little suburbs where they had canvassed he recalled a row of very attractive homes occupied by the more respectable colored people miss palmer had canvassed there very carefully and had sold the book to nearly every one but she had as carefully avoided showing it to a professor who occupied the most imposing of the row he had not said anything but of course he could scarcely help noticing this careful avoidance of all houses where teachers lived in some manner the matter came up one day and miss palmer merely remarked that the teachers were all broke would be so until school opened again

sidney had surpressed his criticism but one day he called on miss palmer he was just in time to meet a white woman coming out the latter turned and thanked miss palmer for her kindness in giving her the list of thirty teachers with the suggestion that they would be interested in the set of books for which she was agent

the lady had sold to twentyfive of that number not counting miss palmer who had cheerfully started the list and the books were in twenty volumes at one dollar each

of course miss palmer showed them to her friend with much ado stating that the same would be so helpful to her in her school work he said it was very nice but he wondered just what particular help the books could be to these teachers for the set were a collected list of fiction with no care as to whether it was a

work of specific interest the set included many volumes by authors who issued a book every sixty days all of which were on sale at any bookseller or by mail at that time and for some time past at fifty cents a volume or twenty copies from the publishers at fortyfive cents each

of course miss palmer did not know this or any of the other twentyfive teachers out of the thirty who had purchasedâand lest we forget it was this lack of knowledge that had cost the druggist two dollars because he had been shown a work by one of his race with a suggestion to buy the fact uppermost in the mind of sidney was that the teachers with few exceptions scarcely needed any such work to teach black children many of them would be unlikely to read as many as half a dozen of the books in their lifetime and yet by borrowing the book they were reading the tempest some were even contemptible in their criticism but all of them borrowed it and read it including miss palmer and she admitted it was the only book she had read that season other than what she was compelled to read by the board of education

but all of these people felt they were sacrificing everything for their race and would deplore it were they told that such was not true

but the teachers were nice much more interesting to talk to than the common herd they could almost all smile beautifully and they could pronounce their english more correctly employing their rs and interspersing their discourse with a clever toss of the head or twinkle of the eye and when one of the race who had been successful married he invariably picked a teacher

they were sensible enough to realize that a husband who could keep the wolf from the door was a treasure to be appreciated it was thus sidney wyeth found teachers but he could not understand why they seldom appreciated negro literature to the point of purchasing since they were engaged in the teaching

miss palmer was buying a small home in one of the suburbs and which was all she could boast of owning

as we know her she secured her living by teaching nine months in the year at forty dollars a month and as we now know she must perforce earn something during vacation which was the real reason for selling wyeths book so from what we know of her there is no reason why she should not have been conspicuous in colored society since the masses unfortunately are all poor hence wealth cannot be the dividing line else there would be no society whatever

miss palmer showed more ostentation as their acquaintance lengthened sidney was now thirty and since nineteen he had lived on the western ranges

and as is usually the case western people are great readers but here his people did not read not that they could not do so but because it was apparently not a preference considering the fact that few seemed to care for much reading beyond a newspaper sensation and as he met the more elite he was surprised that they paid so little attention to the condition of the masses murder as we have seen was an established habit of all those he had met the teachers impressed wyeth as having the least regard for conditions in other words they never worried they dressed the best their means would afford and aped the rest which was easy and this he found so prevalent that he was at times dreadfully bored by it all but he was relieved when he looked deeper to find that the people who were actually succeeding in doing something paid little attention to this set which dominated society but the set claimed them nevertheless

as he had known society from reading of it only he had judged that literature was one of its chief featuresâ but not so with this gossip and hearsay were more in keeping and obviously more appreciated

wyeth was a literary man now for the sake of gaining a livelihood but he had studied it as we know from a modern point of view he had never however any difference of opinion with them for so few knew of the late books purchased few and most of them not any magazines of interest not one in a dozen even read the races only periodical the climax though the editor had once been one of them and had written a book a novel it was a failure from a financial point of view

the fiction they knew and talked of was in the order of rip van winkle ben hur and st elmo

one day when arguments were abundant it came to a point where wyeth made mention of the fact that so few teachers showed any interest in current events did not read the magazines and negro literature they almost held in contempt

is it because they feel that no negro knows enough to write anything they would care to read

the idea cried miss palmer indignant all the teachers take the magazines and as for negro literature it has been the teachers who have robbed themselves to make the same possible

and yet other than up from bondage and the works of the dead poet you can seldom find a volume by a negro author in any of their houses    and if i have investigated correctly ninety per cent of this was placed there after the white people had bought it and proclaimed the authors great in the many houses i have been in with you i have not yet seen any of derwins

though one of them he wrote and which is named after our souls had a great sale among the white people even

i cannot see nor appreciate either your point of view with regard to the teachers lack of literary interest when not two weeks ago twentysix teachers among a list of thirty purchased a set of twenty volumes each and which cost them all that many dollars

and every volume by an author few know of further than that he was white and therefore knew something

he retorted

it ended there and they were both relieved that it did but neither forgot it

effingham with its sixty thousand black people had scores of drug stores which sold literature many newsstands also did such a business exclusively there were four drug stores operated by colored people and like attalia not one sold magazines and newspapers as a side line nor did any sell literature which were operated by whites that depended upon negro trade granting of course that many colored people bought such at white places when they desired to read it may reasonably be imagined how much literature was in demand among the colored people

wyeth usually purchased a work of fiction weekly and sometimes more while some weeks of course he omitted this custom one day he was asked by the clerk of the leading book store in effingham what he did with so many books when he had read them we have sold

he said seven copies of the book you sold us but i guess youll be surprised to know that we have not as yet sold one to a negro wyeth was not surprised but didnt say so that ad we placed in the colored paper and have had standing a month would bring dozens of curious white people in to see what it was

and of course some would purchase it to see what was said then if the contents did not thrill or please indifference would follow but when nobody buys not even inquires we can only feel that your people dont have much interest in books and we have had the same experience before he smiled when he had finished a smile that was embarrassed he disliked to say it apparently but when wyeth was so pleasant he added we have bought what few books your race has written for the purpose of sale and have naturally expected some evidence of interest from them by a call and an occasional purchase and i am telling you the truth if we depended on them to unload this stuff from our shelves it would be there yet as some of it is you have personally bought more literature in the way of current books since you came in here than all the rest of your people in this town together

wyeth went his way then but he was no longer surprised as he once was for he had heard that many times before

one day shortly after wyeth happened in at the druggists place the hot bed of argument he inquired why a few magazines were not carried in stock

hell cried that one throwing his hands up in a gesture of despair and mingled disgust niggas dont read

the following sunday morning when the drug store was full he happened to mention a new book he had and which many of the idlers were inspecting one by one asking to borrow it when he was through he suggested that it was on sale uptown then quoted the words of the clerk who had remarked that he wyeth bought more books than did the rest of the colored people put together

he was hooted down so there was no argument each was positive that his friend had bought one while that friend was likewise of the same opinion and of the many almost every one had read the book he wrote having borrowed it from someone who had bought it

the druggist then offered an excuse for the absence of literature at his store by declaring that almost all the people subscribed and the same came through mail

miss palmer and he were certainly very forgetful

literature was a dead issue that could not be denied but whiskey was not

effingham had no library for its black people and they were not allowed the privilege of the white yet a part of their tax was paid to support the same still no one gave that much thought insofar as wyeth could ascertain when he mentioned it to the teachers almost without exception they replied no use negroes dont read and it was so everywhere yet every class but the doctors and teachers purchased the tempest when it was brought to their attention and wyeth even sold to three of these two doctors and one teacher in effingham that summer

no no one he met had any worry about a library but thousands of black children ran wild day by day upon their streets went to jail in great numbers before they were of age and filled convict camps as members of chain gangs long before they could be called even young men there was no library nor was there a park but there were plenty of other places conducive to crime

and still effingham had more than a hundred negro churches

can you not realize that in your absence of such necessities for the training of these little black children that you are growing children for the chain gang every day but this never aroused any visible concern

and sometimes they did say emphatically aw we dont need no library and if we had a park for colored people they would do nothing but fight in it and still others would cry git religion n read d bible prpare yself fo heaben and still others were in disgust as they replied a nigga ain going to mount to nothin nohow so whats the use

a library could be obtained if the conditions here were brought to the attention of the northern philanthropists he suggested to miss palmer whereupon she cried oh mr wyeth you bore me with your contention about libraries and parks and y m c as and the like

these niggas in effingham are not worrying about such things so why should you a stranger a mere observer be so concerned

because miss palmer i cannot help but see all this murder and crime going on which is undermining the foundation of colored society every day when my paper comes its murder murder murder and fully ninety per cent is among our people although only twofifths of the population is negro

havent i told you all along that the crime is among the low down whiskey drinking depraved element and not among the best people

yes but this country cannot exist in peace and prosperity and happiness nor can this race with the greater part ignorant criminal and depraved the more intelligent have for their duty the task of helping in any way possible and by so doing lift these unfortunates into a state of intelligence and selfrespect

well she contended resignedly that is for the churches to do theres enough of them

and the teachers because they are looked to should help as much as they can with their higher intelligence for the mothers are too ignorant and too depraved to do so but of the many churches of which seventy are baptist not one has any connection or interest in a school here directly or indirectly i begin to think you are going to lose your mind if you dont quit seeing the many iniquities of our people

if you would only see what the good people are doing and try to interest yourself more in them you would be happier she said he sighed now and then said to himself whats the use

quit it all sidney she said softly calling him for the first time by his first name quit all this worry about these niggas and be yourself be sweet and she kissed him

wilson wilson mildred is gonel

wilson wilson mildred is gone mildred is gone

cried constance ringing her hands despairingly

gone he breathed uncomprehendingly

yes gone his sister sank into a chair and gave up to a flood of tears

but why he cried only now seeming to understand that she had actually left them

i dont know i dont know she moaned

this is certainly a mystery surely dear you are mistaken he insisted greatly disturbed mildred would surely not have left us so unceremoniously and besidesâwhy sheâshe constance why she gave one hundred and fifty dollars to the christian association movement only today and you cannot mean that she has gone it is hardly possible

i only wish it were not so but come and taking his hand she led him to the room mildred had occupied

it was deserted save for the furniture that belonged there only once had he seen the inside of it while she occupied it and now it did not appear the same because then it was decorated with much lace and womans needle work and picture postals but strange as he had thought when he happened to glance into it before there were no pictures of girls and men young or old nobody excepting the picture of the author of the book which she sold and which had been taken from the frontispiece

this is the way i found it when i came home a few minutes ago she said resigned i cannot make it out i cannot make anything out except that the sweetest friend the dearest girl i ever knew has disappeared strangely

she sang at the meeting only a few hours ago and sang as i never heard her sing before she was moreover in the best of spirits all day and was so enthusiastic over the meeting dear me he sighed wearily

if she had only left some word given some hint that she was going to leave but of course she knew and couldnt tell us so there is no use at all shes gone and i cannot imagine how much i am going to miss her

her brother sank into a chair and gazed silently at nothing he could not think clearly of the departure

for days he had slaved for this day of inauguration and in his work he had looked forward to her for much help

her encouragement to be near her and to hear her voice daily was more to him than our pen can describe he had felt that he could face the mighty struggle which he knew was now before him with all the strength of the strong but now only he fully estimated what she had been to him and what he had dreamed that she would be some day and all that was now cast aside in this one moment his hope his greatest hope had been shattered

his sister looked at him and for a moment almost fell on her knees in sympathy for she had not been blind she had seen the change coming over him with no thought but to encourage him constance had faith and patience and perseverance and she had felt that everything would result favorably in the end

and then she had watched this girl during that spell of a short time ago she had seen her appearance change as the result of some mystery her eyes became dazed from loss of sleep due to the worry and subtle fear it was then with great cheer that she saw it disappear later until she was the same again constance was happy then because the other was happy she had been happier still because she saw that without effort the other was making her brother happy he had fairly thrived under it

constance felt that his lot was a hard one she was confident that he wouldbe a leader of men in a greater measure than he was at the present and when she had carefully observed the practical ability as well as the intuition and foresight of mildred latham she had longed with all the craving of her heart for a union between these two

and as she saw her brother now with eyes dry and listless her heart went out to him with all of a sisters love it pained her more when she realized that she could not help him she would have to stand by and say nothing at the very time he needed her more than ever before he was too strong a man by disposition he possessed too much will power and was too proud to ask or accept sympathy it would all have to be given in silence

there was a knock at the door she heard steps on the porch and guessed it was the people calling in regard to the y m c a and it was only then she recalled that they had been invited to a supper she called to him wilson some one has called she went to the door and admitted a dozen persons members of the church and foremost enthusiasts in the christian forward movement

well well martin girsh principal of the local high school cried coming in ahead of the others you are both sitting here at home when we have been looking all around for you and you both show the effect of the strain you have been laboring under in this affair

he said this after he had seen the look upon their faces their efforts at selfpossession which they could not hide

they were glad he saw it that way

where is the young lady the dear young lady who showed such an interest in the movement by giving such a liberal sum inquired one and it was immediately taken up by the others it required an effort on the eart of both to explain that she was out and would not e back again that evening   

isnt that too bad and all of us were simply wild to meet her to hear her sing and to know more of this courageous young person said the professor with much regret

she is positively a jewel to say the least upon my honor cried another who was a letter carrier i didnt know she was such a treasure until she sang and when she led them all in a cash subscription i declared i would have to become better acquainted with her

i had heard her play and sing but indeed i didnt know she possessed such a voice before

suppose we arrange a banquet for this young lady have her cut in the paper and let the people know what a racespirited young woman we have in this town

suggested one the others took it up by acclamation

wilsons eyes found his sisters with a sickly green expression and then he heard them again

when can we arrange this wilson it is left to you and miss jacobs to set a date the incident of this young womans contribution to the colored y m c a can be employed to a great advantage in the inauguration of this movement

fire fire fire came an alarm from the street at that moment all eyes sought the front where directly across the street and one door down a large frame house suddenly burst into flames forthwith the visitors rushed in a body a wind was blowing strongly from the west at that moment and the conflagration seemed to draw the flames it had not rained for some time and in an incredibly short time the beautiful structure of a few minutes before was beyond saving from the way the flames were fanned by the wind they threatened to endanger other buildings

in a few minutes the place was surrounded by spectators while a number of fire departments were rushed to the scene from different directions

it was hours later before the flames were subdued

only a mass of charred ruins marked the place where the handsome structure had stood

services at the churches were well under way before many of the watchers left the scene and the number included many of jacobs callers who had of course forgotten their suggestion to entertain mildred latham in honor of the beginning of the effort to secure aid for the colored youth of the city

as they sat alone that evening neither wilson jacobs nor his sister offered any comment upon how they were saved an embarrassing ordeal they were both thinking thinking and seeing with their eyes full of tears a chair where one had sat and talked and laughed with them the sunday night before

their hearts were heavy very heavy for strangely enough they felt that mildred latham would never sit in that chair again

the beast and the jungle remember the sabbath day and keep it holy

this was the inscription under a cartoon in the effingham herald one sunday following a sunday when crime seemed to have run riot the cartoon pictured a huge knife stuck into a human heart and the moral was that on the sabbath day when its population was supposed to be at pious worship murder was ungodly

the sunday previous to this seven different murders had occurred in that many different parts of the town sidney had read the accounts and said nothing when he saw they were all black people only one exception and that was one who had shot another and in attempting to escape had been shot by the police

thus was the condition of crime in effingham it was a rare sunday that didnt have five or six shootings killings and cutting affrays the record for the previous year showed more than three hundred murders mostly by negroes upon each other and in part by the police

eighty per cent of all murder in the city was among twofifths of the whole or the negro population but what surprised wyeth was that insofar as speaking of it as an everyday occurrence and something to be expected the colored people paid little attention to it

by this time wyeth had become known as a severe critic and therefore against colored people in their effort for salvation so the critics complained there was one however who saw beneath the surface and who said in reply to the criticisms going the rounds that wyeth was criticised not for the criticisms but for his method of bringing the truth before the eyes which did not wish to see it

weve tried every way possible to obtain a library

said one

what are some of the ways he inquired pointedly

well for instance we have asked the teachers to each give a book for that purpose we have almost two hundred teachers in this town and if each one gave a book and the preachers likewise that would make considerable of a library

for sixty thousand people yes and under his breath he added you fool

why do you not write an editorial and bring attention to the dreadful amount of crime that seems to have submerged your population he said one day to mathews a very excellent writer

im writing of what people are doing that is uplifting the other returned

do you not consider that all this murder the negro is committing to the disgrace of the state the city the county and the race to which he belongs is a thing that requires some effort or some comment on our part as citizens of this commonwealth

oh but the best colored people dont care to read of that he explained

but its a fact is it not and one that is going forth every day through the columns of the big dailies and a fact that the public is making record of and holds up to the gaze of the world and gives this town the name of being the most uncivilized community in the country

there is of course mr wyeth no use in trying to argue these things with you complained the other

about town although you have been here only a short time you are regarded as a contentious person always forcing your way of seeing things upon people and criticising our teachers and preachers and best people for their lack of concern in regard to a lot of criminal negroes that find their way to this town from every convict camp in the state and other states if you would struggle to get into society and mingle with the best people you would forget what these brutes are doing instead of that you can always be seen standing at a distance viewing all of us as one

abraham lincoln our emancipator said this country cannot continue with one part of the people free and the other in serfdom and thrive i am wholly at a loss to understand this attitude of what you term the best people toward the masses wyeth persisted thoroughly aroused we complain of the injustice of prejudice which is well worth the complaint but while we see that the white people refuse to accept us on an equal basis with themselves we cry out about the best people we cannot expect the world to accept us as a race on the reputation of a precious few and yet right here in this town on all sides among the best people we hear that you cannot be responsible for the condition of the great herd i do not think you are expected to by the public but what stirs me fires me sometimes to denunciation is this utter disregard for the evil things in which our people indulge themselves to the disgrace of all

have it your way mr wyeth said the other resignedly that is the reputation you have having your way 

this was the end of that but not of murder everywhere it continued

wyeth went to the churches he listened to the sermons and at the drug store where the more logical members of the city could often be found he met the same condition nobody was worried nobody cared

just as long as their own affairs were going along in a satisfactory manner no complaint was forthcoming

and as time went on wyeth took notice that everybody carried a revolver one evening at the drug store someone displayed a revolver of a new type which brought about some comment forthwith among the twelve present ten additional revolvers were produced and displayed wyeth being the only one not possessing one

he was looked at in surprise and made the object of much comment

why i wouldnt go from here home one night without my cannon said the druggist a prominent doctor smiled grimly as he pocketed his whileothers laughed and patted their weapons fondly

you from out of the west and havent a gun man you are crazy laughed one you better send out west there and have them send on that dungeon

i never owned a gun in my life

what been living out in that wild country these many years and never owned a cannon what kind of people do you have out there

civilized people

uh well i ain never been without a smoker believe muh

hell be carrying one before hes here long laughed a physician as they filed out into the night

more conspicuously here than elsewhere he had been wyeth saw that the undertaking business thrived better in this city than any other conducted by colored people

a half dozen companies were incorporated with a paidup capital stock and declared handsome dividends every six months and each company owned one or more ambulance carriages or dead wagons as they were commonly called as they moved busily about the streets picking up wounded and dead negroes almost daily they whirled through the town at breakneck speed to the tune of a dreadful alarm

then wyeth began to see without looking why crime thrived the mills coal mines and furnaces employed thousands of men as we know and paid them at various times and to a saloon they filed and drank their fill

in his observations wyeth had never seen saloons do such an excessive bottle business great cases the length of the bar in many instances and piled everywhere were half pints of liquor a man said to him one day youll find upon searching the ignorant negro three things almost any time a bottle of booze which might be empty if you searched him at his workâa cannon if not it is because he is not able to possess oneâa knife with a blade long enough to go through youâadditionally a pair of dice

but it was not at the saloons that they bought all the whiskey regardless of the great number in sight but barrel houses and wholesale stores were operated in connection therewith here the tiger conductors purchased their supplies which consisted mostly of whiskey and the cheapest available which was to be exact a dollar and a half a gallon but if bought in smaller quantities it came at forty cents a quart while the beer used by the tigers was so cheap that finally no label was used on the bottle and it was this kind he learned the tiger people used almost exclusively it was likewise this kind that produced the most fighting drunks and was sold after midnightâsaturday night so on the outside of a good supply of drink and a crap game in sight crime ran high in this city and was ever in continuance

this is mr winslow madam

after his conflict with moore legs took a silent pledge he would quit gambling and drinking and start a bank account im going to use some sense and save my money he declared with much sincerity there is nothing like a few dollars in case of emergency

if you stick to that theory in practice legs wyeth corroborated youll never have cause to regret it

he started the same at once with one dollar the next week he added another which made two and was jubilant the next week he added another and at the end of four weeks had five dollars to his credit and was discussing investments im going to buy me a house and lot by and by he said laughing over his prospects

i own the l  n r r cried a dirty black fat negro coming up the street haf a the a g s too

thats sam said the mis coming to the door at that moment ever since a white man took his wife they say hes been like that he imagines he owns railroads and if you happen to be going by the station you can see him standing gazing at the trains with a foreign expression

git that car back on the right switch there flag that engine and make them push that section to the left

all right now pull her ahead thats all

howdo sam she greeted him as he came abreast

he halted a moment and gazed at her remonstratingly

this is mr winslow madam always address me as such and in that manner hereafter i am mr winslow understand and i own the l  n r r

and the a g s

own haf a that too

and the t c i company

they wanted to sell it to me i wouldnt buy it

come on there with that train engineer drop that car on siding g now switch that other chain around on track e

say books laughed legs if you want a get rich quit the book business and run into a train with your head that guy is certainly rich

he carries on that way all the time the mis explained but he is sane otherwise that is he is harmless and lives with his mother down the street a few doors he goes errands and you can give him as much as twenty dollars to buy a nickels worth and hell bring back nineteen dollars and ninety five cents no one can beat him and he is as honest as the most conservative

lets go to a movie books said legs when sam had disappeared

all right and together they went down the street in the direction of the business district when they had arrived at one of the three shows the pictures did not appeal to them and they strolled about the town

the bank conducted by negroes was near the center of the block and cornered on the alley and on either side of this was business conducted by or for negro trade within a block of the bank was located the three shows and while operated and owned by white men were patronized entirely by negroes it was a puzzle to wyeth to see his people operating banks with more success than they could picture shows clothing stores and even hotels this was the case not only in effingham but in other cities as well the bank and the neighborhood immediately surrounding it was the center for negro gatherings and upon this street might be found a crowd at any time almost every other door seemed to be a restaurant and operated by greeks in fact this line of business was apparently monopolized by these people all over the country wyeth saw that this was due to social reasons a greek or an italian or even a poor jew operating a business like a grocery store or any kind of business employing less than ten thousand dollars capital stock lived much within his means whereas a colored man in the same business invariably was through the connections of his family a leader in society these greeks did not even pretend such a thing even in a small way among their own which made a great difference at the end of each year none of this class referred to would think of owning an automobile whereas such an asset is common among these black people hence a negro in any business other than a barbershop bootblack stand pressing shop or business requiring a considerable amount of practical ability was a rare thing

being in business he is looked to to spend more money as well this wyeth had found was not always his preference but his wife and family usually represented the better colored people and therefore are expected to entertain are made the object of much flattery and ostentation there was one who ran a grocery near miss palmers whom wyeth recalled was the object of much scorn when discussed more than once when he suggested a purchase of a watermelon or soda water or some refreshment that might be obtained at a grocery store he was advised against patronizing the chinse on the corner meaning the colored grocery keeper and he came to learn that the only excuse for such a reference was that he didnt keep his wife in society but made her slave in his little old store along with himself

for this he was given as little of their trade as possible but with careful application and perseverance he was succeeding to a creditable degree but the most extraordinary feature of this was that the druggist received no more of this class of trade than did the grocery keeper notwithstanding the fact that he was high in society and was positively of their point of view wyeth passed much of his spare time talking with the grocery man and came to find him a most obliging man in every way

when he was informed that wyeth was selling a book by a negro he instructed him to bring him one forthwith and which he was glad to own and read it through at once

so it came to pass that in all he saw wyeth found many honest and unassuming people and whose interest in the race did not end with a few sweet words and a shrug of the shoulders

many colored men were actually succeeding in the grocery business in effingham and many of them were referred to as chinses by those purporting to be leaders in society

getting back to sidney wyeth and legs who were uptown for the purpose of attending a picture show two of the three shows were operated by the same company and the playhouses were referred to as capital number one and capital number two they were in separate blocks legs and wyeth had been to capital number one and were turning in the direction of the other when some excitement was in evidence in that direction

they joined in the crush and were just in time to see an altercation between a man and a woman a nice looking woman brownskinned with an unusually heavy head of hair the man appeared to have called the woman and was desirous of remonstrating with her about something to which she took exception she turned to go and it was then that like a flash he drew a long keenbladed knife from his pocket and without a word drove it to the hilt in her breast she walked calmly perhaps a half dozen steps and than with a sudden clutching at the air she cried oh im so sick wyeth saw her eyes for one moment and the next she reeled about and fell dead at the feet of the crowd

the murderer saw her and it was only when she fell that he appeared to take any notice of the fact that he had committed murder he now turned and fled up the alley while the negroes about him fell back

there goes the beast cried legs pointing him out to wyeth and the next moment they followed in close pursuit a cry from the crowd went up as they disappeared it warned them that they would be dealt with likewise but they heeded it not

they ran up the alley that opened ahead into a wide street the murderer led them at considerable distance and as they hurried after him they saw his head turning from left to right evidently looking for some opening in which to escape but their pursuit was too close

arriving at the end of the alley he halted one brief moment and then turned south

this street fell rapidly a block and reached a level in a railroad yard where long trains of cars stood silently in the pale moonlight to these he now ran not looking back at his pursuers a few minutes later he had for a time disappeared from view behind a car but determined with their blood now boiling the two flew on after him when they got inside the yards they caught a glimpse of him crawling along to the other side of a line of cars to which was hitched an engine

a moment later this began to move and suddenly while they were yet some distance away he swung aboard one of the cars and stood on the bumpers they hurried forward and caught a car each a few cars to the rear while the speed of the train increased in a few minutes it was flying and they were hanging dangerously to the side with quick intuition wyeth climbed to the top of the train and called to legs when he stood over him to do likewise hurriedly legs clambered to the top as he settled panting on top of the moving train in the rear and hurrying forward the light of a brakeman approached

they darted forward looking carefully between the cars to ascertain which contained the fugitive the train now hurried around a bend toward the outskirts of the town and as it did so they saw the creature drop suddenly from between the cars and roll over the embankment and down the grade which was perhaps at this point twenty odd feet

the train was tearing along now at a speed that made it positively dangerous to alight still the light of the brakeman was only a few cars away and inasmuch as they would most likely be severely dealt with if found they were for the moment at a loss what to do the fugitive had now arisen and was running again to safety

all they had seen before the electric show now came back to them and without regard for the risk they were taking they quickly clambered to the bottom and fell off the train just as a curse greeted their ears from the brakeman above

a moment later the roar of the train was lost in the distance and they were alone but fortunately uninjured the fugitive had apparently made good his escape disgusted and disgruntled they started back down the track in the direction from whence they had come they had gone it seemed perhaps a half mile when suddenly a groan came to their ears they stopped from near where a few stray hedge and weeds had grown up and were tangled and enmeshed they caught the outline of a man stretched apparently helpless therein

they hurried forward legs in the lead as they did so he sighed perceptibly legs had now reached the man and was in the act of bending over him when wyeth grabbed him from the rear and jerked him quickly back but he was in time to save him from the other who had like a flash sprung up and lunged forward with upraised knife

having missed the murderer tumbled forward on his face and bit the cinders while legs raised himself off wyeth who had been pushed backward and down by the sudden collision the other had gained his feet however before they got their wits together and with a mad curse he tore down the tracks as wyeth raised himself his fingers encountered a piece of cinder heavy with iron unconsciously his fingers encircled it and when they again started in pursuit he grasped it

well kill that beast as he killed that woman cried legs panting dreadfully but more determined now than ever with a clear track and nothing to obstruct the speed it was now evidently only a question of minutes until they must surely overcome the other who was shorter and whose speed had become noticeably slower

legs had got within a few feet of him when suddenly he stopped short and whirled about too late legs seemed doomed to meet the point of the upraised knife that glistened in the moonlight wyeth at that moment saw the danger of his companion and with a cry he hurled the cinder full at the crouching fugitive it went straight and took the beast full in the face with a cry the other fell backward across the track

legs tumbled over his prostrate form while at that moment from down the track came the sound of an approaching train both now looked up and it was only then they were aware that it was so near they were blinded by the light but with a cry they sprang free as the light fell full upon the face of the fugitive who at that moment came to his senses he staggered forward and then with a cry that rang above the roar of the train he stumbled forward but in rising one of his feet had caught in a frog and held him fast a screwing of brakes could be heard but in a moment the heavy engine crushed over his writhing body and mangled him until when he was taken from beneath it he could not be recognized

legs and wyeth were present the next morning at the inquest there was no visible excitement over the death of either a small paragraph at the bottom of the back page of the morning paper reported the death by stabbing of a negro woman while a still smaller one made notice of the death in an unusual manner of the murderer

and so it was in effingham if one desired notoriety he had to do other than kill a negro or be killed by one

for such was soon forgotten among other and more unusual sensations

thou shalt not steal

during wyeths canvass among his people he had become accustomed to regard men who indulged excessively in drinking as a problematical feature and when that same man gambled in addition and failed to keep his word or oath he was not in the least surprised

and moreover when he became acquainted with a person who loved liquor gambled likewise and who did not struggle to secure a job but was content to walk about in perfect peace without any effort in that direction he was not surprised if that person stole in addition

the people he stopped with were in a measure secretive that is they did not always take the trouble to state where they purchased all they had about the house he took meals with them occasionally and saw them eating every day and although chicken was very high exceedingly high in effingham they had it every day

the druggist whose store was a block distant had inquired of them and made known the fact that moore was indebted to him two fifty but wyeth paid little attention to this since during the warm afternoons under the cool of the electric fan he indulged in such reminiscences and wyeth knew almost everybody who owed the druggist anything including miss palmer

two robberies had occurred in less than two weeks at the place and both were shrouded in mystery the first had been explained away very reasonably a window that was almost hid by vines had been left open and through this a nigga as they put it had made his entrance and gotten away carrying with him a suit of clothes belonging to one of the roomers who kept himself pretty well soaked with liquor this roomer happened to be employed at a wholesale liquor house and was therefore able to drink with economy sam was his name but he was not however the one who owned the l  n r r but sam was an easy golucky and didnt care whether school kept or not and likewise didnt make a big noise if something did crawl in through the window and steal a new thirtyfive dollar suit

as was stated it was explained john moore lost an old derby the same timeâat least this was how he reported it the green stain upon the windowsill from the vines his knees crushed was further evidence of the ingress and the egress considerable indignation was shown by moore and a great many words were employed over the affair but in due time it had died away and was forgotten when the second came to pass

the victim this time happened to be a gloomy and forlorn creature who could well boast that no miscegenation had prostituted his ancestors and whose teeth in the night flashed like a diamond necklace griffin was his name and he did not shoot craps or fight or get drunk and wyeth didnt think he drank until he saw the mis go to make his bed one day and in turning back the pillow revealed a half pint of john

griffin reported that it was employed as a medicine and wyeth allowed it to go at that but indulged a smile upon griffin that meant more wyeth had a way of joking with the eyes that kept him out of difficulties but convicted and judged those near him and they could only laugh and look guilty

one of the other good things we know of griffin is that he read the bible and nothing else and said so moreover he deplored the reading of anything else declaring it to be contrary to the laws of god griffin rarely said jesus and never jaysus andâyes he was a sunday school teacher and went to services to a church that was at the other side of town he shouted when the preacher delivered a soulstirring sermon and expected to go to heaven when he died only one thing did griffin indulge in though he was careful to keep that to himself and that was womanâbut we are a long way from our story and still we cannot leave it this part of it until we make known that she was a high yellow

which is perhaps unnecessary to state for when the color is like griffins they scorn all other kind

the robber this time employed a more machination method and he was a very congenial robber also out of consideration for griffins regular attendance at church he left an old greasy suit that due to the great amount of the foreign matter it contained was likely to last him until finances would enable him to restock for the benefit of the robber

this robbery occurred one night when he was away and did not return until the following morning which was in itself singular for griffin was rarely away it was like the other mysterious griffin was a miner and since he would notâso twas saidâpay twentyfive cents a week for warm water and a towel to clean himself at the mines he preferred to sleep in the kitchen because he was unfit to occupy any other portion of the house unless it was the attic and since there was none to this house we leave him in the kitchen where he slept in a dirty but warm bed and kept his clothesâhe had some prideâin the strongest trunk wyeth thought he had ever seen on the outside he kept it locked with the strongest yale spring with all the highpriced advertising done in regard to the safety of such locks this robber didnt seem to give a hang but with a steel poker he had twisted and twisted until mr yale had resigned himself to the inevitable and permitted ingress

within were four nice clean suits awaiting griffins subtle occasions

legs wyeth and glenview who were very agreeable roomers didnt hear of it until the second morning

and they might not have known then if it had not happened that they were together in the adjoining room and overheard griffin crying over the loss that happened to be friday legs had become something of a hero with his successful running down of the murderer and now played very successfully the part of a man

legs did not positively condone the light fingered method

when they had been led by their curiosity to investigate and had returned to the room he remarked it beats hell the way this place continues to be robbed

it is indeed singular commented glenview whose english was always the most careful and he never swore

yes said legs again it is strange so strange that im getting suspicious and he closed an eye meaningly theres a man in the house who has not worked this summer  he cannot seem to get the kind of work he follows true but the fact to be considered is that he has not worked this summer he likes to gamble and is particularly fond of liquah   

there was a pause and he closed that eye again and looked across at glenview glenview closed an eye and looked at wyeth wyeth held his open but did some rapid thinking he now recalled that upon entering the robber had cut the screen it was shown to them but now as he remembered it the ends of the wires where the screen had been cut pointed outward    also it was reported to have been cut with a hatchet and the hatchet was on the ground near the window which was logical  it was very strange indeed this robbery   

legs was speaking again this man who has been out of work all summer at least has not worked all summer and who loves liquah better than i do and who could shoot craps forever and be happy sleeps within four feet of that trunk the only thing between him and the trunk is a door that has not been closed this summer    and who moreover if you will recall he closed that eye again and held it so a second awakens always when we enter late at night and inquires who goes there and this man slept through all this with the trunk almost against his head and didnt hear it being opened he paused again and closed that eye it was the right glenview closed his left wyeth closed his too from the other room came sighs and a restless turning on the bed where some one lay

on the front porch john moore sat with the bible open before him    have you observed said glenview in his englishy way that the ones who have been robbed are those most likely to take his story about it and are not capable of investigating on their own initiative three eyes closed simultaneously for instance he resumed theres sam always full you know when i inquired what he had done about it he replied that he had inquired of one pawnbrokerâand you know there are perhaps a hundred in this townâif any one had offered a suit as security for a loan that fit that description think of it

and now here comes the instance of this old creature we hear sighing in the kitchen and who reads nothing but the bible and goes to church on sunday he hasnt sense enough and nerve he doesnt know he has perhaps called on the lord to restore those things why havent some of our things been stolen    again three eyes closed while memories became the order the memory of wyeths conflict and they didnt forget that of legs we leave them laying around and none of us lock our trunks    you he said seeing legs have more suits than any of us and they hang on the wall   

john moore had fallen asleep and the bible had tumbled to the floor a street car line came past the door and the cars when passing filled the house with noise one passed at this moment and he was suddenly awakened

looking about hastily for the bible he had held he saw it on the floor at his feet he stooped to pick it up and as he did so saw that it was open as his hand touched it his eyes lit upon a chapter whereupon he straightened up quickly a moment later he picked it up and rising entered the house

the words of the chapter that had disconcerted him for the moment were thou shalt not steal they turned her out of church saturday night of that week was a beautiful night and everybody sought the open airâno almost everybody

there were a few that didnt in fact they sought the closed inside for a purpose

murphy had a good crowd for it was pay day and everything was sliding along  k glenview who had purchased a new novel from wyeth who bought them and sold the same at a discount when he had read them was there too so was john moore he was always there wyeth was below and so was legs for strange as it may seem he had kept his pledge thus far he was glad of it too which is ahead of our story easy

a game was on a big game and darkies were uncoated perspiration flowed freely wyeth retired about twelve or it might have been earlierâit makes little difference the game was on and so was somebody else

wyeth felt himself being shook but could not seem to awaken at once words came to his ears and it was the voice of legs that spoke get up it said in subdued excitement get up you fool

go to the devil are you crazy dont awaken me

im tired and want to rest he answered unconsciously

i said ariseâat once somethin doin

will you go to the devil or shall i hit you in the ear and dispatch you forthwith i want to rest you pair of legs

listeni listen hear them books

books heard something but he didnt know what it was moreover he didnt carein fact he didnt want to hear he wanted to sleep it was a fine night for sleeping too the soft air floated in through the window at his head and the vines and garden the mis raised and which grew within a few feet of him perfumed it with natures own why should he be concerned about what went on up in murphys den he kicked at legs when he repeated

legs went into the other room but the noise from above persisted

look out there nigger it said dont start nothing dont start nothing get around there you beside that other nigger now here you ink put these cuffs on the two niggers against the wall right around the wrists you fool ive put them on you often enough for you to know that they dont go on the shoulders

and dont be so damn nervous you shiver around there as though it was the first time youve been arrested

are you done well stand over in that row beside them other niggers dont think because i know you that you cn ease out that window and dont figure im going to play any pets heah heah you little black rat

you i say with the pop peepers if you try any monkey foolishness ill putm out ill putm out hear that nigger hear that ill shoot you nigger ill shoot you

hearrn books hearm its the police theyre upstairs theyre making a raid hearm books

came legs voice as he came back to where wyeth lay

sidney had awakened now sitting up in bed he listened to the voices that came down from upstairs it was still a little vague but legs spoke again they are coming down now and so they were

a noise of many feet tramping about began to file downward on the rickety steps

wait frank came a voice let me out on the front so i can hold a gun on these niggers now come ahead now niggers the first one that makes a break remember out goes his light bingo

mary oh mary bring me my coat and hat wyetb was dressed now and peeping out the window yea it was john moore and ne wanted his coat and hat he was going away on a journey the mis very much frightened hurried forward and held them out to him

he placed the hat on his head and took the coat on his arm he wore cuffs so that made a difference

the mis fell into the room a moment later and gave up to silent anguish it was not the first time she had witnessed a raid sometimes wyeth felt sorry for her

for once upon a time she had been a good woman she was yet when she could be at least she was always kind but when liquor was voted out of the state some years before he her husband then took up the sale of it contrary to the law he had been caught once and then twice he had then been caught the third time

the third time is when you go to the mines you may never return from these places so tis said they kill you out there is what john moore had told him once grimly yes they kill you out there its hell

they killed the miss husband and she had a son and he sold liquor too he was a dissipated youth the mines had him six months they gave him back to her

t b he died and at this time she mourned his loss

she was now alone in the world she had at first made an honest living and was a member of the a m e

churchr she became acquainted with john moore

well they turned her out of church some time afterward they would have done so sooner but she was pitied and black people have sympathyâeven for criminals the mis had lost her husband and then her son andâbut they turned her out of church thats bad

oh its awful bad to be turned out of church black faces crooked often regard one with dark suspicion when he is turned out of church especially if a woman

and now they had him the other her consort for such he was because you see be merciful she was a human being    and all human beings cry out for love yes love   

take along his bible mis grinned legs and then he looked at her    yes legs knew the story too  he was sorry terribly sorry they were all sorry for the mis

legs and wyeth now stood on the outside it was safe now they watched the arrangement

four abreast they now stood lined in four rows they were all handcuffed together john moore was there bringing up the rear murphy was too being the man of the house he was honored with a place at the front

and behind these sixteen men walked his honor the police and so very insignificant they were apparently

yet they were the law and that means more than our pen can describe here

black people claim to fear god and no other they dont the most of them do not understand it in a larger sense no but notwithstanding the fact that in dixie they are forever breaking it they do fear the lawâand the white man

they filed now a row at a time and a few feet apart across the street under the flaring electric street lamp they passed some bareheaded but all downcast discouraged and remorseful oh this was the law the law of effingham declared thou must not game

in the middle of the street they walked and a few minutes later they passed under the light of the lamp at the next intersection and disappeared in the direction of the station and it was only then wyeth recalled that among them he had not observed glenview he was not there he was positive and yet he was at the game

where was he where did he go

he turned his eyes in the direction of the rear and at that moment glenview walked into view

you cried many voices for a curious crowd of crooks had gathered good people had long since retired

well he smiled

well   

im here not there and his eyes went in the direction of the others who were now passing under another light into a bigger light

well

 i saw they were nothing but a pair of snots

well

the window was open

the window

and the outside air was very inviting much more than that other

oh    it was becoming clear to all now the mis looked disappointed sometimes she had not liked glenview  he winked and went to the front of the house

well sighed the mis resignedly they certainly got a bunch of them and then laughed a laugh that wyeth had heard before and knew not a cheerful laugh but a dry hard laugh one that was possible after years of bitterness

by this time ja score or more negroes denizens of the night had gathered and were exchanging opinions offering theories and executing objections

some low down nigga done turnedm up this was what a large negress with imposing hips was saying

she sold liquor across the way and conducted a house for any kind of purpose

some doity lit stool pigeon added another who was more doubtful still wyeth regarded them a moment in disgust they were dressed as they were when they arose that morning or that afternoon or whenever it was which was not in the last hour or two

it was glenview who detailed the raid now at some length a big negro was shooting for three dollars a little guy who appeared to be very drunk kept making a fuss finally asking to be let out he went and when murphy opened the street door for that purpose well in walked the bullsâno the little snots

im going upstairs to see how it looks after the scramble said he and a moment later his feet were heard in that direction he had no sooner hit the landing than from above came a dreadful noise a crashing of window panes indicated that someone was trying to get out of the window a table turned over with considerable objections judging from the noise it made the whateveritwas appeared to be coming toward the stair in post haste now chairs were cast aside without care of how they might land and then it appeared on the landing a moment later it came down much a tumble and not in the usual way hands and legs and feet seemed altogether as they did many stunts on the way down eyes were opened wide while breaths were held as the spectacle was observed closely and then it landed

one moment it lingered and made a funny picture for the many eyes then it became erectâand behold

it was a man

but he hadnt taken the time to dress entirely he had upon coming down or deciding to do so donned only a coat while his large loose knee lengths stood out conspicuously from the small legs that reminded one of pipe stems smoked onesâcoming out of huge corn cobs

it came about when glenview ascended the stair and met it in the act of looking about to ascertain whether the coast was clear

for a time that may have been a second possibly more he stood hesitant wild of eye and trembling in the legs but conspicuous to a humorous degree he soon came to appreciate the spectacle he made and forthwith betook himself hurriedly back up the steps but alas not many had he ascended when he made a miss and with a smothered embarrassed cry he fell and the next moment came back

while all this performing was going on he was not aware that the officers had long since departed and when he again landed at the feet of his onlookers who were now given over to a fit of snickers he cried in a subdued but intensely excited voice dont let them get me dont let them get me he was wild as he hesitated before attempting to return and in the meantime he whined like a poor thing which made the negroes who stood about give up to loud laughing

at last he was calmed to a point where he took himself hurriedly up the stairs and disappeared and then there was another commotion apparently the house was coming down from the scrambling and the way chairs and beds and tablesâand everything seemed to be turning over

say say came the voice of glenview the officers have disappeared a half hour ago be quiet

those are not officers below they are curiosities but it was some time before he was able to communicate this fact to a point that brought quiet when he presently emerged the onlookers saw not two glenview and the other but five they slipped down the steps like ghosts looked wildly about for one brief second and then melted into the night like vampires

as they floated away some one recognized one and called him out by name and these words came back to those who listened hush calling my name you fool

the plate at the head of the table was not turned that morning the mis notwithstanding the words she uttered when the raid had been made im glad of it

itll stop that gambling and i hope murphys whiskey selling she was nevertheless sadeyed and all upset

all that day she so remained grew worse if anything

dont worry mis contorted glenview kindly as soon as some word comes from them ill hustle about and secure bail but it was late in the morning before any word came and then alas it was a surprise

there is a law in regard to gaming in effingham which makes the penalty heavier if caught gaming during the week whereas it is lighter for sunday therefore being well aware of the fact no serious anticipation was held as to how the gamesters would be dealt with since they had been caught after midnight saturday night

in fact when the excitement attendant with the raid had passed those directly interested looked hourly for those who were caught to be released

whatll it cost them under this law inquired wyeth of glenview who appeared to be fairly well informed regarding the matter

oh not much he replied perhaps five or six dollars you see he explained the city considers gambling through the week as a business indulged in by professionals whereas sunday they construe that they may be workmen engaged in a pastime

wyeth understood of course but it appeared singular at first

they will be taken to the city lockup glenview resumed and if collateral to the amount of twentyfive dollars be offered and approved they will be allowed to return and when they appear tomorrow morning they will be fined five dollars and cost if they were caught during the week it would be ten and cost and possibly more depending

it was at the end of this conversation that they got their surprise

murphy came in he seemed tired and worn he was a picture in fact of the result of such a raid he sat himself down with a sigh that was not altogether one of relief all waited with drawn breath

thats the worst place i have seen the inside of he said and shook his head in emphasis

where did the wagon pick you fellows up inquired glenview i dont recall hearing any

no wagon picked us up we walked all the way

they didnt carry us to the city pen but to the county jail

what cried the mis while glenview appeared to regard it with incredulity

and then all were silent with a cold feeling creeping through their veins as the grim reality came upon them

it would now be thirtyseven fifty and not five dollars for the county made no exception for sunday all the day through john moore raised from his hard seat and gazed out through the heavy bars that penned him in will they never come will they never come

he cried to himself but only the heat and multitudes of negroes greeted his gaze as it eagerly sought the door to freedom

and all day glenview walked from one bondman to another

no said the wealthiest negro doctor who had bailed out many ive quit going anybodys bond i dont think from the experience i have had that i would be justified in going my brothers hereafter he had a few to jump them and it cost him a pretty penny he afterwards told wyeth to get them back

hes worthless said the druggist apparently amused at least satisfied with his solution for the present he owes me two fifty for medicine i sold him and trusted to my sorrow but ill tell you what i will do he changed his tone to one of thought then went on now you tell the mis if she will come down here and give me seven fifty five of this is going the bond thatll put the thief on the street because it is he who has been doing that stealing up there and all of you dont seem to know it and the remainder two fifty is what he owes me tell her to bring it to me in cash understand the long green and out he comes to go back soon where he ought to be for he has honestly no right to be free

of course mis never had such an amount so moore insofar as this source was concerned was doomed to stay in the hot place for some time glenview went to another

that nigga hell why i wouldnt go his bond to stay in heaven he is so crooked and undependable

that was the end of it for that day and the night settled down

it would cost ten dollars cash to secure release through professional bondsmen and inasmuch as john had not the tenth part of that he reposed for several days in his new place of abode and became very dirty and bedraggled in the meantime always so clean and tidyâ thus the mis kept him that he was hardly recognizable when a few days afterward he returned it was murphy who secured bond and wyeth came upon him in some surprise that evening he sat quietly on the porch with the bible in his hand so greeting him wyeth asked how he liked it the other said whew the worse place i was ever in he had been in them before but not this one but he did not of course deem it necessary to make this mention it had been made by others two hundred niggas in the room i was in and god knows how many more elsewhere and they were onearmed and onelegged oneeyed and toothless earless and oneeared but the whole bunch every one of them were filthy and the place was rotten

yet more than five hundred negroes most of them young men preferred the place to freedom

i love you she said miss annie palmer had about despaired of winning sidney wyeth and by this time was not nearly so considerate when he called as she had been some weeks before and besides wyeth had an insistent way of seeing things which was not the custom of her friends

when he called sometimes instead of giving up to the easier things in life and which concerned the select few he was liable to bring up a subject concerning the future of the negro of the south as he is today etc etc etc

so it came to pass that miss palmer was only good at times and at those times she was liable to be good by fits and starts and then she got cranky notwithstanding the fact they were still friends nothing more and as miss palmer sometimes sighed to herself will never be anything more

you were i thought she declared one day the sweetest kind of a boy but of late you are so concerned about y m c as and libraries and schools and the like for our people and how many are being killed and all that that i am sometimes serious in my belief that you are losing your mind

i came to show you the article in the herald by the park commissioner with regard to the establishing of a park for negroes i suppose you have read it i am certainly glad to know that you have white people in your city who are showing some interest in the civic welfare of our race and from what he has suggested with regard to this park for our people to be centrally located there is conclusive evidence that the white people are coming to appreciate that the evolution of these black people can be brought about otherwise than in the chain gang

please dont today mr wyeth please dont she begged  promise just once that you will try to be if its only for a minute as you were when i became acquainted with you lets drop this matter about the park and all that today these negroes here would do nothing with a park but fight in it and a library they dont read so whats the use she came to him and before he could say a word in protest she had gotten on the daven sort and beside him very closely in that moment miss palmer felt that she wanted to hear him say something about her

listen she said in a voice that was full of feigned passion do you care for me it was so sudden that he did not know how to accept it whether as a joke or serious he had of late been backing up on the flirtation however she was evidently serious so with a jolly word he talked with her at some length about nothing presently she became meditative she spoke of her unhappy life with a sigh and then fell to accounts regarding her little boy

my entire hope is centered in him i intend to make a doctor out of him and to do that i will have to work hard and save money to put him through school when he is grown up and you see what that will call for

he was a lad of ten years and the image of his mother

the future of the american negro was bright in his eyes and he assisted commerce to a degree by consuming as much coca cola as he could buy with as many nickels as he could gather likewise peanuts crackerjack and candies

 hes some boy glowed wyeth enthusiastically

i wish i possessed a lad like him i would feel proud

wouldnt you like to have something to do with him she said and he replied jokingly sure

she nestled close very close so close that he felt her hot breath upon his cheek you do care for me a little dont you she almost implored he was embarrassed but replied of course i like you

i love you she said i love you she said again

ooh mamma cried her son at that moment

come and see the funny man coming down the street

ooh but he is so funny she moved away guiltily

a moment later he arose and took his leave

please git d ole man outta jail

umpumum man you done bring dat book heah tday n i ain got a cent nary a cent

oh but youre a good joker he laughed depreciatingly you drew four or five great big dollars saturday night and i know you saved a part of it for the book as you said you would didnt you

yesser yesser ah knows ah said i would butsumpin done happened since then sumpin i want figurin on

sumpin i sho wasnt lookin fo

oh   

yes embarrassed ysee its lak dis ma ole man e went down town satdy night nâwell e gotn a lil trouble yes lak a nigga y know got in dis heah trouble n it done took all i had t getm out sides i didn have nough n had t borra frum ma whi people

thats too bad indeed said wyeth sometimes he said this freely and again his voice carried a touch of disappointment and impatience because sometimes he met a half dozen such instances when he went to deliver on monday as a rule and since he was by now accustomed to it he offered sympathy to the unfortunate wife who had to pay so many fines and went his way

yeh es alius gittin in sumpin las yeahâah maybe twas las monthâe got in jail n when i got im out dat time i swo is gwine let im stay du nex time e went offm heah and didn come back n ah didn getim out right away dis time ah letm stay tree days but e jes keep sendin up heah n worrin n worrin th life outta meân i was worried anyhowâwi uh please ole oman jes please comein git du ole man outta jail so e jes promis so faithful n jes begged so ad until i was at last pvailed on wi du elp ajaysus t gitim out jes this timeân you cn jes depen on it its the las time i gin git dat no count nigga amine outta dat place so help me jaysus du las time and she bustled about her duties with a determined set of the head

how did he come to get locked up this time

ugh yes yes its lak disâso e said e was down t a sloon n got t argin wid annuder nigga n so den dis udder nigga done posed on im n den dey got t squabblin nd plice dey runs in onm n linem up so d wagin come long n hurried m up t jail

and thus it went wyeth found the women in a great measure trying to do right as they so regarded it but the men from the saloon to a tiger thoroughly soaked themselves regardless of the cost so long as they had it

and then to a crap game where they lost the remainder

evidently there must have been some winning but wyeth never happened to find the winner they were all losers if he had their orders and expected to deliver the book he had to plan to deliver the same on saturday night and before they found the enticing game

and for telling the truth they drew the line on thatâ refused to have anything to do whatever with keeping their word when he ran into a man who was as good as his word and which he did occasionally he was so surprised that he became nervous many of the white agents and collectors informed him that with a few exceptions they drew the line on any credit business with the men because they simply could not trust them

of course this was not among the socalled best people but with them he had a hard time securing an order since to make appearance was their obvious effort in a large measure when the cook advised him to see the butler he forthwith inquired whether he gambled or drank for if so he thanked her for her kindness and made no effort to get the order for it was useless in four cases out of five

hence it came to pass that sidney wyeth learned that his people were the victims of liquor and gaming and this was the result of ill training ignorance and lack of civic observation if john barleycorn was at the bottom of most of the crimeâwhich grew in most instances out of discussions and differences of opinion regarding trifling mattersâignorance was at the bottom of the indulgence

on this day when he had completed his work he stopped at the library this was not open to colored people which he knew but since what he desired could not be obtained elsewhere he decided to go to the desk and make known the fact and leave it to the civil regard of the librarian he was ushered into a room to one side which was not always used and they brought anything to him that he wished when he took his leave he was invited to call at any time and he could expect the same accommodations

some time later he did and while looking through the matter which was the occasion of his visit the librarian approached him and said you will perhaps be interested in hearing that it is the desire of the board to take some steps toward a library for the colored people of the city

indeed he replied i am sure i am interested

nothing i assure you is much more needed

yes the other went on earnestly it has been the desire of the board to do so for some time but owing to the fact i regret to say thatâwell those in your race whom we have waited for and looked to to take some initiative with regard to the matter have not appeared to care muchâwell not any as yet he paused a moment while wyeth waited

i presume said he presently that you are one of the professors

no i am not i am not connected with any school in fact i am not connected with anything here other than a book of which i am the author and which is being circulated by myself here in the city but i am deeply interested in anything pertaining to what you mention

oh i see said the other and disappointment was evident in his tone i had hoped from the interest you show in literature that you are connected with one of the schools but i will state what we have planned on and what would be necessary on the part of your people in order to stimulate such a movement

this city is of course unable to make such an investment but it the board is willing to cooperate with the leaders of your people the teachers and preachers in bringing this to the attention of northern philanthropists and with a little effort concentrated on the issue it is reasonable to suppose that in view of libraries given to the different colored schools in the south the securing of one here is quite possible

that is the way i have been compelled to see it through knowledge gained in observation wyeth agreed

oh it can be obtained it should be obtained he paused again hesitantly then went on somewhat determinedly this city has a dreadful record for crime and while i regret to make the mention yet i think you will agree with meâ

that the great amount of the crime is among the black population wyeth assisted unembarrassed

exactly it is a dreadful affair this daily murdering of human beings and this continual herding to the chain gang these people go there and get in so much trouble because their minds are untrainedâand this is due to their environment which is bad it is a distressing condition which the state is facing a library will in time have a marked effect upon existing conditions there is no park either in fact there is nothing but the open street the schools and churches for the colored youth whereas the white children have everything to help them become the proper men and women and yet and here is where it becomes awkward for the public to do anything you are aware that the south is poor and therefore unable to give even their white population what the north can in regard to uplift but as i remarked the leaders appear to show such little interest in betterment

now for instance if the teachers and preachers would unite themselves into a body for the purpose of securing a library for the colored people of effingham and persist in this matter eventually they would have a building and not less than fifty thousand volumes but as it now stands rarely do any of them call in the manner you do and before anything can be done by the board it is expedient on the part of these people to get some public sentiment in favor of the proposal now what is your opinion of it

of course i cannot be otherwise than heartily in accordance with such a proposition and i regret to agree with you that the people we or you look to as our leaders show little interest in this matter publicity is necessary i could for instance write an article calling attention to such a movement and have it published in the colored paper but they would not read it with other than a passing interest in such a sheet i have had it in view for some time past of doing somethingâor i should say saying something i shall not yet however state just what or how i will say it but suffice that i am going to say something and say it at a time and in such words that the negro public as well as the whites will i hope sit up and take notice

i am glad to hear that drop in at any time and if we can help you in any way we will be only too glad to do so said the librarian enthusiastically and extended his hand

when wyeth got to his room he thought long and deeply upon the subject and when he retired that evening he had begun the formulation of a plan that would wake up this sluggish resignation which seemed to possess the race to whom the white people looked to for initiative

the following sunday when he received his paper the herald an article spread over the front page double column caught his attention and he read it through as no doubt every one did who was interested in civic welfare it was another by the park commissioner and was in regard to a park to be centrally located and to be used exclusively for the use of the colored population of the city

in effingham there are perhaps a half dozen small and large parks and all for white use exclusively during the hot days of the long summer black people must roast in their stuffy little homes perhaps a fourth of which face alleys black children have no place to play no place to exercise their little bodies or give free vent to their desire for child play crime therefore is their greatest environment

stealing is so bad in this city that the druggist remarked to wyeth one day that if he should awaken at two a m

and see a negro pushing a box car up the street not to become excited or even be surprised since he had been in effingham a man who lived to the rear of his abode and who owned a horse and wagon had on three different occasions and in less than two months found it in a remote part of the city it was tied to a tree or a fence or maybe not tied at all it was nothing uncommon

the horse was used to haul stuff that had previously been spotted and later stolen it is this that the colored children see and become acquainted with in their alley homes and which makes criminals of so many long before they are of age

the article by the park commissioner dealt with these conditions as well as with the great amount of murder committed in the city it was the desire to locate a park near the heart of the city so that these little children with the ebony faces might find some relief from their alley homes and in that way help a little toward the discouragement of so much crime the jail was overrun with both women and men prisoners the funds for the purpose of building a larger jail was not forthcoming so the city could do the least by giving these people some place of recreation

however went on the commissioners article neither the city nor the commissioner could be expected to make any move toward giving this to the colored people until the colored people themselves through their leaders the preachers and teachers of which there was estimated to be in the neighborhood of three hundred would show in some manner that they desired it to purchase the ground and remove the buildings thereon prepare and dress it down to a park would of course require a considerable outlay of capital the commissioner therefore would be glad to consult with this body of people with a view to that end if it was not convenient for all to come he added kindly write him their views and desires with regard to the matter but the commissioners would consider it more demonstrative if the teachers and preachers of the city colored would call upon him in person and in conclusion he set a day and requested that as many if not all of them would call at his office on the afternoon of the following wednesday

wyeth spoke of the matter to those he knew few though had concerned themselves as much as to read it even while others made idle remarks and so the day came

yes it came and to the office went to be exact five teachers and three preachers out of a possible total number of three hundred the commissioner was too discouraged to keep these precious eight very long so with a few words announcement was made that a pasture five miles from town could be leased for a small figure and that a car line went within a mile of it so that it was moved and seconded and the colored people got a park

the following day the papers were considerate enough to make small mention of it and that was the end of the matter

when sidney wyeth had learned the details he decided upon a plan which will be unfolded in a later chapter

this man is losing his mind

hello stranger said miss palmer one beautiful morning when he came strolling by i havent seen you for a long time she said smiling not overly pleasant

in fact miss palmer looked worn and acted likewise

she did not present a hopeful example as wyeth saw her now she was sweeping the sidewalk in front of her place with a broom that was worn to the last threads and more these had been cut and only the small wire held it to the handle

good lord he exclaimed upon looking at it

what do you call that and pointed at it with a laugh she looked sad and replied thats my broom isnt it a shame but its all the broom i have wont you buy me one and give it to me as a present you make plenty of money and i have five fifty in the house for you myself she smiled up into his face now wearily and he was touched he was moreover sorry now for what he had said but to make amends he replied cheerfully sure sis take any part of what is due me and use it for that purpose

that is so sweet of you she smiled gratefully i always believed you were sweet regardless of the fact that of late you have become so awful

hows that he inquired curiously

 oh i have been constrained to believe you are losing your mind you have succeeded in criticising about everybody and everything that pertains to the good colored people of this city

 oh miss palmer he cried looking hurt  i have not criticised everybody and everything i have only shown that i think a lot of the socalled good people are fourflushers and selfish creatures with no real love for the race nor any regard for the civic improvement of these black people but i know lots of good kind sincere colored people in this town that i am proud of as members of the race

come into the house she invited and presently they were seated in the parlor at once miss palmer took up the discussion of society and the buying of homes which had reached a degree of impracticability among the colored people notwithstanding the sound idea

all over the country during this pilgrimage wyeth had witnessed this purchase idea with a mark of encouragement and to say that they were succeeding was a fact that meant a great deal to their future welfare

miss palmer delighted always to discuss the buying of a home and marrying another teacher was visiting her that day and likewise shared her views wyeth did too but he always had questions to ask that sometimes made the discussion rather upset

he read the negro paper and had fearfully obthat an unusual and alarming amount of fore was the order in conversation with the numerous real estate dealers he learned moreover that many of the attempts at purchasing were foredoomed to failure when made that to own a home in a great many cases had become a fetish and was therefore not a practical consideration in the beginning successful dealer colored had told him conthat he sold many homes and would have ad been expedient that they would not be the payments up for a year es so much of this come about he had inquired

fiety too many people do not study although have a liberal school training among our its the great ambition of too many to get into with the first object of being seen therein to their friends and put on airs they buy with no idea whatever as to value liability or anything

they have simply stinted themselves until they have managed to save a few dollars and desire to get into the biggest home possible to be where they can be seen by their friends

the rate of interest appears to be very high i have observed said he by way of comment the other looked at him meaningly and then said interest eats these people alive here just sucks their lifes bloodâbut it is not that alone not one in five knows how to arrange a loan they permit themselves to be governed by some dealer who in almost every instant is the worst grafter possible they will make a loan with a life of three years at eight per cent interest and five per cent commission now you know that no loan running three years on property that poor people are trying to buy on the installment plan is practical

yet that is the kind of loan that most of these cheap sharks offer to the masses of our people who have no judgment a negro is unable as a rule to realize that three years is a very short time he is compelled to learn by bitter experience the worst feature of this is that at the end of it he is so discouraged that often he does not benefit by this experience because the failure has gotten his heart and he is done for

at the end of three years which seems like three days when they are trying to buy a home the shark is around for a renewal of the mortgage and must therefore collect another cash commission of five per cent think of it in twothirds of such instances it takes every dime they have paid in those three years sometimes more now how can people pay for a home under such conditions but there is another side of it and it all comes from the inability of our people to see further than their noses

almost all these purchases are made beyond the extension of the sewerage often the water works positively no street improvements and side walks are rare but in three years in order to boom the property the promoter is active in bringing some of these improvements within reach of this property that adds about onehalf to twothirds more to the cost of the property he is trying to buy moreover when these people know anything they will not buy a house built by these promoters for it is nothing but the cheapest shell they can get to stand but attractive from the outside in two years the occupant is fortunate if he doesnt have to build another

then comes the great day these people cannot pay that commission over again and the loan company doesnt care to increase the loan maybe by including the commission in a new one if they are unable to make arrangements with a bank and that means they are going to deed them the property seven cases in ten foreclosure proceedings are instituted the property is finally deeded by the sheriff to the mortgagee now here is another phase this piece of property can then be sold quicker than before for this reason it is very easy to frame up a tale to the effect that a party who was purchasing the place was a shiftless drunkard or anything and imagination can supply the rest but inasmuch as they had taken the property back they are now offering it at a greatly reduced price and better terms there are so many subtle ways of drawing people in that it would take a volume to relate them all but they come to the same in the end installment property at two thousand dollars can be bought for about twelve to not exceed fifteen hundred instead of commission and everything else buying by the installment plan in this and every overboomed southern town costs from twice to three times what the property would actually cost if the purchser could pay half of the purchase price cash for in that way he could secure terms and could pay interest rate on the remainder in time he would get the same paid and have his little home

and that you feel is the reason for all this foreclosure said wyeth

that is the cause of it why advertising property for foreclosure has become a feature of competition between the three negro papers in this town they get more money out of that end than they do from the advertisements through straight business for the purpose of selling it originally

it would seem that the people would get on to such methods by and by wyeth commented

some of course do and avoid it but you cannot imagine how many do not it alt comes about through a lack of general intelligence too many of our people do not read anything are therefore without any vision or judgment of their own they dont know and of course are made the goats of those who do

so that explains why a portion of this town to the west and which is occupied almost exclusively by our people has such dreadful streets and no sidewalks whatever

thats it they will perhaps have none for the next twentyfive years too much property is being bought and so little is being paid for that it is a continual change about

 i find a great many of the peopleâintelligent peopleâ who do not care to see this side of it wyeth remarked

 half of the school teachers for instance seem to wish not to see it and they get stung but they are so anxious to be seen and to be referred to in a position beyond their means no wonder

so sidney wyeth had to take this mans point of view for more than one reason like attaliaâbut worse these people considered literature as a whole dead stock more than sixty thousand in number the demand among them for books and magazines was insufficient to justify any ones running a place for such a purpose it was not large enough to justify either of the negro drug stores carrying periodicals in stock even those that were carried by all white drug stores excepting those in districts occupied and patronized by the colored people

and with all this there was not the least claim for that kind of knowledge more than a hundred churches never encouraged the people to read anything but the bible apparently the obtaining of a library had not worried any but sidney wyeth it has been seen how they wer the securing of a park is it a wonder this under his observation that sidney wyeth from a land where people read and thought some perspective eventually came to be regarded nic critic he had witnessed more murders than n all the days of his life

digressed to such a length we will return now annie palmer who was possessed with the ambe established in a home of her own and to be hose who knew her

think of it suga she said to the other teacher get the nicest kind of a home in the west end considerate sum and only fifty or a hundred dollars the best of them the rest is paid just like you and no more it was this wyeth recalled them it cost no more than to pay rent after payment

m from the other

the sewers and sidewalks and streets and lights said wyeth kindly

you go for an argument miss palmer wyeth grinned

lings have all been completed to include rt said nothing to him in reply

get it after the first payment like paying d the other teacher

out miss palmer sweetly real estate dealer offers such bargains  said wyeth humorously the drugiverybodys business had told him that one time was the object of every real effingham and then some one lodged bs and since she had been left alone whether it was because miss palmer as colored society could not conveniently get together

losing his mind she said to the other other now regarded wyeth dubiously

hen said if you start buying or biting on one of these easy homes in the west ena that you refer to you are going to lose your head

oh is that so miss palmer essayed with much spirit do you suppose that with me teaching in the schools of this city for thirteen yearsâ and she had begun at twentytwo so she told him onceâi do not know something and if you infer that i havent a hundred dollars then you havent become acquainted with annie palmer dont you worry about her for she always has a roll convenient and you never see any collectors coming here and leaving without what they came for she was very dignified now as she went to the door to answer a knock

the room in which they sat opened into a small hallway which was entered from the street by a glass door

it was at this open door that a man stood who however could not be seen from where miss palmers company sat

he could be heard though and they the company couldnt help hearing they were not eavesdropping it was then that wyeth learned miss palmer was vain

he could not help recalling that if no collectors went away without what they came for it was because they expected nothing when they came so when miss palmer had completed her trite sentence and sallied forth to answer the knock they could not help hearing her say very quickly and with some embarrassment oh you are too early come back tomorrow i have my books to deliver this afternoon and will be ready for you tomorrow soâ

that was as far as she got and her company could not be censured for overhearing the rest of it that is what the other made in reply the chances are the other was not aware of their presence a few feet away but that is a matter for conjecture miss palmer could be heard attempting to finish with him without his words that came in a flow she was nervous but he would have his say and so he said cutting off her discourse im tired of this stalling all this stalling you have been handing us for months this has got to come to an end

ill bring it to the office iâ

youll do nothing of the kind and you know you wont

ill pay you tomorrow sure sure sure why didnt the man be a gentleman and go go go plainly miss palmer was dreadfully nervous more as she could be heard by those who were listening she was plainly in agony the collector was on the warpath and went on relentlessly if you havent made some disposition of it by monday a week get that stuff ready for the wagon and a moment later his steps died away in the distance

for one moment wyeth saw the face of her friend but he couldnt believe it and still when miss palmer returned and resumed her discussion with regard to buying homes he would have sworn that the other had to smother very quickly a gleeful expression

ill brand you as a faker

eh there get that car on switch a now let her come back to the left all forward noow engineer whats the matter with you today are you drunk

pull that train forward and back it up as i tell you or i shall report you to the superintendent youre devilishly contrary today

oh sam called some one

aw dont bother me today im in a hurry i am called by the board of directors to talk over the purchase of the a g s i am chairman of the committee and have no time to talk with you

hello sam greeted wyeth as this worthy came hurriedly by sam halted a moment and gazed at him then walked forward and extended his hand crying mr morgan im glad to see you i am called by the directors of the southern railway with regard to purchasing that line and merging it with the l  n

i see who owns the l  n now he inquired casually

me

and the a g s

i only have a half interest in that now

i understand that you refused to buy out the controlling interest in the tennessee coal and iron company

yes i refused i dont like the lineup in the directorship and besides i cannot see my way clear to act as chairman of the board of control therefore i considered it unwise to invest any millions in the thing

well i wont detain you since i know you are so busy good day

 good day mr morgan try to call at my office in the empire building before you leave town

 engineer if you dont switch better call at the office this evening and get your time i will fire you and sam hurried to his office just as john moore came from another direction sleepyeyed and looking like the last rose of summer the mis was waiting for him and as soon as he was inside she inquired with concealed suspicion well where were you last night

in jail

you seem fond of that place of late

he shrugged his shoulders sleepily

where did they get you this time

rosies

youve been quite a frequenter about there of late

didnt you have breakfast up there but then it seems you left before breakfast how came you back so early i didnt look for you so soon

how did you know that i had been got you are too smart nowadays anyhow

who went your bond

he regarded her out of impatient eyes now he glared at her but said i was eight dollars winner and had two dollars besides

umm so you give that to a professional bondsman

hello came a call from the outside

hello called back the mis come in

is john moore here said a bad looking negro with a head like a monkey and no chin at all moore looked uneasy

oh here you are said the other as he spied moore

his tone was full of contempt and a touch of anger was mingled where is my part for the stuff you disposed of

ssh not so loud

not so the devil you cant shoo me away any longer you aint paid me for the last bunch a chicken i brung heah and now you want t shoo me away on this last stuff we done stole togedder

wes gon talk it over heah n you gon hand me ove fo dollahs ah im goint take it outta yo stinkin hide he looked at moore now with an evil eye and that worthy backed up and picked up a pair of scissors that he had brought in late one night from one of the mysterious directions

oh you gon push them things through me eh

i gin fix you ah you gin fix me and with that he started in the others direction

the other came through the room where wyeth and legs were trying to play a game of checkers he was puffing so hard that he appeared to be afraid of himself

that low down skunk im gon run that nigga ontell is ankles done be so hot that the streets gon melt behind him doggone im

are you outside shap head called moore nervously

im out heah you liver eater come out wi yo ankles greased cause you gon run six blocks faster yu ebber did in yo life n when you gits to d end of it i gin kill yu

bang went the door and the key turned to describe the indignation of moore for the next few minutes what he would do what he ought to have done would be beyond the possibilities of our pen he was positively so bad that he had much effort to keep from doing injury to himself legs winked at wyeth and then rising unlocked the door and slipped out quietly a moment later a terrible banging was instituted upon the door wyeth held it closed with a great feigned effort

let me at him let me at him cried legs from the outside but john moore didnt wait to hear any more a crash and a rattle as of falling glass scattered about showed that an exit was unconventionally made in the rear wyeth and legs came around in time to see him going over the back fence the next time they saw him he was leading the other by about two rods as they went up the street

jumped right into his jaws laughed glenview as they watched the chase from the porch

ten minutes later some one tore into the house and turned the key of the door so quickly that it seemed like an automatic spring lock

it was john moore

lets go down to the drug store suggested wyeth

legs didnt hang out in that direction so glenview was the recipient of the suggestion he couldnt so presently wyeth went alone

they are going to fall down in both those towns on the securing of a y m c a for negroes and i knew they would when they started the druggist was saying when wyeth entered

negroes can secure nothing but churches down south

commented another

they have only a few weeks left before the time limit on the appropriations from the jew expires he offered twentyfive thousand to any association where the people secured an additional seventyfive thousand

now six months after the campaign for the association in grantville so said a mail clerk who ran to that city less than five thousand in cash out of a total of more than thirtythree thousand dollars subscribed has been collected to date how can thisâwhat is the name of the secretary of the proposed association â â yes i have it jacobsârev wilson jacobs figure they will be able to secure one in that town

its all stuff niggas down here would do nothing with an association no way said the druggist

i stopped at the y m c a when i was in chicago this summer said the bookkeeper in the dime savings bank it appears to be conducted with great success and is surely a fine clean uptodate place to stop regardless of the fact that almost everything is open to negroes in that city

yes but the negroes in chicago are civilized said another these negroes down here would have to have a half dozen police standing around to keep order if they had one

but dont you feel such a thing in this town would act as a great moral benefit suggested wyeth at this juncture

we now hear from tempest smiled the druggist

he had not been able as yet to reconcile himself to the bet he lost some months before and had since a grudge against wyeth

i see by todays paper that wilson jacobs will address the people of the city in regard to the christian forward movement and will be assisted by several white men of high standing in the city

well speeches will be all right but id bet a dollar to a dime that they will never secure a y m c a in the town he represents as for effingham no chance

you seem to be successful in getting the biggest kind of churches here said wyeth

yes returned the druggist and they will be paying for them as they have been for the lastâsince i ever knew anything

but they have the churches nevertheless

oh so far as that goes yes

they must have had to pay as much as forty per cent of the cost to secure a loan for the remainder

yes tempest but what has that to do with it

well if the big church on the corner up the street could be secured at a cost of seventyfive thousand dollars half or more of which i understand has been paid then a like amount should be available in a town of this size and which has an equal number of colored people shouldnt it

tempest is out for argument said the druggist

no argument when almost every large city in the northâand some not as large as this townâhave a y m c a for its black population and more than half that have such have not nearly the colored population that this town has and positively have not nearly the need

tempest has been worrying about a library a park and everything else for this town in the months he has been here the druggist said looking almost amused

wyeth took exception

i am interested in this town and in another where i see and read of more crime and murder than i ever dreamed was possible

then tempest said the druggist naively you ought to get one or at least you ought to awaken by some initiative on your part some enthusiasm to that end you see all we need you do a globe trotter and you have certainly criticised to that end and now his voice took on a cold hard tone i say do something to prove this criticism worth the while or ill brand you as a fakerâa frost with all your premeditated ideas

every one about was silent while their eyes turned and regarded sidney wyeth about the corners of their mouths a smile that spelled of a sneer played subtly

if sidney wyeth didnt see it he at least felt it and in that moment he realized that he would not dare show his face about this place lest he be scorned henceforth if he didnt take the stand the druggist had taken

very well dr randall he said rising  shall do so he regarded them all for a moment with a firm sweep of his eyes and next he turned and left the store

the arraignment i guess that will do whispered wyeth to himself arising from his typewriter at onethirty the following morning carefully he placed the typewritten pages in the drawer and retired

a colored man to see you mr byron said the clerk to the managing editor of the effingham ageherald

show him in said the other shortly and kept about his work a moment later sidney wyeth stood before the editor

well

i should like twenty minutes talk with you mr

byron said the other calmly

the editor laid down his pen and raising his eyes he began at the feet which were somewhat large ran the gaze up a pair of long legs and finally saw a chin a nose and the eyes and there they stopped he had been in the act of freezing what he was confident was a crank a fool or a knave to walk calmly into the office of the managing editor and ask for twenty minutes of his time

it was incredulous and yet when he saw the eyes of the other something therein told him strangely that this man was no fool nor a knaveânor any of the things he had been feeling he wasâwell he was a colored man which made it stranger still for colored men had not been in the habit of coming to his office at all much less asking for such an amount of time on his busy day he shifted his position and finally after swallowing guiltily the words he started to say he added be seated

i realize that you are busy very busy mr byron

wyeth began rapidly not waiting for the other to say anything more but my business is a matter of grave importance of the very gravest importance and that is why i have called and asked for the amount of time which i am aware is not customary for you to grant

the other said nothing he knew of nothing to say but somehow he simply sat viewing sidney wyeth out of curious eyesâand waiting the other unfolded one of several papers they were the editor now saw previous issues of his paper he wondered he had been very careful to kill stories that smelled of strife between the races    he did not conduct his paper with an appeal to race prejudice mr byron was proud of the fact too moreover while he had doubts as to the hurried evolution of the negro race to a place in the least equal to the one of which he was a member he had always tried when he could conveniently do so to say a word of kind encouragement with regard to the colored people only that week he had run a strong account on the front page with regard to the governors visit to tuscola at the invitation of its principal who had extended it the invitation came for the purpose of allowing the state government to see by a personal inspection whether the colored schools were entitled to a portion of certain funds the federal government had appropriated for the purpose of farm demonstration work

following his return to the city the governor had without reservation announced that the appropriation would be so divided as to allow tuscola institute and another negro school a liberal portion of said funds

steven byron justly took some of the credit for this and now is it a wonder that he held his breath while this young negro whom he had never seen before unfolded the paper and finally began

coming to the side of his desk wyeth reseated himself and pointing to an article said you recall this incident

yes said the editor still wondering

and this one also said the other with another paper unfolded and spread before him

of course

and for the next few seconds he showed him others

the other was still wondering when wyeth said do you recall following this particular wednesday when you published this article in regard to the park for colored people the number of teachers and preachers who presented themselves as the commissioner had suggested and requested

well yes there wereâ

eight to be exact three preachers and five teachers

yes the other was still curious

have you any idea what number of preachers and teachers you have among the colored people of this city

why a great many i am sure

three hundred or more according to the directory

i dont think they got all that teach elsewhere and make their homes here during vacation and i know they have not all the preachers but that is neither here nor there

in regard to this article about securing a library for the colored people how many visits can you recall were paid you by any of the teachers and preachers following the publication of it and can you recall how many letters you received or anything else connected with the instant

i can quite well i regret to say replied the editor for the simple reason i received no letters nor any visits

you requested in your paper of recent issue and which is before you that the leading colored peopleâand of course this includes the teachersâshould call at your office to make arrangement for the coming lecture in regard to the need of y m c as for the colored people of the south i suppose you have been favored with many visits

the other shook his head sadly as he replied no one has called among your people

very well bias it ever occurred to you mr byron that an unusual amount of crime appears to be the order in this city

who couldnt realize it that lived here or knew of the place through the columns of the papers

and unfortunately eighty per cent of the murders are committed by a certain twofifths of our population

that twofifths represents my race

the editor nodded

then in view of what i have just called to your attention does it occur to you that the leadersâor the shouldbeleaders of my people of this city are indicating by their actions that they care a hang what becomes of the race

the elements were beginning to clear now the editor said it certainly doesnt appear so

and yet how many of these people in conversation are ever ready when there is a mob demonstration to exploitâwhich in itself is much in orderâthe best people and what consideration should be shown them regardless of the ignorance and crime of the masses

does it not occur to the casual observer that a great deal of negligence is the order when it comes to moral uplift on the part of the leading negroes themselves

i cannot help but agree with you

then mr byron i have prepared an article arraigning this element of my race that i have brought with me and ask you to examine it with a view to publication

i beg you to read the same carefully and if you feel you would like to run it i shall appreciate it and if you do not i will call tomorrow and get the same forthwith he handed the editor the typewritten pages he had prepared the night before and with a bow left the office

the colored man that was here yesterday mr byron has called again and waits outside

show him in show him in at once cried the editor turning about and preparing himself for a conversation

well sir said wyeth after greetings had been exchanged you of course realize what i am here for

and i am certainly glad you called returned the editor with a serious face i have read the article and reread parts of it he paused and was thoughtful before he went on and must say that it is certainly strong whew the colored people are liable to lynch you for such an arraignment if i know them a little

i had considered all that before i submitted it

said the other resignedly

if a white man wrote such an article and brought it to the office i would not under any consideration publish it but since it has been written by a colored man well that makes a difference he was silent again

do you know he said regarding wyeth keenly i thought over what you wrote all last night i have thought of it in that way before but it would never have done to give utterance to it me a white man but take for instance he drew out the manuscript and turned to a certain page you say here that multitudes of these socalled leaders have accepted the work and the teaching of the wizard of tuscola merely because the white people have and that in accepting him and his views for the welfare of the race it has been merely to be on the popular side because the wizard is so much so but that they have no sincerity whatever in the words they say about him he laid the sheets down and raising his finger said how true that is why i know personally scores that would kick him for the statements he has made if they could do so but as you say further they seek to get into the band wagon at any cost now you refer at some length to the proposal to secure a park

it is a positive fact that the good white people of the south are made the object of bitterness by the northern people on account of something for which they cannot always be blamed now who would believe at the north that the white people were willing and ready to give the colored people a park a place for an outing for the children and the colored people didnt want it wyeth shook his head

nobody declared the editor nobody in the world and yet here is an example in this very town which has more murder and crime among its black population than any city in the world regardless of the size

and your race that body of people the teachers and preachers to whom we have naturally looked and asked for cooperation in securing a park have simply ignored our invitation

now in regard to the library here is the article and which i with care prepared myself what good has it done i have asked their cooperation not their money but i have been ignored the same as the commissioner was in regard to the park and before and since then crime continues

we know the lawabiding colored people cannot be altogether responsible for the crime of the polluted and the criminal but lord one would not suppose that they would so utterly disregard an effort on our part for their civic welfare

in the end you call attention to the churches and the condition of the pastors it is certainly time someone is calling to time ignorance in the ministry frankly i have long been of the opinion you advance in the article that an educational requirement should become a law with regard to preachers as well as to men in other professions think of it a profession calling for the highest general intelligence having the lowest rate of intelligence

and again this church building bee has submerged the baptist church among the colored people how can any of them be of any practical service when there is one for every one who can say jesus you draw attention to the inability of the southern cities to secure y m c as where the great masses of black people of course live not a one is in operation as they are conducted by the whites or by the colored people of the north it is easy to excuse the matter by pleading poverty but while that is a plausible excuse it seems quite feasible to build great big churches for a certain few they have two churches in this town that would cost more than a y m c a building complete

and yet in grantville and the other town and attalia they are required to raise only about onethird of the amount necessary

what then is the cause of this failure you have answered it in the pages of this manuscript

i am going to publish it and in doing so i am forewarned that it is going to arouse a world of indignation among your people or i miss my guess but it needs to be done something should come before them to awaken this sluggishness with regard to uplift among their own

so you may look for itâthe entire article on the front page of next sundays issue good day

that was sure a dirty deal dr randall and dr bard handed tempest wasnt it remarked l jones editor and owner of the effingham reporter colored to his assistant

i dont fully understand what was it i hear that wyeth bet or rather made a bet with dr bard about something said the other attentively

made a bet with bard and beat him a mile and bard through his friendship with randall who has had it in for wyeth since he came here over a bet that wyeth won from him hedged on it the dirtiest you can imagine

tell me in detail about it requested the other at that moment a private detective entered the office and upon overhearing the conversation said i can tell you all about it because i was there when the bet was made

it was like this or came about in this way down at the drug store wyeth has had the nerveâi guess that is how you can place it since the bunch including bard and randallâespecially randall dont appear to appreciate that any one knows anything but themselves

at least they have been this way in regard to that fellow wyeth so an argument came about that wyeth got into he quoted an editorial in regard to the prosperity of california and mentioned that california had more automobiles in proportion to population than any state in the union randall had no reason to take exception to this further than he was so anxious to put this wyeth in the wrong he started an argument but of course he had his dose last summer and knewâif he would have admitted itâthat wyeth was not arguing on something he didnt know but bard who accepts randall as the man who knows everything and who has argued so much that he would try to down anybody for the sake of it was regardless as to the merit bard took exception those fellows cannot appreciate anybodys knowing anything unless he is a doctor so in the course of the argument bard offered to bet wyeth five dollars that the state of iowa had more automobiles than california in proportion to its population wyeth called him and they put up the money

i heard bard explaining to one of their friends that iowa had so many automobiles but was away down when it came to population wyeth overheard him and agreed that iowa did have lots of machines but that he was wrong in regard to its being away down in population that in fact iowa had almost as many people as california the crowd ridiculed such an idea and cited the big cities of california as an evidence of the fact

there is no call for argument when the same is down in black and white look it up in the census wyeth declared bard colored while randall fished around in his belongings and found a book containing the last government census report now what do you think of a bunch that are always arguing and not one of them knew the population of either of those great states

not a one and most of them graduated from college

which showed that they have not studied what is around them while wyeth had

the report they found had iowas population for fifteen years before wrong said wyeth calmly

well here it is in black and white they all cried at once but its wrong i say declared wyeth you cant convince tempest on anything declared randall disgustedly you cannot convince me that iowa has not increased in population in fifteen years the census you are poring over there is fifteen years old they were taken aback they looked at the top of the page and saw they were all wrong again not a word did they say no they wouldnt admit in words to him that they were wrong when it was before them wyeth called the population and when they looked just to the side there it was it was the same with california and still not one of that bunch said by jove hes right no but they all knew then that he had won that bet and dr bard was sick just sick while randall was sore with himself

now here is how they hedged and kept from paying it wyeth wrote to two of the biggest motor magazines and to the department of commerce the department of commerce wrote back that the information he required could be gotten by consulting the magazine he had written to and stated what issues gave it wyeth brought the issues and the letters they then claimed that they would accept the information from the secretaries of the states only he wrote to these people and strange to say they did not answer and that was how they hedged there was only one of the bunch that frequents the place regularly who was man enough to tell them how cheap it was and that was dr landrum

he purchased wyeths book and read it and told wyeth that he had done finely for a beginner randall has had more criticism to offer upon it than any one else but would not of course honor wyeth by buying one

i guess he more than paid for one from what i have heard laughed jones and related the incident of the bet which had become known about town

well said the detective they are giving him the laugh down there now about how randall called him on his criticisms

i heard about that too said jones but you take it from me that fellow is going to make a fool of those fellows yet the man has something up his sleeve behind all this criticism he is accused of and i am looking for him to do something i dont know what it will be but i feel in my bones that it will be something that we will all know about

i agree with you said the detective that fellow has no college education like randall and bard and others that feel they are the only fish in the pond but he is a walking encyclopedia when it comes to every day facts about our country and the people and some day we are going to hear from him otherwise than through the pages of his book he didnt know all about writing when he wrote that but its some book at any rate

and with that he rose and went his way

sunday was a beautiful day the air was calm and soft a crowd was on hand early at randalls pharmacy as was the usual custom on sunday

well said randall cheerfully today is fine

wonder where tempest is and he looked about at the others amusedly a tittering went the rounds

he appears to be somewhat scarce about these premises since you called him some days ago said bard whereupon there was some more tittering

well guess ill look over the paper since our wise friend isnt around to teach us something and smothering his glee he uncovered the ageherald laying the funny pages aside he allowed his gaze to fall upon the front page of the general news section

what in hell he exclaimed in the next breath

what is it ran cried the crowd

negro says race faces dreadful conditions due to lack of interest by their leaders says selfishness is so much the order that there is no interest whatever toward uplift professional negro the worst

have you read this cried professor dawes bursting in a few minutes later what do you think of it

he was very much excited so were many others

that negros crazy cried professor ewes of the mater school professor ewes had read wyeths book which was loaned to him by one of his teachers who had purchased it from one of wyeths agents in two payments she had loaned it to professor ewes and professor ewes had in turn loaned it to professor dawes and professor dawes had in turn loaned it to another professor and after all three had read it it was returned to the original purchaser who had seen the advertisement that it was on sale at the biggest white store in the south and had been inspired to subscribe for it on that account when the book was returned to her she had read fifty odd pages and liked it so she told miss palmer

she further said she hoped some day to know the young man who had written such a great story and then miss palmer told her forthwith all interest became an argument

do you mean to say that fellow is the author of the book she inquired of her professor

oh yes he said

when the agent called for the remainder due he was handed the book with a statement that it was positively n g when the agent opened it as he was leaving the rear of the house of the wealthy white people a book mark dropped from between pages fifty and fiftyone

did you read what he said about the teachers exclaimed a supernumerary stopping in at the drug store and seeing everybody excited over the article jones came in behind her

this is where you come in for a big article in your next weeks issue said randall who didnt take any negro paper shoving the article under the eyes of the negro editor

im afraid mr wyeth has said all i would liked to have said he replied calmly

what several cried in consternation do you mean to say that you would have talked about the best people as this man has

i mean that i would have tried to i do not consider that i possess the ability to arrange it as he has you see his range and vision is beyond mine which has been confined to the southland while he has studied every section of the country we call the united states and he has as you will observe written this article in appreciation of that point of view

but great goodness jones cried randall very much excited and likewise forgetting that he did not subscribe for nor advertise in jones paper which was the best negro paper in the state because he said to everybody but jones himself it was n g and didnt pay to advertise in it see what he has said abou tour i have seen it what of it

its dreadfulâterrible

about the park and library you mean

sure

how can you say thatâor anything to the contrary when you know all he has related there is true

randall hesitated embarrassed for a moment then said but he neednt have made such an issue of it

but its true

wellâyesâof course its true butâ

and about this crime etc

yesâbutâ

he shouldnt have told it where the white people can read it assisted jones grimly those about became quiet very quickly and looked at each other jones saw the lay of the land and took his leave

at last at last he cried to himself as he went up the street the turning point has been reached when i write again of civic conditions in my paper and show up the fallacies among our own itll be read and notice taken of it

all that day indignation meetings denouncing the article by sidney wyeth was the order among effinghams black people all the week following it was further denounced and thus we come to the end of this part of our story

as for sidney wyeth he left effingham he left shortly after writing the article and went to another city in that other city he came back to where he startedâthat is something had come back to him which was his dream when we met him in the beginning of our story

that gals crooked

when mildred latham left the church she hurried to her room greatly excited without delay she threw her belongings together as quickly as possible and without care when she had them tied and ready for moving she went out locking the door behind her and paused briefly to gaze up and down the street after a moment in which she satisfied herself that neither were in sight she hurried down the street to where she knew a man lived who owned a dray

can you get a trunk and other matter for me at once she inquired subduing her excitement

i guess so sometime this afternoon what number miss he replied regarding her with admiring eyes she bit her lips in vexation

but i would like it moved at onceâright away she said quelling her excitement as best she could

oh very well didnt know you were in such a hurry he called to a black boy in the rear and after instructions turned to her and said fokes out eh hehe where you want it dumped

ohwhy yesâohâyou may just keep it here until i call for it please without further words she hurried away down the street she came to a boy with a push cart directed him to the address let him in saw to the loading of her luggage and when this was completed slipped quietly out behind him when a few doors away she paused long enough to gaze longingly in the direction of the number she had just left and then after a smothered sob she caught a car that took her miles to another side of town and where the houses were recently built near a new extension of the car tracks

two hours later she had succeeded in getting a room from a woman who had a daughter about her age she would get her meals at a small restaurant nearby until she could arrange to cook them in her room or maybe she might be allowed to cook them in the kitchen on the stove of the family she didnt request that privilege this day for she was too greatly excited to say more than she had to

its terrible she moaned silently when alone in the room she had secured i would not have left them like this for anything in the world but i could never stay there and take the risk i could never look in their faces again    but oh how i dislike to be away from them it is almost the only real home i ever knew and the only ones who ever really loved meâbut sidney   

i must not think of him i must forget but can i

that is what has worried me these months i can never forget how he looked at me that day that day when he would have spoken   

and then he came   that nightâbut that was the end the end of my dream and yet only yesterday i dont know why i coulnt seem to help it but i had hopes dear hopesâbut today she went to sleep after a time and all the night through was asleep and awake by turns it seemed that morning would never come and when it did at last she arose with heavy eyes

she decided to go for a walk and not canvass that morning she was glad now that constances work was in another part of the city and she could at least go about hers without any likelihood of meeting her

did you rest well last night inquired the lady of the house a hardfaced dark woman whose appearance did not appeal to mildred the night before and now she was less impressed than before

oh very well thank you she replied quickly so much so that the other looked at her keenly and when mildred saw her eyes now she detected an air of suspicion therein she flinched perceptibly the other saw this and was more suspicious still

you seem worried nervous said the other with feigned kindness but even in the tone could be discerned a mockery

i never sleep well when i change rooms and sleep in a new bed said mildred calmly the other nodded

this is my daughter the other announced as a tired looking black girl came forward mildred accepted the introduction with forced courtesy and only returned the greeting the other did likewise while her mother appearing to wish to tantalize the feelings of her roomer said you and she can be partners you must take her myrtle around to see your friends she now turned to mildred and said myrtle has many admirers so you and she can go out anytime and turn on a stunt 

she smiled a dry hard smile that almost made mildred shudder she made an excuse and hurried into the street preferring the outside air to the evil atmosphere she felt within

that gals crooked said the black woman to her daughter who had just come in that morning

how do you know said the other coldly

how do i know she repeated derisively do you suppose i have been in this town and seen a thousand gals with her sweet face and not know that she ain got a white manâmaybe two or threeâon her string

youre crookedâso crooked yourself ma that you see everybody else the same way said the other sinking into a chair and closing her eyes

ive always tried to make you straight and you know that her mother retorted grimly

a crooked mother cant raise a straight daughter

its up to the daughterâand ive failed a moment later she was snoring loudly the other regarded her now with a pang in her evil heart it always made her sad to see her only daughter like that she had fostered hopes while this one was growing up that she would be a lady she had sent her to school with the funds she got in any way she could but heredity was too strong they wouldnt have the girl after six months at the boarding school she attended in grantville no they expelled her with an emphatic letter that she should not return the following season she swore when she read the letter from the president and forthwith sent her to another the offense was repeated she sent her then to a catholic convent but in some way she escaped from this and when her mother saw her two months later she was living in adultery

mildred renewed her canvass that afternoon and under the spell of the work she was able after a time in part to forget the worry that possessed her she returned to her room humming a little song much to the surprise of herself she hushed however when she approached the house the face of the black woman seemed more cruel every time she saw it she wished she had another place but since she had moved in she decided to make the best of it

all that week she worked away diligently she worked to forget what had frightened her away from her friends and her success was great she placed the book in scores of homes through her concentrated efforts and when she returned at night she was invariably so much exhausted that she retired early and fell asleep the minute she touched the bed and awakened each morning rested and spurred on to a greater effort

sunday came again and having grown accustomed to attending church she knew it would be a long day for her without doing so she inquired of the people regarding a church and was embarrassed to have the woman remark oh you attend church well theres a big baptist church down the street and across five blocks while theres a smaller one two blocks up

thank you said mildred so sweetly that the other looked after her with open mouth

i cant make that gal out she said to her daughter as they sat together at breakfast

im glad of it growled the daughter without looking up

shes a puzzle sells a book but i will never bring myself to believe that she doesnt do something else on the side

evil to him who evil thinks said her daughter still looking in her plate i think i might possibly have been something ma if you hadnt been so evil now what right have you trying to trump up something against that girl supposing she aint straight does that give you any call for all time tryin t make her what she ain showed herself t be myrtle was impatient and her mother had a way of hushing up when she was in this mood

she cn certainly make herself look good commented the black woman as mildred passed out and went down the street in the direction given to the big church

has got some clothes too she commented further as the other remained silent she certainly knows how t have her men dont none ofm bother about where she lives and she goes t church on sunday  she laughed a low hard laugh but did not look in her daughters direction

mildred found the church it was indeed a large structure and a large crowd attended it she sat to one side where a window was raised and the soft air floated in above her as she caught the strains of the mammoth pipe organ and heard the music from a score or more voices in the choir she thought of her friends as never before since she left them she had told wilsonâwho was so goodâthat some day hed be the pastor of a big church a big church like this where thousands of people attended only forty members comprised his congregation he was delighted she recalled when as many as one hundred attended and she had wanted so much to help wilson jacobs and his sister in their great effort as she recalled how unceremoniously she had left them and at the very time they needed her more than ever she experienced a pain that made her turn in the pew

she heald the pastor now he was preaching she settled herself for a long sermon that was the kind the baptists preached she judged soon she found herself listening to the words that came from his lips he told the story of damon and pythias how glorious she thought pythias was a manâand so was damon

they were strong menâwith what was that she was thinking of it all the time yes they were strong men with the strength of their convictions amen came all about her and still the pastor was preaching and he was preaching a good sermon she heard it all and it concerned menâand the strength of their convictions

to be a christian she heard him now you must be strong you must be courageous and willing to sacrifice for your brother as was damon for pythias

there are those who are christians with all the feelingâon sunday monday they are like any other sinner this version of christianity and religion is the reason hell is getting so many people every day sometimes when i think it over i dont wonder because all my life i have been constrained to observe that too many people regard jesus as the individual and not as the moral

it is the moral of the christ his teachings and example that we are to follow we do not know him insofar as the christian sense is concerned as an individual but it is a fact that so many of our preachers wax eloquent and literally bring down the heavens and likewise great demonstration from the congregation thereby

but to be a successful practitioner one must be strong he must stand for something to be a successful farmer a man must be practical to be a successful business man requires application and fortitude to be a good husband and the father of a happy family requires strengthâin short to be anything in this life requires strength therefore dear friends fancy if you can how a weak man can be a christian for to be a christian requires the strength of all things

she was moved oh it was a relief to listen to a good sermon and she was glad to hear a baptist preacher speak so forcibly in such terms she was not so very well acquainted with this denomination and its pastors but from her observation she had almost concluded that they appealed to the emotion rather than to strength

she wondered now as she saw him making gestures in emphasizing his words whether he had taken any interest in the y m c a she decided to find out if she became an attendant of this church

when the sermon had closed she contributed liberally to the table whereupon she was looked at closely by the man who took collections when she had reseated herself and glanced in the direction of the table she saw the man pointing her out to the pastor whose eyes for a moment rested upon her in curiosity

when she was leaving the church at the close of the services someone touched her arm she turned quickly with a pang of the heart recalling with fright having been touched a week before she had no need to fear however it was the man who had taken collections

the pastor would like a word with you madam he said with his hat in his hand and all politeness she blushed and then turning followed him back into the church where she came upon the pastor standing among several people

ah he said advancing as soon as she drew near

and this is the young lady we observed pardon me miss but you are a stranger among us we wish you to feel welcome in our church i hope the service didnt bore you he was a good man her ideal of a true christian she replied with embarrassment and blushed fearfully oh no indeed not sir i enjoyed the serviceâoh ever so much and i am delighted to be made welcome here i hope to come to services very oftenâevery sunday i think you preached a wonderful sermon

she paused now too embarrassed to go on he saw it and made haste to dispell it introductions followed and invitations were the order

it was over now and she was happy at that moment she felt at peace with the world and this included the evil black woman with whom she roomed and who didnt attend church she grasped the hands that now sought hers and murmured kind words then she turned and before her stood the man with the scar

she uttered a low cry and the next moment fell prone upon her face in a dead faint

it was in that church last sunday

the sunday following mildreds departure was a sad one in the jacobs household since she came to it months before sunday had always been distinguished from other days it was then that all talked and smiled and indulged at length in other pastimes that make home happy and that is why today was the saddest day theyâconstance and her brotherâfelt they had ever experienced neither could keep their gaze from wandering to the empty chair and down in the hearts of each was a constant cry though both surpressed it with a mighty effort where is she today

it was wilson who broke the silence was it perhaps the one woman who had filled that empty chair only last sunday gay cheerful happy and hopeful wilson jacobs felt as though he should choke constance saw his emotion ere he spoke and experienced a choking sensation also she hadnt become reconciled to the absence and all the week through she had been like one in a trance

can we ever give mildred up constance constance did not reply she did not raise her head for fear he might happen to see her eyes but after a time she could hold back the tears no longer all at once they came in a flood and her whole being gave up to convulsive sobs

there there dear he cried rising and coming hurriedly around to where she sat whereupon she became worse he raised her to a standing posture and took her affectionately in his arms but the weeping went on unchecked he held her and stroked her hair with his hand but said nothing he could not for he was too overcome himself by and by he knew it would pass and then they would speak of her in the terms they had known her she was a good girl

oh wilson i will never get over itânever never never constance moaned and gripped him convulsively just think of it too and when we were beginning to realize how much she was to both of us

and just think how she acted about the y m c a

went to the bank and drew all the money she had saved this summer walking by day in the sun to sell the book and gave it every dollar of it to the cause of our people

she cried harder now than ever he drew her closer and as he did so one tear dropped from his eye upon her hair she never felt it and he would not have had her know for anything he was a strong man and had ever kept from tears

if we could only do something only help a little

he said now in a constrained voice i would give the rest of my life to the cause of that girl he said with words that spelled of fire whatever this lurking evil is that has driven her from the protection of those who love her it was in that church last sunday he paused now and while he stood silent his sister released herself looking at him for a moment sympathetically and then sank again into the chair

their breakfast had been neglected forgotten and was growing cold come wilson she called softly and pointed to his plate he heard her and obeyed they ate in absolute silence automatically putting from their minds the emotion that had possessed them

and even as he ate the food with the strength it required to force it down his mind played about the incident connected with her strange leaving he tried vainly to recall who was at the church that he did not know and it occurred to him that there were many

yes there were many then he remembered suddenly how cheered he had been when he saw his little church filled to its capacity he recalled with a pang that as he stood at the rostrum mildred had passed and upon seeing him had glanced at the congregation that had gathered and then back at him and smiled he continued his meal but he knew he could never forget that smile

mildred latham had wanted to help him and when she saw his small church filled with people that day some there purposely while others were merely curious she had in that smile shown how glad she was it was that unselfishness about her which was evident in many little ways and which had finally won him

and she had played and sung that day with all the strength of her body and soul she had struggled in every way she knew how to help him in his great effort

she had gone to the bank and drawn all she had saved in the months he had known her as further evidence of her regard for this human welfare she had acted in doing so at the most opportune time with such a sum from an unknown girl others during the week had surprised even themselves by subscribing sums that made the success of his work seemed assured and cash was given where it might not have been otherwise he knew his people a little and when someone started the ball rolling by means of patience fortitude hard work and application to the task others can be found who will keep it going

and why had mildred latham done this certainly she had not done so because she was in love with him

she had never shown any affection for him in that way

she had been interested in him because she felt that he was sincere in his effort to help his fellow men and she had given the sum to the proposed y m c a because she was interested in humanity and that was her mite to prove it   

and on the heels of this she hadâalmost in the same moment been driven from the place she had appreciated as home    who was this beast for positively he was a beast    when he got to a man in the case he could never go further for think as he might he could not in some way connect her with a man a man it might be but he felt positive she had no relation with anyone

and yet what was it just something and after that all was blank

they had finished their meal now and he rose and strolled out upon the porch he drew a cigar and lighting it started to smoke it was a beautiful morning and one to make even the sorrowful happy but wilson jacobs was not happy pie gave up to the delight of the moment and for a time he forgot the harrowing sorrows

the trees that lined the street were heavy with foliage and gave forth the sound of many song birds while a soft wind made the leaves rustle ever so little

presently a man came down the street on he came until he was even with the house and then for a brief spell he paused at the gate until then he had apparently not observed the man sitting on the porch

he glanced up and saw him then with something akin to an air of guilt the stranger passed on and as he did so wilson gave a start his thoughts flew back over the past with electric rapidity where had he seen that man before where where where his thoughts were fairly alive his lips grasped the cigar so tightly that the lighted end fell to the floor for he had bitten it in two in his excitement pie kicked it from him with impatience while he ransacked his brains in deep thought where where where he cried now almost aloud and strange as it seemed in some way he connected this man with the disappearance of mildred latham he raised his hands to his head to steady the thumping there which by now had reached a state of violence just then the sexton rang the bell of his church next door the same broke forth upon the clear morning air in stentorian tones and floated beyond and then wilson jacobs sat up quickly bolt upright

i have it i have it he cried in a subdued voice while his very frame trembled it was at the meeting

that man came in late i recall it all now he came in late and i saw him he i recall now appeared to have no interest in the service but his eyes sought something and then i caught him looking at mildred with a cunning expression why had he not thought of this before it was all clear to him now as he arose

and then it occurred to him to follow he tore into the house and seizing his hat hurried out and through the yard came into the street and looked in the direction which he had seen the other take no one was in sight

he hesitated a moment and then hurried forward in that direction he presently came abreast of a house where people sat upon the porch he halted a moment as they called out his name pleasantly bidding him good morning he calmed himself and after returning the greeting inquired quite casually whether a man had passed that way recently and he gave a description of him

no but such a man as you describe came down as far as the corner back there one of them explained and turned in that direction and he pointed west

thank you he nodded calmly and then retreated until he came to the place the other had turned he stood for a moment apparently lost in thought while the people on the porch stared at him carelessly a moment later he passed in the direction the other had taken

but while he had been advised that the other had gone in that direction no one was in sight he now saw with sinking heart he walked for two blocks making inquiries as he went but no one had seen such a man

he was downcast for a time presently he returned to his home in a disappointed mood as he came by the church the doors were open and his few members were filing scatteringly in he hurried into his clothes and a few minutes later stood before his congregation reading the text

uh es gotim a nigga

when mildred awakened she found herself stretched upon a pew with her head in a womans lap while the pastor and many others whom she had met a few minutes before stood about with anxious expressions two ladies were fanning her face vigorously she awoke with a start and recalled quickly the moment she had fainted

she had never done so before and had often wondered how people must feel when they fainted she knew now but that was not what she thought of when it became clear to her the man was her chief concern she sat up and looked about her quickly if she saw him she felt that she must certainly lose consciousness again

he was gone with a sigh she sank back into the arms of the woman for a moment the fanning was more vigorous now than ever all was quiet about her she did not first understand it was it because they were afraid it might disturb her or was itâhad they seenâ and understood she was too weak just then to speculate about the situation but she was delighted to hear the pastor say a moment later stroking her forehead kindly you feel better now miss

she nodded and felt now like crying she understood facial expressions and they had not seen she was so relievedâfor the present and did not think then of the future she had that to worry over later and for this moment at least she was relieved these good people hadnt suspected the cause of her swoon she sat up now smiled with thanks upon those about her and wiped the cold perspiration from her forehead someone held her hat which they now handed to her she placed it upon her head covering the mass of hair that many were looking at a moment before with natural admiration thanking them again in a kind and embarrassed manner she turned and left them while they followed to the door and went their many ways

when she got back to her room she experienced a spell of nervousness when she entered she saw the black womans face for a moment and was again relieved

the other had not been there so she nodded coldly and entered her room she closed the door and removing her apparel got into a kimono and threw herself upon the bed

she had no thoughts for a time but surrendered herself to idleness for perhaps a half hour and then her mind began to react it took the form of reminiscence

sidney wyeth came back into her memory and for a long time she lay thinking entirely of him

it was heâand he never knew what had started her on this strange journey she now recalledâor tried to recall why and then after a time she knew yes

she loved sidney wyeth and it was that which had made the difference but what kind of love was this that had no hope and yet did she not hope

as she lay with the hot air floating in upon her she gazed out into the street where a dozen or so little black boys played she thought with her mind idly drifting and she saw these boys as men in her idle fancy they gathered presently in a circle and when she watched them in her halfconscious halfwaking manner for a few minutes she saw they were shooting craps think of it these boys ranging in years from eight to twelve

and they were already engaged in that demoralizing pastime she trembled with sorrow as she watched the game proceed soon she saw that an argument of some kind had come up they became very demonstrative and while this was going on suddenly from a remote direction a bluecoated policeman appeared upon the scene there was a scramble and they flew in many directions all escaped with the exception of one he was a cripple and as he tried to hobble away the burly cop swooped down upon him he grasped him without regard for his infirmity and disappeared up the street dragging the cripple with him

and that was a common occurrence in this city

hundreds of young menâboysâwere started on a career of crime by premeditated arrests they were often placed in jail when they were so young that it was a tragedy when they came outâfor the courts could not bring themselves to sentence below a certain ageâ they were then pointed at as having been in jail and since they had the name they often thereafter diligently sought the game

as the policeman passed up the street with the pitiful cripple she rushed to the window to look after him

a little boy stuck his head through a broken fence and she heard him say as they went by uh es got im a nigga 

mildred stretched herself upon the bed again but her thoughts were now of something else the y m c a

and wilson jacobs at this same hour last sunday she had been with him in his effortâhis great effort and the need of such an effort had just been demonstrated a few minutes before almost beneath her very eyes

there was no place to go no place as a rule where young men would go and this helped to make it so bad

young men will play pool some of them and they will seek some kind of diversion other than the church

their natures call for these things and she knew it

since freedom the negro has not been sufficiently practical to appreciate this point of view plenty of churches are available and services are held all day sunday and it is easy so easy to say they ought to goâeverybody ought to go but does everybody go

would everybody go and the most discouraging part of it is that everybody does not go

some young men if there were a clean place to go and indulge in the pastimes that are a custom with many of them would be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity yes they would be glad and by so doing they would perforce meet others who were likewise seeking amusement thus brought together they would know and appreciate the good in each other and still further when they would go their many ways in life they would naturally spread the gospel of good or whatever was worth while such was the natural tendency of environment she had just witnessed such an example a mere incident in the citys life those boys had not all known the game when they began to play but those who did know it and had likewise learned it from somebody else had of course in turn taught it to these others who would in turn teach it still to others and so on evil environment bad influence she had seen these lurking evils in so many places in this city of the south and as the months went by they took heavy toll in startling numbers among the black children

the effort of wilson jacobs would not soon be appreciated it would take years for all these young men to see and know the real worth of such an institution

but it was the duty of society nevertheless and what was the church but the center of society to put forward all its efforts toward the evolution of its members

oh some day mildred latham hoped she could do more

apparently for the present she had done her best but as to how she could continue doing that which she loved better than anything else to do helping others she could not now see clearly she had no plans whatever for the future as she lay stretched across the bed this warm afternoon she had no thought of leaving the city and still she now knew that it was only a question of time when she would hear from this man again he had said nothing but she had read evil in his eyes he would strike sooner or later of that she was sure but she was now resigned to the inevitable she decided to continue her work the next day and to be brave she was away from those whom she would dislike to see embarrassed maybe he might go about his business if he had any and let her alone that was all she asked

if he spoke to her again and forced himself upon her she would ask him to do so she would even beg him not to annoy her and in the next thought she realized how useless this would be

she was in the street now and was walking along

this part of the city stood upon a considerable hill and some distance away ran the mighty river its muddy water could be seen from where she stood in that moment she wanted to be within its shining ripples

they led to the mightier ocean hundreds of miles below

impulsively she now sought the river and decided to walk all the way she had walked to it when she had stayed with her dear friendsâyes very often and then as she thought of them a fear arose in her bosom that she might possibly meet them that would never do and she turned back oh why could she not meet them

how much would it have meant to her to feel herself in constances arms to feel those kisses upon her cheek and to know that someone loved her yes to see wilson and appreciate his great kindness when these pleasant thoughts had spent themselves she realized they could never be anything more to her no she could go back there and they would take her in and ask no questions they would be good to her and appreciate her desire to do good but it would always be differentânow no

her life was before herâshe must work out her own destiny whither would it lead she made no effort to answer this question

she thought now of wyeth she formed his name with her lips and spoke it aloud and was made strangely happy and forgetful of that which troubled her when she heard it pronounced she repeated it sidney

oh but to hear him call to her now as he did that day

the day they danced and she had heard him stifle the passion she had seen his eyes and they had hypnotised her and in that moment of sweet insanity she had not resisted the kiss that she saw he would imprint no

and she had never been sorry somehow that one moment had been her guiding star she would continue into the future and thus it would always continue so

she arrived at the placeânot home she could never call this place home but where she had her room she came around to the rear she did not know why and then she was sorry too ranged about without regard as to how they sat were men and women their faces were flushed while their smiles were amorous she almost choked as she begged pardon and hurried around to the front she had not gotten out of reach of their voices when she heard the men say gee some kid

who is she

aw shes a little nicey nicey girlie that dont drink nor smoke nor chew norâanything but goes t church on sunday the black woman answered and laughed a nasty laugh

she was in her room and was glad she was shut away from the comment to forget it she busied herself with the names of her subscribers and worked over the same until the sun had disappeared for the day and twilight was in the air she lit a small lamp drew down the shade and taking up the tempest read until sleepiness drove her to bed

please go she cried hoarsely weeks had passed and mildred latham had not seen the man since that sunday at church she had become an active worker in the big baptist church she had no thought of becoming so but somehow she couldnt keep out of it such a great crowd of people attended it each sunday but they are not the select class of people she had met at the presbyterian they consisted of all classes and from every walk in life among them she met many of her subscribers and was pleased to be remembered by them they impressed her all of them as being good people in fact she could never believe many of them bad they were simple and too free in their thoughtsâwhen they had any they impressed her at times as so many children many of those who came to the church regularly did not she observed pay the least attention to the sermon for the most part the large majority could not even have remembered the text

and yet they came every sunday in great numbers in droves even many of them were very beautifully dressed there were no kinky heads among them albeit the original had been so the most of the hair which was theirs by birth was all straight while the acquired portion was beautifully matched

but the point that reconciled her was the fact that the pastor was a good man and a fit one he preached always the sermon that spoke of practical uplift and this she judged after a time was why he was not liked by all and why also a great many made not the slightest effort to listen to his sermons

aw reverend castle dont preach this religion lak i wants to hear it preached some complained umâm exploded others

they ain no iigion no mo mong the people they is all out fo style still others said

and thus it went out for style was in a great measure quite true but reverend castles sermons could easily be understood if those who attended made any effort whatever to do so but they did not and mildred could never reconcile herself to this

back in cincinnati she recalled when she used to attend a certain theatre the only reason colored people were allowed to purchase admittance was because they did not come in great numbers there were theaters where they were denied entrance because they made such disgusting disturbances and it was only because they would come and make no effort to understand the performance unless it was something below par and something entirely comic

in this city she had attended a great motion picture drama it was a play built upon an incident in the history of the struggle for christianityâthe effort to overthrow the power of caesar above all it was a play for christians which these multitudes professed very loudly to be and yet the entire performance was disturbed by the gallery where only the black people were allowed to sit they were assigned this portion because so few understood or made any effort to understand the play

these were some of the facts in the lives of her people which exposed the negro to the contempt of the white race

wilson jacobs and reverend castle were preachers of a new type and there were many other such ministers but the masses continued to preach in the old style regardless of the fact that many had prepared themselves to preach as these men did the old type still continued to work upon the emotional fibre of the congregation

and likewise in so doing others were disturbed who wished to be taught but the sermons of reverends jacobs and castle were not disturbed by emotional demonstrations the people were if the truth be known inspired to higher ideals and a more lofty conception of life christ was pictured in such sermons not as the moralist but in the highest type of perfection as an incentive to noble conduct

autumn finally came with its many varied tints and the leaves were falling jack frost had placed his feathery designs for the third time upon the window panes and in the meantime the work for social betterment went on apace

the effort toward the securing of the colored y m c

a as it was referred to had proceeded to the extent that it was on everybodys lips wilson jacobs had proved to be a secretary of unusual efficiency

mildred kept herself informed of it through the columns of the papers and was always delighted to see that subscriptions were being paid to an encouraging degree but she saw that of the thirtyfive thousand dollars to be raised by the colored people of the city only six thousand dollars had been paid in after two months campaigning

this was encouraging nevertheless for grantville with a much more intelligent negro population had only secured twothirds of this amount at the end of six months

yet twentynine thousand dollars were to be paid in

this amount had been over subscribed but getting the money was a different story would the black people of this town pay the twentynine thousand dollars before or by the first of the coming year for on that day the time limit of the jews contribution would expire also that from other sources but it was the money from the jew philanthropist that figured most prominently

frankly when mildred saw it she smothered her doubts as to their ability of obtaining the desired amount

rallies for the purpose of raising money were given weekly but wintertime was approaching and colored people very often had little set aside for such a purpose

then already work was shutting down and had shut down in many cases hard times had been felt for some time but were beginning to be felt more so men by the hundreds walked the streets in search of employment and found instead trouble arresting for vagrancy had been stopped by the order of the court many preferred being locked up for they complained it was so difficult to secure bread and even at times an impossibility whereas while locked up they could eat and that meant much

churches were now begging for money to buy coal the annual interest on indebtedness was past due and reverend castle did double workâthe y m c a and his church

and it was about this time when one evening mildred returned from her work and was informed by the black woman that she had a caller she was surprised and looked it the black woman was too and she likewise looked it moreover she made comment mildred had never had a caller before

a gentleman said the other when the look of surprise spread over her face the other winked and continued some guy too yes swell and laughed in a way which mildred always disliked to hear

who was he she presently inquired thinking of someone with a growing fear

didnt leave no name said you wouldnt know it nohow whereupon her black face took on a look that was tantalizing mildred ended it by going to her room

she felt the call would be repeated and then would come the climax she experienced a tired feeling this being sought by one whom she did not seek was nerveracking but she steeled herself for the ordeal she hoped since she now felt that he would call that he would come again that same evening and she would have it over

and he did

she was about to retire but not to sleep for as the time passed her nerve began to break under the strain of waiting and she was fatigued

the gentleman has returned miss announced the voice of the black woman as her fingers played upon the door mildred opened it forthwith andâyes there he was he pushed himself in without being asked and being surprised at the intrusion mildred let go the knob whereupon he grasped it and closed the door he smiled at her now a smile that lurked that boded no good and she felt this with a heaving of the breast

havent seen you for some time why dont you bid me welcome he leered her eyes stared at him coldly but her bosom heaved nevertheless

dont stare at me as if i were an iceberg said the other with his smiles just an old acquaintance fromâ and he jerked his thumb in the apparent direction of cincinnati he smiled a cruel hard smile as he did this dropped uninvited into a chair and lit a cigarette

have one he invited and then snickered you are real cute nowadays i observe he tortured quite a church lady ha ha and he gave up to his mirth for a few seconds quite cute with the preachers

wilson jacobs is bugy bout you awful bad for you t get up and steal away so mysteriously he looked at her now with ill concealed glee and then continued i didnt know youd beat it until the next sunday when i passed i didnt see you sitting on the porch with him but instead he sat there alone looking like the devil before dawn about the time i saw him he saw me and looked at me as if he had caught me trying to break in his house or something so i lit out i hunched youd fled d coup then n as i was beating it down the street in no slow gate i sees a drayman agreasin his old hack i had a premonition this guy the way he regarded me was likely to follow so i just slips into this old crows nest and gets behind someahis junk and gets int conversation with him and sure enough it wasnt three minutes before this preacher comes walking by alookin right and left for me i laffed in my sleeve and continued talking with the old skate

a bent key encountered my hand on the ground n i raised it up the old buzzard spied it and cried thats a gals key that come down heah t have me move her in a hurry las sunday i oughtta sent it tor but lows i ain got the time just lak a flash i gets wise so i says t im was she the girl that stayed up at jacobs

if so ill carry it to her since shes afriend amines by gad he coughs  n im the one thatll let y too and looked grateful where did she move to i inquired like i didnt care and then added y see i know the place by sight but i cant find its im turned around down here a little he puts me next and i beats it up to where youses roostin n i comes up i see this ole black hen aworkin away with the house all open v nobody about i dopes at once that you sweet little girlie is off someeres to church

you know the rest and rising now he came toward her you ought t be willin t give me a kiss now honey for showing how hard im willin to hustle for a sight a them eyes he advanced to where she stood

he smiled as he came while she recoiled from the sight of him and retreated that appeared to please him and he began a merry chase dodging behind chairs and jumping up and down playfully wants t tease eh

thats a way with you little women yu lak t tease

ah thats what makes us lak yu n kid i sho does lak you you are a pretty little wenchâi mean little gal he corrected continuing his chase

please go she cried hoarsely i dont know you

i dont want to know you why do you torment me

he only smiled now and looked grim and determined as he at last cornered her between them was a chair

she got behind it and grasped the back of it he halted on the other side and showed his teeth for a full minute before he said a word or a word was spoken

did you hear me why dont you go if you were a gentleman youd go his eyes narrowed to mere slits and then he suddenly opened them wide

just a kiss dearie why all this argument sometimes it goes so far that it spoils all the sweetness just allow me to turn this chair until i can be seated and then i will draw you down nicey upon my knee and everything is o kâsee he now grasped the chair which despite her efforts to hold it as it was he twisted slowly from her grasp the next minute he had succeeded and nothing was between them he made one step in her direction whereupon she recoiled in fright

he caught her wrist with his right and then with the left he proceeded to encircle her waist the next moment she felt his hot breath in her face and then with her free hand she struck him a resounding smack full on his cheek with all her strength he released her so quickly that he staggered backward blindly for a moment

the next he had recovered while his face was colored with the blood she had brought to it his eyes were narrower now than ever while his voice as he spoke came in gasps

why you little wench you little imp you little fourflusher you littlestrike me when i have kept my head closed all this time while you sailed about here with these big niggers the nicest little nicey ha

niceâhell how long do you figure these church people would kite you about if i told them what you were back in cincil

she flew to the door now and jerked it wide a bundle of meat with clothes on fell in with a scream it was the black woman and she had heard all

the time limit what is the total constance her brother inquired wearily as his sister poured over a long list of figures on a balance sheet before her

in a minute she said and continued her figuring

presently with a sigh she straightened up and handed him a sheet showing a list of names at the right of which was registered various amounts

seven thousand six hundred fiftynine dollars and fifteen cents he repeated half aloud he looked at his sister and saw in her tired eyes failure staring them in the face unless something extraordinary occurred the chances of securing a y m c a for the colored youth of the city was doomed to failure he laid the sheet down and picked up another piece of paperâa letter

he had read it several times but now he read it again

he didnt want to believe what was written upon it and signed by the jew philanthrophist put it was before him in plain typewritten words and was to this effect mr wilson jacobs secretary y m c a

my dear sir receipt of your letter of december  is here acknowledged i note carefully what you say in regard to your efforts in relation to the securing of funds for the y m c a for the colored youth of your city

you are of course aware that my offer made five years ago in which i agreed to give the sum of  to any city where an additional sum of  was forthcoming from other sources

the time i made that offer was live years ago january of the coming year therefore the time will expire at twelve december  this month

w ith regard to extending the time limit on these gifts i regret to say that i have made no such provision moreover with the present condition of the financial outlook i cannot see my way clear to do so however all cities that report favorably up to that date i will fulfdl my agreement

regretting that i cannot write you more favorably but hoping it will be possible for you to comply with my offer i beg to remain very truly j rosenthal

he laid the letter aside he had known before he wrote what to expect for announcements had come from grantville that the philanthropist would not extend the time on his gifts for this purpose hard times had spread over the country until not enough was being collected to maintain the cost of the office and advertising notwithstanding the fact that they secured it at the smallest possible rate both were compelled to acknowledge now that a failure seemed imminent to secure the gift of the jew it was necessary for them to raise still more than twentyseven thousand dallars

could he raise such a sum in view of prevailing circumstances

have you received a decision from the railroad president who personally contributed five hundred dollars wilson constance now inquired

the hoped for appropriations for such purposes have been deferred indefinitely he replied so there is no hope now only from the local interests and they i fear are hopeless

and you see no place where such a sum might be raisedâin so short a time she asked again a trifle nervous

only to go north and try to enlist the sympathy of other philanthropic persons

andâwillâyou go she looked at him now anxiously

yes i will go he returned

may god be with us she sighed and picked up the afternoon paper she glanced over it and saw the usual accounts relating to the shutting down of various industrial concerns and as hes looked further there were the same accounts regarding the colored people the business of fighting and stealing and getting drunk went on more actively than usual if such were possible she laid it aside presently and flicked up her subscription list she was still selling the book and had a great many sales for the holiday trade

when she paid the charges on a consignment of books a few minutes later and unwrapped them she thought of her dear friend who had brought her attention to the work how much she would have liked to see her she did not conjecture but she was glad now she had taken up the work the returns from the sale of it had meant a great deal to the home in the past months wilson who usually made some money otherwise than what he received from the church which was small had been unable to look after or give his time to anything but the work of the y m c a therefore the money from the sale of the book had come in at an opportune time

as for mildred the earth seemed to have swallowed her insofar as they had been able to ascertain wilson had worried to a point where he now looked ten years older than he had six months before grantville had given up in despair five thousand dollars was all they had been able to raise and therefore realized how useless it was to continue the effort which had subsequently come to an end she believed in her brother she was confident he could raise the amount necessary if he had the time if the gift from the jew could have been possible a year hence she was confident he could raise the balance but with less than four weeks it seemed hopeless

and yet as long as there is life there is hope he would go north the coming mondayâthis was fridayâ and she hoped he would be successful until he returned she would not despair she made preparations for his departure by packing his steamer trunk washed his handkerchiefs purchased many little necessities from her own purse and placed them along with the rest of his belongings

will you go to new york or chicago she inquired as they sat at dinner

i suppose the chances are better beyond new york

i shall of course go directly to new york but from there i will go into new england i have credentials from several well known white people as well as letters from the secretary of the white y m c a here and at effingham and attalia so i think that part is quite sufficiently looked after when reverend wilson jacobs had dined he felt like walking and drawing on a light overcoat and cap he strolled out into the chill december night the air was still and the stars gleamed brightly as he strolled down the street in the direction of the river when he had gone three blocks he decided to walk to the river and look out upon its water for a spell so increasing his speed he walked briskly in that direction

to reach the river by the street he was following it was necessary to pass through a district of the town that had not the best reputation it was a part of the town inhabited in former days by denizens of the underworld and was interspersed with many halls and buildings that had been built for such purposes since liquor had been voted out of the state and the city likewise while the women had also been forced to scatter due to the enforcement of the law relative to their profession the neighborhood had been given over largely to bootlegging places operating under the guise of softdrink shops sold liquor as freely as the saloons had when they operated in the same places a year ago and in this district holdups and other cases of outlawry were a common occurrence

he had arrived and was passing leisurely through this part of the town when ahead of him a figure crossed the street and entered one of the dives something about the swing of the arms made him recall that he had seen that person before he thought it over as he approached the place the other had entered he had not reached it when the other emerged and made his way up the street ahead of him only a few yards he studied the character and when he turned into another place a few doors up he recalled where he had seen him it was the man who had paused before his gate months before and whom he had started to follow but who had eluded him he saw no reason for paying him further attention now and passed on to the river

he returned by the same street and as he came abreast of an open door he overheard voices and caught a glimpse of the man again he halted and leaned beside the door in the shade of the building a moment out of sheer curiosity the voices came to his ears plainly as he stood there

i have reason to believe she has money said one whom he surmised was that of the man he had seen

if she has you have spoiled your chances of getting hold of any of it

how do you figure that out said the other gruffly

well what you should have done was to have communicated with her while she was stopping up here with that preacher and his sister and made her come across to keep you from putting them next now s i figure it out you blows in on her with your recognition game and frightens her out of her wits and she flies the coup

and then to make matters worse you trail her across town to where she beats it and instead of using a little diplomacy you blow in on her and frighten her away from there you played a deuce of a game you did the tone was impatient and from the way the other shifted it was quite obvious that he was not playing a clever one either

well she was such a good looking little wench that to be truthful i lost my head over her the other laughed a low hard laugh as he said this

lost your head hump growled another i cant get into my nut how you blame niggas get in your ugly knots that a gal thats got the sense you say this gal has is going to fall to a cheap nigga like yourself

the voice showed that the speaker was plainly disgusted

aw old shine ive had some as good looking a gals as her on my string dont fool yourself bout that

the first speaker retorted

how much sense did they have in their nuts none

if they had theyd a never fooled with you

well im still trailing her i ain give up yet im determined ill bring her to time or ill know the reason why the other declared determinedly

dont the ole cat down where she was roosting know where she has gone inquired the other now

dont know a thing swears that she dont and i blieve her shes a little sore cause i blew in and scared her away funny too cause that old womans so crooked she cain lay straight in bed and say you know lizzie the good looking black gal that comes over to dagos place and licks up so much booze

who slender liz sure why

thats her ma

the dickens

sure is

that beats the devil i know her but i didnt know until this minute that liz was her brat and you mean to say this little gal what you lost your head about and chased away was stopping with the old woman

that was where she slapped me blind at

well ill be darned i shouldnt have thought shed have stayed around her very long when she got next to what was going on

well the little wench was so frightened when she left this preacher up here that she didnt know where she was going and she got into the place hurriedly and then after she had got tied up there she seemed to have decided to stick it out until she could do better then besides the old woman told me that she dont think the gal knew she sold liquor and ran a crap game every saturday night her room was so located that the gamesters came and went without going near her room

then the gal kept herself shut in like a prisoner when she was around besides

i wish you hadnt spoiled this deal i believe we could have dug enough dough out of her to stake us into a game when were settin roun broke like we are now

ill get her just be patient i dont believe shes left town but i cant pull the old woman for any more information besides she ain got over me frightening her away cause she said the gal was sure a fine roomer and that she is sorry now that i found her at all these old crooks can be won over when you come clean at that

bet your life they can and when you get the friendship of one like that theyd go through fire for you

there was a shuffling about now as if someone was coming toward the door wilson hurried away and walked rapidly in the direction of home

the black cavalrys chargeâonward boys

mildred my mildred where are you dear heart

said wilson jacobs as he hurried in the direction of his home after he had overheard the words of the two men

he was in a turmoil of excitement he had reached no decision as to what he would do that is as to how he would find her but he was determined that he would search the city to the very doors until he found and brought back that girl to his home

she is being persecuted being hounded out of her life as she has been out of the place she called her homeâ and by those brutes and he trembled with anger as he thought of the dastardly creatures who were pursuing her

 i could corner that brute and make him confess what is behind this mystery but then i have overheard him admit that she has eluded him therefore that would be useless until he ascertains her whereabouts it would be foolish even to whip the cur for his villainy one thing he decided on ere he had gone far in his reflections and that was to keep it from his sister it would only serve to upset her more and she was worried enough already

my poor dear little girl my brave little girl and you must bear this burden and sorrow all alone he murmured in a strained voice as he approached his abode somewhere in this city she is in fear tonight in fear of these dark creatures i would give half my life to find her this very night oh that i had some clue

she would not have me find her but that is a matter that i would waive aside her happiness even her very life is in danger and whatever this evil may be i will never believe even from her own lips that mildred latham is guilty of any act that would not become a lady somewhere in the past she has in some way become involved and this in some manner is the occasion of the mystery but i have faith in her above all others and so with this thought he entered the house and his room where he walked for hours trying to form some plan of action

i will find her i must find her he declared with compressed lips time and again but as to how no way seemed clear i must leave monday on the mission and i must try to find her before then i dont care what it isâhas been and might be in the futureâi love you mildred i love youânothing else matters i have faith in you i believe in you above all others with your presence under my protection i feel i could do the things you had faith i could do he almost raved at times during the still hours that followed

all the kind words she had said to him in the months gone by came back to him as he trod the floorâthinking thinking thinking you will succeed you will become ere long a leader of men she had said once for it is you courageous with the strength of your convictions this race needs and it is you they will eventually find

she had said this with all the fervor of her soul and he had listened he had hoped and then he had worked

yes wilson jacobs had worked hard to raise those few thousands that would revert back to the donors in four weeks if a preponderous sum was not raised by midnight of december thirtyfirst december thirtyfirst midnight god how that sounded in his ears now

the fateful night one minute after that hour sixtyseven thousand dollars waiting from other sources than the black people of this town would be no longer available seventythree thousand dollars for the future moral welfare of thousands of young men of this race would no longer be available unless he wilson jacobs could raise twentyseven thousand dollars in a day over three weeks

that was his burden

if he wilson jacobs could raise such an amount innumerable black children yearly and until the end of time oh how long    until the end of time would be saved and have their chance their great chance to become men how much they needed it these black youth

only to see any daily every daily paper would answer this and how much would they appreciate it yes how much would they appreciate it    and yet what did that matter    yes there were plenty who would say offhand they would not know how to appreciate it they are incapable of appreciating it    but that was from those who did not think deeplyâand yes the majority by far of this race to which he belonged did not think deeply but wilson jacobs did he had made it a part of his young life to think deeply and in the interest of those who needed him

and now they needed him oh how much they needed him and how much strength he needed to raise twentyseven thousand dollars before midnight of december thirtyfirst

black people do appreciate that which is for their good but he merciful dear god they know it not

but they will and when they do come to know it how much life how much feeling and enthusiasm they will exert and may we not say the same of all of us

he had been a very young man when his countryâyes his countryâregardless of the fact that many of this race now said with pent up anger this is not our country its the white mans country how much bitterness they put into the words he could not soon forget but this was his country and he proclaimed it as such and had enlisted and gone away to that little island to the southeast

he was with that cavalry that cavalry of black men

and when thousands of aimless bullets poured upon americas greatest cavalry commanded by the greatest american citizen since one immortal one who met his death cruelly but for this country and tumbled them from the saddles like so many playthings he would never forget that battle cry onward boys and from another direction they came black men up a hill that was forbidding in the abruptness of its ascent they went

under the heavy fire of the enemy they did not flinch

what they did on that memorable day in our modern history the world knows and if a part of our citizens did not appreciate it at this date one did and he proved it in afteryears so when he heard these poor men of his race now bemoan their fate crying this is a white mans country we have none he sighed and felt pity in his heart for them

after the war he had gone to arizona and spent one summer there at a ranch during his vacation and this ranch was among the navajos dull listless inert creatures they were they did nothing to make this country a better place in which to live and they had never done so nor were they ever likely to but in spite of that they are the primitive inhabitants and heroes but not in the best sense could anyone live among those people three months and conscientiously regard them as men and yet they were given every consideration while black men were thrust aside and this was after three hundred years out of which two hundred and fifty were spent in developing that which is called dixie

and in spite of these conditions wilson jacobs was the most optimistic of all men he conscientiously believed that this was a black mans as well as a white mans country yes he heard those others say this is a white mans country and they said it very loudly but these same men were the scions of those who had tried at the price of all their wealth and blood to divide it he never let his memory dwell upon this other black men did though so much so that they made themselves unfit for this new generation what has been done he always considered could never be undone

if prejudice against his people was the custom here prejudice against the jew elsewhere was usual also

but it isnt right they would deplore and of course he could only agree that it wasnt to hate thy brother is contrary to the laws of christianity under which we live    but the prejudice remained after all that could be said its growing worse they cried

yes it appears to grow worse he also agreed then what have you to say and he answered nothing

and then asked and you nothing then what are we to do become examples of dull inertia by grieving over it or shall we struggle to become men and through the strength of our mind and bodies make this a better place in which to live if only for ourselves

for live we must not since the beginning of the world have ten million souls sunk into oblivion the pessimist always departed at this point

after all jacobs felt sorry and pitied bothâthe ones who bemoaned their fate and those who boasted

both were in error for regardless of what was said he loved america his home and a mans country so when college had given wilson jacobs his degree he drifted about for a year among his people he had never thought of the ministry as a vocation and it was only when he had seen his people as they wereânot altogether as they ought to be did he appreciate the fact that he might be able to help them he had learned while at school but more in actual life that jesus lived and died as a moral example but his people saw only the individual

so back to school he had gone where he studied five long years to fit himself for his present calling his success was yet to come mildred latham had said it would come oh mildred for you i would go through eternity he declared feverishly but only the silent walls answered him

after many hours he retired the sun was shining although it was december when he heard constance calling him to breakfast how much he would have liked to have said constance mildred is somewhere in this town our mildred she is being persecuted constance our mildred is being persecutedâbeing hounded out of the sweet life we know she lived and inspired in those about her and he knew that constance would say go forth my brother and find her bring her back into our home that we may love her and make her our sister for it is as such she was and more these many months that was the spirit of the jacobs

but he kept his peace and ate in silence

monday came a cold dreary day snow fell all over the country and dixie land far south was white mantled wilson jacobs went to the depot for he was leaving on a great mission would he succeed he hoped so others hoped so and constance hoped so as well as mildred latham

but he never knew

please stopâand save me

breakfast is ready my dear said mother jane for as such she was known and called by all who knew her

she was speaking to mildred latham

a moment later mildred came out of her room and seated herself at the table at the head of which sat an old grayheaded man and at the foot sat mother jane whose head was white also

and did you rest well my dear inquired mother jane of mildred bestowing upon her a smite full of kindness and tenderness

i slept beautifully mildred replied as kindly and beamed upon the old soul with all the considerationâ maybe moreâof her own child

and you sell a book inquired the elder woman after a moment

yes maam i sell a book a book by a young colored author

by a young colored author i do declare exclaimed the other with enthusiasm it is delightful when i know we have young men who are doing something else besides making convicts mother jane was known for her wit

what is the text of this story she inquired later

mildred told her

delightful to say the least the elder woman had secured some learning in her childhood and had studied by consistent reading until she was well informed and used the most perfect english went out into the great west to the rosebud country well well i read all about that country when it was opened to settlers some years ago i wanted my son to go butâhe went elsewhere and she paused to swallow while a tear shone in her old eyes mildred spoke of other things the other didnt say but quick intuition told her that son had gone to the chain gang

she had found this place two days after the visit that was paid her by the unwelcome guest it was far removed from the black woman and she was glad of it and yet when she was taking her leave that apparently evil creature had shed tears and begged her to stay saying that she would not be molested further mildred felt a human pity for her but she knew she could not have stayed on the longer she lived the more she was learning that secrets are not good things to share with others or for others to be in possession of regardless of their good will thereto she now knew that the only way she would have people to know these things people she might chance to live with would be to tell them before she moved into the house to have them find out afterwards and from others would be she felt an infringement upon their kindness as for the man who had with his persistency driven her from two places she hoped he would not succeed in finding her in the present

the following day she went about her work with heavy heart she felt she must continue in the work as long as she was in the city and besides she had accumulated many orders for the holiday trade and could with her efforts secure many others but it was not this alone that held her in this city it was something else

she was following the effort of wilson jacobs to secure the y m c a each week she carefully noted the details in regard to the same and had fearfully observed that it might fail she was aware of the time limit and she was worried over the lack of the twentyseven thousand dollars how can he raise such a large sum in so short a time she asked herself many times each day and yet she still hoped he would even when less than four weeks were left in which to do so

she had managed by dint of economy and hard work to accumulate almost two hundred dollars since she left them and this she would give at the right moment when she saw there was any possible chance of his succeeding she would have to send it anonymously but desire for his success was her gravest concern

sunday came and she stayed at home for the first time since she came to the city the sound of the bells made her feel terribly sad and lonely to have heard wilson jacobs or reverend castle would have been a privilege of which she would have been thankful to have availed herself but fear kept her confined to her room all that day she felt positive that he would visit all the churches in search of her that day and other sundays so with this pleasure denied her she felt more lonely now than she had ever felt before since coming to the city

she purchased a book a new novel the evening before so in this she concentrated her mind all that day it was an unusual story which made it more interesting it seemed that in england where the plot lay a postmaster was likely to be removed through subtle influences

to save the position for him because of her love his wife who was all to him made a sublime sacrifice it came to his attention and in doing so the fact of her past was also revealed it was a terrible book to say the least but between the lines was a moral that the reader was compelled to appreciate in the end the man was redeemed to her through the churchâthe baptist church

two weeks passed without event her work went along nicely and she succeeded in delivering to almost all of her holiday customers it was about this time that she became deeply concerned with regard to the possibility of securing the y m c a wilson jacobs had not returned nor had any word come from him so far as the public knew as to whether he had met with success but mildred entertained grave doubts regarding the matter if he were succeeding it was her opinion that some word would be wired that cheer might fill the hearts of the anxious ones waiting she wished she could go to constance and comfort her during these anxious days that desire became so uppermost in her mind and heart that it was with difficulty she kept herself from rushing madly to the house and throwing herself to the others feet she felt strangely guilty she had convicted herself in their eyes by fleeing it couldnt be changed now no she could not go to constance as much as she wanted to and as she looked into it deeper she came to realize that she could never go to constance again    that was the hardest part of it

never to go to her again oh the anguish it gave her when this was regarded as a reality

constance she prayed on her knees that night

constance will you can you forgive me can you forgive mildred she loved you and your brother and it was because she was weak because she felt that she could never have stood to see both of you knowâfelt me otherwise than as you knew me oh i have suffered constance i have died a living death daily i long for you i pray in the only way i know how that he your brother whom i know to be so strong and noble and good may succeed in this great effort this effort which these others so much need some day oh lord may it come to passâthough my mind cannot now see it i hope to feel that love again

and then it came to pass the next day she met the other upon the streets he smiled upon her through his ugly teeth and in soothing words offered greeting she passed him by but knew without looking back that he followed she had completed her work for that day

many copies of his book she had placed in other hands and that night many eyes would begin an acquaintance with those years in the west and now at her heels followed her vendetta he would follow her to mother janes and then she trembled she could never allow mother jane to even think she was any other but her dear daughter for it was such mother jane now called her anywhere nowâbut there

she increased her steps made them faster in a direction that led toâshe knew not where nor cared but anywhere but to mother janes supper would be awaiting her there at sixthirty as it had waited for her every day these past weeks but mother jane would be disappointed this evening mildred latham would not see mother jane at that hour today and maybe she mother jane might never see her daughter again   

on she went before her over a hill came a car she could not catch that one but others would come that way soon maybe by the time she arrived beside the tracks another might meet her she hurried she never looked back she was too frightened but intuition told her that he followed she wished she knew how far he was in the rear maybe if the car came before he arrived she could elude him oh if it would

she was trotting now she was so near the tracks at this time that they glistened like steel rays in the distance from a direction which was not the way the other car had come she heard another car it was approaching and now it flashed into sight

the sun had disappeared long ago and the stars stood out like a million diamonds in the skies above the evening air was chill and she rushedâshe was running nowâpast the houses the car was almost at the crossing would she make it she cried out and waved her hand frantically it was going to pass her although she had arrived at the crossing and regarded it with eyes that were franticâwild please stop mr motorman

she cried piteously

please stopâand save me it tore by her the front end in the rear she heard the crunch of feet upon the gravel street she saw the side of the car it dazzled her she was lost she could almost feel the presence of the other one terrible moment she swayed and the next the rear end of the car was before her

welcome did the inside seem she must catch that car she feltâor die a brass rail touched her hand like electricity it closed over it she was raised and then felt her body speeding through space a cry from the inside and a ting then a shutting of brakes and the car came to a stop

my god the conductor was saying why did she grab that rail this is the only line left with cars with the open entry none of the others can be caught without the consent of the conductor she looked about her she sat in the rear of the car that was now speeding into the business section about her were many anxious faces

why oh why their eyes and lips spoke as soon as they saw her did you take that terrible risk but she did not see their eyes or hear their wordsâfor her eyes were looking for another he was not there

and they never knew

what her eyes saw our daughter is late tonight gabriel said mother jane coming from the door where she had been many times it is now almost seven and she has not yet arrived i am uneasy but i will be patient maybe she had to wait on some of her customers it is so near the holidays that some may have been downtown buying presents for their friends and she is compelled to wait

of course she has never been late before which doesnt mean that she might not be late todayâbut oh well ill wait

gabriel her old husband played with his fork and said nothing he never said anything he had not said anything since  the rebels at fort pillar stopped him from saying anything further for since then he had been speechless

we will have a big christmas this year gabriel

said she mildreds being with us will make a difference she was silent now listening to the fire that cracked in the grate presently her eyes sought a place at the table it was the place mildred occupied but she was thinking of another this other had been all to her for he was her son tears came to her eyes now as she thought of the years gone by and the times she had fixed that place for him yes she had fixed the plate there for him a thousand times but he did notâhad not eaten from it for many a meal now no he ate elsewhere as she looked at the place today strangely she felt he would never eat there again and he was her only child if he failed to carry the name beyond his present circumstances then the name of gabriel ware ended with her mute husband who sat waiting patiently

it will be so nice gabriel to have her with us this christmas and she stays right at home and reads to us both every night she is a sweet child is mildred

she has been our own daughter since she came here

it has been a treat for me because i love so much to read while you have liked since  to hear me but my old eyes cannot follow the lines with the accuracy they used to no the lines run together so often now and when they become clear again it is so hard and tiresome to find the place but since she came with her young eyes her cheerful smiles her endless patience with old people who at the best are hard to get along with i appreciate that things have been so different

gabriel nodded they lived easily these two this may be a white mans country but our uncle

took care of gabriel and mother jane comfortably

these many years he gave to them many dollars at the end of every quarter and he had increased this until now gabriel received ninety dollars four times a year

a step sounded upon the porch there she is god bless her said mother jane and flew to the door opening it wide and then alas no mildred stood on the thresholdâbut a man

his teeth shown and his hat in hand he stood with a bow and inquired if miss mildred latham was within

on the main street of the town where all cars find their way mildred alighted and crossing the street she waited for the car that would take her to the suburbs which was near where mother jane lived

when gabriel and she had built and settled it was far from the town and they had not dreamed that some day before they died that their ten acres would be surrounded but the city grew and they had sold the ten acres long since in lots for big prices they had money she now knew a part of which they had received for the lots and they owned other houses but a part of what they had was gone it had been invested in a shoe store incorporated and conducted by colored people

they knew not how colored people act in such capacity so in due time they failed therefore going the way of thousands of such attempts in dixie for you see these black people had not known how to conduct such a business they only knew how to wear shoes when they were fitted by the other race

now for home mildred sighed as she settled back and listened to the hum of the car as it sped on its way oh how glad i am that i eluded him she breathed happily ill be late which i dislike but its better late than never blessed old dears she added impulsively and then fell to planning for the christmas day it was so near now that she would have to hurry in her few plans months ago she had hoped she was going to spend a real genuine merry christmas with her friends the jacobs but now long since of course she had given that up but she was glad that she had found this new place and had been there long enough to be so high in their favor as to be the star guest for their holiday

they were industrious and raised almost all they ate in a garden of a half acre in the rear and chickens

mother jane had raised two hundred fifty so they had this meat almost every day for supper they would have some surely so soon she would eat and then the two would prepare for the coming event she was impatient to be there

it was freezing outside ice could be seen from the car window gathering wherever there was water

a nice hot fire they would have she knew while she had a good new book that vas half read through after all was done she would read to them and so all three would be made happy

she fell to thinking to thinking of others and sidney wyeth came to her mind last christmas she had received two nice books from him he wrote no letter nor did he autograph the sameâhe didnt even let her know by word or letter that they were from him but she knew

where was heâwhere had he been since she wished she knew for if she did as she thought now she would send him a nice book for a christmas present but he would never know it was from her her pleasure would be in the giving that was why presents were given

for the pleasure of giving a token of remembrance

some people did not consider it that way but then they were not christians she wondered as the car sped along how many people who belonged to church did not know they were not christians

i wish i knew where he is she said again this time half aloud somehow i believe he wouldâforgetâfor a day and then she thought of wilson jacobs and in doing so recalled that in the months gone by she had seen him at the end of a talk and was forced to look away she could not stand the pain in his eyes did he care for her she wouldnt trust herself to believe it

it wouldnt be right no she was glad now that it had gone no further it wasnt right that he should be allowed to do that and then learn the truth oh the truth that was her burden the other had learned the truth and then he went away he would never return no and wilson jacobs would do likewise

she had struggled these months to keep it from him

if he learned from other lips it would be as sad but she would at least not have to face him and see another suffering in his eyes with sidney wyeth it now seemed different as she had grown to feel she believed she could meet him she felt now that if she could find his whereabouts she would go to him yes she would go to him and see him and let him see her oh as much as she loved himâfor her love had never diedâshe believed now she could look in his eyes and ask him to forget she suddenly made up her mind to leave and seek him but i cant she moaned i can never leave here until i know the worst in regard to the y m

c a no i would never be happy to leave them to their fate until i know the bestâor the worst somewhere in the great north wilson jacobs had either by now succeeded or failed which until she knew she couldnt bring herself to leave

by this time she had arrived at the getting off place

she sprang lightly from the car and walked briskly to where a light shone for one always shone from mother janes window and it was this light which guided her now she skipped lightly along humming a little song as she did so again was she at peace with the world and forgave all who sinned against her she had no malice in her heart against anyone as she approached the houseâthe house of the waresâwhere already the smell of nourishment was in the air

oh how delightful it is to have a home a place where someone with love in their hearts awaits you and when the door is opened gathers you in welcome she thanked him that is holy for being so kind to her

she had arrived at last and with a delightful sigh raised her foot to the step and as she did so her eyes glanced through the window the next moment she fell back and placed her hand upon her breast while her heart thumped violently within

then she turned and disappeared into the night while those inside waited

whas y man

on she flew across the car tracks she stumbled but she didnt stop nor did she look to see whether anyone was coming or not she thought of nothing but to be away away away down the street that was dark and rough and led to where she did not know nor did she even care she was going away away from everybody

she would hide herself from the world she could go to another city but there was no use in that either she cried half aloud as she hurried along i can stand it no longer i can stand it no longer i want to die oh i want to die

i know she choked at last as she stumbled down the middle of a dark alley in which she now found herself i know she cried again and she hurried on as soon as she had caught her breath it is the river

yes the river she quickened her pace as she came into a street that was at the end of the alley it was wider she hastened down a hill that seemed to her a mile long and maybe it was more but when she had hurried two blocks along this she left the middle of the street and took to the sidewalk and slowed to a walk

i cant go on like this it will excite people i must walk but i must hurry hurry hurry

she had covered many blocks when she came abreast of buildings occupied by colored people there was a barber shop where men were being shaved and a restaurant where others were eating a soda fountain also and she wondered whether the people who conducted it made any money this time of the year

the night seemed to have grown much colder from the frost that was on the windows but mildred latham did not feel it her face she felt it for a moment was flushed and then it occurred to her that her throat was dry oh yes she knew why now she had cried all the way from mother janes to hereâwherever it was

and her face was hot her throat was dry and she wanted water she must have water or she could no longer swallow for a moment she hesitated before the soda fountain then she opened the door and entered a man who sat in the rear approached he was a neat man with a heavy mustache he invited her to a chair at a table that was near a glowing fire she took it

he waited her order politely

i would like someâasoda water if you please she said hesitatingly he looked at her a moment keenly winked his right eye and then his leftâthen his right eye again twice she looked at him without understanding he repeated it she wondered what he meant presently he moved behind the counter and returned with her order

while she drank it another a woman came in mildred watched him incidentally he repeated the winking process while she glanced at the other who repeated it

he went now to a room in the rear and when he returned he handed her something in a package the woman gave him a half dollar and waited for no change

youre a stranger about here miss he said observing her a bit dubiously

yes sir she replied i am a stranger about here

oh i see he said now gazing at her very keenly a few moments youre one of the solicitors for the y m c a i suppose said heafter a moments thought

no sir i am not she replied with a start and wondered why he asked her

they was aplanning t have a meeting overhead here tnight was why i asked he said

oh is that so she commented and then added  i am not connected with it in any way but i am very much interested in it

well its too bad he said thoughtfully but i dont think we will ever get such a thing in this town

its going to be a failure so i hear

indeed she echoed how so

well unless they get twentyseven thousand dollars together in a week its sure to be and f anybody cn raise that many dollars s hards times is now id lak t see them he smiled grimly

she wanted to ask him about wilson but hesitated

had he returned he was speaking again they aint had no word frum the secretary since he left he went north some time ago and it was hoped that he might succeed in raising the amount among the wealthy northern people but its dollars t doughnuts that he dont cause i figure its lak this f hed ahad any success up there some worda come back by now frum im

so no word had yet come from wilson jacobs and as she thought of his possible failure all thought of herself and what had been in her mind a moment ago left her

when she left the place she was calm but where to go now was another problem to go back to mother jane never entered her mind she wandered about for an hour she now recognized the locality she was on the same street she had found upon her arrival in the cityâbeal street she walked up this for two blocks and where many negroes were assembled several picture shows greeted her but she had no inclination for such amusement

presently she turned into another street that led down to the river it was narrow and poorly lighted and the people what few she saw were ragged and dirty and forbidding she walked some distance on this until she came across another that led in another direction into this she turned aimlessly

she had gone about threequarters of a block when her eyes in glancing up caught sight of a house dark and weather beaten with a glimmering light on the front under which was written lodging for men or women rates right she paused her hand touched her forehead it was hot and throbbing she felt tired and her eyes were heavy with sleep she hesitated turned into the gate and approached the door timidly it was a forbidding place she saw as she came nearer the door hung weakly upon its hinges while light came through the many cracks she shuddered how different it was from mother janes where everything was spick and span clean and well kept oh if she could be home now with mother jane she wrapped lightly upon the door and it seemed a long time before someone shuffled in that direction

presently after a turning of bolts or it seemed more like someone was drawing a peg out of a staple with a squeak the door opened about a foot in the dim light the face of an old woman looked out from a very wrinkled face

what d ya want she asked gruffly

i see you have a sign up here and she pointed upward that says rooms she replied timidly

yeh is yu lone whas yu man

mildred shuddered and then she recovered she was tired and wanted to sleep tomorrow she would try to do better she replied as politely as she could i am alone i have no man

hunh grunted the other opening the squeaking door wide as she said come in

mildred entered and stood looking about her while the old witch regarded her suspiciously

so youre alone uh got no man hunh thats funny she hobbled to where a lamp set with chimney smoked and upon which a crack had been patched with paper theres a chair sit down gal she shuffled about and when the light was better by turning it up a bit higher she came near where mildred sat and took a seat in an old rocker which had a sack filled with straw to make it more comfortable

how much do you charge for your rooms mildred inquired

two bits when youre alone thirtyfive cents if yu got a man mildred had surmised that would be the charge and had the amount ready she didnt care to have this witch see that she had money she handed her the quarter the old creature took it held it to the light and examined it a moment before she dropped it into an old pocket

wantta go t bed now the other inquired a little kinder than she had spoken before

i feel sleepy said mildred and looked it

all right said the other rising with much difficulty

ah gal thats rheumatiz bad when you gits lak dis life dont hold much fo you

mildred tried to look sympathetic as she followed her and murmured something inaudible

they had entered a room now that corresponded with the remainder of the house except that the ceiling seemed to be lower and the room was a bit cleaner

a small fireplace was in one side of the wall and the bed stood in an opposite corner two chairs a table a bureau a wash stand and a pitcher with a clean towel spread over it made up the meagre furnishings a rag carpet covered the floor

i dont funish fiah said the other when she saw mildreds eyes rest for a moment upon the fireplace

if there were a fire she now felt she would rest better

i should like to purchase some fuel of you to make a fire if it is possible she said

ill sell you a nickels woth

very well bring it in when the other was gone she took fifty cents in change from her purse she displayed this that the other might see and feel that she possessed little a few minutes later she was alone with a fire cracking in the grate that soon made the room quite comfortable

she retired when the room had become warm the heat in contrast with the air she had just come out of made her yawn so after barring the door securely she retired and was soon fast asleep

she might have slept for an hour or it may have been only a minute but she was slowly awakened by a stream of light that poured in through the window she sat up suddenly and blinked as the rays fell across her face and saw that she had forgotten to draw the blind and that the moonlight was streaming into her room

but it was not that alone which had awakened her

there was some commotion in the street or rather in the house next door a wagon stood at the front and into it policemen were pushing men and women the wagon was a police patrol and they were making a raid

in a few minutes it was all over and dropping back she was soon asleep again

kick higher dare gal

christmas day had come and the whole country was gay and festive in the city of our story the sun shone beautifully and from the way the birds sang it was hard to believe it was late december the streets at an early hour were filled with pedestrians seeking the open air freedom and merriment fire crackers filled the air with noise while the discharge of blank cartridges and an occasional gunshot as well as a cannon now and then added to the confusion the sharp noises made many people start suddenly and then smile when they recalled that it was xmas day the day when jesus our saviour came into the world and began a christian civilization

but there was one person who was neither gay merry nor festive although she had cherished hopes dreams and desires for that day

mildred latham lurked in the confines of the room she had taken seeing the worldâa small part of itâfrom the window of the room she had taken a night or two before she had remained in it ever since venturing out only to get something to eat and drink she was almost oblivious to the fact that it was xmas day until the discharge of firearms and crackers came to her ears from the street and then she awakened to the reality of what she would lose that day

a chinaman ran the restaurant where she bought her meals at one of their stores she had purchased a few dishes and a knife spoon and a fork so she brought the meals to her room and ate the same at the table she had no plans now for xmas day she tried to forget it but the noise from the street did not permit her to do so as the sun rose higher the revelry became more pronounced she tried to forget the day mother jane and she had planned to spend together she tried to shut out of her mind the day she might have spent with the jacobs and she tried likewise not to see the dreary day she must now perforce spendâalone

the sun rose higher and higher and the day became warmer so warm about noon that she raised her window and permitted the soft breeze to float in upon her filling her lungs with it and sighing contentedly

she watched the few people that passed that way and noted that they all appeared so happy they were all apparently carefree and desirous of getting all the enjoyment that the day afforded presently it occurred to her to venture forth and get something it was bad enough that she must spend it alone but to hover in the four walls of that little room was a fact she could no longer submit to

she passed into the room that may have been called a sitting room and where the old woman was stewing some meat on the rusty stove before the other turned at the sound of her footfall she scrutinized her for a moment meditatively she wondered who this old woman was who lived thus alone she fancied what her life must be she had other roomers she had observed but they came in late and left early so she had no idea who they were or what kind of people stayed there

she hesitated for a second and then the other turned and faced her

uh gal she creaked in her shaky old voice be goin out t see a lit xmas ha ha sho you might

cain stay shut up in that room all time and she grinned which made her features repulsive to mildred

yes maam i thought i would step out and look around a while she answered kindly i shall be back presently

as she went toward the gate the hag looked after her and shook her head as she muttered that gals a puzzle a devilish puzzle i cain make her out but of one thing im certain shes straight huh yes shes straight and she continued shaking her head

and it was that fact that made her a mystery to this old woman

she walked along slowly when she got into the street looking from one side to the other at the end of the street in the direction she had taken was the warehouse district in the old days this had been a prominent shipping point by water but now this had been largely substituted by railroads the yards were quiet today as she made her way along while scarcely a wagon was in evidence around the many large buildings

she walked in the same direction until she came to a street that led down to the river she turned into this and followed it until she stood on the banks of the stream that flowed gently southward it was filled with a number of boats while ferries plied back and forth to the other side for a half hour she stood thus with her mind free of all care and enjoyed the stiff air that came with the breeze from the river when she presently turned to go she felt strangely invigorated and decided to walk about more

without regard to direction she finally found herself on beal street which she recognized at once she paused briefly before venturing into it but the street was filled with music while across the way several electric shows invited the crowds that poured in and out so she went forward timidly she stopped at length before a black boy who was turning a street piano the music was exhilerating and she gave him a nickel when he was starting away whereupon he dropped the handles and played her three of the popular airs she gave him another nickel and he took delight in turning on three more by this time a crowd had gathered and thinking quickly she slipped away and continued her way

she stood before a large picture show for colored people a few minutes later at the front were gorgeous pictures advertising the show within she hesitated briefly and then fishing a five cent piece from her purse she entered the show and took a seat to one side in a minute her attention was centered on the screen where a western play in which red indians and cowboys were in a mimic battle was being shown the play aroused much interest in the audience which fairly raised from the seats at times especially when there was a gun play and since gun playing seemed to be in evidence much excitement was attendant during the whole time the reel was being run

she recalled suddenly what she had read in the book of sidney wyeth with regard to indians he had dwelt at some length upon this subject and had concluded a chapter with words to the effect that the indian as he was today and had been for years was in no wise what he was pictured upon the screen or in novels but a shiftless being without spirit in truth only an example of dull inertia

the next reel was much more original she thought and therefore more interestingâto her but it wasnt to many of those about her who as she heard them made little effort to catch the moral of it

it was a play of present day life in which the hero was a man employed as floor walker in a large department store while the heroine was a girl employed in the most insignificant position in the basement of the same

she studied the play and was carried away with the great human interest conveyed in the plot it was a difficult task to keep her mind and thoughts upon it however because all about her many remarks came from impatient creatures who continually muttered aloud demanding that it be hurried off and something with ginger put on

huy huy n git hit off git a gal out the n some song n dancin said one who sat next to her and who she observed was ragged and dirty in the bargain his long kinky hair stood erect on his head and made him resemble something recently departed from the jungle

when the vaudeville in connection therewith was put on she was filled with disgust it was not refined vaudeville and in no way corresponded with the pictures that had preceeded it but of the most vulgar sort it brought shrill cries from the throats of those about her and remarks that showed the character of the crowd

put the sof pedal on it kid keha

dat gal sho kin sing nigga believe muh

kick higher dare gal you ain done nothin

growled one who was not satisfied

mildred arose to go out to get to the aisle she must pass about ten people mostly men in rough clothing

set down gal don git in fronta me one next to her complained

don spile my gaze when dat gals showing up lak she is said another with a sigh and a disgusted feeling she sank back and made herself patient until the disgusting performance was at an end she had no trouble then for all those between her and the aisle filed out ahead of her apparently they came to the show for the purpose of witnessing the vaudeville only

when she was on the street again the sun was getting toward the west but she did not feel like going back to the hovel she called a room yet the noise and music seemed to make her forget her troubles and worries and mingling with the masses that now filled the sidewalks she followed them aimlessly along the street she stopped before other shows and when at last finding one that appeared to have no vaudeville in connection with the pictures and which did not appear to have such a big crowd about the entrance she entered and took a seat toward the rear

she had been seated about half an hour when she chanced upon looking back to see someone whose face was familiar she looked toward the front and then after a few minutes in which she tried to recall where it was she had seen it before she turned her head slowly and looked again behind her and just seating themselves were not only three women belonging to wilson jacobs church and with whom she was well acquainted âthey had been her best friends and had admired her playing and singingâbut in their midst sat constance herself

my wifeâsickâhell

it was the day before new years and the city was in the grip of a severe blizzard that has swept down from the northwest and had driven the people from the streets and into their homes where they stayed closely shut in

from her little room mildred latham peeped out through the small window and was glad it was an ugly day without for being so she did not feel as lonesome and so desirous of going forth as she had the few days previous or since xmas day

she would never forget the moments she went through wondering how she would extricate herself when her friends entered the show and seated themselves behind her

she had sat with her heart beating a tattoo against her ribs and hardly dared to breathe the play was a deep one that flashed upon the screen but her attention had wandered she was trying with all her senses to think of some way out and the way would have to come quickly for if not at the best it would be only a question of minutes possibly seconds before one of the trio saw and recognized her she was almost choking when there was a noise in the rear all eyes turned quickly and then there was a snapping of films or something but whatever it was the place was dark in a moment

now was her chance she thought as the theater was suddenly plunged into darkness she arose could she make it in a flash the lights might be on great god she trembled suppose they should be turned on and with this fear gripping her heart until the perspiration started she struggled toward the door

she stepped on many toes while growls and complaints came from the lips of the owners but she felt her way resolutely forward and toward the aisle it seemed like an age before her feet found it through the place now matches were flashing she glanced for a brief second in the direction of those from whom she was fleeing and as she did so someone struck a match in that moment the faces of the four came full into view oh my god

she cried inaudibly they are looking straight at me

but before the flare had died she breathed a sigh of relief for at that moment the lights came on and they were looking toward the screen

she passed quietly out and when once outside hurried in the direction of her room

they had not seen her

the day was fading into twilight the sun had set and with it the wind had fallen the air had become still and the stars shone brightly from above

if i dont get out of this place for an hour i will surely die cried mildred walking the floor in a fit of impatience having become accustomed to plenty of exercise the days that had come and gone since xmas day had seemed like an eternity perhaps it was hard for her because she had not been further than the restaurant since that day she admitted to herself that she was afraid to go anywhere now she had not the courage to run the risk of being seen again and had therefore remained confined to her room

she paused before the window and looked long and earnestly into the street never before had anything seemed so inviting she was simply mad to be in it if for only a half hour but to be in it she felt she must

after a time she resolved to run the risk she fixed herself as best she could and shuddered when she realized that she had not changed her clothes for a week at last with a suppression of her excited nerves she slipped out of the house and entered the street just as darkness had set in and the stars were the brightest

she hurried along and when she had arrived at the end of the street she turned into another and in a direction she had not been before along this she hurried feeling the sting of the air which brought the blood to her cheeks and made her feel real life after many days of fear and worry she had been downtown one day before xmas where she dispatched a telegram and now as she hurried along it occurred to her to go to the office again she walked boldly in that direction and a moment after she had entered she came out with a satisfied smile playing about the corners of her mouth

now she whispered softly where shall i go

without answering her own question she began walking

she walked until she had exercised her limbs and they were tired so she felt like sitting down and resting

still she continued the way she was going until in turning a corner she ran fully into someone and fell back with i beg your pardon and then suddenly the other fell back

why miss latham the other exclaimed amazed

miss jones i declare echoed the other and stood abashed

i have not seen or heard of you for months indeed i thought you left town long since

noo mildred mumbled frightened and embarrased all in one

andâwhatâwhat are you doingâin this part of town the other exclaimed now regarding her suspiciously

this part of town she echoed bewilderingly

iâiâdont understand why this part of town

yes this part of town she paused a moment and surveyed mildred in wonder and then went on why didnt you know this part of townâis the restricted district 

ohâmiss jones she wailed heaven help me

i didnt know

the other looked at her keenly and a little dubious and then she said with a toss of her head as something seemed to have occurred to her when the other looked at her strangely i guess you wonder what i am doing down here too

the other started and her lips opened to say she had not but before she could say anything the other continued  well i dont mind admitting what i am doing down here since i see you here also but i have been coming down here for a long time yes you see this is not the first time i have been down here before and she laughed a hard laugh as she ended with another toss of her head

mildred stood frozen she could not collect her shattered wits to say anything but she was thinking

miss jones was a member of wilson jacobs church and sang in the choir it cant be possible she murmured inaudibly it cant be possible and then all of a sudden she felt sorry for miss jones because she had liked her and thought her very sweet and now she met her face to face in the ivorst part of the city

how could this be explained miss jones being encountered in the worst part of the city    and miss jones had with her own lips admitted that she had been there before she had been coming there for a long time oh god mildred cried almost aoud this is terrible why did miss jones come to this part of town    miss jones came to this part of town and knew she was doing so   then if that were trueâwhich it surely wasâmiss jones was a bad girl    miss jones a bad girl she could not believe it and yet before she could get all this through her whirling brain she heard miss jones speaking again what was she saying

it couldnt be true surely miss jones could not mean what she was saying oh horrors if miss jones meant what she was saying then miss jones regarded her as a bad girl too miss jones miss jones something in her now was crying although her lips moved not

please dont please dont i am not that way

i am not a bad girl oh no please please and still her lips had not moved she stood like a dumb person but she heard miss jones clearly lets go over here to a place i know she said its safeânobody but a swell bunch goes there no tramps or talkers

she felt all she had heard a moment before now running through her mind and yet she did not speak miss jones was speaking again we are both in the same boat ones as bad as the other no questions asked 

oh miss jones mildred heard again but her lips still were not moved how can you oh how can you

why didnt she do something she heard herself but words were not spoken why do you stand mildred latham why do you not goâhurry you have stood too long now hurry hurry to mother janesâto jacobs yes to anywhere but go go go and still she stood in flesh and made no reply

a swell bunch from the north railroad fellows with plenty of coin some good time kid come on at once

lets dont stand here and be looked at

she was in a trance now she couldnt stand there she was aware of that that would be worse how to get out she did not know for she had now forgotten how she came in but she had no notion of following miss jones no she would go to mother janesâno she would go to jacobs jacobs who were they oh yes she remembered now and when she knew the jacobs she had known them for the truth if she went to them and told them she had just came from theoh no no no she couldnt go to jacobs    but now she had it she would go to sidney wyeth  yes that was where she would go he would welcome her

he would be good to her while sheâsheâwould tell him everythingâyes everything oh she was glad she had thought of him in time because if she had waited a little longer she might not be fit to go to him

they were going now miss jones and she miss jones was going where she didnt know but she mildred latham was going to her lover sidney wyeth

oh how she loved himâshe had always loved him but now she loved him more than ever and she was going to him and when she arrived the first thing she would do would be to get on her knees as she did when a little girl at her prayers she would tell him all all the truth from the time she was old enough to remember until today yes she would tell him all she would show him how faithfully she had worked in the sale of his book and she would tell him how she had been driven from place to place until she had no home nor friends but withal she had remained clean clean

yes that was why she had struggled so she had fought everything to keep clean    and he oh heâwould be happy oh he would be so happy and then they would bothâyes both go to the rosebud country together wouldnt that be delightful they would go to the rosebud country together and live happily

here we are she heard miss jones saying she rapped on the door in a peculiar fashion presently the door opened but no one stood beside it or behind it

it had opened from the top of a stair which they mounted the moment they entered this led to somewhere but she followed

now they were at the top and paused for a brief moment then turning to the right they crossed a hallway and entered a room the door closed behind them and it was some time before her eyes became accustomed to the darkness within why was the room dark she wondered but just then it became a blaze of light she looked all around her bewilderingly it was a beautifully furnished room with a soft heavy carpet while about the room were many heavy chairs

in the center was a table and around the side were smaller tables what was this place she asked herself feeling the back of one of the heavy chairs to one side of the room was a huge buffet with a number of glasses all thin and of many varying sizes artistically arranged

on the other end was a piano with an electric cord reaching it from above and as she stood looking at it a light within it flashed and it began to play a song that made the room resound

hark what was that she cried with her lips closed she saw the eyes of her companion as her ears listened to the music a smile a wild smile danced in the eyes of miss jones she caught mildred suddenly about the waist and before she was aware of it was whirling her about in a waltz and the tuneâwas the blue danube

in the midst of the sweet old tune the door they had entered a moment ago swung open and two men entered

they were striking looking men and were dressed in the latest style of clothes they were both smoking cigars and the room was soon filled with the aroma but they must have been good cigars because the odor they gave off was pleasantâso mildred thought

miss jones dropped her at once and flew to one of them who gathered her in his arms and dreadful before the others he kissed her as mildred swallowed she turned and nestled in his embrace and with his hands he pulled her head back until her round throat stood out beautifully and kissed her again and again

mildred was shocked at such immodesty but before she got over it the other stood over her smiling down into her face with eyes that danced like fire she fell away from beneath his amorous gaze and ran across the room and got behind a chair she turned and looked at him wildly now he hurried after her his lips were pursed to say something funny and then he saw her eyes he stopped suddenly and fell back a step while his smile died and his gaze as he saw her now grew pointed

thunder he muttered slowly the others disembraced themselves and regarded them for a moment

they looked from one to the other and then three pairs of eyes rested upon her alone at first they were dubious and then as they saw the frightened look they changed to something akin to contempt

aw kid cried miss jonesâand mildred had never imagined she could be so coarse cut it hes a good guy he is a thoroughbred she looked at the man now who appeared a trifle angry youre spoiling it all hed like you but he dont want too much of the kid play

these good lookers are always hard t land said the man but this trick appears the hardest then to her he said come on kid look over my hurry of a moment ago that face of yours i must say got me daffy  and he laughed with a toss of the head

her tension relaxed and she permitted herself to come from behind the chair a moment later they were seated around the large table in the center of the room a waiter now stood over them with eyes askance

little sunny brook ll do me said one of the men

the other nodded the same his eyes rested upon miss jones who tossed her head gayly and said aw dickie and joe i dont like it straight make mine a dry martini

he attended mildred now while the othete conversed

she did not know what to say she had not thought of anything to drink but in that moment she knew she would have to order something

a coca cola she said quietly

three pair of eyes regarded her then with surprise evident as it became clear to them all threw their heads back and laughed loudly the waiter stood with a little smile about the corners of his mouth which showed he possessed a sense of humor

mildred was silent and looked at them in surprise

presently when they had quieted miss jones said a little impatiently youre a good one kid i must say so coca cola

ha ha but they dont carry coca cola at this joint

whereupon they laughed again

yes maam now spoke the waiter we carry coca cola but its used as a wash they laughed long and earnestly

bring us a quart of sunny brook said the man who was nearest her andâyes bring this little girl here a coca colaâfor a wash

he lit a fresh cigar and smiled

play cards kid he inquired and looked at her

why dont you say something sweetness gee has the cat got your tongue he complained a trifle nervously as he flicked the ashes from the cigar

the waiter had returned now with many glasses and bottles and their drinks were before them before her was placed a small bottle of the drink she had ordered while two glasses were arranged beside it while a larger glass filled with ice stood beside them the others had before them likewise all except miss jones whose drink was in a peculiar glass with a long stem and flashed green in the electric light

the others poured their glasses about half full while mildred poured a part of the fluid in one of the glasses before her it foamed she stopped and when it quit foaming the glass was only about a third full she had not observed how much it lacked of being full when suddenly the room resounded with the music of the electric piano it took her so much by surprise that she turned quickly and looked when she saw that it was only the piano she turned to them again as they raised their glasses she took up hers at a sign from them

it was full they all drank together

she had a mighty effort to swallow hers when she had succeeded she made a wry face and tasted the stuff gingerly she had never drunk coca cola that tasted like that before the others smiled naively she felt strange she raised her hands to her head it felt stranger still she wondered at such a strange feeling after a drink of something she was fond of she had drunk as many as a half dozen bottles a day and as many as three bottles in an hour but three bottles had never any effect while now her head was whirling terribly everything about her swam she saw the others smiling and then she heard herself talking and laughing but she was not aware of what she was saying

it was perhaps an hour later or it might have been only a half but she was on the street she was trying to walk but apparently she was not succeeding for the man she had run from was supporting her he had his arm about her waist while his free hand held both of hers she was not talking now she was resting her neck was limp presently they turned into another place she did not know where before them raised another flight of stairs and up this they walkedâthat is he did and almost carried her a full minute it took before they reached the top an old woman met them

mildred saw her for a brief moment and recalled that she resembled the one where she had a room

my wife is sick she heard the man say is sick

i wish to get a room

his wife she repeated but that was all darkness was all about her now but the man repeated his words and at the same time handed the old woman a half dollar a moment later a door closed behind them and the next a key turned

but mildred latham didnt hear it

the old woman looked after them a moment as she rubbed the new coin in her palm she raised it to her lips and kissed it with a smack she regarded the door of the room in which they had disappeared and then she burst into a fit of laughing

my wifeâsickâhell and went about her duties

midnight december thirtyfirst wilson jacobs sat in his study gazing across the room at a clock it ticktocked as it always had the minute hand slipped from notch to notch there was nothing whatever wrong with it it was a good clock

as he gazed at it he recalled that in the years it had stuck to the wall there it had never stopped it had never varied from standard city time more than a minute or two during those years and yet he watched the clock as though it were something strange something uncanny something that spelled his end

for it was and it marked the failure of his great effort

in a few hours now that clock would show another year for it was the night of december thirtyfirst

in a few hours it would tell him as it had told him before that a new year had come yes but this year it would tell him more how much more it was hard to estimate he made no effort to do so he had already done that in the past few daysâthe days he would always remember as the darkest in his life of hope

a noise in the other room came to his ears it was a sigh it was constance and he was sorry for her yes constance had hoped until the last minute that he would succeed but he had failed   

vainly he struggled in the great northeast to secure those thousands to complete the amount necessary he had gone from town to town the people were kind they were considerate and they listened patiently while he waxed eloquent and forceful in his appeal for this great purpose he met the nicest people he had ever metâhe knew that so refined and how much they appreciated his great cause was shown in every town large or small they took him through many of the buildings they were perfect pictures and the management was the best the per cent of people who could not read or write in those parts did not include any of the native born he had never he recalled this now strangely met people who were so courteous he had been so long in dixie and therefore accustomed to the country there that he found it hard to believe that white people could be so courteous to a negro true but they held to their money they shook their heads and pointed across the waterâand he knew

he had raised less than three thousand dollars he lacked almost twentyfive thousand of having the proper amount when he returned home

his sister met him with a kiss she looked hopefully into his eyes at the same moment and knew he had failed so they had said nothing about it others came in as soon as they learned he had returned and it was with a heavy heart that he told them the result

well said the professor of the colored high school you made a brave fight reverend yes you made a brave fight more than ten thousand dollars in such a short time is going some you beat grantville by twice the amount and did it in onethird the time

by the way doctor said a mail clerk as he was passing out he stopped and lighting a cigar continued what ever became of that young lady who played at the church and who started the cash subscription

yes said the professor i have intended to ask you myself

my friends said wilson it is the strangest thing i ever knew but we have not seen that young lady since the day you were hereâin fact we have not seen her since she left the church that sunday

indeed both exclaimed that is strange

the strangest thing i should say he declared

they spoke of it at some length and then they took their leave others had come and made it harder for him to tell words of consolation were given by all which made it still harder

he arose after a time and walked back and forth across the room he thought of the y m c a in a northern city for colored men and where he had stopped such a delightful place it had been there was a pool hall a cafe a barber shop a complete gymnasium a swimming pool a reading room with piles of the latest magazines in fact there was everything to keep young men out of bad company and at the same time provided for them a place for clean manly sport he had stopped there three days and during that time he had observed the great good it was doing the young negro men of that city the negro population was not onefourth that of this town and still the schools there were the best while almost everything in the way of public conveniences was open to the black people if the y m c

a could be of such great good in a community of that sort words figures estimates all were inadequate to describe what a great benefit it would be to this town

and until the last day he did not despair he hoped and he worked the administration has balled the financial situation up so badly that it is useless to seek subscriptions for anything one had told him

a million and more dollars he has given away said the secretary of a millionaire he had consulted yes i will arrange an appointment but from the way he said it he was sure it would do no good

crime and evil environments have undermined the foundations of our society those people for whom a million men went to battle fifty years ago and freed have reached a place in our american society where it is the greatest mistake of a decade that they are not provided with better surroundings he said this time and again and the people heard him through but in the end it was the same

by some he was greatly encouraged if the gift of the jew could be extended a year all would be well he was sure but that had been settled

i am asking you for assistance because we have at our disposal threefourths of the amount necessary but without your assistance in this this threefourths reverts back to those who have offered it

the country is in a bad shape and they pointed again across the water

and now he had returned and had to admit to himself and the others that he had failed he forgot his own desire he wanted the association for the great good it would do his people

he seated himself and mechanically his eyes sought the clock again it ticktocked the minutes away and the minutes became hours and every hour drew him near the end if he could present twentyfive thousand dollars to the y m c a by twelve oclock that night it would be saved

suddenly it occurred to him to go into the street and walk about for a time maybe he could forget it he picked up his hat that he had thrown on the floor in his absentmindedness and drawing on his overcoat made his way thither it was a crisp night and the chill as he struck the street made him quicken his steps and he walked briskly in the direction of the river

he observed with a start presently that he was going in the same direction and the same street he had taken before going north the incident and the words he had overheard came back to him and he thought of mildred with a pang of the heart i wish i could see her now

he said and then in the next breath he said no i would have to tell her that i had failed after her kind words she said i would succeed yes she said thatâ and meant it he walked on and finally fell to talking to himself aloud

yes wilson jacobs with all you have been through you have come to this in the end youve failed and then something somewhere in his mind said yes you have failed but dont despair all may not be lost

as long as there is life there is hope he laughed at this and wondered then at the strange caprice of the human brain wonderful he commented i wonder how did man ever come to be in the years when he was wild that was different but now he is becoming so wise that almost miracles are accomplished he continues to grow wiser as the years go by until i wonder what it will all come to in the end

by now he had reached the place where he overheard the voices of a few weeks before it was dark not a soul nor a sound came from within he stood where he had heard the voices but no voices came to him that night he presently retraced his footsteps he could at least be home and comfort his sister she could not be allowed to be alone while the old year died and the new sprang into being he dragged himself along in an aimless fashion not hurrying as he figured in his mind he had yet two hours

when he arrived at the house and entered he resumed his seat in the study and since there was nothing else to do he resumed his task of watching the clock not as much time was left as he thought for it was now almost eleven in one hour and a few minutes it was goodby to seventyfive thousand dollars for the purpose of building and establishing a y m c a for the black youth of the city

he heard constance in the other room breathing heavily and wondered whether she was sick he watched the clock now as a man who waits for the death knell

time seemed to go slowly he thought he would call his sister when the clock reached a quarter of yes and together they would watch watch watch he dozed off to sleep suddenly he awoke with a start

he had slept the old year out was his first thought

then he looked at the clock no not quite he rubbed his eyes

and then he listened had he heard someone or something of course not he muttered half aloud

this game is telling on me and he raised his hand and grasped his head and still he felt something had happened he arose and walked back and forth across the room and then sat down again as he did so his eyes saw the clock

it was now eleven thirtyfive

into the infinite long ago that is the ponca dear said sidney taking her hand as they walked up the road

but you did not call it that in your story sidney

said mildred squeezing his hand fondly i have never been on its banks when are you going to take me there she now said poutingly

he placed his free hand under her chin and dared her to look into his face with such a frown she failed and laughed instead

but i want to go she cried swinging the hand she held back and forth wont you take me soonâtake me today she begged

he drew her to him placed his arms about her and kissed her fondly

a moment later they walked down the wide road

and this is the rosebud country she said allowing her eyes to stretch over a land to which she saw no end

yes this is the rosebud country he said contentedly

she regarded him a moment closely before she spoke

in that look she appeared to see him as she had never seen him before this man was her husband and he had spent the prime years of his life in this land to the northwest he loved it and now she would love it because he did in the years gone by he had hopedâhe had built his hopes here and into that life had come another after that things had been different yes things had been different and that was why she was here but she was happy yes she was happy he was too so that made her more happy

see those rocks on yonder hill she heard him say and she allowed her eyes to follow the direction of his finger

yes and oh sidney i gaze each day at them and at the smaller one just this side of it tell me of them and of the little one too

and as they strolled together down this prairie road to the valley of the ponca sidney wyeth her husband told her the story of the two hills

many i know not how many years ago yon hill was the scene of many a crime so the squaws told me

and he sighed as he seemed to look back over the time

she placed her hand now in the curve of his arm and held it closely it seemed to satisfy him and with a glance at her and a far away look in his eyes he proceeded to tell the legend of the hills

it was before the days of the mighty sitting bull and red cloud too before the days of the cowboyâand even the squaw man it was in the days of chief stinking eye who was the bravestâso the indians sayâof all the great sioux warriors stinking eye and chief bettleyon loved one and the same maidenâthe daughter of chief gocatchtheenemy

gocatchtheenemy was a great chief and owned all the land in what is called the bull creek district now while bettleyon lived with the tribe of his father in a part of this country far to the west in that part which is now called the cottonwood creek district

this vast tribe of red men lived by hunting principally but their women discovered that crops could be grown in this soil and with rude plows and hoes and whatever they had they dug little patches in the soil along the creek and in springtime they planted these patches in maize and beans so when the zero weather of winter made the wigwams the most comfortable place they kept from starving by feeding thereon of course that was in the day when the buffalo was plentiful and they had meat but with cornmeal this was made more delicious so in this way the sioux indians came through many cold winters and went to war again in the early springtime that is the men did while the women repeated the task each year of planting the patches to squaw corn or maize

how they fought and bled and died is a matter not trivial about this time there came a man he rode a pony and he had on bootsânot moccasinsâand he wore a hat on his head he carried a rifle in his hand and that was the first time these red men had seen such a weapon strange as it was to them he talked fluently in their tongue and withal his cleverness he became a favorite among the many before long he was in reality chief over all from the niobrara across the keya paha including the ponca the mastadon on to the whetstone and landing creek and to the white river he ruled they named him raininthefaee and he made them all believe that he was next to the great white father

there came a day when he made love to gocatch theenemys daughter winnetkha which was her name and she was said to have been the most beautiful daughter of the sioux indians the rosebud had ever known

this as you might expect made enemies of young chief bettleyon and also chief stinking eye but the white man was shrewd he thought at night when all was quiet and the indians slept so the mornings were used in carrying out the thoughts of the night before while the indians had to think of war

so before any knew the white man had made winnetkha his own and took her to live in a real house that he had made the indians build for him of straight ash logs with bark peeled off and hewn on the inside until the white wood glistened like silver

that was the beginning of the breeds and after that many became crossed and have not stopped until recently but bettleyon and stinking eye never got over it and when the pale face was spending his time herding the cattle that were now replacing the buffalo they intrigued cruelly against him

winnetkha overheard their plan and informed him when he came from the herd that night and so he kept watch they came late with a band of picked men and loyal followers and began at once to make war on the big house all night they fought but the indians were shrewd this time and fought from long range they shot at the house with arrows that were heated red hot on the point until at last they set it on fire this of course drove the white man and his squaw out they managed to escape and reached safety ere they were discovered but the white man was angry and he swore to have revenge so loading his rifle he saddled his horse and came down singlehanded on the indians and killed many and routed the rest

he was not bothered any more for years afterward but the indian you know never forgets so one day when he was grazing his herds near the top of the hill he looked up to find himself almost hemmed in by the skulking red devils he rushed to safety behind the rocks at the top where you see them here he fought until his ammunition was exhausted and he was without defense with the indians all about him

and it was then that he looked about for other weapons of defense and discovered a den of rattlers

then one at a time he allowed the indians to approach him and as they did and went to look for him they were struck in the face by a rattler more than twenty were bitten so tis said and more than half died from the effects and then they killed him

 old gocatchtheenemy made war on them afterward and a reign of outlawry began but to the white man his soninlaw he gave a great funeral and did not bury him on a tree top where buzzards picked the bones as had been the custom but the indians preferred such a burial rather than that a coyote should dig them up from the earth he was buried on the top of the little hill to the side as you see with stones arranged about him and so deep in the earth that the wolves never bothered

so that is the legend of those hills that you see and they are the land mark those who live here will not soon forget it

they stood on the banks of the ponca now and listened to the happy birds that filled the air with music like thousands of little bells as they stood arm in arm they appreciated all that life held in store for them

suddenly from the west came a great noise hark

cried the husband a prairie fire of course not

the settlers made that impossible long since he looked anxiously in the direction from whence came the noise the sun could not be seen and everything at once grew dark a tornado cried sidney and grabbing his wife he started to fall to the ground but too late a sudden wind seemed to pick him up and a moment later whirled him into the air while mildred cried out in agonizing tones sidney sidney come back come back dont leave me but on he flew with the wind raising him higher and higher into the air while she moaned until she felt her heart would break everything was so dark about her that she could not see and then suddenly it began to clear darkness was not about her for overhead burned an electric light she lay across a bed she stood up and looked about her

her brain throbbed terribly while she tried to recall where she was and then slowly it all came back to her

miss jonesâthe visit to the blind tigerâa bottle of coca colaâoh my god she cried in piteous tones

im lost im lost im lost

she rushed to the door it was bolted she paused a moment as she stood by it where had he gone she had a watch on her wrist she looked at it she had not been there long she recalled looking at it just before drinking the stuff in the glass that was exactly an hour before it was fully a half hour later when she had been brought to this place but where was the man

she looked across the room to a chair over the back of it lay the overcoat he had worn then it became clear to her he had stepped out a moment to get something perhaps she walked to the door quickly and tried the knob it was locked and the key was gone she became frantic as she ran around the room she tried the window again useless besides when she peeped under the shade it was too far to the ground she stood dumbly for a moment presently mechanically she walked to a dresser that stood to one side and peered in the glass at herself she recoiled when she saw her face it was swollen and her eyes looked strange she could not believe herself she looked again yes

s she whispered this is  she looked away the top of the dresser was covered with a newspaper mechanically she found herself looking over it it was not a city paper she could see so somewhat curiously she turned it over and saw the front page her eyes chanced to fall on an article two columns in width she read a few lines and then with a muffled cry she staggered backward clutching the paper she sought the chair or the bedâanything she was too weak to stand now but ere she had reached either she suddenly stood stiffly erect while the blood seemed to freeze in her veins

a step sounded in the hallway and a moment later a key rattled in the lock the man was returning

go brother in gods name go

i am truly sorry to see the colored people of this town fail in their effort to secure a y m c a for their youth said the secretary of the white y m c a as he rested his elbows for a moment upon the cigar case

and they wont get it after all said a young man whose father had given five hundred dollars to the cause

they certainly need something of the kind the crime and condition of the colored people of the southern states give this section a bad name in the eyes of the enlightened world he commented lighting a cigarette and sprawling his legs in front of him when he had taken a seat

i regret it more because that fellow wilson jacobs the secretary has been a faithful worker if there ever was one the secretary said thoughtfully

how did they happen to fall down on it i understand that the white association has subscribed twentyfive thousand dollars inquired another

so did a chicago jew and likewise seventeen thousand dollars were subscribed from the city and other places by the white people but only ten thousand dollars could be raised among the colored peopleâor rather only about five thousand he secured about the same amount from the white people here and in the north

i met that fellow down here one day and say

exclaimed another he impressed me as much as any person i ever met i want to tell you

how did they ever come out with the effort over at grantville inquired another

they failed said the secretary and then added the gift from the jew philanthropist has run for five years and expires tonight at twelve oclock so saying all eyes sought the clock that hung on the wall above them

they have only a few minutes left according to that

smiled one

say wouldnt it be a sensation if that fellow came tearing in here at one minute to twelve said one and laughed the others joined in but the secretary did not share in the joke notwithstanding that it was not meant to be depreciating

if he should said the secretary walking from behind the case i am authorized to acknowledge the same and the colored people would get their association

but of course i do not anticipate such miracles tonight

a moment later they all filed to another part of the building where hundreds were gathered to watch the old year out and the new in and where music soon made them forget the subject they had been discussing

twenty minutes of the year was left in five minutes wilson jacobs would call his sister and together they would watch but the new year would bring no joy to their hearts it meant that a great struggle would end in failure he watched the clock by the minute it was now eleven fortyone nineteen minutes left

presently he heard a light footfall he looked up and saw his sister coming toward him she looked tired and worn the strain she had been laboring under was plainly evident in her face

she came straight to him what was it that made her regard him as she did had she seen in these last minutes how much it hurt him to have to pronounce his great effort a failure she advanced to where he sat and impulsively bent over and kissed him as she raised up both pairs of eyes saw the clock and both pair of lips murmured eighteen minutes left and then his lips said yes sister eighteen minutes left to raise twentyfive thousand dollars for the y m c a for our people

he lowered his head and sighed long and deeply she placed her hands about his forehead and let them slip ack over his hair

my poor brother my poor brother and then for the first time she observed a package with womanly curiosity she inquired what is this wilson and pointed toward it he sat up quickly as though he had been asleep

that he replied blinking why i dont know

i declare i didnt know it was there he was thoroughly awake now as well as curious

wonder what it is she said curiously

i dont know he breathed turning the package over

and you are sure you didnt put it there

oh no but i am curious to know what it contains

and she turned it over while her face lit with a little smile that was carefree he saw it and said why dear if it will please you open it as the last thing in the old year

oh brother that is so nice of you and she took the knife he handed her opened it and quickly cut the strings a package was enclosed tied with paper she pursued the task of cutting strings and then as she unwrapped the paper from about it she mused oh i wonder what it can be it was open now and two pairs of eyes opened their widest while her voice cried wilson wilson my god its money its money to save the y mc a for our people both now regarded the clock fifteen minutes was left to reach the y m

c a building thirteen blocks away it was she who spoke go brother in gods name go

had it been any other night but the night of december thirtyfirst a man who tore wildly down the middle of the street bareheaded and with a woman with hair flowing loosely behind her the officers on duty would surely have made an arrest but as it was they only smiled amusedly as they remarked a new freak of meeting the new year how little did any feel or know that upon that wild run depended one hundred thousand dollars for the salvation of thousands of black youth until the end of time   

the papers carried the account in large headlines the following morning

reverend wilson jacobs springs a coup energetic worker and secretary of the y m c a for the colored people raised twentyfive thousand dollars and completed the condition of the association at two minutes of twelve oclock last night two minutes later more than seventyfive thousand dollars would have been unavailable for the purpose

in a column and a half the people of the city and elsewhere read the account of the wonderful victory that meant so much for the colored people of the city of which the population was twofifths it was likewise a victory for the white people all of whom could appreciate the fact in securing the same the city with the unenviable reputation of being one of the most criminal cities in the world now took first place in the line for uplift among the colored people as it would be the only city in the south to have a y m c a for its black population

the fact made thousands of black people buy the blind tigers and drugstores out of whiskey on new years day it was their greatest day since freedom

in grantville everybody wondered how they had done it and in effingham and attalia and then the people of the fortunate city wondered too after their excitement had cooled and they could think wilson jacobs wondered likewise and so did constance everybody wondered

but they never knew

end of book three do you read d papers

a cose i does wha kinda sinuations yre tryin t pass on me nigga said one whose feelings were at that moment very much injured

the heavy train pulled cumbersomely to the summit and stopped a moment while the switch engine attached to the rear was uncoupled a moment later it continued on its way

miles to the rear and below effingham it struggled for one brief moment and then as a curve in the mountain was being made it finally disappeared from view

sidney wyeth settled back in his seat in the front end of the jim crow car and with his feet spread over the seat ahead prepared himself languidly to enjoy the four hundred odd miles that were before him

only half a car possibly not that much was given over to the use of the colored passengers it was as comfortable as the other part of the train however so no discrimination was evident the portion given to them was of course next to the baggage car while far to the rear as he observed when the train rounded a curve fully eight or ten cars were more or less filled with white passengers about half the number were pullmans

den f y read d papers yu autta know bout dis scrimination dat is agoin on up dere in washington

he overheard between three or four negroes a few seats to the rear

ah reads th papers eve day but i on know wha you s adrivin at contended another

the first speaker confident at first that he was going to show the other up as not knowing as much as he looked a trifle disappointed but he didnt grant the other the benefit of the doubt

the second speaker went on yeh i don read all bout dat yu see he explained very ostentatiously dare was n editor a smat nigga frum boston who had done been t school n graduated frum college and knowed ebreting n e as a bill down dare t washington n eve body says t im why on you take dat bill up n make d president sign it so dis nigga e finally git mad n takes it roun to de presidents office n shows it toim n tole him sign it now dy president he look at it and read it over a little then e jumped up outer is chaeh n says i won sign tha bill n dey says e got awful mad n stomed aroun fo n houh

but said another who up to this time had taken no part in the harrangue the president ah taut ain axed t sign a bill ontell it had been acted on by congress

the others looked at each other now in some surprise

then they observed the speaker in a manner that was serene with contempt for his apparent ignorance  then the second speaker said aw dis bill y see us a secret dey want but three people knowed bout it n dey was du editor and du presidentânâ he was thoughtful now as he meditated for a moment and then said roosevelt

by this time the train had gotten under way and it thundered on its way southward down among the scrub pines that stood back from the single track croppings of iron wyeth observed reached far to the south of effingham while the country as far as soil was concerned was a desolate lot of red clay and rock the train tore through numerous little towns consisting of a number of shacks built mostly of plain boards standing straight up and down with smaller boards nailed on the cracks

before some of these shanties played white children whose appearance showed the life they lived which was apparently that of poverty while at some distance he also observed were other houses not as respectable as those behind which white children played and occupied by negroes little patches of cleared land that was scratched over denoted that agriculture was attempted in even this poor soil by the slenderness of the dead stalks he could see that it would take many acres to produce a bale of cotton

on to the south the train hurried and as they neared the capital of the state he observed with some encouragement that the soil grew a little deeper but at the best would have been laughed at back in the rosebud country

and the same sight met his gaze all along this had once been a proud aristocratic state but he wondered if it became so by the returns of crops from such poor land yet he was seeing only a small part of it from the car window

a cotton gin greeted the traveler at almost every station while everywhere the scrub pines and rocks were largely in evidence if all the state was like what he saw from the car window with the exception of that which lay about the capital for a distance of fifteen or twenty miles he scarcely wondered that so many negroes preferred the city where wages were sufficient to give them something in life

it was a cold disagreeable day in the beginning but as afternoon wore on he was cheered to see the elements clear and the air become warmer

the highlands were behind them now and had given place to great trees while back from the track log houses interspersed the forest here and there the further south the train pulled the deeper became the swamp while the trees towered to heights that could not be fully estimated from the car window the atmosphere which had before been dry was now charged with a peculiar dampness that seemed to rise from the earth which melted away from the tracks

after many miles in which the afternoon sun barely penetrated the deep forest the train passed through another pine district the trees were slender and scattered while thousands of stumps stood lowly and darkly about as he looked closer he saw that among the standing timber at the base were little buckets he made inquiries and was told that this was where turpentine came from he laughed then at his ignorance

he had forgotten entirely that it was the south which produced the greatest amount of this article

and when they have tapped the tree for such a purpose i suppose it is of no further good but to be cut down

they cut them down at once and make most of them into cord wood replied the person of whom he asked

now these people said wyeth pointing to the black people they attend to the most of it

yes the women to the turpentine and the men to the timber

the train had now come into a land of swamp as far as eyes could see there was a profusion of vines and palm leaves he wondered if that was where the palm leaf fans came from if so the harvest was abundant

for miles and miles the swamp was thick with them and they appeared to be all of fan size water stood a foot deep while the track rose perhaps upwards of four or five feet above it all the trees were a strange variety to him while nowhere for miles did it appear possible for anyone to live the mosquitoes he judged must surely find this place a haven when the days were warm while fever could fairly thrive

now the train had left the deeper forests and was rolling across numerous trestles that stood high above the water great lagoons were crossed where large birds sea gulls and others not so large flew about undisturbed miles away at last rose church spires and ship hoists and he then knew they were approaching a city that was a great seaport

a half hour later they stood in the station he found his way out over the tracks and into the station where he entered the colored waiting room and lunch counter

they were supposed to stop twenty minutes there but before the lunch he had ordered was served he observed the train pulling out he tore out and was about to pass through a gate that was open but was halted by a young white man who informed him that it was the gate white people passed through

but im traveling on that train and it is pulling out he cried frantically

dont make any difference said the other coldly

enter through the niggers gate and pointed to the rear wyeth tore down there but it was closed and locked he gave up aboard the train was his luggage while he must stand and see it go on without him simply for the sake of a rule that negroes and whites cannot walk through the same gate he was disgusted over such an occurrence and stood watching his train disappear it had gone well toward the end of the yards when it came to a stop while the locomotive attached thereto whistled two or three times another man came to the gate and wyeth said to him  im traveling on that train can i not pass through this gate and catch it

he was permitted to and breathed a deep drawn sigh

as he passed the fop who kept him back he gave him a look and wished they were both in the rosebud country at that moment   

a waiter who had seen him go into the station had the vestibule of the diner open and it was through this he entered as he caught the moving train

i knew you would get balled up he exclaimed

i saw your controversy at the gate    and wasnt surprised for you see this is a white mans country

thereupon he smiled a hard dry smile wyeth passed forward to the jim crow car and forgot the incident for it was best so

they had now come into the greater city and he got off

where can good accomodations be had here he inquired of the porter

want a place to stop his face lightened perceptibly if you will wait until i get throughâsay ten or fifteen minutesâill carry you to a good place he said and sidney waited

he sat in the waiting room listening to the noise without about the four sides of the wall sat many little girlsâthat is girls they smiled upon him and made immodest advances he wondered at it but then he recalled that this was supposed to be the most profligate town in our states he paid little attention to them

others entered and they smiled upon them also

presently the porter appeared clothing changed and dressed neatly several of the girls gathered about him and said many foolish things he smiled upon some of them while he told others to go to the devil and still others he told to go tobut we will stop here

and then they told him he could go there too they left then and wyeth and he walked up a street that was the widest he felt certain that he had ever seen

where are you from inquired the porter

wyeth told him whereupon the other whistled

thats a long way from here how do you like these parts

wyeth didnt answer the last but to the first he said yes a long way and fell silent

ever been here before said the porter

twelve years and more ago

see quite a difference now eh

 i was not here long enough to see what there was in the beginning

they walked up a street that was intersected at various and irregular intervals by numerous other streets that were as narrow if not more so than the one they were following was wide in the center of the wide street were four car lines this part of the street was raised above the other and was protected by a curbing that prevented anything with wheels from crossing only at the intersections wyeth remembered this it was something he had never seen elsewhere and he wondered who could have conceived the idea of making one street so wide and then crossing it with others that were so narrow that only one single street car track was possible and when passing down it the wagons on either side had to hug the curbing closely or be collided with

a beautiful place he commented pointing to the maze of electric lights that lined the narrow cross streets and made their way as bright as dayâbrighter he came afterwards to see when it rained

this town was settled by french and spaniards many years ago and they were very artistic in planning for the future of the city said the other

it is apparent on all sides i can see that wyeth agreed

there are some of the most beautiful colored people here you ever saw said the other

there is one now said wyeth as a woman different from the kind he had been accustomed to passed by

creole advised the other

and this is their native soil so i understand said wyeth turning his head to take another look at the woman with the beautiful face

there are some said the porter who cannot speak english at all

indeed exclaimed wyeth

yes went on the other plenty cannot speak a word of english and they may be found in what is called the french district it is there you find them with the most beautiful skin and the finest and heaviest hair you ever saw

i hear they have frightful tempers said wyeth

is it true

i would advise you to avoid any conflict with them lest you find out said the other smiling amusedly

what is that said wyeth pointing to a bar before which stood many men drinking

why what said the other then replied a saloon

and they are open on sunday yet he was not surprised when he had thought for he had seen the same elsewhere but the other replied the saloons never close here

never close what do you mean said wyeth

what i say from the other

and still i do not understand you said wyeth

and then added what time do they open in the morning

they do not close at night therefore they do not have to go to the trouble of opening in the morning

uh huh

there are saloons here that boast of having not closed since before the revolutionary war

good night wyeth laughed something historical down here

youll learn more when you have been here a while

this is the city of historyâamerican history we turn here

and wyeth came to see for himself they were crossing the wide street now and went up another that was as wide but no cars ran up that way

this is basin court said the other as they paused outside of a twostory structure that opened its doors upon the street

a big fat brownskinned man appeared presently and bade them enter

when they were inside they met anotherâa woman and she was fatter still it was the mans wife and she appeared to be in charge from her statements regarding the rental they were from alabama and one glance was sufficient to show they were not creole

wyeth bought some beer and the fat man went for it with a pitcher he returned with as much for a dime as would have cost twentyfive cents in effingham he said so to the other and then the others laughed and said this is the city where they drink it they drink more here than anywhere else in the world wyeth recalled a year beforeâbut then these people had seen only a small part of the world as their conversation later revealed and of courseâbut it didnt matter

you genemens goin to the dance said the woman

to the dance wyeth repeated this is sunday

they smiled at him nowâall of themâand then said sunday is the day of sport in this town more dances occur on sunday than any other day

wyeth whistled

this is the creole city and they smiled again

this gentleman is from a more pious territory said the porter appreciatively he seemed to be very intelligent

what kind of work do the genemen follow asked the hostess

books wyeth replied

they dont read much down here she said dubiously

some do everywhereâmore or less

they are strongly engaged in the art of having a good time here remarked the porter and laughed

i suppose so said wyeth and since practically half of the colored people of the state are illiterate i am of course compelled to agree with you

they talked on other topics now and wyeth not feeling sleepy suggested venturing out sight seeing

he went alone and what he saw he did not soon forget

when the door had closed behind him and his steps died away in the distance the fat man winked and the woman smiled then the pair spoke in the same breath booksâhuh he he bookshuh he he they regarded the porter with a smile but he did not strange to say share their point of view but they had their say nevertheless

booksâhuh

mildred stood in the middle of the room directly under the electric light that tilled the room with its bright rays she could see the end of the key as it turned in the lock and in that moment a scheme entered her head like a flash locating the direction of the door and facing toward it she reached up suddenly and switched off the light instantly the room was ingulfed in darkness she hurried to the door and stood just to one side presently the knob turned and the man entered he stood on the threshold a moment and she heard him say ah the little girl is sleeping peacefully and laughed

that was a devil of a dose awhiskey that girl gave her though knocked her stiff darned if i dont believe she was handing the straight dope after all

he advanced now toward the middle of the room quick as a flash she stepped out and seeing he had left the key in the lock she jerked the door closed and turning the key which she allowed to remain rushed to the end of the steps and hurried down as fast as she could safely venture

it was dark outside and no one stood about the entrance she struck the pavement looked up and down a brief moment and then hurried in a direction that led to whither she knew not but to escape was her only thought she hurried along for fully three blocks and then turned in another direction and then one block in another and pausedâfeeling safe at last

up to this time she was not conscious that her head was aching to a point that was almost splitting she placed her hand upon her forehead and only then was she aware that she had the paper she had picked from the dresser closely clutched in her hand the words she had seen there made her at once forget her headache and all else

she thought of something then she looked at the watch on her wrist yes thank god there is yet time an hour later she came back to the place where she had stood and continued in the direction she had been going looking from right to left for a lodging house

she stopped at several places where a sign over the front advertised rooms but at each one they wanted men only she had no thought of going back to where she had been stopping the last week and besides she knew not where she was nor did she know the street or number where she had been stopping therefore was confident she could not have found it had she wished to return

upon the street she encountered many people celebrating the event of the coming year and then she tried a small house that set back in a yard and which appeared very neat from where she viewed it she secured a room and retired at once setting the oil lamp on a chair next to the bed she unfolded the paper and read the article on the front page carefully over and over again it was an effingham paper and a date of some time before when she had read it until she was convinced that she was not dreaming she sighed restfully as she murmured at last oh lord at last

it was the effingham ageherald and the issue contained the article by sidney wyeth in which he severely arraigned the leading people of his race in that city for their disregard of the general welfare of their people

im so glad so glad she whispered softly and to think that it came to my attention in such an extraordinary manner she felt her forehead and winced when the heat and throb came into contact with the touch she made a wry face as she recalled the taste of stale whiskey only then did she become aware that when she had turned at the sound of the piano someone had filled her glass with liquor and she had drunk it before she realized that it had been doped she thought of the incident from the time she had met miss jones at the corner and had been informed of the part of the town she was in she shuddered and drew the coverlets closely about her as her mind went over it again she then tried to recall how she had followed miss jones to the place where she had met the men and there she had drunk for the first time in her life whiskey although she was not at the moment aware of it she rose out of the bed as the dream came back to her how the tornado had taken sidney into the air and then the story of the hills and the indians she pondered for a time and wondered if such a thing had been the history of the rosebud country and sidney wyeth had not been caught in a tornado but had swept a multitude of people with his pen in a burning article she read over a part of it again the very evils he had berated the most fiercely were the things she had heard wilson jacobs deplore and speak of more than once yes sidney wyeth had written the truth and from the way it was pictured she reckoned that it must have created a bit of excitement and that was the kind of man sidney wyeth was

she smiled as she thought of it

and i love him was it because of these principles that i strangely felt were inherent in him that he has been my dream which has grown larger in my estimation in the months i have had no word of him she asked herself i am going to himâi am tomorrow of course she replied to herself in the next sentence i am not going directly to him    he wouldnt quite appreciate thatâoh he wouldnt appreciate me at all but i love him and am going where he is and after that she had no other words nor thoughts to be where he was maybe to see him became the uppermost desire in her mind

she did not strangely enough think any more about the y m c a she thought of her lover as with a peaceful smile she fell asleep she did not dream that night but lay as she had fallen asleep and it was six oclock the following morning the first of january when she awakened

she lay a half hour without any thoughts in her mind and then observing a window next to the bed she raised it slightly and peeped out it was not yet so very light it was apparently a quiet street occupied by working people who were now in many numbers on the way to their work a boy with a bunch of papers under his arm was passing in their midst and then suddenly she wrapped on the window pane he looked up being accustomed to doing so and catching sight of her hand entered the gate and stood under the window with an upraised paper while she fished out a nickel and dropped it into his hand

she smiled with an expression of satisfaction as she read the article relating to the y m c a for colored youth of the city and was glad to note that wilson jacobs came in for a great deal of praise she laid it aside for a time and was thoughtful again

yes she whispered to herself i will leave the city at once the one thing i so much desired and which has kept me here through these weary months has been obtained she closed her lips and planned further

she decided to go to effingham she would send an expressman for her things at mother janes that morning

she would then purchase a ticket and go by the first train she turned to the editorial column of the paper and was made happy by a lengthy editorial relating the effort for the y m c a and praising wilson jacobs further

she did not know however that the editor of the paper that she was reading and who was one of the most ardent supporters in the christian forward movement in the south had been at the y m c a the evening before he had come with the others out of curiosity when wilson jacobs had torn into the building bareheaded and looking like an insane man and he had written the article the first thing in the new year

she arose and dressed herself at seven oclock and slipped out of the house without awakening anyone

it was getting light now and she went some blocks before she encountered an expressman that satisfied her

she gave him the instructions and walked about impatiently while she waited for him to return as she was waiting she became possessed with a desire to see the little house occupied by the jacobs and where she had spent so many happy hopeful months

she had no trouble finding it since light had given her an acquaintance with her surroundings she found that she was not far from it and then recognized with a start that the same drayman she had sent for the goods was the one who had taken the same from the jacobs a few months before he had not recognized her and she now gave him no further chance to do so

she walked until the house was in sight and then going around a block she found herself within a half block of it smoke was coming from the kitchen chimney and she knew they were astir

bless them she murmured as she realized how happy must be their hearts that morning and that is why they are astir so soon they do not usually arise until nearly eight oclock

as she stood gazing longingly at the house she saw constance emerge from the rear and scatter wheat to a few chickens they had taken a delight in raising the past summer if i could only go to her in this minute and feel her caress for just a moment i would leave the city the happiest woman in the world she stopped when she had said this to realize that she was slipping out of the city like a criminal without greeting the friends she had there made her feel peculiarly guilty she had no enmity in her heart toward anyoneânot even the man who haunted her into the position she now assumed and whose sole purpose had been to satisfy an animal desire she knew she could not go to constance nor to mother janesânor to anyone she would leave the city without saying goodbye to a soul she turned her face away as she recalled that she had left cincinnati the same way she had no friends there and had avoided making acquaintances she almost choked with guilty anguish as she asked herself is it always to be this way am i forever to go from place to place under cover like a criminal am i always to be without friends she couldnt make answer

she could have a certain kind of friends but she shuddered when she realized what kind they would be she had never told anyone the secret

she had no desire strangely to do so only one person among those she loved knew it she now conjectured and she would leave to be near him soon

he knewâa part of it    and he had turned away and had passed out of her life when he learned it he would never come back he would never forget itâand even if through any possible chance she proved to him that it was all a very different problem could he ever forgive her perhaps that was what made it harder to bear

she almost believed he would not in reading his book she had marked a cold decided stand and she felt that if he had made up his mind against her which he had apparently done he was not likely to change  it depended upon the strength of his resolutions she could never get beyond a certain point in her dreams but in spite of that fact something within her longed to be near him to see him not to ask forgivenessânot to do anything but just to be near him that was all

wilson jacobs stood on the porch at the front of the house now smoking a cigar in a way she could at this distance see he enjoyed yesterday morning he could not have smoked in so much peace but today the future was brighter than it had ever been for him she felt this and it was true as he stood looking about him wilson jacobs was happy he was not happy over his own successâfor wilson jacobs did not feel that he had made the successâbut he was happy from the fact that the young negro men of that wicked criminally torn city would soon be the recipients of a movement that would insure a brighter future less tinged with degradation and vice

presently he turned as though responding to a call and entered the house mildred surmised that he had been called to breakfast she turned on her heel and went back to the expressmans place and met him returning with the things

were all packed the trunk only required a rope it and it was ready for the station she inl the expressman to this end and met him at the where she purchased a ticket for effingham trolled outside and to a nearby restaurant where took of a hearty breakfast for she was hungry lrned to the station and waited patiently for the of the train from the north that would take her from the city where she had been for many months

not fallen to her lot to encounter the man who own her back in cincinnati she could have left with friends at the depot and much more cerely but she was glad that she was leaving it as when she had awakened the evening before she a moment felt that she could not leave it withrrible pang of conscience

rain had arrived and the people were hurrying direction she joined them and as she was through the gate she turned for a moment and into the face of the man who had sent her away  she regarded him without a tremor of fright she didnt care a moment later she entered yes said the man i knew sidney wyeth well fe was in fact a personal friend of mine and let me teii you madam there never was a fellow more interested  the welfare of his people from a general point of view than the one you inquire about

indeed she echoed with a pleased smile

yes madam i speak the truth my name is jones

e said  i am the editor of the reporter and mr wyeth sed to drop into the office here quite often and talk ith me about the condition of our people in the south te was a conscientious fellow void of pretense and with regard for anyones point of view yes wyeth was fellow who insisted upon calling a spade a spade not a oe but there is an element of people hereâor was itherâbefore the appearance of an arraignment by fyeth who had only contempt for anyones opinion jier than their own oh ill tell you miss you cannot imagine how this has been worrying me for years i ave been conducting this paper for some time and have ruggled to make it a good sheet but of course we cannot collect from advertising and make our paper pay  we would like to see it he paused a moment and len making himself more comfortable he fell into a ng conversation in which with much fervor he told mildred latham whom he had observed was a careful id appreciative listener of the conditions sidney wyeth id seen and had written about

the papers told about the success of wilson jacobs securing a y m c a for the town northwest of here and god knows how glad i am to see that our people in the south are coming to appreciate a christian forward ovement we have been in a way steering in a directhat got us nowhere and that was the way wyeth to discuss it we have here and in the town just oned the worst negroes under the sun and yet ed as civilized people and it seems to have been ten or overlooked that our salvation in a moral as well as in a practical and progressive depends ipon our own initiative i cannot account for the ness that has so pervaded the lives of our prolal people last summer in a lengthy article a  j dickson editor of the attalia independent l the physicians of that city for a little incident in itself showed a mark of narrowness that few or could be brought to believe

then related the article in brief stating that the line had been drawn among the colored people elves and became very much worked up over the hat most of the people who had been invited did is a rule employ negro doctors for professional ses

have hinted at the things mr wyeth attacked in tide and i have more than once pointed to the i our own society but no one paid any attention ley were too selfopinionated they could not see aults in a negro paper but when it was brought ir attention on the front page of one of the most vative papers conducted by whites in the south hen it appeared altogether different ey stewed and deplored became indignant and all but the truth cannot be played with with all se that followed the publication of the article nce became a burden they knew to the last hat sidney wyeth had written the truth and g but the truth and thanks to god there were i good people to say when the demagogues were lg it that it was the truth so now in this city times are hard and many people are out of work th plenty of time to think it over there is in evii decided change and it is my opinion that next r will see this new idea put into effectâat least so mr wyeth has located permanently here she lired after a pause

oh no he replied quickly i had become so ed when i recalled how much life and appreciation  article of his had inspired in the order of existence ut here that i forgot to say that mr wyeth has the city in fact he left the city immediately after appearance of the article

she caught her breath and swallowed with surprise disappointment he had left the city where had gone to she was afraid to inquire but jones was iking again and saved her the embarrassment of tiring

yes he left a day or so afterward he is not likely locate in the south and moreover his mission in e parts is not i am sure one of locating or hunting a tion he appears to be one seeking the truth about people he told her of wyeths departure to the le city and then obviously anxious to unload his ten of opinions to which she listened with patient est he continued  am of the opinion that he will write a book on  conditions in the near future and if it compares his article and carries a romance interwoven it will  with public appreciation he always spoke of his e out west with much longing and i suppose that atmosphere out there must be of the progressive t which makes a difference when one is forced to ate the conditions of sluggishness down here

low are the people here on christian forward work 

asked

they had never thought of such a thing until wyeth e the article and it was the same in regard to a ry and a park you see madam it has been like he explained our people have been in the habit accepting everything when it came to uplift from white people as a matter of course never letting it y them as far as their own efforts were concerned i again what few books have been written with exceptions novels especially and of which our persecuted character deserving everybodys sym in some manner the authors have been either to avoid his more inherent traits or they were so th their subject matter that they forgot it

 wyeth brought in a couple of books he had sent which were written by the most successful fiction iur race has known he read them and pointed t only a slight mention was made therein that negro would lieâexcuse the expressionâand steal nk and fight and kill and gamble to such an that he would lose his last dollar and lie out of an honest debt

one who conscientiously knows the negro must y be aware of these traits why then should a auild a work of the imagination in which he reveal to the reader the white mans hatred for k brother without including in the same statelat the negro has inherent traits which are some orst evils good society is called upon to endure

judged this was the reason why these books did and the authors ceased to write since they could k without a living profit

course when we allow ourselves our thoughts to dwell upon the white mans prejudice we will ecome pessimists who is not aware of it but  purpose of the practical negro to forget that n as much as possible to allow our minds to upon it and predict what is likely to happen is prepare ourselves for eternal misery so far as s it is my opinion that the white man will always negro it may be argued that it is unchristianich is true but the fact to be reckoned with h remains is that the white man dislikes negroes en we have our own welfare to consider first and is logical that we turn our energies to a more ary purpose

id derwins first book a work of sociology and let a great sale and thereby brought him into notice then i read his late one a novel in he potrayed the evil of prejudice like the author i refer to he built his plot entirely upon leaving the fact that the negro possesses the vices i have mentioned to be understood of all the negro is the most original and humorous

who know him even the least look for some r fancy then how people must be disappointhen they purchase and read a volume concerning ace and find it void of humor the work of both men like works other than fiction by negroes ched in the most select words but the people look hat they know to be current and when they do nd it they are likely to lay the book aside and pick mething that is more to their taste nd with all due regard for the writings of these men i read their works carefully you will discover their lack of confidence in the race whose cause they pion i will relate a little incident to show this ollow the romance and you will find it invariably ed about a white couple why have they done the answer will be a moral but in my opinion could not imagine a negro character strong enough ave into the plot and therefore substituted white because in their imagination it was more fitting hese men have quit writing from the fact that it ot pay for it takes a world of thought concend upon a certain purpose to write a novel any with the ability to put a great thought into words to employ words that are select in the manner men did in their books could at least should be ical enough to do so in such a manner as to win dience that would pay sufficiently for their work to ain them instead of that they have both quit ng they were sincere but did the worst possible by quitting for the quitter never gains anything when it comes to championing the cause of a people ersons who have attempted the same should cerr adhere to the task he paused now as someone ted at the door come in he called

a woman neatly dressed and attractive in appearance and apparently intelligent entered

how do mr jones she cried stretching forth her hand mildred rose to go but jones waved her back

mrs langdon he said kindly i am glad to see you be seated she took a seat she turned to mildred who looked as though she felt she was intruding and said it is nothing private

she drew from her bag a few sheets of paper and smoothing them out she handed them to the editor with here is a little article i have written in honor of the young lady who is soon to make her appearance here in recital as you know and which has been well advertised

i wish to have you publish it in your paper and then she smiled sweetly and affected much modesty as she added it will not be necessary that you mention the same is written by me

but i wish you to have all that is your due mrs

langdon he protested

oh very well then she said and rising with a few more words she took her leave

jones glanced over the page and then started excuse me just a moment miss he begged and read the pages which were neatly written and punctuated when he had finished he smiled and said under his breath that is certainly nerve

mildred regarded him curiously he looked at her and handed the manuscript across the desk saying please read it

she obeyed and when she was through said it is a nice eulogy and then her face showed the wonderment because of his expression of a moment ago

yes he agreed it is nice but take a glance at this and forthwith drew from the top of the desk a pamphlet with the picture of an attractive colored girl thereon

mildred observed the picture and then read the article on the other three pages when she saw the editors face again she understood but she didnt say in fact she didnt know what to say the editor continued  these pamphlets are scattered all over town can you imagine a person with her appearance and obvious intelligence doing such a thing and yet this office is the recipient of many such instances

the article had been copied from the three pages of the pamphlet he had handed her and which were scattered all over the town

she was now in the creole city before her lay the wide street that sidney wyeth had followed but it was lighted by the sun for she had arrived in the morning whereas he had come at night she traveled with only a handbag to encumber her and therefore did not take a car but walked leisurely up the broad highway

the street she at once observed was very wide it was so wide that the buildings appeared very low that lined the sides she counted the stories of one building and found that it was not the wide street alone for the buildings were not high after all not nearly so high as any of the towns in which she had been she wondered why they were not and of course it did not occur to her that the city was built over water that was only a few inches from the surface and which in fact seeped and stood upon the top whenever it could keeping the water below the surface in short had been this citys problem ever since its location and it is no wonder for if anyone takes notice the water of the mighty river that makes it possible as a port and encircles it largely is very often above the town at several times in the history of this citys existence these waters have become so high that they threatened for days to spill over and therefore submerge all the city in a few minutes but our story is not concerned with the possible submerging of the town we are concerned in following mildred latham as she walked curiously up one side of one of its broad highways

she wondered as had sidney wyethâand as perhaps anyone else given to observation would wonderâthat it should build some streets so wide and at the same time make others so narrow that they were not adequate for an alley the buildings as she saw them with few exceptions were old only a few had apparently been erected in the past ten years while over most of the sidewalks were sheds

as she continued her indefinite wandering she observed many curiosities not to be seen in other cities but of course she murmured this is the creole city and is known to be much more historical than the rest of our country

there are not so many colored people encountered on the streets as in other southern towns although viewing its last census of five years before there should be now not less than one hundred thousand of that race within its limits she saw many however and looked at them curiously here and there was one that looked like a creole while most of them were the usual kind

never had she seen so many cars on one street as she saw on the four tracks that ran down the middle of this one they were arranged with a curbing to protect or keep slimfooted mules out of their way so they had to avoid the pedestrians only many police protected at every intersection but withal she was nervous as she hurried across at the beckon of one who wore the bluest uniform and a white hatâno it was a helmet

she had arrived at basin court and did not know that she was within a few doors of the man she loved she gazed about for a time and then went on her way

she came presently abreast of a manâa colored manâ and he was neat looking and intelligent she paused with some constraint and said could you advise me mister where i could secure lodging i am a stranger andâi do not know where to go

he looked at her keenly for a moment then his eyes glanced away and down a street that intersected on either side of that street were housesâsmall houses that made a specialty of a room to the front and these rooms containedâbut we have not come to that and then he looked at her again

his eyes wandered back down that other street and he thought for a moment he looked at her again and then spoke this girl might be stallingâso many of them didâbut still she was intelligent and that made a difference

i could not madam i regret to say for i do not live on this side my home is in tunis which is across the river that is why i do not know

oh she said and her tone was sorry you do not live on this side

no maam you are a stranger here he eyed her keenly again

yes sir i have just arrived and she told him also that she sold books

her tone was pleasant her words were correct and she said them in such a way that he forgot his suspicion and then showed her forthwith much courtesy

indeed he commented i wish i knew a place but i am not so often on this side for i am a physician and my duties keep me mostly over there but if you had happened to be wishing to stop over there i could place you she thought quickly

sidney wyeth was on this side undoubtedly she might at any time encounter him and she didnt know why since that was what she had hoped for but she rather feared to encounter him right now she had no room or place to go and as she meditated she could not see any reason why she should not as soon be on the other side as on this she liked quietness so she said i had not decided whether i would stay across the river or here though of course i expected to stay on this side i would however as soon be on the other side i think

in that event then said he you can accompany me home for my wifeâwe are recently married and she is a stranger and would be glad of companionshipâhas a room and it is for rent so when you have seen it and in case you are satisfied you could have it the charge i think furnished is seven dollars a month

that will be nice she said and was beside him

i am sure i shall be satisfied

thank you said he i am going over now so if you are agreeable we will catch a ferry forthwith

they now walked back down the broad highway at the end of which could be seen the stacks of many steamers he pointed out very kindly sights of interest and explained them

now here he said is a store the family who own it are rich as rich as any in the city and it is said they are part negro though of course they do not admit it the city you will find is a historical old place in many instances and as they walked down the broad highway he told her a great deal that was so interesting that it made the distance which had seemed a long way an hour before appear real short they went up to the river and boarded a ferry

it was a nice ride to the other shore once in the middle of the river which was very wide at this point the creole city rose and stood outlined in all its splendor

the waters near either shore were decorated with many river steamers and as many if not more ocean liners

great docks grim and dark opened their roller doors along the banks while the steamers before them swung great loads of freight in their cellars

miss latham said the doctor when they had arrived at the house this is my wife mrs winnie jacques

they greeted each other and murmured many words and when the introduction was over mrs jacques turned and asked mildred to follow her as she did so upon her neck which rose above the loose kimono she wore was a mole to the right of it another almost midway between the two but an inch below was another and now mildred latham gave a start then she swallowed hard where had she seen the moles beforeâthe three moles only one person in the world she was sure possessed them she followed the other to a room and that night she didnt sleep

the next morning she kissed the other before she left but mrs jacques didnt know why but she watched her strangely as she walked toward the ferry

hello brown skin

he came abreast of a depot it was new with an imposing front over which was inscribed terminal station in arched letters it seemed quite a long way back to the colored waiting room and the station was very narrow it ran back several hundred feet where four or five tracks received the incoming and outgoing human traffic the station like the one he had come into a short while ago was filled with men and women obviously idlers he lingered only a few minutes when curiosity led him further he left the station from the side entrance and found himself upon a very narrow street he paused and as he did so strains of ragtime music came to his ears he was curious to see where it came from and to hear it closer he crossed the street and found that it came from a placeâa cabaretâbut for white people only he turned away and went down the street where something odd caught his attention

he stood where the walks intersected and gazed to his left yes it was a feature on either side of the street stood a row of onestory houses lights were bright as bright as day on either side which fact filled the narrow street with light also he passed down one side and there were multitudes of men sauntering as he wasâbut there were no women excepting in the onestory houses they stood behind open doors some of them while others sat in chairs before a grate fire but one and all he noted were thinly dressed and smiled on everybodyâbut himself for you see they were white womenâwith amorous eyes

come here dearie said oneâand many others said the same i have something to tell you indeed

he conjectured but secrets appear to be the fashion here

he walked to the end of that block and where that street intersected with another and before him on eight different sides was a myriad of the same women thinly cladâand it you understand was the month of january   

it was a sight to be indulged a pastime that was diverting to say the least and since so very many othersâmenâwere seeing it why then not he

he saw itâat least a large part of it

he strolled another block and the same sight met his eye but as he got further away from the station the lights grew dimmer the women fewer but plenty at any rate

now he had reached a place where the crowds had not penetratedâonly stragglers lingered like himselfâand where the women were of another race for now they were colored

hello brown skin they greeted him and he smiled back but didnt stopânot even to hear the secret that almost everyone had to tell him

you are sure some brown kid just come here a moment dont be afraid i wont eat you

 indeed he said to one who was very small and could smile with more effect than the others but im afraid

and he laughed aloud as he went upon his way

he had stopped now he had to for before him was a brick wallâno a brick fence it was painted white and was about eight or ten feet high while inside raised something sinister gee he exclaimed but that is a sight one does not appreciate

he turned now and passed down a side street which was occupied by the same but he couldnt forget what stood grim and determined on the other side it had been there a long time tooâbefore oh long before these women had yes and it would be there long after they had passed away and others not yet born had come to take their places and as he passed down the street under the subtlety of those night smiles that place seemed to sayâkept on saying play on she cats oh play on hells got your soul but ill have the rest by and by he turned the next corner and walked another block and lo there stood another kick high little girl sin as you please hells got your hearts but ill have whats leftâi wont say how soon   

the devil he exclaimed this is the worst place for cemeteries i ever knew im going away from here to my room and he went

where do the wealthiest of the wealthy white people live he inquired the next morning when he had arisen and dined at one of the chinese cafes

the others regarded him now with a question in their eyes yes he repeated where do they live for it is to their servants i prefer to try to sell the book for which i am agent

they caught his logic then and replied take a car at the next corner ride until you come to a park that is called dubberville there you unload and find yourself in the midst of the wealthiest of the wealthy

he went down to that street which was the aforementioned wide street all that money could buy was on sale along its broad highway he sought a bookstore where he wished to make inquiries and of course found a number he strolled about making inquiries until his watch said it was time to return and go forth in quest of that part of town where he wished to begin his work

it was certainly a long way to his destination indeed he made inquiries of the conductor until that one told him he would tell him when they arrived at the place where he wanted to stop so he sat in patience after that he allowed his eyes to feast upon the splendor and magnificence of the beautiful buildings yes they were elegant homes they were the finest homes and they were beautifully arranged not to say artistically on either side of the street which while not the same was another one just as wide so wide indeed that the middle was converted into a lawn on which many palms reared their graceful foliage

the creole city he murmured for a long time i have wished to see it as it really is to know the people and to learn of the many things and wonders it is said to contain

here you are said the conductor at last and sidney wyeth alighted at once

whew he exclaimed standing entranced as he looked all about him such homes such treesâsuch everything and then he walked in the direction his face happened to be turned he was slightly nervous for a time but presently with a bold front he turned into the most insignificant of the many houses and rapped quietly at the back door

come in someone called and he knew the voice belonged to one of his race he had many times thought it strange but it was always easy to determine the negro by his voice alone

he entered and looked at the owner of that same voice

she was a stout brownskinned woman and there was another also but she was black one the large woman was the cook for she worked over the stove while the other was obviously the washerwoman for she was ironing

in his talk he told the story of the book and filled them with enthusiasm to a point that both subscribed

he said he was just commencing and was glad they had favored him with an order he thanked them again and turning he left and betook himself across the street where he encountered another brownskinned woman but she failed to buy and the excuse she gave for not doing so was one he always regarded she was not ableâhaving other irons in the fire he left her went across the street on another corner and entered the rear of the smallest house he saw on the street he was turning to go when another brownskinned woman put in her appearance she was beautiful he thought and she could smile until heâwell she smiled she said shed take one to be sure so he wrote down her name the forged note and asked her about herself she was married and laughed tantalizingly though he had not asked her that

he left presently by the way he had entered and went to another house and still to another until the watch said five then he betook himself to a car line it was not the one he had come out on and soon he saw other homes which showed the creole element

that night he went rambling he couldnt seem to be still there was so much to be seen and it had a peculiar fascination for him he went in the direction he had gone the night before and met crowds of people he strolled until gay music arrested his attention about an electric entrance from which the music came stood colored men he got a peep inside as some one entered and saw that the occupants were negroes so he entered

a waiter showed him a seat by a table around the room were plenty of others there were women and men and others came and went all the time the music had ceased when he entered but ere long it struck up and the room was filled with the strains couples arose and stood face to face and did what he had never seen as he recalled the music played was a twostep but they did not twostepâat least not the way he had done it years before they made only one step where he had made two across the table from where he sat a girl smiled upon him invitingly as much as to say lets dance he was tempted and then he recalled that they had begun this dance since he had quit some years before so he kept his seat and she smiled upon another

he escorted her and they joined the dancers a hesitation they called it and he was positive he wouldâcould never learn it

presently the music stopped and the couple returned to their seat

i know you are going to buy me a little drink she said whereupon the man said nix and left she glared after him and called him cheap

wyeth was glad now he had kept his seat he didnt like bold women even in a cabaret and this was the first one he had ever entered

hello brown skin

it was a place for amusements he soon saw for between dances came songs by many girls and a man or two while clever dancing and ballin the jack was a feature and it attracted to the performers many nickels that they did not hesitate to pick up ere they had fallen and balled again and again until it seemed their legs must sure be tired but you see they were accustomed to that

some town he said to himself when he took his leave a good place to forget to live well it seemed that way

and now we arrive at the end of the pilgrimage of sidney wyeth he had ceased his critical observations and had secured a room on the fifth floor of an office building that was owned and controlled by a negro lodge he began an effort toward the distribution of his work that he believed would be successful now since he had learned by contact the art of reaching his people

he placed a large desk in the office and put a carpet on the floor a large table for wrapping purposes to one side while upon the door and the windows he had an artist painter inscribe the letters cresent distributors company now then he said if i can induce someone here and there to go to the people and follow the instructions i will cheerfully give i think the tempest will be placed into the hands of many people and to that end i shall bend all my energy

and thus he began work permanently he decided to canvass every afternoon and to attend to the office and correspondence in the mornings until such a time when it would not be necessary to do so

he filled the country again with circular letters but before he had completed tins task he felt an illness pervading his usual healthy physique biliousness he said itll be over in a few days and he went to work much harder in an effort to forget it

for days he held it in check by the effort he put forth

but as the days came and went it became harder he didnt go to a physician but waited but before many days had passed however he became conscious that it was more serious so there came a day when he felt whore you she repeated  strangely sick when he laid down everything about him swam he felt dizzy but withal he kept up the fight

i wont give up to it i wont he declared and he earnestly tried to overcome it

he arose from his desk and despite the fact that his knees trembled and his whole frame quivered he went into the street he felt a mad desire to see this city although he had been seeing it every day so to the wide street he went and boarded a car that took him around a belt it brought him back to where he had entered and the route was twelve miles long it led him through the district where he canvassed and which was occupied by the richest he saw their magnificent homes this time strangely at times his eyes would close despite his effort to keep them open and then when he awoke it was with a nervous start and he was surprised each time to find himself aboard the large cars that thundered along between rows of the finest houses in the city

he could not interest himself in them now they appeared dull and without life the car came down and went through the business district before it came back again into the wide street he got off and almost fell in doing so he stood for a time at a loss to control himself he wouldnt go to bed that was sure but where to go he could not think for a time then it occurred to him to see that placeâthat place where a thousand and more women vandals were hurrying life to its end

so he walked in that direction reeling at times until some regarded him as if he were drunk he passed down a street that was called bienville in that neighborhood it was the broad highway and it was crowded

it was then about nine oclock and the sidewalks were filled the girls were merryâthey were always merry apparently    they called to him as before that is a part of them the othersâwell the color line was drawn here too and white men came first

hello brown skin smiled one he had not seen before and winked he regarded her for a moment strangely

she took it as an evidence of encouragement she beckoned to him vigorously and promised so very much

he turned and before him rose one of the ghostly silent placesâthe cemetery it aroused him for a time from his apparent lethargy he looked at it and thought how strange it was this city had so many and they were always silentâwaiting waiting waiting

he shuddered and moved away from it and in a direction that he had not been on all sides the girls were gay that night he went around a block ignoring invitations his brain was clear for awhile and he thought who located such a place a place where each day someone died and went to hell but as he thought the more he concluded that dying was not necessary it was a living death   

come in brown skin not a man has been here tonight he looked up and in the doorway stood a woman she was tall and slender and brown she smiled with an effort he could see for in truth the woman was hungry

im hungry she faltered and thats on the square

the landlord took every dime i made last night for rent this morning not a bite have i eaten this day every day he calls early for his rent business is rottenâeverybodys broke but he must have his rent or out into the street i go she paused and looked tired and then went on im so weak id slip out of this hell hole and try to make an honest living but i have no clothes and besides im afraid that while i was gone he might come along and turn the lock and carry the key with him and too the bulls are filling the streets tonight and fly cops are everywhere so i might be arrested and go t jail i dont like that place up there and she sighed a long drawn weary sigh

why would you be arrested he inquired speaking for the first time

why would i be arrested she exclaimed you must not know the rules of this district she cried

why we are not allowed to leave it when we enter this we agree to stay

to stay he echoed

yes she replied to stay   he followed her gaze she was not aware of what she saw no doubt but he was before her gaze rose gray grim and sinister one of those placesâthe abode of dead things yes and it was waiting silently waiting he turned and regarded the woman she was quiet a man came by crying hot sandwichesâhot tamalesâfive cents apiece

he saw her gazing at them with eyes that were dry but hungry

here he cried with your sandwiches and then turned to her take as many as you want all you can eat tonight and some for tomorrow

her eyes widened she beheld him now with wonder

do you mean it she whispered in a subdued voice

he nodded and handed the man a half dollar

she ate ravenously while he watched presently he started while she watched him strangely as if he were something unearthly he turned suddenly and came back to where she stood he ran his hand into his pocket and drew forth three silver dollars here he said and a moment later he was gone

she stood transformed and then dreamlike she cried after him god bless you

back toward his room he now walked and at times stumbled but all the way the words of that woman rang in his ears god bless you god he murmured do you know these people are you acquainted with these women who are sinning they dont know you their souls are burning now in hell he didnt know the direction he was going nor did he hear the invitations but soon he came to one of those walls and looked up yes they were inside    those who had known this life in the infinite long ago and they were waiting for those others 

brown skin he now heard and then much gayety followed but he looked up and saw the others who were likewise waiting sin on little girl satans got your soul and youll burn in hell some day

he went a block where on one side the gray silence greeted him while on the other gay life was the order

come in boy ive something to tell you but sidney wyeth made no answer all the while he could feel that silent spectre the grave and it seemed to say we are waiting waiting waiting

he went now in the direction of his room and as he went along the gray court kept telling him these are mineâall of them and do you know they come to me each day oh they are gayânow the devils got their souls but i always get the rest meanwhile i am waiting patiently waiting

gay music came from the doors of a cabaret and he saw it was for colored people white people were not allowed within he entered the accustomed crowd lined the walls the same girls came each nightâhe now saw they welcomed those who wished for drinks which came at fifteen cents apiece a half of which they received at the end of the night and that was how they lived

he avoided them on the floor were the dancers

the music was inspiring and balling the jack was the order a rain of nickels came down upon them and they quit only when they were exhausted

he was awakened by a waiter at the table where he had fallen asleep so he ordered a drink gulped it down with an effort and took his leave he emerged and had walked a few steps when someone touched him he looked down into the face of the woman who had been hungry

whore you she said whore you she repeated  to feed a starving wench and ask nothing dont look at me so strangely i followed you i saw you enter there

i would have followed you in but they dont allow us in there    they dont allow us anywhere butâoh well i didnt come to tell you my troubles and then she added i wouldnt wish to disgrace you by having others see but wont you come back

he gazed down into her eyes and saw the truth therein

 a lost soul    yes a lost soul and then something within him seemed to burst the world about him became a maze of darkness and he knew no more

at last oh lord at last

mrs ernestine jacques very soon became devoted to her roomer mildred latham she told her husband as much when she had been in the house a few days

shes a delightful girl a fine companion and i am glad she made inquiry of you in regard to lodging

i am pleased to hear it said her husband i am glad to have found you a companion and now you wont miss me so much will you

of course i will she pouted i didnt mean that

she said but women you know seem to require friends even when they have the best husbands in the world

we leave them at this point and return to the subject of their conversation who had begun a canvass in the sale of wyeths book and had met with success which is neither unusual nor strange since it depends upon the efforts of the worker

she estimated that he would confine his work to the aristocratic section where the multitude of servants were so she decided to try the colored people in their homes to begin with therefore from one she learned of others until she had a list of people whom she worked among and with excellent results she became an attendant of the methodist church where she met many and made acquaintances that increased the success of her work and thus her life flowed serenely along uneventful for many weeks but she had not seen or heard of the one she sought although in the course of time she came across the book and knew it had been bought from him

it rained at times until whole days were lost for it was too wet to enter nice homes she stayed in her room at these times and talked with mrs jacques as little as possible although she longed to do so very much she was glad to see as the time went on that the two were devoted to each other dr jacques was a good man and was even a better husband

some day she sighed maybe ill be like that

she pondered now for some time

mildred had reached no decision as yet in regard to her plans she was nervous at times on the street fearing she might meet sidney she worked hard to occupy herself and thus it went along until she had gotten her work well under way

have you ever been up in the perier building

a lawyer who purchased a book inquired of her

no sir i have not where is that and are there colored people about it she said

yes maam it is a building occupied and owned by negroes there are a great many people located in it who would buy the book i am sure he informed her

i would advise you to go

i thank you ever so much indeed she cried gratefully i shall go there tomorrow

the next day was a beautiful one the air was fragrant with the perfume of roses and the birds sang seemingly everywhere

a storm of some proportion will reach this place before night said dr jacques a day that begins as this one always ends that way

my husband is a weather prognosticator commented his wife humorously mildred smiled knowingly from across the table

and you have been very successful with your work miss latham said he surveying her appreciatively

oh very much so but it has been so elsewhere

she told him of her work in the city she had just left

it was a strange coincidence said he how they came to secure the y m c a in that town i keep i myself pretty well informed regarding uplift among our  people and it was truly a delight when i read that at j almost the last minute money that was lacking but necessary to fulfil the requirements was brought to hand

 it was too bad grantville failed in the effort to secure theirs and they wanted it so badly the doctor continued i attended school in that city and always have a warm spot in my heart for the place

well dear said his wife how did they come to fail in the effort in grantville and succeeded in this other town i understood you to say that grantville had a much more intelligent set of colored people and more progressive

so it has so it has he said quickly but by some strange coincidence the money necessary to complete the arrangement was brought forward at almost the last minute otherwise they had acknowledged failure

i wonder where the money came from she mused

i suppose i must be going about my work said mildred rising i am going to canvass the perier building today i have been told there are many offices occupied by persons who might buy

most assuredly said the doctor there are many i am sure he was thoughtful a moment and then continued our people in this town are not possessed with that race spirit which it is claimed negroes have in other cities they are accused of lacking unity but in spite of that when one applies himself to the task with patience and fortitude enough of the spirit can be aroused to make work like yours remunerative but nevertheless i am often distressed when i realize that we havent a first class local race paper here for without one it is impossible lo reach the peopleâthe colored peopleâthrough advertising unless a high rate is paid in the columns of the white paper and that is not practical

are you much acquainted in the building mildred inquired

oh yes i know everybodyâthat is almost everybody the last time i was over there i observed that an office had been taken by one who is a stranger to me and i observed also that he appeared to be studious so it might be worth while to see him too

she thanked him kissed his wife and a few minutes later her steps died away in the distance

dear said mrs jacques dont you know that she reminds me of someone i knew a long time ago

but who it was where it was i do not know but i always feel queer when she kisses me

youre becoming fanciful he smiled lighting a cigar

they talked about other subjects and mildred was for the time forgotten

a story of the northwest by a negro pioneer eh

said a man upon whose office door was written real estate loans and renting mm looks like a good book negroes dont write many books although there are a great many that come the rounds about negroes but gotten up by whites with a sketch about tom dick and harry and exaggerated estimates of the negro

so in view of the fact i guess you may put me down for a copy and deliver it next week

thank you sir she said as she wrote his name and the date of delivery

having much success he inquired

a great deal i am glad to say she replied pleasantly

glad to hear that there are always readers to be found if one looks for them but on the whole the people of this town have not much of a literary turn of mind

indeed

no it is such a carefree happygolucky place that not all the people who should try to concentrate themselves in reading he was quiet and thoughtful for a moment and then said have you tried many of the school teachers

a great many she said

and how did you find them

well just fair i sold to a few of them

a few of them eh it would seem they should welcome the fact that negroes are beginning to write books

obviously yes

and the preachers

they buy but some of them dislike to so much so that i have dispensed with going to them

and the physicians

they are very nice she didnt say how nice and he didnt ask so it ended there

she went from one office to another and almost all purchased some out of real interest while others subscribed merely through courtesy to her and from the fact that it was rare to meet colored people selling or trying to sell anything

she had completed the third floor and was ascending to the fourth when the then overcast skies became darker and rain began falling fitfully she made all the offices on that floor with her usual success and started upon the fifth twilight was gathering and with the darkness from the clouds lights were soon aglow

she had made the fifth and was just passing to the elevator when she chanced to spy an office that she had overlooked and in that moment she recalled the doctors statement about the stranger the office was at the end of the hallâa hall that was not much used evidently

mildred observed as she approached that the door was slightly ajar she knocked lightly and then receiving no invitation pushed the door open and entered

a man sat at the other side of the room and he seemed to be sick or asleepâat least he lay with face downward across the desk at which he sat she approached him disregarding his apparent lethargy and when she had offered a greeting and he had raised himself slightly she told him the story of the book

he was sick she soon saw and she felt sympathetic

she bathed his headâhis foreheadâwith a damp towel then she inquired if he felt better and looked for the first time into his face

at last oh lord at last she cried in a subdued voice as she bounded down the steps i have found him i have found him she walked hurriedly on her way to the street and did not wait or think of the elevator that would have saved her strength when she was on the street she hurried through the rainâfor it was pouring nowâand did not stop until the ferry had been reached

once aboard this she hid herself in the darkest place she could find and there as the paddle of the propeller came to her ears she cried sidney my sidney i have found you and never never until the end of the world will i be far from youâoh my love

well im going and she went typhoidpneumonia said the physician rising from over the patient who had just been brought to the hospital

sidney wyeth unconscious was carried at once to the section of the great hospital reserved for patients with contagious diseases

what do you think of it doctor is it a serious case or just a light attack inquired one of the assistants who was making a specialty of a study of fever

serious was the reply very serious he will be lucky if he is able to pull through

i just missed you miss latham said dr jacques coming in a few minutes after mildred had entered the house

indeed i am sorry we could have come over together she exclaimed smothering her excitement for the time and smiling regretfully when he had told her that he was in the perier building just before she left

were you very successful with the people in the building he inquired pleasantly

i received eleven orders there today

too bad the young man the stranger took sick

you might have gotten a dozen he said

who took sick she inquired with a start

the young man i spoke to you about this morning

explained the physician he was carried from the building shortly after you left with a serious attack of typhoidpneumonia he was standing with his back to her when he said this and therefore did not see her start and open her mouth she swallowed the exclamation and he was no wiser hurrying to her room she entered locked the door and sat down with a wild look in her eyes plainly frightened

sick she mumbled typhoidpneumonia oh merciful god she was silent then for a long time

outside the rain continued to fall while in the other rooms she could hear mrs jacques singing softly as she busied herself in the preparation of the evening meal

if i had only known mildred whispered to herself

and then she was compelled to dismiss what she was thinking of as being impractical she continued to sit and meditate until she was called to supper by ernestine

she arose and bathed her face realizing it would be advisable to appear unconcerned for as she now estimated she would dislike to be questioned

when the meal was over she inquired of the physician where the patient had been taken

to the charity hospital he replied

i see she said calmly is that a good place

oh the best in the south the sisters of mercy have it largely in charge and they give the best possible care to all patientsâblack or white

she went to her room slightly relieved and fell at once to planning

the fact that he had taken an office was selfevident that he was preparing some extensive campaign with regard to his book as it stood now whatever he had been arranging would stop at once

it was late that evening when she retired but before sleep came to her eyes that night she had decided upon a course of action

mildred arose early dressed heated some tea and ate a light lunch then she threw on a dress hurried out of the house and down to the ferry an hour later she was at the hospital

i called beg pardon she began to inquire about a patient who was brought here last evening and who i understand was stricken with typhoidpneumonia

his name is sidney wyeth and he is a colored man

after a moment in which the record was consulted the informant turned to her and said sidney wyeth a colored man serious attack of typhoidpneumonia in the ward of contagious diseases cannot be seen madam i regret to say

indeedâahâdid you sayâitâwasâquite serious

she inquired tremulously

quite serious madam quite serious

there is no doubt howeverâah that he will recover

we are not allowed to give out information of that nature he may recover and still he may not but we cannot say

just another question sir she said hesitatingly

about how long would it be in case he should recover before he will likely be on the street

cases as serious and of that nature rarely leave the hospital under two months possibly three and sometimes it is even four but if he should recover it would not be possible under two months

very well i thank you and bowing she left the desk

mildred walked down the wide street upon which the hospital faced she had not consulted any one else and in truth had no idea that the disease would last so long

what can i do what can i do she asked herself several times as she passed down the street he has just started up and to think that such a misfortune should overtake him at the outset

she walked on down the street until she arrived at the corner where she paused for a moment she turned and only a block away rose the perier building she could see his office it was toward the rear and as she stood looking up at it meditatively she caught an outline of the desk at which he had sat when she came into the office with no thought that she was near him

i am going up there to the custodian of that building andâwell im going and she went

are you the custodian of the building sir she inquired a few minutes later of an elderly man with a pointed beard and cleverly trimmed mustache

i am madam he replied and at your service

a gentleman who has recently taken an office here was yesterday stricken with typhoidpneumonia and was taken to the charity hospital

yes madam so he was acknowledged the other

too bad he took the office only a short time ago and seemed to be a very progressive young man you are acquainted with him he asked observing the worried look upon her face

yes sir i am acquainted with him

indeed i suppose you are a relative or a close friend he said and then paused before proceeding

his office is openâthat is no one is there to attend to it and he seems to be the recipient of considerable mail i have observed so if you are interested in his affairs you may have the key and look after the matter if you wish too he was very cordial and the fact saved her from explaining what she had in view when she entered

yes she said i am interested in his affairs and it is very kind of you to make the suggestion in truth it was on his account that i called here i should be glad to look after his business while he is indisposed

she ended bravely and kept her face straight

the custodian gave her the keys and a few minutes later she found herself in the small office looking curiously and guiltily about

she assorted the mail and then going through what had been opened she soon got an idea of his plans

being engaged in this same work it was easy for her to collect the broken threads and resume his task she carefully opened the mail that had come that day and a moment later was typing replies to a score or more in the manner he would have done had providence given him the opportunity

she worked late that evening and neglected to canvass at all although it was a beautiful day

she saw by the copy in one of the drawers that he was advertising for agents and in an apparently successful way now it had occurred to her before that white people preyed upon negroes as agents and moreover from her own experience she had come to realize that they would white agents attempt to sell anything if inducements were made that seemed plausible

when she was in her room alone that night she did some more planning some figuring and some estimating

in the end she decided to take the risk

being a business woman had always appealed to her fancy and the work was to her a most absorbing diversion she had learned how to operate a typewriter when she attended school and was very clever at shorthand also could keep books with proficiency and was now glad she had learned these things although until she had taken up the sale of the book she had had no occasion to use her ability

the following day she arrived at the office at eight oclock sharp and went to work at once when the mail came she was cheered to receive twenty dollars in the same and also to note three orders from agents who were selling the book in other cities she attended to all this the packing and shipping of the books wrote replies to all letters including some of encouragement to those who were succeeding

she had lunch at a nearby cafe and returned to work immediately she then made up a list of carbon copies which she mailed before going home to several newspapers all over the country inclosing a money order in each to cover the cost of insertion

and now she sighed i am happy i feel better than i have felt for some time   she closed her eyes meditatively and thought of him would he survive typhoidpneumonia was a dreadful disease and she was considerably worried when she retired that night she prayed a long prayer and went to sleep with a smile upon her lips at peace with the world and with hopes for the best

i hope youâwontâwont be angry

we cannot give out information as to the condition of the patient madam said the informant at the hospital when mildred had called to inquire regarding the condition of her lover she turned wearily away and went back to the office

she was anxious to know the worst if it came to that and was worried daily until she could not restrain the desire to visit the hospital each morning before she went about the duties she had preempted

he is not dead she whispered to herself and if i go each day i can work with my mind at peace whereas i would surely go crazy if i were compelled to go along and not know whether he is living or dead

two weeks passed and he still lived and at the end of that time she was advised at the hospital that recovery was expected but that he would be in all likelihood unable to leave the hospital under two months from that date

she went to the office that day in the highest spirits and was especially cheered to find a pile of letters in answer to the advertisements replies were many during the following days in due course of time she had secured a large number of agents and a greater portion upon following her instructions were successful orders for books began to fill the office and after she had been in charge of the office a month she was pleased to see that she was actually succeeding each mail brought money and express orders and then the work being too heavy for one she looked about for a stenographer to help her she was successful in securing a very intelligent girl a creole with french ways and a command of that tongue which at times especially when excited conflicted with her english to a degree that was amusing

as the days went by business increased until at the end of six weeks more than a thousand dollars was finding its way to the office each week mildred was encouraged she was delighted she deposited the money to his credit in a savings account and used only what was necessary for expenses and for her own living she became so enthusiastic over the same that she almost forgot he would return and thenâbut she got no further

he will be able to leave the hospital in two weeks possibly ten days the informant advised her the last day she called which was eight weeks after he had taken sick it was only then that she became fully appreciative of the position she held she now became uneasy as after thinking it over for some time she was unable to decide what to do the business was now so heavy that it was impossible to be away from it money came in each mail and sometimes in large sums while orders and inquiries for the agency kept her dictating letters for hours each day she permitted herself that day and other days that followed to become the heroine in a wild dream she saw him well which he would be soon and she fancied how much she could help him but always when she recalled the past there came a choking and she would turn desperately to her work in order to forget

and yet she said to herself one dayâand that was only a few days before he was expected to returnâi must do something i cannot sit here and allow him to walk in upon me becauseâhe oh im afraid he might resent it

one morning the mail was heavier than usual because it was monday and saturday had been a holiday

springtime had come with its time of blossom and the air was fragrant she hummed a little tune and was happy that day happier than she had been for a long time she went about the great amount of work with a calmness and precision that resulted in finishing it before five oclock ordinarily there was enough to have kept them busy until the next day noon

well katherine she said to the stenographer we have been very industrious today and i am going to bring you something nice tomorrow you are very helpful and with a quick impulse she kissed the other who returned it as affectionately

in that moment she almost felt inclined to tell the girl the burden that was upon her but she thought better of it quickly and with a kind word she turned to her desk and for a time listened to the others footstep in the hallway where she moved occasionally while waiting for the elevator

from a drawer she took some letters and glanced over them reflectively they were letters from a girl she recognized in the story and from their tone she surmised that the other had once loved him that love however had changed in the course of events and now they were only friends

she sat for a long time and gazed dreamily out over the city and then suddenly it occurred to her that she was sitting in the same position he had occupied when she had entered his office almost ten weeks before she stirred uneasily at that moment a step sounded in the hall and came in the direction of the office it paused a minute outside the door and then it was opened and some person stood on the threshold

it was getting dark and as the man paused she observed that he looked about the office strangelyâdoubtfully in so far as he knew he had felt the office was a thing of the past and at this moment he muttered  hump guess someone else is in this place presently with another muttering he came toward the window

mildred sat stupified and seemed unable to move any part of her body she felt strangely paralyzed when he got near the middle of the room he suddenly bethought himself of the light and turning he went to the wall where the switch was located and pressed the button

she had rearranged the office that is she had added to the number of lights since there were only two bulbs when she came now there were six over the desk set one and it had a reflector when he pressed the button the room became instantly illuminated by the bright rays while the one on the desk reflected full into her face

she said something and turned her face while he gave a start and cried you

the next moment he fell back and observed her strangely she sat as he had found her with head lowered and heart thumping violently he advanced after a pause and stood close to her regarding her with a look that was stranger still he appeared to be at a loss what to say or do then he raised his hand to his forehead while his gaze was one of utter blankness it occurred to her then that he might be impaired in some way after such a severe illness so with an effort she rose boldly from the chair and facing him said yes it is i sidâmr wyeth she was compelled by the thumping of her heart to hesitate for a moment and then she continued more calmly i have made bold to come here during your illness andâandâtake charge of your work i hope she was now faltering while he was regarding her without understanding from the expression he wore andâoh she saw it now

he was regarding her with disfavor a frown played about his lips that appeared drawn and thin while his eyes gradually changed until they were openly hostileâ contempt almost could be read she turned her eyes away

this was her reward she choked her brain became a whirl for a moment she had tried to help him and had succeeded she had thought of it in that way she now strangely realized that she had not expected any thanksâindeed she had never thought of anything but to make the business a success and she was positive that she had not expected any reward

she was saying something she was not fully aware what it was and her head hung down while her eyes sought the floor instead of his face with the hostile expression

i hope youâwontâwont be angry with a great effort during which she felt he was regarding her in the same critical manner although she was careful not to glance into his face she explained briefly what had transpired during his absence and so she concluded here is everything drawn down to date and with that she suddenly caught up her light coat drew her turban hat over her head and went toward the door

as she did so she was aware that he had turned and was looking after her she paused when she reached the door and thought of his illness he might take sick again she saw his eyes now for a brief moment and they were upon her she could not read them altogether but it seemed as if the hostility was gone and a look that bordered on appeal had taken its place her gaze lingered kindly and then she said you are illâhave been please be careful and in spite of the effort it cost her to say it she added i will come again tomorrow and was gone

all that night she tossed and tumbled in her little bed in tunis and when morning came she dropped off to sleep mrs jacques called her and then came to the room and knocked at the door presently she ventured to open it slightly mildred was snoring peacefully

shes tired poor thing very tired she looked at her again her face was upturned and her throat was exposed a beautiful brown throat she crossed the room easily to where she lay gazed down at her for a moment and became conscious again of that same feeling that had been haunting her since she knew her

she stopped presently and drew the lace night dress down a bit the next moment she recoiled in fright

at last oh god at last i have found her my sister the other stirred light shown brightly through the window for it was seventhirty and the sun was climbing but mildred latham was tired and was snoring again in calm repose the other bent over her

she kept from putting her arms about her with much effort and then kissed her lips fondly

she stood a few feet away and regarded her with a heavenly feeling and then drawing the blind until the room was fully dark she left her

vellun parishâjefferson bernard sidney wyeth sat for a long time at his desk after he had looked through the statement before him he could not for some time understand how it had all come about

he had been carried from the office unconscious ten weeks before and during that time or when he had come back into his senses after many weeks he had concluded that his effort which had not gone very far was doomed to die and had resigned himself to the inevitable now before him was a statement which showed that more than a thousand dollars was finding its way to the office each week in excess of the cost of the books more than five thousand dollars was to his credit in a local bank what miracle had been wrought to make such a profit in so short a timeâor any time at all it had taken him two years to reach a fourth edition of this book while now the copies before him stated ninth edition

how had it all happened

there was but one answer and that was mildred latham

he lived over again the years of the past he saw her as he had met her on that first day he recalled her patience and appreciation while he explained to her the contents of the book and the order she had given he remembered the dance and the kiss with a strange pang of the heart in all his days no kiss had seemed like that and the look in her eyes afterward was that love surely that was life if god our creator made that possible then life was worth the effort he became so absorbed in his reflections that he started when he recalled his last visit

after that it was different but for thatâbut he had worried himself sick and had succeeded in forgetting it and her until the day he took sick he was too weak and torn by the illness to think about the matter while he lay on his back in the hospital but when convalescence had set in he had thought of it almost constantly try as he would he had been unable to understand how it all happened he pondered over it until he entered the office an hour ago and now it was all plain

who is this girl he asked himself what is she

he demanded she has always puzzled me but at the end of it all the old hag on the steps with the words she had spoken rose again before him and he forgotâhe felt he was compelled to forget all the rest

he got up after a time and walked about the office

he felt tired and in view of her success and of the circumstances surrounding it he would go somewhere and rest until he had thought it all out but of one thing he was certain and that was he must never see her again

he could love her he could do anything within his power for herâhe was only too glad to but he felt he could never forget the few words he had heard a long time ago

so he wrote a letter to the effect that he had gone away but he did not state where

oh i have overslept myself dreadfully cried mildred entering the kitchen where the other worked away in silence

i started to awaken you and you were resting so quietly that i desisted mrs jacques replied regarding her with a fond glance that the other did not understand

i must hurry for of all mornings this is the very one i would not have been late for anything and she hurried through her breakfast and was turning to go when the other came up threw her arms about her impulsively and kissed her long and lingeringly upon the lips

mildred returned the embrace but she did not understand the expression in the eyes of the other as she took her leave

she arrived at the office and was surprised to find only katherine working away on the books

 hasâah any one been here she inquired after waiting to hear something from the lips of the other

no maam no one said the other looking up in surprise for a moment

very well said mildred seating herself at her desk

as she did so her eyes fell upon an envelope with her name written across it and marked personal she broke the seal nervously calming herself she straightened out the folded sheet and read it carefully

miss mildred latham my dear madam it is impossible to state how much you have done for the sale of the book during my illness i do not hesitate to say that in view of the fact that i have struggled over a period of two years with only a small measure of success as compared to that which has come about since you have looked after it that it is beyond me

i cannot however conscientiously accept it in the way you have of tered it according to your statement so i have therefore made over to you the sum total that you placed in the bank to my credit

i am leaving the city for parts unknown and may not return for a long timeâand possibly not at all

regretting that i cannot thank you more amply but hoping you will accept what is no more than due you i am very sincerely yours sidney wyeth

she laid the letter down and gazed into space for a long time not trying to understand anything he had gone and left her he had given her all she had earned and the privilege of earning more but he had gone

would he ever return    she was sorry now that she didnt tell him all when it had been convenient and still in the next thought she was glad she hadnt

she was not excited but went about the work without any outward sign that she had been the recipient of anything unusual but all the day through she was thinking of what had just passed she could not recall what she had expected or that she had expected anything but of one thing she was more conscious than ever before and that was that she loved him with all her soul

so she decided to allow matters to drift along and made no change

wyeth stood before the window of the city ticket office of a small railroad he was attracted by a parish which appeared rather remote but where a lake was advertised as a nice place to fish he made up his mind to go there

it was a half days journey by rail and a train left in two hours he returned to his room and an hour later his trunk was at the depot he passed near the building and from where he paused he caught a sight of her sitting at the desk where she had sat the night before

he could go to her now and say what had been on his lips more than a year before he gazed at her for a long time and was conscious of a longing he had loved her âoh so very much indeed she was everything he had desired then he thought of the hag and what she had said and went his way to the depot

vellun parish is perhaps the most remote part of the state it lies toward the southwest and is bounded on one side by the gulf of mexico its land is all swamp while no part of it is more than ten feet above the level of the sea the most of it is under perhaps a foot of water upon the dry portion a few people live they make no effort to raise crops further than a garden but depend mostly upon fishing and upon tourists for their living one railroad pulls through the mighty swamps about it and has a small station located on this dry spot it is many miles to another station almost everybody leaves the place in summer for mosquitoes hold sway while sickness and swamp fever are prevalent

it was high noon at this resort and from down the track could be heard the whistle of a small locomotiveâ for the trestles would not hold up large heavy ones presently with a ringing of bells it came to a stop before the station and two people got off other than members of the train crew one from the rear and the other from the front of the jim crow car

the latter was sidney wyeth and in his hands he carried a fishing outfit and other matter together with a suit case before the station loafed a few of the inhabitants including an old man whose age was perhaps sixty he regarded wyeth strangely but returned the nod curteously when the other had spoken

have any idea where i can find lodging about here

he inquired it was at the end of the winter season and those who live the summer months through had resigned themselves to the heat and mosquitoes the old man surveyed wyeth a moment critically before replying

well i dunno exactly said he at last and wyeth was startled at his command of language for in those parts few spoke english and when they did it was bad

creole was customary the old man looked about a moment before continuing but presently he said i live alone over beyond that clump of trees and he pointed to a grove that wyeth saw plainly and if you are alone you might go along and look it over and if satisfied why we might make a deal

thats fair enough agreed wyeth im alone and may be here a month a week or it may be three months i cant say

very well then follow me

he took part of the luggage and they went across one of the few cleared spots of the parish finally they came to a neat log house behind a paling fence before which a dog barked viciously don don hush the noise the old man said he wont bite but he is fond of barking

the dog now rolled on his back at wyeths feet and they soom became friends sidney patted his head and then rolled him over much to the dogs delight

well well governor cried wyeth enthusiastically when they were inside but youre all fixed here i must say

yes said the other slowly and modestly i guess itll do for an old relic like me and he laughed humorously wyeth regarded him a moment and then for the first time told him his name

and mine is jefferson bernard

well mr bernard i have always taken pride in the fact that i am at home in the open and he gazed out the window across the cleared spot and into the forest that surrounded the house

glad to hear that cried the other i was under the impression that you were one of the fly butlers who come here with their people

no im a sort of globe trotter you might say in fact at the present i have no plans whatever for the future so i might bunk with you here a few months

depends on how my mind is at the end of each day

restless eh

thats it have spent eleven years on the prairies of dakota and very often the call of the wild gets into my veins and i want to get out where i cannot see any one and sort ofâwell forget the strenuous ways of life for a while

both laughed agreeably

well said jefferson bernard i bunk here alone and do my own cooking of course and hunt and fish and read and sleep whenever i get ready

wyeth wondered at this man about the wall everything was clean while the clothes the other wore were a forest suit of brown cloth with lace boots and a belt his hat was a broad brimmed stetson they were all the best of material and the mans appearance was anything else but the backwoods negro he started to inquire who he was but something about the other did not invite familiarity so he talked on other topics instead

he had been there two weeks and had been over all the part of the parish that was accessible when one of the periodic rainy spells set in for days they were unable to get outside without getting wet and at times they told a great deal about themselves

and that reminds me said bernard that you spoke of cincinnati and that you came south from there a bit over a year ago i then left there after you did

indeed said wyeth in surprise

yes i have been down here a little over a year only

i was reared in this same parish many years ago and since then i always had a longing to come back and stay again until i got tired of it he made himself comfortable as he drew away on a long pipe while wyeth observing him waited for the story he had to tell

yes i used to live in cincinnatiâin fact i guess that is what i might call home if not this

this is news to me said wyeth

the other smiled languidly and went on i used to live on walnut hill and was employed by stephen myer a wealthy retired merchant who not only was welltodo in cinci but owned a number of interests in the south in fact he came to cincinnati from the south not so long before and never went back again for he died

i was his valet for years got acquainted with him right here in this parish one winter when he was staying at the hotel over there and it was the second winter when he hired me and took me north with him

stephen myer was a good man at heart but a sport until he died and certainly believed in a good time with the women he loved his family but he would run around which recalls his death whenever i think of it

he came back from the south about three years ago i think and it was not long until i knew he was keeping a girl he had brought with him i paid the matter no attention because he always had somebody before but strange to say after that he had no other it was kept very quiet and i knew nothing of itâthat is from him until the night he died that took place while we were at a hotel in detroit his death was due to heart failure but it didnt take him as it does most of its victims

he was conscious that he was going to die although he was to all appearances well

it was then he told me the story

calling me to his bedside this is what he said i do not think i shall ever forget it because it was such an awful death jeff said he im going to die i looked at him saying oh youre frightened but he shook his head in such a way that i became frightened and waited yes jeff he resumed im goin to die and jeff im going to hell i tried to soothe him but he only frowned slightly and went on yes jeff im going to die and go to hell because i deserve to go there i deserve to go there jeff because i have sinned

yes jeff ive committed an awful sin and its no more than my due to burn in hell in payment i never believed much in such a place until not long ago when i brought that girl to cincinnati he breathed deeply and with some effort and it was then i could see he wore a strange expression and now as i look back at it i guess that meant death he went on again after a breathing spell bring me that box over there jeff that one with the key in the lock i want to leave that one whom i have wronged something before im done for i brought it to him and he unlocked it and took therefrom a lot of papers and a certified check for twentyfive thousand dollars all made out and to be turned over to her through due recognition as attested by his lawyers in cincinnati

hadnt i better wire for your family i inquired of him but he waived it aside and said he didnt want them to know until it was over

 now jeff he went on you are to take this envelope to my attorney and see that you get their receipt of it after which when you get back to cincinnati you take this box as it is to her i trust you jeff and believe that you will attend to it and too ive left you well cared for but that is in the will in due form and now if youll just give me a drink of water ill tell you the story

my company had their southern office in attalia and we had quite a bit of business with the financial department of one of the big denominations of negro churches and that was how we came to become involved in this deal the financial secretary of the church very often gave us his note in payment and soon became well known to me and i liked him pretty soon however it came to me that he aspired to be a bishop although the office he held was a good graft and we knew it altho the niggers didnt but he became crazy to be a bishop and a real big negro proper

 about this time it came to my attention that something crooked something underhanded was going on in the affairs of the church well one of the boys who worked as porter was reading a negro paper one day and i observed that this financial secretarys picture covered the whole front page i took the paper and when i had read all the stuff he had written under anothers name i began to figure what it was costing him to become a bishop other extravagances came under my observation and since the business we had with them was becoming involved i began an investigation regarding the preacher it developed that he had been married twiceâthat is the present wife was his second the first one had died and left him two daughters my investigation which came through a negro detective by the name of dejoie although he was known during the investigation as edwards developed that he was a despot his youngest daughter by his first wife realized this and she threw it into his face and left when she was thirteen going to a place in michigan where she educated herself the other was a girl with much sense but somewhat subservient to the old man regardless of the fact that she possessed a mind of her own apparently it had been the old mans practice to have them regard him as the great i am she stayed with her father who lived with his second wife and to that union were born several children i dont know how many

edwards uncovered all this and some more he revealed the fact that this preacher who was so anxious to become a bishop was not only seeking it by extravagant methods but had employed the churchs funds to the amount of more than five thousand dollars and still all those pig headed niggers knew nothing of it its a great wonder they have anything they seem to know so little my company was up against it for what was due us but that was not the end of if on top of this what did that sinner do but write my name on a note for five thousand dollars and through his standing with the bank got the money and covered the shortage before those niggers ever knew there was any wasnt that the limit he was elected bishop and became the big nigger his great ambition had aspired to

i was too put out to do anything at once although the note came due before i was aware it had been given

the night i discovered it was one when i happened to be in my office alone i decided forthwith to place it in the hands of the law it was then that this daughter came to the office with a note from him asking for an appointment i have an idea he was only then aware that the note was due or past due she caught me as mad as a hornet and i told her the whole thing i shall not soon forget the expression on her face when i had told her she looked like she would die right there it was then too i saw how beautiful she was and so well formed suddenly a proposal entered my head i have always been impulsive but i have never been known to back up so i got up and stood before her and said my say she was terribly indignant and would have fled but i stood between her and the door i became mad to have that girl she fought me but i grew worse i finally said to her come with me to cincinnati and save your rotten sinning preacher father from the chain gang

a home it is up there with plenty of everything or fifteen years for your now bishop father on the worst chain gang in the world she regarded me wildly as the substance of it became clear to her oh i mean it i cried im going to send that dad of yours to the chain gang tomorrow âand you know what that means i think all the horror of it rose before her in that moment all the negroes spiteful envious creatures crying aw youre a big nigger huh your daddys a bishop and the next day umum what do you think of it a big bishop done foged a note and she had seen the chain gang all those stripes and chains frightened her she looked up at me with an appeal in her eyes that frightened meâ even then but i was too wild to have her at that moment to give heed and then she begged me to have mercy

she cried and beseechedâshe did everything and thenâ in the endâwell ill not soon forget those appeals im a nice girl can you not appreciate what that means

i willâto save my father and those little ones but before god hear him please see him i may be yours in body but never in soul whileâoh cant you see what you ask can you not see that you take everything i have lived for dont you see that when you rob a woman of her purity you have destroyed her womanhood

she fell on her face and sobbed until as i see it now i cant imagine how i could have acted so

and that is why jeff im going to hell yes to hell he was going now his eyes had a far away an unearthly expression but before he was gone he saidâand his voice seemed to come from another world as i held him im going jeff im going satans waiting for me and say jeff his voice now came in gasps and sounded as if from eternity i dont mind it so much no i dont jeff but the only thing and the last request of god is to be sure to send that old preacher down to meet me sometime with that his muscles relaxed a spasm contracted his form and he lay dead

the two were silent now outside a bird hopped about and finally lit on the window sill peering in as if to inquire the cause of the silence after a long time it seemed wyeth spoke

strange and didâyouâahâfulfill the request

yes said the other slowly i did at once and let me tell you my friend i will never forget that girls face oh ive seen many but this girls face told the story and her story was that of a pure girl a good girl who had made a sublime sacrifice was that sacrifice worth the cost again silence reigned supreme each with his thoughts

the birds outside made sweet music as they flitted happily about sidney wyeth was speaking again and his voice was from a distance as he said quietly what became of her

what became of her oh yes cried the other sitting up and shaking off his distraction as though he had been awakened from sleep why she left soon after came south and when i was on the way down here i chanced to stop over in a townâi wont mention the nameâbecause she was there was selling a book so i understood but was staying with the pastor of the presbyterian church and high in their favor i was glad to see it and never let on but there was a skunk aboard the same train from cincinnati and who stayed there

ive often thought about it since and i hope that devil never knew her and made trouble she was a good girl and still may be saved if things go along right

life is full of mysteries wyeth commented

sure is his companion replied and then became dreary as his mind wandered sadly solemnly back into the past suddenly he sat bolt upright saying i trust you and for that reason since i have told it to you i have a small picture that i found in the old mans effects and considered it good policy to remove so i have kept it and im going to show it to you

while the other fished away in an old trunk a strange thought came to sidney wyeth and he recalled singularly the effort for the y m c a in that town up the river and how twentyfive thousand dollars from a source that no one could explain was paid at almost the last minute  he was doing some thinking and had forgotten all about the other who had closed the trunk now and came before him with a small picture

he sat up quickly when the other touched him and held before his gaze the picture of mildred latham

and in that moment there came a vision of a dark dreary night when he hurried through the streets of cincinnati and came to a place where an old woman sat an evil hag and who regarded him with malicious eyesâ eyes that appeared to hate everyoneâand the words in reply to his request came back with a shock gwan

shes with her man

sidney continued to gaze at the picture there was profound silence for neither spoke one was not in the mood to do so the other could not he raised his hand mechanically to his head as though to rid his mind of some obstruction he tried to think coherently but his senses were confused

he turned staggered slightly groping as if blindly for support and passed on out into the open and under gods pure heavensâanywhere away from the stifling air inside and its hideous secret

sidney stood outside now and the spring sun beat upon his bare head as with his trembling hand he shaded his eyes and looked in the direction of the creole city

back there he would goâhe had to go he couldnt say whyâfeel whyânow for in the tangle of his confused thoughts nothing seemed clear but he would go back his hand sought his forehead again yes he would go back

let us go back to a night when the heroine of our story got up from a drunken stupor to find that the hour of fateâfate for the y m c a was at hand she had rushed breathlessly to the office of the western union and had secured the money that had been transferred at her request from the cincinnati bank some days before she had known when wilson jacobs returned unsuccessful in his attempt that some expedient was necessary

when she realized a year before that she was heiress to such a sum of money she had worried as to what she would do with it her conscience would never let her touch a penny of it for personal use it had been left on deposit and insofar as her daily life had been concerned she had about forgotten it until the climax of wilson jacobs great effort had stood like a spectre before her

for a time she had hesitated feeling that such money should not be used for christian purposes    but when she had awakened on that dreadful night she came at once to appreciate how through her and her alone this effort should be realized

so she rushed pell mell through the streets that led to wilson jacobs home as she hurried along visions of the great need passed fitfully through her mind she recalled all the crime she had witnessed thousands yearly herded on the gangs torn mothers prostituted sisters homes broken up by that demon of liquor she could see the condition which forced so many of her people to the belief that colored people could never be anything regardless as to how much they might try

race prejudice that demon of american society had succeeded in convincing so many of these weak people that there was no future that the only resort was to get all the excitement out of life that was possible how they conducted themselves to secure such a life was the one great detriment to the race to the city to the state and in the end to the united states

as she rushed along she could hear these poor creatures and the words they uttered when approached with offers for their salvation for in addition to the discouragement caused by race prejudice there was another feature that was worse stillâclass prejudice the folly of it

the effect was more damnable she knew than all the other causes for through it these poor creatures were made to feel that they were actually bad bad beyond redemption which made them unfit for the civilized world under this they fretted they grew likewise to hate and in the end to become not only a disgrace to the race community and state but even enemies to society

she recalled once a man a mulatto and obviously a pervert who answered a street preacher she could never seem to forget his words

you say he had said that i should get religion

and i say whats the use im a nigger and that means im a vagabond a castoff a thing to be hated condemned and persecuted you speak of brotherly love and the reward hereafter i laugh when you make such assertions heaven for a negro why do you suppose that even satan would care for him as to brotherly love why dont you go to the white man that keeps my sister why dont you tell that man what you preach about i am illegitimate my youngest sister the white mans mistress is too and so are all the rest then you speak of heaven and reward in the hereafter for negroes

the hereafter is the chain gang where my illegitimate brother is serving twenty years for murder as for me im going to a blind tiger and get a drink im going to get drunk the idea that a negro can be anything is a joke there may be a heaven for white people but for a negro oh you fool

as all this and other instances passed through her mind mildred became much excited then as the reality dawned upon her a picture of what that money could do became clear to her and with wilson jacobs as its secretary she presently came to feel that her sacrifice might be a blessing in disguise

on and on she hurried until at last she came to the house she paused at the gate and caught her breath

her thoughts were busy for a moment as she tried to formulate a plan to deliver the money without being caught she struggled nervously with first one plan and then another and then at last she boldly entered the gate and walked up to the front door as she reached to push the bell she looked through the glass door

wilson sat nodding in the study his position she saw was such that he could see the clock and watch the fatal moments pass it was then past eleven she could see the clock and realized what those moments meant

he had as she observed him fallen asleep from sheer fatigue as she watched him there came to her mind a bold idea and she put it into effect at once she tried the door fearing it might be locked but was relieved when it opened with a turn of the knob

she entered the house on tiptoe passed through the hall to the study which was to one side entered the room in which he sat and with breath held nerves tense she cautiously crossed to where he sat she slowly drew her breath when she saw he was sleeping peacefully she placed the package containing the price of her virtue upon the table she looked at him again and caught her breath in fear as he moved slightly but did not fully awaken

the next moment she stole her way to the door like a thief in the night and was outside she turned as she heard a sound and saw constance weary tired and apparently nervally exhausted come from the rear and enter the study she dared stand and watch her as she entered the study where her brother sat now fully awake but oblivious to the presence of the package he was watching the clock that was ticking away

with a catch of her breath she saw that constance had discovered the package and she saw them open it with curiosity she noted the look of intense joy as their eyes beheld the contents

as she was leaving these words floated out to her in the stillness of night go brother in gods name go

no one so far as we know guessed where the much needed money came from but strangely enough the giving had relieved the giver after she left the jacobs home she felt as she had never felt before and took life and what it brought very calmly as she passed along she looked with silent relief into the faces of those of her race who were persecuted on one hand by fear of the superior white and on the other by cast

at times she had regarded them as so many dogs lurking hungry dogs who wait until darkness sets in before lurking in the alleys and searching garbage cans expecting to be kicked or be killed upon discovery if for no other reason simply to give vent to a hatred they felt as she saw it that it was the lot of the negro to be hated they got no kindness they expected none they even scoffed when it was offered regarding it as some subtle means of inviting them to a worse fate and this was what discrimination and prejudice had brought them to

there still remained the dispensation no person in all the world she felt was so fitted for the task as wilson jacobs care of the building after its completion would itself be a problem then there was that distrust to dispell too often she knew that arrogance on the part of the leaders of these institutions had a tendency to keep away from their doors the very class whom they sought to attract unfortunately the negroes themselves realized that those conditions were true

wilson jacobs was not such a character she felt relieved as she realized this when she thought again of her people she appreciated what in time this genuine christianity of his would mean to them when they came to know him for the kind man he was her race was emotional superstitious but withal patriotic and enthusiastic nothing regardless of all she had seen could make her think otherwise and what could be the attitude of her race her brothers when they realized the efforts made in their behalf will they say you want to help me you really want to be a brother and take me into that place and help me to lead a good clean life and i doubted you i scorned your offer and cursed you and all society oh merciful god but i knew not what i did and you say that i am not bad that i never was bad that i was merely weakâweak as other human beings were can all this be true i can hardly realize it i have never known kindness i have always been told that life held no future for me a negro that by the will of our creator i was born to be hated hunted and abused a creature of no destiny a thing to be spat upon and made a slave of a creature without morals you say that all this was wrong and that i can be not only a good person but an example for the good of others that i am after all only the victim of circumstances

wilson jacobs would convince them and when this was done her reward would come

mildred ive come back

it seemed a long way back to the city as though he would never get there and the train crept slowly along through the mighty swamps but all the way his mind was busy thought after thought came and went but only one became fixed i love her he cried again and again i love her he exclaimed feverishly nothing else mattersânothing else can matter now

he was going to her just as fast as the slow train would carry him and when he arrivedâbeyond those conflicting moments he got no further

he lay back in his seat after a spell and calmed himself to a degree that he could see it all clearly he wanted to see her now he wanted to look deep into the eyes that he was sure must be tired he wanted to see behind those mirrors and to do his share to relieve the turmoil within after a time his return to the office after his illness recurred to him he had found a letter from the publisher and upon opening it he had found it to contain a draft for a large sum of money he didnt know then who had sold the book with so much success to him and he had wondered strange but it had not occurred to him then that it was she but now it was all clearâ everything

and it was mildred all the while he exclaimed in a controlled voice despite the excitement it gave him

how could i have misunderstood so long and then the instance of the five thousand dollars came back to him and the sale of his work as he had left it true he had given this all over to her but the fact to be reckoned with was that she had succeeded where he had not   

she had done this without any thought of herself

no girl with so much ability with such constructive thoughts would have done as she had for others unless inspired by some divine sacrifice

it was all clear to him now and then the other   

in all his life virtue in women had been his highest regard during the months he spent in the south he had seen immorality of a nature that was revolting to his finer senses it had been the custom since the landing of negroes in this country and was in evidence every where in the many colors that made up his people but in spite of this his high regard for the virtuous woman remained the same so when the words of the hag came back to him amid all the good things he was thinking of her for a time all was swept from him in a wave of revolt    how could he be blind henceforth to that

he became weak and listless for a time to pass on through the city to catch one of the ocean goers that he was often interested in observing at the harbor and go to argentina brazilâanywhere and forget it all and then there came to him the thought of his people all that he had lived through when he saw the leaders with their selfishness the neglect of their christian duty how he had written of that selfishness fearlessly with jaws set and soul on fire and of the reign of excitement that followedâit was impossible to further contemplate other plans

and amid all the chaos there came to him thoughts of the success of the christian forward movement in the town up the river with success there in the worst of two towns in the world it was now an almost foregone conclusion that shortly the spirit would prevail successfully in other towns yes it would have to the public for its own welfare would soon come to appreciate what such a movement meant to twofifths of its population

and how came this to be would the people of that town up the river now have a beautiful building in course of construction if it had been left to them to supply that fatal twentyfive thousand great god he murmured how can i how can i

and as the train continued on its way over innumerable trestles with lagoons and marshes everywhere it occurred to him that the one who had made all this possible and who at the price of purity which was a womans all was now and for the sake of it homeless and friendless    even that family that bishop father surrounded by thousands of hero worshippers with his picture decorating the walls of thousands of homes and pointed to by day would scorn her the thousands of young men respectable but poor and who for this girls sacrifice were given a great chance to conduct their future lives along christian lines even they would scorn her all decent and respecting society would scorn her

they would have to scorn her he himself had already scorned her

he allowed his gaze to wander beyond the waters of a lagoon until it rested upon a clump of trees that rose ragged in the background he was too torn with anguish to think for a time what price had been put upon virtue for his peopleâand her peopleâwas too great to estimate but behind it all was a homeless friendless loveless little girl drifting about in the world for mildred latham as he saw her again was a mere girl not yet twentytwo she had a heart but what kind of a heart must she have after the suffering she had endured

yet she was a human being with a human desire after all

what he had seen in her eyes in cincinnati that pain and at times that wild elfinlike mad desire    and oh that caress that one kiss that seemed to have penetrated her very soul the look she had given him that weak protest afterward united in its pathetic appeal for mercy    she had been his dream his mad desire

he had declared then that he would help to dispell that worry he had felt himself courageous enough to do so too but now before him was the test and he was weakening under it

back in the rosebud country he had lived alone for years and during those long days his greatest desire his greatest hope had been to love to have that love returned by his ideal of womanhood he dismissed what had followed the other had not even courage enough to accept graciously what he had worked for any woman can to a degree mould the future of her husband no man he knew could be oblivious to the condition of his household and that which made it that part of his life however had long since been a closed chapter his great effort had been to forget it and he had succeeded to such a degree that he was able to concentrate his mind on other things but now it was different because with the exception of the one thing mildred latham was more than his picture his ideal but that one thing was the silent barrier

it was springtime now and back in the rosebud country all must be busy he thought of the years and how busy he was at this time and hopeful because whether the season proved successful or not springtime when the crops were planted was always a hopeful time every farmer believed as he planted his seed that the season would be successful and now he was not there to plant the crops he had not been there the year before but as he continued to recall the past he knew that it had never occurred to him that he would have been anywhere else but there he wanted to be there but financially he couldnt afford to be there any more

after an interminable spell of mental depression something came to his mind it entered slowly but at last took shape he whispered after a time yes yes i could with that amount i could start all over again  

and out there no one would know no one would need to know    just being there with the right to continue as i once was but with a terrible experience to remind me of what it is all worthâit would not be the same now

he saw her now differently that other side was passing it would come backâit would keep coming back but it was his duty it was his futureâit was his very life to crush it as often as it came up but that was not the half of it mildred latham was homeless and friendless as we know after what she had done for so many others was it not christianlike to think of her 

and now he had another thought yes back in the rosebud country it would be possible for two people to be happy people who had no other hope no other ambition but to follow the pursuit of happiness and labor

as it became clearer he realized that he had never cared for conventionality that other experience had thrust it upon him and when he showed his dislike for it he had been tortured it would be differentânow

mildred latham would not care for any thing but himself and that which would make him happy    and he his experience had been too real and too bitter not to appreciate what kindness sincerity and courage in ones convictions means in future happiness

the train stood in the station now and all the other passengers had left the cars he came out of his revery with a start and hastily collecting his luggage he rushed forth and caught a car that took him within a block of his office he deposited his grips in a cafe he knew and a few minutes later he stood in the doorway

it was late in the afternoon and nearly everyone in the building had left for home but she was there curiously he had felt that she would be there with the amount of business he had seen she had created he was certain that he would find her and he did

she sat at the desk as she had the afternoon he had returned from the hospital she was working away and he saw her before she noticed him when she did she gave a start opened her mouth and then as if she thought of something closed it slowly fumbled her pen but said nothing

he paused briefly and observed her and as he did so took note of the fact that she had lowered her head

and he knew it was in shame strangely now since she knew that he was aware of at least a part of the past she could not endure to have him look at her but in these moments sidney wyeth was not observing her in scorn as her colored cheeks gave evidence

mildred sat still and waited she expected to be scorned she had come to a place in life where she expected anything he might rebuke her and she would say nothing but intuitively she had never felt he would rebuke her as she sat with drooped head he saw one tear drop unchecked upon her lap no others followed but he knew the time had come to go to this girl she had endured a hard lot not one person in a thousand would have gone through what she had but human endurance wrestling with all lifes vicissitudes has a limit how much it cost that one tear he could not fully estimate but if he knew life if some one didnt come to mildred lathams rescue soon she might become anything not far from where she sat a thousand or more women were burning their souls in hell and all those women were thereânot by preference but because they were simply human beings and weak

he approached and a moment later stood near her while her finger toyed with the pen she had as he noticed now grown stouter since he knew her in cincinnati her hair covered her head and was beautiful to his eyes while her skin appeared somewhat darker he paused as one at a loss how to begin because he had so much he then wished to say presently he found his voice and his excitement was controlled as he spoke her name mildred said he she heard him but did not reply

so he repeated mildred ive come back he paused again and the room was silent she did not answer him and he did not expect her to presently he said it over again yes ive come back  i was away i was off in one of the parishes one of the most remote for when i left i wanted to be away away from everybody   

but it happened out there that i met a man mildred

i met a man    and he told me a story a long story 

what he told me concerned somethingâsomething i will not tell and somebody i will not mention but what he told me cleared the horizon    and thats why i came back on the way i faltered i weakened for a time i thought once of not stopping i started to go on and on and on maybe never stop but when i thought again and again and kept on thinking i couldnt i couldnt because well after all i wanted to stop

so i stopped mildred and then i came here here âand to you  i have come back mildred and to you are you glad ive come back mildred he paused and listened though he did not expect her to answer

she remained as she was and silent

on the way back i thought of you of nothing else no one else but you my thoughts went back to our acquaintance in cincinnati and the day we danced and iâiâkissed you mildred he paused again and gazed out over the rows of buildings below and then i realized what has been wrong with me every since and all my life  it was because i have been hungry i have been starving to death these many years for love mildred love and understanding i am still hungry and thirsty but at last a hope has come to me a hope that it will not long continue as it has these many years

but withal i have thought of something else too and that is i want to go home i want to go home to stay

i dont like it here idont like it anywhere but in the rosebud country 

the rosebud country she echoed sitting erect and turning slightly

yes mildred the rosebud country he paused again and the ticking of his watch was quite audible to both yes he said presently and after a time in which he seemed to be engaged in deep thought he resumed and i was going to say that i have decided to go back he moved and stood beside her the sinking sun now played a last evening ray across her face and in turning from it she happened to look up and into his face he saw her now as he had never seen her before

something she saw caused her to catch her breath and venture another look his eyes appeared to see something far away and she continued to stare at him

yes mildred he started again and now his voice became low and strange she understood and knew that he was living in the past oblivious to her presence

she listened with a strange rapture ive decided to go back to that land beyond the big muddy back to that little reservation the name of which i love but mildred it depends he halted and looked down into her face their eyes met now and both seemed hypnotized for they continued to stare at each other becoming more enraptured it depends said he very slowly upon you she looked away but he reached and caught her hand he backed up until he reached the desk upon which he seated himself he looked at her now pleadingly she gave one glance and caught the same look she had seen but once before more than a year before and before he knew he pulled her gently from the chair and placed her beside him on the desk

it depends upon you mildred and still she said nothing

 out there mildred i longed for you yes it was you you these many years i waited for you at last i have found you oh i have found you the one woman

and now he said this in a strong voice im through

im through and ready to go back if you will go with me

do you hear i mean that i love you mildred love you with all the passion of a hungry heart he paused again

and you have had a hard time little girl oh youve had a hard time i know but its all over now dear

yes its all over now there is no society that we are under obligation to there are no pretentious persons to make us false to our convictions there is nothing but impulse to direct us

oh sidney he heard her say with a slight tremble

his arm stole about her waist and she did not remove it

she looked up into his eyes and saw him with trust

and youll go he said and waited

 do you mean it sidney oh sidney do you mean it

her voice now was low strained strangely wistful and then as if suddenly remembering something she had apparently forgotten her eyes took on an expression of mute appeal like that of a hunted animal her form became tense while a spasm of agony contracted her features as she moaned no no no i can not oh i will not and before he could quite understand her sudden rebellion she rushed from the room and into the hall and soon her rapid footsteps died away in the distance

he stood as she had left him not comprehending that she had gone am i awake he whispered dreamily putting his hands together and gazing at them stupidly as if to assure himself they were his own she has gone

gone gone mildredâbutâwhy he felt sadly weak for the strain was beginning to tell upon him

in a half stupor he finally found a seat in the office chair and mechanically let his gaze wander out over the city after a time it rested upon a street that led down to the wide thoroughfare his eye soon caught sight of a figure hurrying along the walk he leaned forward and observed it carefully and when it reached another street he made out that it was mildred he watched her as she crossed quickly to the center where a car was moving and boarded it in a moment it had disappeared down the street

the slave market days passed and still he waited still he watched and still he listened but in vain and always he moved about distractedly he had no plans he had no hopes now but was simply moving in a circle at times he would utter stupidly  where is she where is mildred 

and after that he would become silent he would be thinkingâyes always thinking

he ransacked the office he made inquiries to ascertain where she stayedâbut in vain he knew not how to look for her he knew not where to begin but the work in the officeâthe result of her abilityâcontinued to increase mail was brought four times a day and in each letters from far and near would contain money orders express checks cheerful letters and still orders for more books but they gave him no cheer notwithstanding he mechanically went about the work with the system he saw she had created

and as the days went by he grew more anxious more worried in regard to her fate and he grew determined to find her if he could

poor little girl poor little mildred why has she done all this and she is alone somewhereâalways aloneâand i know not where

there came a day when he felt he could stand it no longer

he took a walk he knew not where it led to possibly it led nowhere yet he felt he must walk not in the direction he was accustomed to go to the river where he had wandered many a night and observed the mighty ocean liners receiving and discharging their cargoes or where on the deck of packets he listened to steam calliopes but in a direction he had never gone before

it was in one of the creole citys narrow ways where he presently found himself sidney strolled along oblivious to all whereabouts and found that this part of the city was much unlike any part he had known

he felt as one in a strange land to be sure on all sides he was greeted by little low houses opening into the narrow streets peculiar people moved about and spoke in a tongue he could not understand but he knew it was creole they were quieter than those in the neighborhood he lived and he understood they were all catholics he had been told and obeyed the priest

he was glad of it he wished all his race would obey something other than their animal instincts

he paused at last before a statue in a small square

four rows of buildings faced it on that many sides

only one side confronted him however and to this he finally went he stopped before a large church a cathedral and read that it had been built almost two hundred years before next to the church was the museum

curious and for a time forgetting his troubles he wandered in he went up a winding stairway to the second floor as he passed upward great oil paintings greeted him all old this he saw for under many were inscriptions showing that many had been painted more than a hundred years ago while he had never studied this art he readily appreciated that many were wonderful elegant ladies gazed at him from the frames their eyes following him strangely out of sight for no matter where he stood whether in front or from either side they seemed to scrutinize him

he passed into the museum and began to examine through the glass cases relics of another day that the city was old was shown by the age of papers and documents of numerous mention pictures of fond old mammies gray and whitehaired old uncles grand dames such as dixie had seen caught his attention everywhere

an old old man scion of a decayed aristocracy sat in a chair within this art room and sidney approached him

have you said he any record of the sale of slaves in this museum the other pointed to a room wyeth had not observed but spoke no word

wyeth wandered into it and his gaze immediately encountered what he was curious to see

know all men by these presents being the last will and testament of joan becuare

to my wife and life companion i do bequeath to thee all i have after death towit one thousand acres of land in caddo parish unencumbered

one hundred niggers of various ages and the following description one mammy age eighty a better wench never lived name diana

one uncle eightyseven beloved servant of his master and faithful ever name joe

one wench twentytwo robust healthy a good servant of the house name martha

and so on the description ran which seemed strange and unnecessary in a will then he recalled the sentiment of the southerner

in still another case he read a sale bill written in long hand with an artistic flourish having sold my plantation i will hereby sell to the highest bidder at public auction the following named property towit one nigger wench sixteen years hail and hearty promises to be a good breeder and is now with child by ditto a young nigger strong as a lion healthy and a good worker not sassy

one nigger wench twentythree name mandy

this is the most attractive wench in gretna parish

she is expecting a third child soon

wyeth wondered why the father was not mentioned

and then he thought of something and knew    his own father was the son of a master

he read other such documents and then observed that almost all sales were recorded to be held at the slave market after an hour or more he passed out

he went up a street which was narrowâlike all those in the old section of the city and walked on whither he had no idea not far away he could see the river and many great vessels moving up and down

just ahead of him appeared an odd long twostory building the first glance revealed that once upon a time it had been a grand affair wonder what it was

he muttered idly

and now he came up to it and paused near one end

he viewed it many minutes curiously from across the street but he could not make out what it had been

as he saw it now it was evident that it had been empty for many many years

presently he crossed to where a door greeted him only to find when he had come to it that it was bolted from the inside while the heavy iron knob was rusted until it was hardly recognizable he glanced up and straining his eyes he read an inscription over the door st louisâroyal hotel slave market so this is the place he whispered observing everything before him now with a new interest herein were sold in the days of old hundredsâaye thousands of my people he passed to the street upon which the hotel faced for a block and walked down this observing the decaying structure with greater curiosity the entire building was apparently empty a porch supported by massive iron pillars reached over the walk the entire length of the building the large windows of the second story were without glass and gaped darkly seeming to tell a story which he would like to have known the lower floor had evidently been given over to business purposes judging from the wide windows that now were boarded over with twoinch planks all this was decorated with stage announcements

when he reached the other end there was an opening the door was to one side and more curious now than ever he paused and gazed into the dark interior soon he passed within the place seemed almost as dark as a dungeon at first and he stood for a minute until he had become accustomed to it he passed into the interior and finally came into a room that was perfectly round an arch chamber or what he conjectured

out of the gloom a block arose something about it attracted him and he crossed to where it was fitted into the wall at one side he now read sheriffs desk

on the other side he read clerk and now he looked at the block and knew that it was on this his people had been soldâat auction he closed his eyes for a time and allowed his thoughtsâhis imaginationâto go back into the past when rich planters grand ladies and harsh overseers once held sway and before him rose a picture

hear me the auctioneer i now offer the best nigger that ever held a plow a good strong rascal that is worthâhow much am i offered to start him

how much am i offered to start him five hundred

who is insane or jokes five hundred for a nigger like this nonsense now here come forward and feel this niggers muscles examine his teeth strike his breast

and to emphasize his good robust property he struck the slave a resounding lick across the breast that would have knocked over half the people before him wyeth could seem to see the man the black man merely smile at all the faces about him

and now i am going to offer you something that will arouse you bring forward the wench the pretty young wench

a young mulatto negress now stood before the crowd

a stirring a collecting near the front a crowding about the block some almost getting upon it in their excitement a murmur went the rounds and words could be heard id like to own her there was a consulting of bank books a figuring of credit and then the auctioneers voice was heard again

look at er look at er ha a fine one eh yes a fine one    look at her form    look at her face

here bright eyes hold up hold up and let the boys see what i have got    what am i bid



say the man that made that bid ought to be hung a thousand dollars for a wench like this why by all the pious gods she is worth that for a year  









ah sir said someone and wyeth cameback to the present to look down upon and old whitehaired woman who was standing observing him from the doorway

he bowed apologetically got down and went toward her

i have charge of the building said she speaking in a little strained voice would you not like to view the interior

i should like to i am sure he replied

he followed her back to the door through which he had entered and up a flight of winding iron stairs to the next floor even these he saw had once been most magnificent his guide offered no comment but caught her breath in gasps as she ascended when the landing had been reached both paused for breath while wyeths attention was immediately caught by the decaying grandeur that was evident all about him

wonderful he said at last in a low respectful voice and as though he feared to disturb some of those grand persons that once had frequented it

wonderful you say echoed the woman and regarded him out of small sharp eyes

magnificent

and be you a stranger in the city she now asked

yes

and from where do you come

the great northwest dakota

ah dakotaâmm that is far far away

yes far far away

i have never been there i have never been anywhere but have always lived here in bienville parish

i was born here a creole

they now walked down the wide hall and where he gazed into the deserted rooms on either side all of which revealed a once greatsplendor

here she said is a room that once played a conspicuous part in the old south she led him then into a large room much larger than any other in the building it was a round room and he could see that it had been made to be used for convention purposes

she was explaining

it was once used as a temporary capitol and later as a rendezvous for secessionists and still later after the war sheridan made a raid and arrested many conspirators

i suppose said sidney that this place has seen many grand occasions

ah indeed it has all the aristocrats of the southland always stopped here as well as counts and dukes and lords and great ladies and still from south america and mexico the best people stopped here

they passed out of the room across the hallway and entered another room that was furnished i live here

said the woman to his surprise

hereâalone

she nodded yes alone for many years

he understood now and running his hands into his pockets he pulled forth a half dollar and handed it to her she accepted it with many thanks and gave him then some pictures and relics

i suppose you have many visitorsâtourists he inquired starting toward the door

well no i do not she said somewhat regretfully

the people do not seem to wander down into this section they do not appear curious for relics as they used to be

thats too badâfor you he said kindly

 it is since i am old and have no other way of getting my living and she sighed

how old are you

eightynine

and you have noâno children he asked now with curious interest

none and thatâand that perhaps is why im like i am today 

wyeth listened kindly patiently the other appeared sad and reminiscent

no i shall never seem to get over it either i am the last of a family that came here from france many many years agoâtwo hundred to be exact for many years we were the richest family in bienville parish and perhaps almost as rich as any other in the state

we owned land and slaves until we could hardly count them of course the war meantâyou can understand what we lost with the freedom of the blacks but after that we were still immensely rich but somehow a curse seemed to come over the family no boy babies were born to any the girls became subject to consumption until all had died but myself then i married

my husband was spanish and french very affectionate and was good to me and we were hopeful and happyâ until i bore him no offspring he grew crabbed nervous and impatient

before long i came to see that he was intimate elsewhere he began to drink to gamble and to carouse

he stayed out until all hours of the night and then he got so he would not come home at all for days i would not see him and then for weeks she paused long enough now to wipe a tear i began to fear for him for i recalled that his ancestors had come to abrupt ends and i worried because i could bear him no children i gave him freely of the fortune that was left to me

he ran through with his and then with mine she was weeping quietly now and he felt inclined to comfort her but did not know how

after a time she was calm again she took a seat by the window and gazed with a tired expression out into the street while he waited well she resumed they brought him home one day dead and i have been alone since

too bad said wyeth and shifted about listening for more for carefully observant he saw that she was not through

one day there came a woman an attractive colored woman with large eyes and the most beautiful hair and skin and form i had ever i think seen she led a little boy by the hand and when he looked up at me i screamed i knew then and didnt have to be told that he was my husbands son

strangely i was happy to know that my good husbandâfor he had been good in the beginningâhad left his name somewhat cheered me and we agreed to educate and give him a chance

we placed him later at my expense in a good school and he grew to be a handsome brighteyed young man

i watched him however with a slight fearâfor i remembered but he made a man of himself a successful man and with the last few thousands i could gather i helped to start him in business and in due time he had made a name that was an envy he became the owner of much of the best property in the city land in the northern part of the state and in the end married one of the wealthiest and most attractive girls in the town she paused again and wyeth listened without a word

something remained yet to be told   

the woman was speaking again

yes he grew to success and happinessâand then well something happened

something happened wyeth echoed

yes something happened she was silent now and gazed again out of the window

heredity

heredity and still he did not understand he could not be patient longer who was this manâthat is ahâwhat was his name i dont think i ever heard of himâa colored man

she looked straight at him now without a change of expression and answered he was not colored

not colored

i should have said she corrected that he didnt go as colored  he passed for white

oh   

but that was not itâheredity

wyeth said nothing

he ran around he took up drinkâand then he wantedâcolored women

after this both were silent for a long time but wyeth was thinking he was hearing over again what he had heard beforeâmany times colored ivomen in dixie he felt that if he could keep his ears deaf to hearing of white menâand those who passed for whiteâwantingâand havingâcolored women he could he possibly might like the country but everywhere he had heard this the woman broke the silence

this city is possessed with that desire have you observed itâeverywhere you might chance to look you will see it

he sighed she looked at him again and then became silent

across the way a large municipal building rose far above st louisâroyal hotelâslave market through the window from where they sat busy clerks worked away over books when their eyes glanced to the street it was broken with automobiles and busy people hurrying to and fro

i have a visitor he heard the woman say she is a sweet kind but sad sort of girl she has been to see me several times of late and i have been talking religion with her in all my days no human being has interested me as she has i love her and while i cant object i regret to feel in some way that she is going to enter the convent and become a sister

are you a catholic

all french are catholic she answered

then you perforce sanction this intention of your girl friend

yes i do but oh how much i shall miss her

will she enter soon

very soon

have you known her long

a few months but it seems i have known her all my life

is sheâwhat is she colored or white he asked

colored

indeed her name

i have it but i forget i call her always little sister

have her picture and will let you see it she had it taken a few days ago out there on that grass plot

and she pointed to the yard of the municipal building

she was a few minutes finding the picture and then wyeth was overcome by a strange feeling with regard to what he had heard a girl  sad  going to enter a convent    who was this girl who who who

here is her picture said the woman

he took it and saw mildred smiling up at him

restitution

i had to cried mildred bewilderingly as she hurried hatless breathless along the walk when she left her lover so abruptly she was distracted she was not fully aware of what she said all she knew was that at the most supreme moment of her existence she had broken away from the one she loved and for whom she would have been willing to die but to marry him at last she felt she could not conscientiously do oh but it was manly kindlysublime his offer and how i love him for it she whispered i know he will forgive me he will remember me kindly he will never forget me and my love for himâbut to go to him and make him suffer with the thought of the pastânever

she slowed down as she neared the wide street that crossed just ahead of her she crossed the walk to the center of the street where a car was coming and caught it once inside and seated she lay back and became for a time dully listless presently she saw the river just ahead and when the car slowed down she left it crossed to the ferry and went aboard a half hour later she was in her room

her sister greeted her pleasantly from the garden which aroused her emotion to such a degree that she choked slightly in order to hold back words she had long wished to say

when alone at last in her room she lay across the bed and gave up to the feeling of inertia that had taken possession of her

all that day she remained so she could scarcely collect her wits again and again the events connected with his return flew through her dull sluggish mind and at last to relieve it she dressed in a cool thin dress and went for a walk down by the river front

she passed many docks where not so many steamers lay at anchor as she had once noticed she wondered why since she had observed the falling off of traffic

then she thought about the bloodshed that was going on each day across the water she soon came abreast of a wharf where more than a score of great ocean goers were anchored no smoke came from their funnels no men worked away on their decks in fact they were as silent as the grave their dark hulls casting a dull shadow above the water she wandered down the board platform and studied them idly then she read painted on their sterns names with bremen and hamburg as their port    her thoughts again reverted to the carnage across the waters

she found the street again and wandered aimlessly along the sidewalk suddenly she halted and strained her ears as a sound came to her from some distance

she listened and then looked up and across the river where the creole city stretched apparently endless before her she observed in doing so for the first time that the river curved in such a manner as to form a perfect crescent at this point and although her thoughts were confused she did not fail to appreciate the beauty of it

her gaze had found the place from whence came the sound that had halted her it was the bell of a church vibrating through the still evening air the steeple in which it was mounted raised far into the air above the buildings about it and she watched it with growing reverence as she continued to stare at it it seemed to outline a mighty sepulchre and she fell to speculating about it she was familiar with it in a measure and recalled as she found herself wandering vaguely along a few moments later that she used to pass it each day

it was when he lay ill at the hospital that it was near

it was called st catherine she had happily observed that may little colored children went to it each day and sunday their training she had observed was very different from the denominations with which she was acquainted she had stopped before its steeple the first time one day toward the close of sidneys recovery

the next day she had entered it and wandered down its carpeted aisles she had gone up to the front before she realized that any one was in the church and then a sister came from an alcove or from some place but she could not imagine where

she had halted embarrassed but the other smiled upon her so pleasantly that her confidence was won in a moment

mildred recalled itâthe meetingâstrangely today

she wondered what the life of a sister was like she had guessed what it meant    she had almost forgotten the sister until she went her way this day when the lot of those patient souls came to her mind again

she reached a street presently where two wide walkways intersected and when she reached the center of the intersection something gripped her and she stopped quickly catching her breath she continued to stand thus but with eyes widening nerves tense and then she uttered beneath her breath why not yes why not why why why then completely absorbed in the idea which had suddenly come to her offering as she felt it now a solution of her life she turned on her heel and retraced her steps homeward

and all the way she kept saying to herself why not why why

she hesitated at the gate and again there came to her ears from across the river the chime of the bell on st

catherine it echoed softly and vibrating it touched her soul to its depths she stood at last transformed

as it continued to float across to her she seemed to translate come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i will give thee rest

when she entered the house her head hung with eyes cast down she had decided to become a sister

there came a day bright clear and slightly breezy but withal invigorating and she went to visit the old woman who lived alone in the deserted st louisâroyal hotel she had no tremors because it had been the place where once her people were sold by thousands

she had met the old woman on one of her frequent pilgrimages alone in the creole city and had become strangely fond of her mildred had on more than one occasion felt constrained to tell her the story  so today she came quietly upon the old soul sitting by the window with the light streaming in upon her faded hair and features

you come today little sister i am always so glad to see you

mildred returned the greeting kindly and pleasantly and sank into the proffered chair she had told the other of her intentions but offered no reason for her decision she asked today that the other bless her which was done they sat afterward in mutual silence

presently however the other broke it

a young man was here yesterday a strange kind forgiving sort of fellow he aroused me in a way he brought back by his presence memories and i dont know why but i told him my story  he listened so patiently so kindly and with such sympathy i do declare that i wept

a young man aâ

a young colored man from away off in the great northwest

sidney oh sidney mildred breathed unheard

and do you know dear little sister i thought of you almost all the time he listened and was near me   

i dont know why i cannot imagine predestination in a large sense but in some way i felt he suffered she paused and mildred swallowed after a time she said in a small voice i guess ill go now

the other did not detain her though she wished she would never leave but followed her out of the silent old place down to the street and watched her out of sight

she passed through one of the narrow streets to the banking section of the city entered the one where sidneys respectful i know    this was all he said but the hungry look in his eyes told all else   

she halted before him without any undue excitement in her manner but her eyes were downcast she recalled even now that she had never been able to return his piercing gaze she kept her head bent with her small hands folded before her but listened with something akin to a heavenly rapture he was speaking again

i am not going to infringe upon your liberty by asking you to give up what is your intention ive come mildred just to seeâto look into your eyes once more before you go your way    that is all i ask

you will grant me that wont you mildred they stood facing each other only a few feet apart he held his hat crushed in his hand while she did not release her grip on the cross she held he watched her as she slowly raised her head as her eyebrows came slowly into view and then at last her eyes    they looked into his now his looked into hers slowly they spokeâboth pairs of eyes no words passed their lips but each could seem to hear a soul within crying restitution

restitution

how long they stood thus they did not know but after a time something seemed to break the spell perhaps it was the departed souls they knew not were not even aware of what was passing still the eyes of each hypnotic struggling with the fire of incarnation slowly drew them nearer they were at last near each other their breaths came in strange tender gasps

their eyes continued to see and regard each other in that heavenly rapture and still no word was spoken

his hands seemed to find hers and the cross they gathered them and held them fast while out of her ethereal eyes he saw a divine glory never to be forgotten then his left arm rose it slowly encircled her form they heard now each others heart and then something else seemed to guide him his head went down while his eyes still looked into mildreds with that peculiar enchantment he placed his cheek against hers with gentleness and reverence

when the goodfather came again into the church he paused as he watched a couple pass slowly down the aisle they were a man and a woman his arm rested about the slender shoulders of his companion with great tenderness

so together they went to that land in the west
