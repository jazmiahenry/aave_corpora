a new student

but let my due feet never fail to walk the studious cloysters pale

with distressing frequency the gentle tall thin pale greeklooking professor of greek in norwalk college for colored men was writing a gooseegg opposite my name in his grade book i can see him now part that flowing saltandpepper beard from thin sensitive lips and calmly say mr wade will please recite yes and i can see myself rise and simply flounder because i had no text book when i joseph wade heard that the truant xenophon long before ordered was at last in the express office i made tracks to get it pretty deep tracks they were too i had to flounder through a twofoot january snow from norwalk college to the depot a half mile from the campus

i had secured the greek book and was about to return to the college when the afternoon train arriving left on the platform something that interested me far more than the historians time honored expedition of the ten thousand greeks or yet his recollections of the immortal sage who on charge of corrupting athenian youths was condemned to drink the fatal hemlock

the new student augustus fairfax was that something my risibles were touched by the contrast between his appearance and highsounding name augustus fairfax he was smoothblack tall and thinâeven to gauntness as nervously restless was he as a blooded racer he wore a soft black hat creased in the middle perched jauntily on the side of a large closecropped shapely head though he had on a cheap countrystore suit whose pant legs were stuffed in the tops of coarse oxhide boots acres too large for him yet he was in the glory of a ruffled bosom shirt with gold studs in it

my face was s aight but i could not keep my heart from laughing at fairfax though it became apparent to me as i panted to keep pace with his rapid strides that he was simply green not dull i learned from him before we reached the campus that he was born of slave parents brought north a child soon after the war  reared on a farm in an adjoining county whence three winter months in each year he had been sent to the excellent district school where the color line was not drawn and where he had made good progress in his studies

a crowd hides some natures fairfaxs however was such that he could not but impinge himself on notice his induction into the student body served to manifest what an original wideawake funloving fellow he was

one effect of his impigning himself on the notice of the student body was that he became the college butt of fun and was thought to be very light hearted because he seemed so amusing but there was not a more soberheaded man in norwalk than this youth at whose sayings and doings the college roared

because the present was new and the future bright fairfax was hopeful though not so light hearted as he seemed comical

fairfaxs race are americas butt of fun they too are thought to be very light hearted because they seem amusing but while the black man is hopeful because his present is new and his future full of promise yet it is a grave mistake to imagine that the child of ham feels free of care because to his brother in white he seems amusing

without a name

a youth to fortune and to fame unknown

the winter of  the one that fairfax entered norwalk witnessed a great religious awakening among the students in this revival one of the most active and efficient studentworkers was my classmate and friend david j holt the only candidate for the ministry in our class and at this time probably the most influential student in norwalk

there were reasons why he was so influential here are some of them he was a fine mind a hard successful student a man of deep piety yet withal one of the most chummy fellows and greatest athletic enthusiasts in school of fine physique and presence the usual height and weight chestnut colored with silky brown hair and open honest dark hazel eyes no one studied played ball and did christian work with more energy than did the only candidate for the ministry in our class then too holt had seen more of life than many of his schoolmates years before he had been in norwalks course but for lack of funds had fallen out and despairing of being able to resume his studies had married his wife however had died with their first child julia now just in her teens with his handsome second wife and julia an unusually bright and attractive girl he was now living in a cottage that faced the beautiful campus holt and his wife were about the same color and had hair the same color and texture julia however was a shade darker than they but was brownhaired and frankeyed as her father

the holt home was a sort of mecca for the students fairfax took quite a fancy to holt and myself probably because we were disposed to see him have fair play against a set of fellows who liked to amuse themselves by teasing the young rustic he was a pureminded youth and withal full of innocent fun and therefore was quite welcome at holts home and consequently found his way there quite frequently

the young mans partiality for holt and this welcome in the home of the influential student made the latter instrumental in leading fairfax to the cross

i was too sick to be out of my room the night our quasiward found peace my friend however detailed to me the circumstances after prayermeeting the zealous christian worker had gone to the young inquirers room and talked and prayed with him i had got home and was getting my next days lesson so holt told me afterwards when someone came thundering at the front door when i opened it in burst fairfax like a storm catching me around the waist crying rapturously with eyes like stars  oh mr holt im so happy ive found him  

holt and his wife so he told me wept in sympathy with the young converts joy what seemed singular to the father is the fact that julia though not a professing christian was likewise moved to tears with fairfax

his conversion was an event for natures such as his do nothing by halves he became a city set on a hill that cannot be hid but his triumphant demonstrative zeal while delightful to the earnest was to another set of students simply amusing nor was it long in consequence of the attitude of these before clouds obscured the sun in the young converts sky

this came to pass about three weeks after fairfax made a profession he came into my room in great distress one night i had just finished my lessons for next day and was about to turn aside to shorthand in which i was taking private instruction a matter i had heard about brought him to my room

it seems that the day before the young man whose duty it was to distribute the mail to the students in their rooms undertook to have some fun with fairfax the said mailagent arriving at the country youths room door said waving a letter tauntingly before fairfaxs face here is a letter for abraham lincoln i guess you are the railsplitter the impetuous young rustic had snatched the letter slammed and locked the door in his tormentors face before that worthy realized exactly what had happened

at first he supposed fairfax had snatched the missive in either pique or fun but notwithstanding the mailagents most vehement remonstrances the new convert refused to give up the letter as a last resort the affair was reported to the president dr f r dale

the distressed young man came to me why havent you been over to see dr dale i asked him

because was his sheepish reply i imagined my voice betrayed the annoyance i felt over his conduct as i said it looks pretty uglyâyour opening and keeping mail thats not yours

i turned my back on him to go on with my work he was sitting in awkward silenceâhis hat between his kneesâlooking like a criminal in a voice that smote me to the heart for my harshness he broke the long painful silence mr wade thats why i am here i came to get you to go over to dr dales with me

i relented and agreed to go norwalk had got used to my scribbling shorthand in season and out in fact dr dale encouraged me to do this so he thought nothing of seeing me draw out my tablet and take shorthand notes of the interview between himself and fairfax

dr f r date ruddy well proportioned stood six feet in his socks a once black but now mixed patriarchal beard swept to his waist overflowing the immaculate shirt bosom that a lowcut broadcloth vest revealed

a figured studyrobe flowed to his heels while on his once raven now mixed abundant locks perched crownlike a study cap above an open ample brow and eyes keen but kind the imposing physique the sharp eyes that nothing escaped the broad square chin the firm generous mouth and the deep rich voiceâthese all told those meeting dr dale that they were in the presence of one of natures kings he sat in his capacious highback leather lounging chair and peering kindly over his gold glasses at fairfax asked gently well sir what can i do for you tonight this question to fairfax indicated that the president surmised the new students errand

ive come over doctor toâto see you about that letter

what about it sir asked the doctor bending on the youth a glance beneath which he winced

itsâits mine doctor blurted he

yours how can that be it is addressed to abraham lincoln is your name lincoln sir

no sir doctor im not named anything i aint got any name  replied he bitterly

why i thought your name is fairfax asked the president with a broad smile at the rustics heat

no sir doctor i havent got any name

how did you come to open a letter addressed to abraham lincoln then asked the official with a stilt broader smile

because replied fairfax sheepishly that used to be my name and somebody that knowed me by that name sent me some money

dont say knowed but knew me

oh doctor im too worried to talk grammar

at this we all laughed

if the letter is yours i dont see why you should be worried laughed dr dale

i see exclaimed the young man excitedly leaping to his feet standing erect before the president i see if it gets out about my name he went on impetuously every dunce in norwalk will be making a fool of me about it

you use strong anguage sir said dr dale evidently pleased at fairfaxs power of expression

well doctor i feel strong about it for everywhere ive been made a fool of about my name i mean finished he in deep pain because i havent got any name dr dale was touched he asked in altered voice how did you come by the names lincoln and fairfax

you told me when you came here that you were born in the south he added to encourage the youth to talk about himselfâevidently a thing painful to the new convert

yes sir i was born a slave this i know because i have some indistinct recollections i dont know exactly where i was born nor when i was with my mother in a tent in a union camp one night when a skirmish took place in the darkness and confusion i got lost from her i thought id find her when daylight came but ive never laid eyes on her since

here he paused under stress of feeling dr dale wiped his eye and blew his nose

how did you get north he asked in altered tones

i was brought north by the quakers who were looking after the orphans of slaves they brought a whole lot of us children north to an asylum i didnt know anything about my folks and i didnt have any name so they called me abraham lincoln they meant all right but everywhere ive went he continued warming up at the thought of past annoyance ive been made a fool of about my name

corrected the president dont say everywhere ive went but everywhere ive gone

oh doctor broke out the young man with a broad grin i know that the past participle and not the past tense should be used after the verbs have and be we committed grammar in the school i went to before i came here but nobody not even the teacher bothered about talking it

well sir laughed the good doctor we in this institution learn grammar and talk it

yes sir doctor replied fairfax broken off from the thread of his narrative and feeling in awkward selfconsciousness for his chair to take his seat

i did not mean to interrupt your story sir said the president

no sir doctor replied the black boy again becoming erect and graceful as his feelings again beguiled him into selfforgetfulness

as i was saying ive been made a fool of always about that name abraham lincoln for what goose wouldnt know that ive no right to that name 

i should think you would be glad to bear the name of so good and great a man

oh the name is good enough but i just got tired of being everlastingly teased about that name so i got the folks that brought me up to get my name changed by law to augustus fairfax

thats more highsounding than lincoln laughed dr dale

i dont care sir people dont tease me about it anyhow

as the letter really was fairfaxs president dale saw that there was nothing to do about it so far therefore as that feature of the matter was concerned the young man went back to the dormitory satisfied and i went with him having had a good inward laugh at the boy and an inward cry with him over the story of his childhood

quite funny

the virtue of prosperity is temperance selfcontrol the virtue of adversity is fortitude which in morals is the more heroical virtueâessay adversityâbacon

augustus fairfax was not far wrong in dreading the consequence of the matter respecting his name becoming known when the facts leaked out a great shout of derision went up he was dubbed the anonymous from eutopia the missing link the hetopsy that never was born but just growed norwalk had such a good time at the young converts expense that his religion was put to a severe test as he was the butt of all sorts of jokes and pranks

here is one of the class of jokes a younger brother of one of the professors had died away at college and in consequence of the bodys being brought home to norwalk for burial we were having a holiday a great crowd of students were on one of the porches of the dormitory in which fairfax roomed as he approached the porch some wag in the crowd called out to the black rustic come here fairfax i want to tear you up to make crepe out of you for the burial

a great shout of laughter was sent up by the delighted crowd after that he was called crepe

then too he was made the victim of many a halfgrown boy prank one of these however did not prove so funny for its perpetrators as it was hoped it would

three of the new students most persistent tormentors all city fellows robt saxton henry don and bill halsey went to the country lads room one saturday afternoon and announced that they were going to cobb or haze him in honor of his new name the anonymous the young christian was not long in reaching the decision that peace must be conquered instantly therefore he not only declared war but immediately and most literally and vigorously carried the war into africa

he had just come in from the football field where he had left the bulk of the student body engaged in a match game of football at that time still a gentlemanly game for the many not yet having degenerated into a brutal fight between a few consequently he had on not the city clothes and shoes purchased since his matriculation but he wore the countrystore clothes and heavy thicksoled bull hide boots in which he arrived at norwalk he was naturally as agile as a deer and labor on a farm had made him ns tough as his lubbering bovine footgear

what of the encounter do you ask this his fists and feet got in such good work that robt saxton carried his arm in a sling for two weeks from a fall on the ice henry donhad the pleurisy in his side from a cold bill halsey had the rheumatism in his left leg so bad that he had to walk with a stick while fairfaxâthe funny the eventempered after his boots had caused all these complaints fairfax the sometime man of peace alexander like sat down on the side of his bed and wept that there were no more worlds to conquer with his cheeks streaming with bitter brine and his eyes as red as fire he is reported to have cried in a fury that recked not of grammar are there one is there two more that wants to cobb me letem come on by jacks i kin lick any such fools in norwalk but so far as the three were concerned he was wasting the sweetness of his challenge on the desert air of their absence for they had gone to take off their wounded and bury their dead

this hazing incident never reached the ears of the authorities yet it did get out among the boys though you may be sure the three kept mum and though fairfax did not tell itâunless he unwittingly let out the secret that same evening at the nightly voluntary prayermeeting the young convert was in deep distress and very penitent

his prayer that night contained these significant words thou knowest we do love thee and that we do want to do right forgive us for all our sins for thou knowest how hard it is to be teased for what you aint responsible for

there is a saying that all the world loves the lover yes and it loves the fighter too else how comes it to pass that the soldier is the worlds first hero no the hazing incident never reached faculty ears but it did leak out among the boys and when it did it is only just like human nature which loves the fighter that fairfax stock took a rise with norwalk students he was never teased thereafter probably because it was hard for a fellow to continue to seem funny who had such good use of his fists and feet

it would be a mistake however to suppose fairfax thereafter owed immunity from teasing to muscular prowess wholly however true it is that it is not human nature to withhold admiration from brawn

what form of education a young man ought to bring from college is an old debate but what kind of boy you send to school is infinitely more important than to what kind of institution you send the boy steel is worth sharpening but whats the good of sharpening lead whats the use of having a boy go through a college course if he has not brains enough for the college course to go through him

there were all sorts of ability in this negro college just as all sorts are to be found in white ones but fairfax was steel he was capable of having the curriculum go through him if a college is a world wherein there is aristocracy of brains rather than that of blood the country youth without a name soon vindicated his right to be regarded as a high peer in norwalks aristocracy of brains

it was said in the outset of this history that our class had only one candidate for the ministry in it the year fairfax entered norwalkâthat is holt robert n wilson joined us as a candidate for the holy office when we reached the junior year after our graduation these two returned to norwalk to take theology therefore while i went off to study medicine as norwalk had no medical department when three years later wilson holt and myself finished our professional courses fairfax graduated from norwalk at the head of his class having become by his industry uprightness talents and sunny heart the most popular and influential student in norwalk

fairfax got a position as teacher in a state normal school in one of the gulf states when he went from norwalk wilson and holt each took a church in the north while i went south and hung out my physicians shingle in the city of rockford where there were more colored than white people

i saw an opportunity for my church in the city of my adoption and fixed on holt to help get it up but being a northern man he preferred work in the north besides this he had a family dependent upon him five with julia who had just graduated and gone south to teach so he did not see his way clear to take hold of the mission

i knew that wilson was my next best manâpious and persistent tactful and talented soon by united effort wilson and myself had effected the organization of a church that we believed would become a power for good in that community

i had no reason to complain of the practice that came to me in this city of twelve thousand negro population

there were a large class of intelligent respectable welltodo colored people in rockford so that what with the friends i made professionally what with those i made socially and what with having my classmate as pastor life went pretty well with me moreover being a northern man the open hospitality of the people their social and religious life and the picturesque dialect of the untutored of themâthese all kept me busy making shorthand notes of the things i saw and heard in my new world from these notes begun from my first hour in rockford i am able to continue this history

wilson and i kept bachelors hall until our church was organized that same week he went to live with two of our members mr and mrs a g harper who had a comfortable tasteful home for he was a fine shoemaker and she a trained nurse mrs harper was necessarily therefore much away from home the burden of housekeeping however and the care of little alfred junior a winsome chap in frocks fell on the capable shoulders of mrs harpers younger sister miss alma may montague an interesting girl in the twenties

a year after wilson left me to continue keeping bachelors hall i was able to do better by the race and better by holt than if i had succeeded in getting him as my pastor

a vacancy occured in the faculty of the rockford normal and industrial college this was a state coeducational institution manned by a colored president and faculty

the president one of the older norwalk men and myself were good friends besides that i was on good terms with the white board of trustees one of the most influential of these having come south and built the rockford streetcar lines knew holt personally for he had helped my classmate in school these influences combined to elevate david j holt to the vacant professorship of rhetoric

he moved south during the summer and began work in september julia who had been teaching in the south so impressed the president that he had made her teacher in the model school of rockford college this work gave her children as pupils unfortunately however in march the president a f garnet died of pneumonia

who does not know that small communities breed cabals and jealousies therefore rather than put a brand new man or one longer connected with the school in the vacant presidency the trustees thought it wiser to elevate holt to that dignity

this they did he was every way eminently fitted for the position the new president used his influence to have augustus fairfax who had been teaching english appointed to the vacant professorship of rhetoric in rockford

though julia holt had been appointed to a position in rockford college an important position too she was quite young and a mere sylph of a figure she was under usual height not what you would call a handsome girl but her high soul so shone out in her fine eyes hazel and frank and she had so much of her fathers noble mein tactful manner and vivacious spirit that those who came in contact with her conceded her fitness for her position and usually thought her a beautiful woman

as for the quasi ward of holt and myself augustus fairfax the sometime anonymousâhow much education time and contact had done for his appearance and manners since i first met him on the platform at norwalk depot there was that in the bearing of the pleasantfaced smoothblack young man so easy in his manners so pleasing in address that bespoke the man of selfrespect culture and mental power modest frank earnest and genial he looked the gentleman and professor

to no mean position had my friend holt been promoted for rockford state normal college built at a cost of eighty and receiving an annual appropriation of fifteen thousand dollars consisted of six men and five women teachers and of one hundred and fifty young men and two hundred young women students the substantial commodious beautiful fourstory brick tshaped college building was situated on a beautiful plateau overlooking the city towards the west discipline is of unspeakable importance in a higher mixed school therefore all the teachers for the purpose of discipline were required to live in the building except the president he had a house

the school property comprising thirty acres had before the war been the estate of dr warren pogue an aristocratic southern gentleman the presidents residence was the fine large old pressedbrick twostory mansion of ten ample high elegantly finished roomsâ downstairs a study two parlors a sitting and a dining room

holt said he never would have gone to the expense of furnishing becomingly a rich mans house if he had not felt that his position demanded that he do so he and mrs holt had excellent taste so the elegantly finished white mans house was furnished throughout in quiet simple elegance

i know enough about the world to know that the holts home was in refinement not behind what would be expected of a white family in a similar position

some rockford folks

let not ambition mock their useful toil ther homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor

âgrays elegy

dr joseph wade had no reason to complain of life had i not a large growing paying practice then think of having lifelong friends in rockfordâpresident david j holt professor augustus fairfax rev robt n wilson and mrs holt and miss julia

many a fellow going from school out into the world goes out into what so far as his former associates are concerned is a wilderness where in being the only educated man of color in the place he is monarch of all he surveys but it mightily sweetens being somebody and having something to be able to be somebody and have something surrounded by friends who have grown up with one

now in rockford there were not a few college bred men and women besides my school friends

yes the lines had fallen to me in pleasant placesâin very pleasant places indeed

i knew the citys highways and byways and the peopie and took pleasure in making my school friends acquainted with the same some of the olderâthat is the dialect talking folks said this wharevah you see one dem new folks whar done come heah you almos sho to see mo of em

rockford is one of the slow conservative cities where everybody knows everybody hence the city had time to notice strangers your big bustling uptodate cityâ oh the pity of itâhas no time to do this

this is why i suppose the following was said of the norwalk coterie neva did see sich folks to ramble bout gitten quainted wid everbody an all de time axin questions we heard some very romantic stories about both races and got acquainted with some highly interesting characters by our rambling about

one of these was jeter hornâole drunken jeta as he was called he was remarkable not because he was a drunkardâfor indeed there were plenty of drunkards of both races around townâbut what was remarkable about jeter horn was his fondness when halftight for using grandlioquent or highflown language president holt laughingly declared that if jeter had been educated he would be a poetic orator he was about fifty gingercake colored the usual height slight built but robust it was a common sight to see him half drunk his head thrown back his eyes rolling his hat in his right hand go stepping high wide and frolicsome down the streetâ he eschewed the sidewalk when tightâthe meantime holding his arms off from his body as a hen holds her wings when about to fly and in a loud mellow voice getting off a rigmarole of nonsense the ilk of the following i is a man you dont see every day skimmed milk masquerades fo cream circumstances alters cases ef im not correct correct i jeta many prophets of evil whar done seed visions an dreamed dreams has done lif up deir onsanctified voices an saed ole jeta aint long fuh dis worl but dem same prophets has gone to try de vas langth of an onknoan eternity but heah i is a free creature of gawd walkin bout dis ole rockford ketchin de cool breeze eatin ma con bread an herins an drinkin ma whiskey

jeter was quiet enough when sober and inoffensive when drunk so the authorities did not lock him up but laughed at his nonsense as everybody else did he worked at whitewashing woodsawing and gardening and made his home with anyone that would tolerate him this respectable people never did for very long so he was at first one place and then another usually among the shiftless and disreputable

another interesting character was ezekiel brownâ called prophet zeke and uncle zeke he was jeters age a trifle darker than he not gray except his mustache the only hair of consequence that he had for he was as bald as a baby on top of his head

he was an active robust man of intelligence as his keen face indicated but unlike jeter he was highly respected by both races he worked in the cemetery being employed by the city in addition to this many wealthy families gave him the job of caring for their plots so that he made between the city and these a very good living indeed he had no family so he made his home with his niece and her husband a fine bricklayer the cemetery a beautiful place beautifully kept adjoined the park equally beautiful wilson fairfax the holts and myself in our strolls in the cemetery and park saw much of zeke brown who had evidently taken the furriners as he called us to his heart it seems to me he knew the family history of everybody in townâ white and black and he liked nothing so well as to entertain the furriners with presentday gossip and pastday history of both races consequently we heard in his picturesque dialect some interesting tales of rockford people for the old man was very much flattered by our noticing him to the extent of seeking him

though rockford college was outside of the city limits yet i believe the holts because i piloted them around knew as much about the city as i did who as a physician had to go in every nook and corner

i did not have so many opportunities to take julia out to drive however after fairfax came to town for though he walked she preferred strolling with him to driving with me this would not be worth mentioning but for the fact that the young lady preferred walking with fairfax to driving with any of her admirers among whom may be mentioned the other single man in rockford faculty professor allen garnet the former presidents nephew mr henry blake rockfords most successful colored lawyer and mr warren pogue one of rockfords most welltodo young colored green grocers

this preference led the holts to see not with displeasure that julia and fairfax were under the spell of the little blind god i told holt how i saw it was going to be between these two if they ever got a chance i saw it when he told me how julia wept and laughed with fairfax when he found peace

i knew holt well enough to know that he was very well satisfied at the turn of his daughters heart affairs had taken and i think i do mrs myrtle a holt no injustice in saying that while she had the highest respect for fairfax and would not for worlds have admitted that she harbored color prejudice yet nevertheless i am sure i do her no injustice in saying that she would have been better satisfied if julias choice had fallen on a man not so dark as fairfax was indeed i know that she preferred mr warren pogue above all of julias suitors

and who was warren pogue he was the son of dr warren pogue a rich white man jeter horns exmaster who was notorious in rockford as a drunkard and libertine he had both a white and colored family after having been a notorious drunkard around rockford for so many years that his name became a synonym for sottish libertine he had recently died in the insane asylum of softening of the brain his son lived with his mother he was an upright gentleman and a fine successful business man but his antecedents being what they were holt charged his wife with preferring pogue above all of julias suitors simply because he looked like a white man both blake and garnet were about julias color mrs holts defense of herself was her weeping on her husbands shoulder and crying dave youre always accusing me of being prejudiced to color and you know very well i am no such thing

holt told me he simply kissed her and laughed at her

give sorrow words

give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break

âmacbeth act iv scene iii

apropos of my remarking to holt that i had long ago surmised how it was going to turn out with julia and fairfax he said wade old fellow it does seem to me you see soul things before anybody else sees them

i noticed that holt did not commit himself as to the opinion he had held about fairfax and his daughter fathers are not usually very voluble respecting their feelings about their daughters marriage for i suppose that though a father knows his daughters happiness is bound up in her marriage yet he does not relish the thought of some other man being more to his daughter than he is just as a mother rarely enjoys having a woman come between herself and her son

i dont know that my spiritual or psychological insight is as keen as my friend thinks it is but i am altogether certain that nothing not even a human body so interests me as does a human soul i said this to wilson once he replied if thats so you ought to be a minister i might have been a trifle vain over supposed ability to deal with soul problems but for an experience that completely emptied me of vanityâan experience i had with miss belle clay a patient i was called to see soon after i hung out my shingle in rockford

miss clays folks were in good circumstances and highly respected her father for years and years had been nightwatchman at maitlands factory one of the largest of the kind in the state one of the most loving and sunny souls you ever saw was her mother a short creamcolored woman with what once was coal black but then mixed silky hair

in younger days she was accounted the handsomest woman in rockford which never was poor in women of color pleasant to look to except that she was taller belle was the exact image of her mother a wholesome warmhearted little thing with good practical sense a teacher in the public school

canst thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow asks macbeth of the physician engaged for his wife insane with remorse because of the murder of king duncan

i felt that my engagement for miss clay was practically asking me the same questionâasking me canst not thou minister to a mind diseased for the young ladys trouble was wholly mental

she had been engaged to dan nealâhandsome dan a great beau atd considered one of the finest catches in town and be it known that there were about six marriageable girls to every marriageable fellow in what was considered the highest social circle of rockford

dan had gone northâhe was a barber and had the next best paying white shop in townâand the next news was that he was married he had married a rockford girl that belle had cut out poor belle had the brain fever over his marriage i saw that no remedy a druggist can compound could reach her case i thought of these other words from macbeth give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oer fraught heart and bids it break accordingly i sought to give grief a tongue i strove to win her confidence in order to get her to pour out her hearts sorrow to me i visited her lent her books took her out socially took her to walk and to drive for no other purpose than to give her a chance to talk to me about neal my treatment worked like a charm by the time the holts came south and by the way she and julia struck up a wonderful friendship belle seemed to have grown ashamed to talk about dan i was glad enough too for i can tell you i had begun not to relish hearing her talk of him

yes the treatment worked like a charm so far as she was concerned but as for me well now thats the part of my experience that emptied me of all vanity about ability to solve soul problems for i had solved her problem by making one of my own

what a goose i was what else could be expected of a young susceptible mans pitying a girl with eyes and hair like midnight and a complexion like a luscious pear wilson laughed at me and said old fellow it will not do for you to administer the same remedy to all young lady patients with miss clays trouble i said i dont want to try to

a year and a half after fairfaxs appointment in rockford college he and julia had set the day it was to be in september in march preceding that september i had a buggy smashedâa blessed smash

i had to knock old molly in the head she stepped in a hole and broke her left foreleg i hated it like all the world for she was an affectionate and intelligent old thing and you do get so attached to an animal that youve had for some time

i prefer a faithful loving dog or horse to a deceitful person every time you see you dont expect much of a dumb brute so its shortcomings dont hurt you as a persons do my new horse lary a barrellike shortlegged powerful bay gelding was a fiery rascal but i felt confident that i could manage him

on the seventh of march i was driving past the graded school where belle taught it was recess time young africa seven hundred strong were filling the air with the glad noise of liberty lary pricked up his ears when i was opposite the girls playyard one of belles girlsâa mischievous little minxâthrew a paper bag with some banana peelings in it over the fence towards me shouting with mischief in her voice there dr wade miss belle sent em to you

perhaps i was not as alert to larys movements as i might have been i confess i was craning my neck to get a peep at belle the bag split spilling the peelings the high march wind blew the rattling bag right in larys face then and there the old fellow danced the kan kan whirling around like a flash hurling me out of the buggy my head hitting the curbing

the foolish horseâwell they say the only reason he ran so hard was because he couldnt fly he had made kindling wood of the buggy before some street hands stopped him recess was over when i regained consciousness and i found myself on a lounge in the principals office alone with belle

the teachers some of them saidâand there were ten in the buildingâthat they did not know how in the world belle got down stairs and out in the street of course i didnt know and i assure you i didnt care it was enough for me to open my eyes and above me see her sweet eyes swimming with tears

that was in march may fourth we were married wilson tying the knot i didnt know how popular we were until our wedding took place it was a home affair but nevertheless zeke brown had this to say about it dem folks had fine doins an some o de bes eatins a man evah shet his teeth down on

some time before i had bought a lot and built a house where i was keeping bachelors quarters taking my meals at maria james one of rockfords crack cooks somebody has said it takes more than good land and tools to make a good farmâthere is needed a good farmer to do that equally true is it that a fine house and furniture do not of themselves make a home it takes a woman that knows how to do that belle knew how i got a house and furniture and she did the restâthat is made a beautiful homelike home not a small achievement by any means many a professional man in marrying his intellectual equal weds a woman that is as helpless as a baby about making a home thats usually because of the foolish kind of seminary education that totally ignores the fact that god made woman to be a mother and homemaker belle however got her housewifely skill in the best possible of all schools of domestic training namely in a wellregulated home

i told belle i think i got the better of the bargain in our marriage

just among ourselves

we may live without poetry music and art we may live without conscience and live without heart we may live without friends we may live without books but civilized man cannot live without cooks

âlucile owen meredith lord lytton love makes our world beautiful yes and it gives us an interest in all things connected with the loved one

now there was laryâi would have liked to keep him because of what he had done to help me win belle but after breaking my buggy the old goose was always trying to run away humph horse nature and human nature if either once takes bit in teeth and runs off and smashes up things either a horse or a person finds it harder to keep from running off ever after that

yes it spoils a horse to let him run off once belle begged me to sell him which i did very reluctantly for i felt kindly towards lary for helping me to win belle

then too there was that girl that frightened lary the day we had been married one month we were to have to dinner the holts fairfax and wilsonâjust among ourselves we said

i was driving rapidly home to meet our guests just as public school let out i saw on the street the girl that had thrown towards me the paper bag that had frightened lary i stopped and said come here sissie will you please

she dropped her head and ambled shamefacedly up to the buggy i suppose she thought i was going to scold her i took out of my vest pocket a brand new silver dollar and gave it to her

she ducked her head in acknowledgment of the gift too surprised to speak while i drove off i looked back and saw her companions gathered around her where she stood riveted with astonishment as she exclaimed in awed tones look what miss belles husband done gin me

that gift was an expression of my joy at being miss belles husband

when i got home i found only professor fairfax and his fiancee miss julia holt neither her parents nor rev robert wilson could come

well now didnt we four have a most delightful time though fairfax was just bubbling over with fun good food doesnt usually put people out of humor he insisted on calling me mr dear and belle mrs darling you can imagine why

when we were nearly through with dessert we had two callers zeke brown and mom kitty parker they met each other at the gate uncle zeke in his galia was gwine to a turnin out of de de lodge he jes drapt in to ax de docta to call by an see my niece nancy shes sort o pooly today

mom kitty had come to see her son de docta who done maied an my lil baby belle lawd chillun i didnt have no idee you all was havin a big dinin else i wouldnt a come

mom kittys husband drove a delivery wagon for a great dry goods firm all five of their children were married and living away from rockford she was a monthly nurse tall walnut wood colored powerful of frame with the sweetest voice widely known and loved by both races for her sweet motherliness every physician in the town knew he could depend on mom kitty she was off with one of her daughters when we were married

i had got her up from a severe sickness and belle was one of her babies hence as soon as she got home she had come to see my children in deir new home

we insisted that she and zeke should have some of our dinner zeke at first demurred saying i aint used to eatin wid de white folks cause you all is de poure quality

when they got to the table however the old man got over his real or assumed embarrassment his spirits arose as the good things to eat descended he grew quite garrulous

i tell you taint nothin sweetens vittals like hard wuk

preach it prophet ezekiel mischievously ejaculated fairfax staring at julia who though usually a light eater had by reason of her morning classwork and the walk done ample justice to the dinner and was now having her third helping of cream

ef im a prophet grinned the old man towards julia i ken tell you miss julia dat de nighes way to a mans heart is by way of his mouf

aint hit de dyinâde livin truth ejaculated mom kltty belle honey continued she beaming on her ef you want to manage de docta you feed him chile

yas put in zeke i dont ker ef de docta is a poure white black man i bet he gits mad when be wants his grub same as i does when i comes home an dinna aint ready i dont want nancy to go wastin time a tellin why taint ready i wants dat grub she ken tell why she didnt have it ready arter i done et den i ken predate de beauty o de reasons for a hongry man aint got a bit mo reason den a rabbit haw haw haw haw laughed his big mouth

pretty lords of creation you men are replied belle in feigned scorn i dont see what makes them so foolish about a little something to eat added julia women are not so unreasonable

i tell you de cause why said zeke  cause de women is de cooks an dey aint got nobody to git mad wid hits like de brides dat make tend dey dont ker whut dey has to eat ive noticed dat when a bride says one thing to eat same as another hits a sho thing dat gal dont know how to cook haw haw haw

i aint treadin on yo cons is i miss belle cause dis dinna speaks fo you belle looked pleased

you are not treading on mine uncle zeke for i know how to cook said julia besides that im not a bride but if i ever become one she continued a flush on either cheek ill profit by your advice to belle mom kitty she added addressing the old lady who looked pleased

ef you evah become one zeke reepated slowly looking at the flushing julia teasingly with one eye shut ef you evah become one humph why a little bird done tole me ef you should die widout becomin a bride youd have a frown on yo purty face in de coffin miss julia haw haw haw

we all joined him in the laugh

belle was about to help me to some more cream and said banteringly to fairfax mr professor of gab join dr mindcure in some more cream fairfax arose and from behind his chair gave belle a most profound bow and said as solemnly as a judge no i thank you madame darling more of the chilled quintessence of the fluid product of the animal sacred to the hindoos i will not take for so copiously have i indulged the clamorous calls of a craving appetite that an oppressive sense of inward fullness admonishes me admonishes me most eloquently to desist from further participation

we all laughed at this but julia she said gus you remind me of jeter horn

zeke chuckled good souls ef i spit dictionary like dat hit would knock all de teeth outen my head so i couldnt chaw my vittals

fairfax delighted to put his fun in the form of the mock heroic ive seen him amuse himself by talking in grandiloquent terms to a group of workmen who seemed to enjoy it as much as he did just as i have seen the ignorant country people who used to go to norwalk commencement sit spellbound under the latin salutatory ive often heard them say dat fust speech wus de purttiest one of all my aint dat latin sweet hit sholy is purty talk

i am sure these people didnt understand a word of what was said but the very flow of latin appealed to their sense of music just as big words more musical than short ones appeal to the negro musical ear

a disturbed siesta

oh happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature is law all then is full possessing and possessed no craving void left aching in the breast evn thought meets thought ere from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart

âeloisa to abelardâpope

after dinner julia and her lover returned to the college uncle zeke went to de turnin out of de lodge and i went to see his niece mom kitty announced her determination to stay and go from our house to preaching at her church just two blocks away

when i returned from seeing zekes niece i found mom and belle deep in the mystery of flowers in the front yard

i had been up the night before and expected to be up the coming night consequently i said mom kitty im almost dead for sleep let belle entertain you wont you and excuse me to see if i cant get a nap

what you wastin yo brath axin me dat fo son cose ill xcuse you go on boy an res yosef i wonder you aint broke down fo now

our house of six rooms had a square front hall on both floors the downstairs hall we used as a summer sitting room in the one upstairs belle had her machine and a large comfortable lounge i threw myself down on this and was soon fast asleep the reason i aint broke down fo now is i can go to sleep for fifteen or twenty minutes and wake up as refreshed as if i had slept for hours

i dont know how long i had been asleep when the voices of mom kitty and my wife awoke me they were in the lower hall i only know i was perfectly refreshed i could hear every word they said for from the way they talked i presume belle thought i was in our room resting i looked down over the banister and saw my wife and the old lady side by side on the little sofa

yas honey i was mighty fraid you was gwine to marry de docta still alovin dan neal like jinnie cross married ira lewis still alovin my nephew dallas leonard but i see yo love yo husban

love him mom kitty i just wonder and wonder how i ever could have been wrapped up in dan neal

i felt that i ought to be somewhere else but i couldnt move without betraying the fact that i had already overheard them so i saw nothing left for me to do but to keep quiet

gals sometimes fool themselves an marry somebody dey dont love cause dey cant get dem dey do love but any gal dat does dat will suffer jes like jinnie cross did poo thing how she did suffer

how was that mom kitty i never heard about her

hits a long story my chile do you want to hear it

yes maam tell me about it since you think her case resembles mine

no honey taint like youn but like youn mought have been let me tell you bout jinnie

i knew mom kittys power of graphic narrative and as i had been refreshed i took out my notebook and took down in shorthand the story as she told belle as nearly as i could in her own language it is to be borne in mind however that no putting of mom kittys story in cold type could do justice to her wonderful telling of it out of the wealth of her love and experience and in her marvelous voice

jennie cross story

then gently scan your brother man still gentler sister woman tho they may gang a kennin wrang to step aside is human

âburns

jinnie cross mothers name was marthy ann jinnies father was one of de normans and you know dey has always been some of de bigges white folks in town her daddy got kilt in de fust year of de war arter de war marthy sent de little thing north to her half brothers wife whar jinnie staid till she was eighteen den a white woman wanted to take jinnie to europe as ladys maid but marthy wouldnt let jinnie go fraid her chile would git off somewhere an forgit all bout her mammy so she had jinnie to come home to rockford

she said says she mom kitty i love ira as much as im evah gwine to love any man cept dallas i argued an argued wid her but i couldnt convince her so she an ira got married he wasnt a bad lookin man but honey he was one mo black man jinnie felt so bad bout not havin no lawful father dat she tried to git away fum hersef by marryin a black man de blacker he was de better she was pleased she said to me i wish i was as black as he is den dese white satans wouldnt be followin me wid dey eyes evah time i got on de street some of em can look at a good lookin cullud gal in sech a way as to make you want to cuss welljennies marriage turned out jes like i xpected ira was dat proud of her he jes thought everything she done was jes right he encouraged her to go out wid young men same as ef she want married ira lewis was a good manâan de greatest man fuh lodge an church you evah sawl every blessed night of de week dat man would be gone to some society er religious meetin fuh he was a big deycon in de church a big odd fellow a big mason in fact a big evahthing he could jine i nevah seed sich a jiner in all my bon days l he encouraged jinnie to have a house full of young folks to keep her company cause she want no church member so when jra would be gone to church meetins prayer meetins lodge meetins an things jinnie would be at home wid a house full o gals an boys havin a high ole time or else gone wid some young man to a party or to de theater

ira nevah stopped to think dat he ought to give mo of his time to his wife cause sides bein a sinna she want nothin but a chile in age to him

arter two years dey got married an dey are very happy up north now

poor thing said belle after a thoughtful pause a guilty conscience and old jeter horns drunken tongue made her take a very foolish step how she did suffer yas belle ef she had been a lowdown gal she wouldnt have suffered so but she wanted to do right you certainly did a good part by them mom kitty an her an jack loves me to dis day dey is alius sendin me something nice

im thankful so thankful murmured belle that i havent a particle of interest in dan neal now i love dr wade as jennie loves jack

i blieve you do honey an im mighty glad fo ef a gal marries widout love an den wakes up to fin hersef in love but not wid her husbanâwell all ive got to say is dat sich a gal dont need nobody to tell her what hells like she knows

the two women were disturbed at this juncture by some one calling for me when i went into my office belle clung to my arm with a tender light in her sweet eyes she seemed surprised at the warmth of my goodbye caress

mom kitty had gone when i returned from my visit i took belle in my arms and read some of my shorthand notes then she understood the warmth of my goodbye kiss i said eavesdroppers do not usually hear any good of themselves ive been an exception

it is not necessary to give her reply mom kittys story made us very grateful for our happy love

âthe deserted villageâgoldsmith

president f r dale used to say young gentlemen no man can preach the gospel with any more force than the power with which he lives it for what the preacher is counts for more than what he knows or says

he was an illustration of his own saying his face shone and he knew it not he has by reason of his character been dominant in my life since i left school in all these years whenever ive been tempted to do that which is unworthy i have seemed to feel that good mans hand on my shoulder holding me back while ive seemed to hear his kind voice asking why will you do that sir i bless god that i ever knew dr dale

my pastor rev robert n wilson seemed to me to be another illustration of the truth of dr dales saying

he was an eloquent speaker deep thinker and a wide scholar but it was wilson the man that drew people so simple sympathetic and earnest was he that although ours was a denomination new among rockford colored people and our house of worship one of the least attractive in town nevertheless our church in the face of most strenuous opposition grew in numbers and power for good

one of the most valuable additions to our church was henry blake mentioned some pages back as one of julias admirers a young lawyer that settled in rockford about the time i did he was a dapper handsome fellow about julias color that of a pecanâa man of fine talents and training

he had been induced to hang out his shingle in the city of my adoption by isaac scattergood a quaker in whose family in the north blake had been brought up friend scattergood was a finely proportioned portly man probably fifty yet unmarried who had gone south for his health and who just outside of town conducted a large truck farm because blake had joined our church quite a friendship had sprung up between us and the kind hearted friendâespecially between him and myself for he thought i had been of great use to him in securing for him an excellent truck farmer in john hill and a firstclass housekeeper in judah hill his wife two people about the age of their employer

blake had gone into partnership with gideon grayson a lawyer who had been in rockford for years the law firm of grayson and blake however did more business in three months than grayson alone had done in as many years for while grayson was an intelligent welleducated man and a good lawyer he had been coquetting with politicsâthe bane of the negro lawyer blake practiced law and let politics alone while grayson practiced politics and let law alone

grayson a great black masterful sixfooter belonged to rev walter granvilles church one of the largest in town the lawyer and the preacher were such good friends and so much alike in appearance they were spoken of as grayson and granville the law and the gospel granville was practically a new man in rockford  he was there three years before wilson naturally he and wilson both young men and new in town were compared soon it began to be said  saul granville has slain his thousands but david wilson his tens thousands this opinion may explain why our church and its gifted pastor were often abused even from the pulpit

wilson be it said was not granvilles superior in natural ability my pastor was the other ministers superior in culture and piety alone for granville had only a smattering of training how different a man he would have been under the influence that moulded wilson as it was granville was bombastic not cultured uppish not dignified sanctimonious not pious but worst of all morally he was a rotten fish yet he had one of the largest churches in town how often does it happen that the negro preacher with the largest following is not by reason of lack of training and good character morally uplifting his followers

we lost a faithful member a pillar you may say the christmas before belle and i were married john davis was his name i attended him and therefore often met wilson at his house he was a consumptive and how the old man did lean on wilson if the preacher did not arrive at the usual hour of his daily visit to the sick it was pitiful to hear the old man say i wish dat boy would come

to me it was a beautiful sight to see how helpless wilson felt in that sickroom and yet to see that he was so perfect a comforter because he so felt i used to think to myself it is sympathy that makes the minister that is a good man a king over hearts

christmas eve night the sunday school teachers prepared the christmas tree for we were to have christmas tree exercises christmas night after we got through dressing the tree a party of us including wilson fairfax julia belle and myself went to cheer the sick man taking along gifts of necessaries

before we left wilson prayed as we arose to go the old man said in tremulous tones chillun ef i dont see you all no mo i want you all to know i aint got a doubt nor a fear i bin follerin him nigh on forty yeahs an i aint got a doubt nor a fear dont be sprised ef you come back arter christmas an i aint heah but gawd done gin me a chrismsa gif

sure enough he got his christmas gif he died christmas morning

in april of that year we lost another member sister myra jenkins a widow all whose children were dead she was a tall angular black woman of great piety and force of character when wilson once preached on heavenly recognition after the sermon with tears of joy glistening in her eyes she said im jes waitin to go to my chillun oh im so happy gawd sent brer wilson heahânobody but gawd sent dat boy heah to preach de gospel

when she got down on her dying bed wilson declared that his daily visits to her were a benediction to him

quite a contrast in their effect were his visits to jeter horn who just across the street from sister myra jenkins was on what was thought to be his dying bed wilson read and talked to him and prayed with him but though jeter had once been a churchmember he seemed to be overwhelmed at the thought of death he did not die however but as he expressed it i is still alive walkin bout dis ole rockford eatin ma con bread an herrins an drinkin ma whiskey

at sister myras funeral there was a mighty outpouring of people wilson surpassed himself that day one of the deceaseds lifelong friends said dat little man whar done come heah an got up a churchâdat mans a wonda to me when lie gits in de pulpit hit looks to me somethin comes over him when he gits on his high hoss in de pulpit he aint like de same man you laugh an talk wid evry day

the old lady expressed just what i feel about wilson when he was at his best a subtle change came over him putting an immense distance between me and himâclassmates though we wereâand making my intimate friend so to tower above me as that i could not but reverence him

one sabbath mornin as we norwalkers still under the spell of one of wilsons most soulmoving sermons were returning home from church holt evidently voiced the feelings of us all when he said to me wade i tell you what it is at his best wilson certainly has the power of the spirit on him as men of old had

in the city of the dead

he is gone on the mountain he is lost to the forest like a summerdried fountain when our need was the sorest

the font reappearing from the raindrops shall borrow but to us comes no cheering to duncan no morrow 

âscottâlady of the lake

rockfords decoration day was the next week after mom kitty told belle about jennie cross mistake in marrying a man she did not love because the man she did was dead a large part of rockford was in the cemetery the white people to decorate the graves of their loved and lost the colored folks to see and be seen and to be going somewhere and strange to say for those who marched to the cemetery to decorate the graves of heroes who died fighting to uphold slaveryâstrange to say a negro band furnished the music

all of us norwalkers went to the cemetery as beautiful as a garden of gods fairfax and julia were there dreaming poetry in their sweet love and belle and i were there walking on air in our new wedded bliss without one how beautiful the world looks when within one there is a world of love

the speechmaking did not come off until afternoon thats why we norwalkers were not out except to hear that but now even the lovely afternoon had waned until the sun hung a lurid ball just above the hazy horizon love had placed its flowers and dropped its reminiscent tears on the graves above the dust of warriors it is true brave and sincere but warriors whose success would have riveted the galling chains of bondage on their brothers in black the placid air had been filled with the rattle of musketry the thunder of cannon the throb of music and the thrill of fervid oratory uttered to justify the lost cause the salutes the music the speechesâwe heard them all and along with the crowd that choked the streets we of the norwalk coterie in consequence of what we had heard were leaving the cemetery understanding better than when we went into this city of the deadâunderstanding and sympathizing a trifle more with the feelings of the people represented by the grayâa brave proud people upon whom by the stern arbitrament of the sword had been thrust a mighty revolution and it is but simple justice to add that however much there may be to be deplored in the souths treatment of the negro yet it nevertheless remains true that history does not show a case where the proud and imperious master class have treated the helpless freedmen better than ham has been treated by japhet in dixie

julia fairfax president and mrs holt had come out in a public carriage for this they were now waiting comfortably seated near an old ivymantled church ruin which ancient pile the city sought to preserve as a relic

wilson belle and myself were waiting with the holts to keep them company in his snuffcolored broadcloth sunday suit zeke brown came to us he had before spoken to us whenever we came to the park which adjoined the cemetery he made it a point to have something to say he hadtaken quite a fancy to us all but he seemed especially drawn to fairfax at such times as we visited the park zeke liked nothing better than to entertain us with presentday gossip and pastday history of rockford folks white and black high and low he seemed to have an exhaustless fund of such stories and he was a most capital story teller he talked all the more freely to us because he no doubt felt flattered that we set so high a value on his tales

while we were waiting for the holts carriage he told us a characteristic one yet different from the others he had told us in that it was about himself this is the way he came to tell the story about himself

after having greeted us and chatted awhile about the days doings zeke said to the young preacher elda wilson i promised you a while ago dat i was comin up to yo chuch dis comin sunday i seed elda granville sence dat an he minded me dat hits communion at our chuch so i cant come

all right brother brown when will you come said wilson

i dunno zackly but fo long cause i does dearly love to heah you preach said holt with a twinkle if you like so well to heah him preach why dont you join his church he might give you the office of carrying around the bread and wine

this last was said with a broad smile

dat wouldnt be no honey to draw me to you alls chuch replied he in holts own jocular vein  cause i done had dat office an lost it i done been a deycon in our chuch

been a deacon in your church asked mrs holt in genuine surprise

yas maam an lost it

mrs holt looked at the old man inquiringly

yas maam done been a deycon an lost it replied he to the query in her look a droll challenge in his voice for her to ask him why he had lost it

you must have done something terrible she answered in his own mock serious vein

no maam i didnt nuther i dont think youd say so ef you knowed

zeke and fairfax were on the best of terms the younger man always joking with the older by getting off some highflown nonsense so fairfax broke out in grandiloquent terms a twinkle in his eyes how long  o how long o ezekiel thou prophet the son of thy motherâhow long wilt thou make thy servants to hang by the eyebrows lift up thy voice o thou seer most mighty and vouchsafe an elucidation of the peculiar peccancy leading to an ecclesiastical catastrophe so egregiously calamitous as thy demission from the lofty sacred diaconate of thy church

amused were we all at this outburst of nonsense delivered in sententious tones of inimitable drollery as well as at zeke who with his hands clapped to either side and his eyes rolled up as if in great agony gasped wait wait till i ketch my breath de fessa done chawed up de whole dictionary an spit it at me so hard he done knocked all de win outen me

julia with a look on her pretty face of amusement disgust and fondness exclaimed i declare gus if you and old jeter were put in the same bag i dont know which would get out first

jeta an de fessa in de same bag miss jule ole jeta is de man dat knocked me outen my deconryâde no count ole nigga but lies now gone into a bag he wont git out of soon i bet

what do you mean asked mrs holt

didnt you see in this mornings paper that he has been sent to the poorhouse asked holt

no i didnt read the paper this morning answered the wife

neither did i put in julia her sweet eyes apologizingly in her lovers for what she had said of his reminding her disagreeably of the worthless jeter

wilson took out of his pocket the daily morning news and read to the company the following item the news for years with all rockford has laughed at jeter horns tipsy highflown nonsense more recently however we have seen a change in him which has made us feel that the funny old darkey ought not to be allowed at large when he is drunk the drinking of years has at last borne its fruitage the snakes are after the old coon and our fears have been confirmed night before last he almost frightened to death some ladies that met him rampaging down north street like a chimpanzee and in consequence the old sot was locked up but he has the jimjams so bad that the poorhouse is thought to be the place for him he will be detained there so that he cant get drunk and frighten ladies

i boun he wont trouble nobody no more said zeke

and you say he knocked you out of the diaconate asked holt

dats what he done he replied then ensued his funny tender tale of how he lost his deyconry

how zeke brown lost his diaconate

true love is but a humble lowborn thing and hath its food served up in earthen ware

âlowell

he had been separated from his wife by his master who moving to louisiana took zeke with him

this was before the war after the surrender he came back to rockford and was made a deycon in de fust chuch

this was said with deep reverence when the holts carriage came up we all bade the old man goodnight with new respect and sympathy for his beautiful faithfulness to his liza

at the gate beautiful

he took him by the right hand and lifted him upâacts 

tuesday had been memorial day in the afternoon of friday that same week rockford college commencement came off

have you ever attended a commencement of a southern colored institution for higher learning if you have you do not need to be told of the large welldressed selfrespecting crowd that gathered to witness rockfords closingâthe cream of the race in that region the large welllighted audience hall on the second floor capable of seating eight hundred was packed twentyfive girl graduates sweet in simple white occupied a front bench on the left side of the assembly hall left side to one on the platform on the right side sat eleven young men graduates the great crowd flowed behind and around the student body on the boys side of the hall at a right angle to the graduates the school choir and piano faced the ladies of the faculty

the male members of the faculty were on the rostrum as also several distinguished men wilson among them

twas an enthusiastic goodlooking audience as variant in color as the frosttouched autumn foliage ranging from the black with thick lips and grapy hair to the white with eyes of sky and locks of goldâquite a comment on the antebellum southern gentlemans selfcontrol  yes on that of southern gentlemen for it is the master class not the socalled poor white trash that have most mixed the people of african origin

the harpers alma may montague mrs harpers sister were over to commencement in a fine open public carriage

zeke brown said dem folks had on some clothes sho as you bon

i hired a spanking new surrey for belle and her mother mrs clay ive said before that belle was the image of her mother who in her younger days was accounted one of the handsomest women in rockford now my ladies had on some clothes too and i dont mind admitting that i was proud of them

mrs holt had provided seats with herselfâit was where the presidents family usually satâfor belle and her mother while it was expected that i would play distinguished visitor on the rostrum but belle was towed off by julia to a seat near the girl graduates the view of fairfax who had charge of the singing was better there  mrs clay sat with the girls matron mrs ada harmon an old friend while i refusing to be big man on the rostrum plumped down beside mrs holt meanwhilethe two vacant seats in front of us were at mrs holts invitation taken by mom kitty and isaac scattergoods handsome vivacious ripe pearcolored little housekeeper mrs juddy hill a popular lady who was always given her whole name juddy hill

as fairfax had charge of the music and both wilson and holt were on the rostrum this failure of the prearranged seating shut mrs holt and myself off from the rest of our coterie

somewhere else in this history i have said that mrs holt was a handsome woman she had what is better than mere good looks that is distinction tall and large but not stout with soft mixed gray hair that was glossy of chestnut color and queenly bearing she usually made those meeting her feel like calling her madam this was her husbands commencement and she would not have been a woman if she had not looked after her commencement attire had julia belle and mrs clay been sitting grouped around her as she intended still in good looks and good clothes mrs holt would have queened it over them all

you can imagine that it did not hurt my feelings to sit in the presidents seat beside probably the queenliest looking woman in all that audience

the commencement music was inspiring the essays and speeches about as good as those ive heard in the north at white commencements of schools of the same grade as rockford was about what were they to do you ask what will young colored graduates usually talk most about if you do not head them off oh about the race of course well is not that quite the expected are they not being put through college to help solve the race problem

the states chief executive had been asked to make a speech and present the diplomas he the attorneygeneral and the state superintendnt of public instruction constituted the state board of education quite proper was it therefore for holt to invite his excellency to present the diplomas and a wise way to keep on the right side of the power behind the local board of trusts

the executive sent word however that he was so busy that he could spare time only to arrive in rockford at threethirty and return to the capital on the northbound mail due in rockford at five oclock this hour and a half would give him only time to step into a carriage drive to rockford deliver his speech and the diplomas and hurry back to the depot for the five oclock mail

now the governor was a distinguished confederate general belonging to one of the oldest and most noted families of the state his excellency was one of that not small class of southern aristocrats who feel that the white mans claim of being superior to the black man demands that the anglosaxon make good his contention by treating colored people right

the state executive was quite willing therefore to visit the school and thereby show his friendlinss to the institution and the race provided his visit could be so arranged that his excellency would not be obliged to accept social courtesies from a negro president and faculty hence the arrangements just described

the welldressed respectable wellbehaved large intelligent audience from onethirty had been listening with enthusiastic appreciation to the exercises to be climaxed some time after threethirty by the governors speech

mom kitty had a nephew and juddy hill an exquisitely handsome daughter among the graduates and so these two ladies were all enthusiasm and who is not when at a commencement our own dear boy or girl is one of the graduates

mrs holt and i had kept up a lowvoiced goodhumored comment possible only between friends so intimate as to address each other by the front nameâcomment on the fine tact displayed by holt the good taste of fairfax evidenced by his handling of the music and his careful drilling of the performers which painstaking training was exhibited in the manner of the rendition of their speeches and essays

finally there remained but two more performances an essay by a girl so white that it would take a board of physicians to prove that she was colored and the valedictory by a young man not only the blackest member of the class but a black man yes just black no adjectives needed 

president holt was about to announce the fair maiden when an usher informed him that the governors carriage would soon be up the hill one must ascend to get to rockford campus the audience was asked to wait until the president should return to the hall with the governor

with holts departure to meet the great man downstairs a ripple of conversation broke over the expectant goodhumored crowd with here and there lowvoiced laughter for on what occasion is it that the funloving negro nature does not find matter for mirth aye you have seen colored people enjoy even funerals

but presently a hush falls on the throng necks are craned with bodies turned the doors open beside holt and followed by the hon nathan f cleggett and a rockford gentleman up the middle aisle starts the governorâa large short redfaced blueeyed sandyhaired man who had more years of his life behind him than before him there is a burst of applause generous and prolonged which his excellency acknowledges by bows to the right and left as he goes to the seat reserved for him during the exercises a fine thronelike chair placed under this legend printed in large letters on the wall welcome to the governor

his excellency heard the white girls essay and the black boys valedictory then gave his speech and presented the diplomas to you young men and young women

the old gentleman could not bring himself to addressing them as young ladies and gentlemen he was a man of affairs rather than an orator and so while he did not make a great speech he made a kind one replete with sound advice you people ought to be industrious frugal lawabiding on good terms with your best friends the white people of the south polite and faithful as the old black mammies were before the war et cetera

howbeit with his sound advice the governor put forth some unsound political economy he told us that because the bulk of school taxes are paid by white people that state support of negro education is a pure gratuity for which you people ought to be garteful to the white people

now governor that will not do if negroes dont commit more crimes than anybody else yet and still because they are ignorant and poor they are oftener before the courts and consequently pay more fines than anybody else if the fines negroes pay were added to the taxes and saloon licenses they pay it is doubtful if negroes get many more schools than they actually pay for

i admit indeed that negroes ought to be grateful for state support of negro educationâif for no other reason because the state does its duty but it is an economic heresy to say that negro education is a gratuity and not a right because white people have more taxable property than black people everywhere except in the south political economists agree that no matter who turns in the taxes to the state treasury that yet and still the laborer the man who does the work is the man who really pays the taxes for there would be no money to turn in if there were no laborer at the forge in the shop and on the farm now since the man who does the work pays the taxes if the negro ever since he has been in the south has not done most of the work of the south and that too for two long centuries before he was allowed any schooling at allâif the negro has not done most of the work of the south i would like to know who has

no dear governor the states education of the negro is not a gratuity it is the negros right the child of the wageearner has the same right to state education that the capitalists child has

after the chief executive had presented the diplomas the two gentlemen who accompanied him were called on for remarks they remarked entirely too long so long that though the exercises were not over his excellency had to go for his train when the latter of the two remarkers took his seat the goodhumored audience were asked to wait until the programme should be completed holt started to accompany the governor to his carriage again the audience burst into applause and the governor proceeding down the aisle at holts side bowed to left and right in acknowledgment

when the party had left the hall again a ripple of sprightly conversation broke over the great gathering mom kitty and juddy hill turned round and engaged mrs holt and myself in talk

the governors presence the speeches the graduation of mom kittys nephew and juddy hills daughter had put the two exslave mothers in a happy reminiscent mood juddy hill with glistening eyes said to mrs holt and myself you all is northern folks who never knew anything bout slaveryâyou two president holt an professor fairfax this day cant be to you whut hit is to sista kitty an myself

no indeed assented mom kitty dr wade continued juddy i neva thought the las time i saw the genral that hed eva give any chile of mine a diploma

when was that asked mrs holt

in the fust year o the war my young missis husban colonel poindexter was on the genrals staff shed follow him in the army wherever she could an always took me with her

the las time i seen de genral befo today was de day after de night he made a raid on de yankees an got wounded an brought back with em liza horn almos distracted cause shed lef bellin in de union camp her only chile a boy

a look flashed between mrs holt and myself

why i always heerd hit was a gal dat jeta an liza los put in mom kitty

no it wasnt it was a boy and i neva seen anybody so heart broken as liza was

continued she you see sista kitty liza was fust married to zeke brown but she belonged to miss ethel kirk in miss ethels own right when she married dr warren pogue the only way to keep from separatin liza an zeke was either for miss ethels father to sell or give zeke to the pogues or for miss ethel to give up liza her maid none of em was willin to do any of these things an as old tom kirk moved to louisiana when miss ethel got married zeke an liza was separated an they married her to jeta she an jeta the pogues took in the army dr pogue was a great surgeonâan the yankees had captured liza an her little boy an the genral knew her an brought her back to dr pogue who was on his staff an liza

here she was interrupted by the applause of fairfax announcing that miss alice ilill juddy hills daughter would sing a solo while they were waiting for the presidents return

the interest of the two women bent on the beautiful girl going up on the rostrum to sing mrs holt whispered to me joe suppose gus isâand paused looking into my eyes

had you ever thought of it before i whispered

yes and have told dave so a hundred times

have you ever hinted it to him and julia

no nor to any one else she answered cautiously

said i i dont think it worth while to do so it may not be true if it is true but nobody knows what difference does it make if it is true and julia and gus find it out what then 

thats just what dave asks

what do you say if it is true i asked looking her straight in the eye

i dont know i dont let myself think of the dreadful possibility said she much moved

if it should prove true my advice to you is let julia and gus decide what they will do

thats just what dave says

then for you madam mum is the word mum here continued i touching my breast with the forefinger of my right hand then giving my attention to miss alice hills solo more i admit to the exquisitely pretty girl than to her singing

the solo over and the prolonged clapping after everybody else had stopped of the half dozen fellows in love with pretty alice we had the rest of the programme the speeches of distinguished visitors somebody now that the governor had gone flowers and presents of doting friends remarks by the president announcements benediction

then the congratulations and the myriadvoiced hubbub of the breaking up of a great enthusiastic throng of the offspring of hamâdemonstrative children of the tropicsâhopeful for the future because of the tearstained bloodflecked past and because there is a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will who is effecting the only solution of the race problem

the only solution yes nothing is ever settled until it is settled right the drama of the right solution is now on the stage here it is ham rising in christian civilization japhet getting used to it aye for despite wrongs that need resistance power benign is moving japhet to help ham to rise in civilization as according to acts the third the apostle peter helped up the lame man at the gate beautiful

and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up    and all the people saw him walking and praising god    and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him

what hath god wrought the miracle drama of hams uplifting is the marvel of the world i quite natural then is the hopefulness of the sunkissed folk recently ransomed from thraldom by the nations best blood now being uplifted by the nations best conscience

hurt to the heart

then must the jew he merciful

on what compulsion must i tell me that

we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy

âthe merchant of venice act iv scene i

there are lots of folks in this world who are hurt to the heart over other peoples good fortune the hon nathan f cleggett a member of the legislature one of the gentlemen who accompanied the governor to rockford commencementâthis gentleman got his feelings hurt that day he had visited the school before holt in great courtesy took him through the college and showed him everything from alpha to omega

when he saw the students diningroom the professors rooms the presidents house when he beheld what was being studied and howâwell like the queen of sheba upon her visit to solomon he said the half was not told me

he left the institution hurt to the heart then he came back with the governor commencement day what he then saw and heard hurt him still more he was quite sick of heart at the evidence of negro uplifting

yes he was hurt to the heart as josephs brethren were over josephs coat of many colors as ahab was over naboths vineyard as that roman senator was who seeing the glory of the punic capital ended every speech thereafter on no matter what subject with the words carthage must be destroyed

now you know that this sort of hearthurt leads to action you know what josephs brethrenâahabâand the romans did

to what action did the hearthurt of the legislator lead well now what did he who was hearthurt over the happiness of our first parents in eden did he not go about to break up that happiness yes and the hearthurt lawmaker went about to break up negro uplifting by means of rockford as he who is described in genesis as more subtle than any beast in the field which the lord god had made took steps to put an end to the happiness of earths first pair of lovers

the angelic solon swore he was going to introduce a bill in the legislature to turn the college into an insane asylum as the state could not provide for all the colored insane of the state

now the hon n f cleggett knew there were a large constituency throughout the state whose views of negro education may be expressed as follows industrial education for the negro is better than higher education but no education is still better than industrial education

he knew he would have backing that would bring him distinction even if the measure should fail it is not improbable that the hon cleggett was more anxious to boost himself politically than he was to ease his hearthurt over negro progress more zealous to find an issue that would keep him in the legislature and bring him into prominence than he was to break up rockford college he had seen other men rise to power by kicking the negro why might he not do the same

it is clear that no matter what mr cleggetts motives were his move to present such a bill at the coming session of the legislature might prove disastrous to rockford college since it was true that the state was under the necessity of providing additional accommodations for the large number of colored insane confined in poorhouses and jails the colored people of the state were apprehensive for rockford college delegations of colored men and petitions had been sent to every source of political influence in the state to avert the threatening evil holt saw the governor and everybody else with whom he had influence

it was a time to make every edge cut that would cut

now while it was true that the governor was holts supporter yet it was thought wise to send to him wilson who had no connection with the college his excellency was a member of our denominationâand a great stickler for his church before he was elected to his present post he had become very much interested in wilson as the pastor of our church wilson had asked the official to help us when we were building this he did quite liberally he in common with the white people of the region members of our denomination had great pride in our church and in wilson for these reasons holt asked our pastor to go and see the governor in behalf of rockford college

also fairfax was asked to see the attorneygeneral of the state

this official had got acquainted with fairfax in the gulf state wherein julias intended taught before coming to rockford

while conducting a case in the city in which fairfax taught the great lawyers life was saved by the young colored teacher he overheard a plot to waylay and murder the lawyer and fairfax by revealing what he knew caused the plot to fail the attorneygeneral thought a great deal of fairfax in consequence hence holts request that the young professor see the great man in the interest of maintaining the college

now both wilson and fairfax had sought to see the one the executive and the other the attorneygeneral who with the superintendent of public instruction constitute the state board of education

wilson got his excellencys classmate to write the governor asking for an interview but his private secretary wrote that his excellency was away and that wilson would be informed if he might call fairfax went to the capitol to see the attorneygeneral but the great lawyer was over ears in a great case he told fairfax to call again when the case was decided when that came to pass however that official was on a critical bed of typhoid fever

both wilson and fairfax therefore were doing that thing so hard to do they were waiting

instant in season and out

and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with himâex  

mrs harper with whom and her husband wilson made his home was in consequence of being a trained nurse much away from home her younger sister miss alma may montague kept house in the wifes absence and cared for alfred junior a chap in frocks alma was quite an attractive and interesting womanâthough not what id call a handsome girl she had however three beautiful features namely a pretty light mahogany color an abundant suit of hair as glossy as a ravens wing and a pretty mouth filled with perfect pearls

she was not a christian though a constant attendant on our church and sabbath school and a most doughty champion of our church and its pastor against all assailants

it was a foregone conclusion that wilson would strive to lead her to the cross he had ever since he went to harpers in season and out of season been instant in trying to bring miss montague into the fold the upshot of wilsons constant fervent pleading with the girl to give her heart to the savior was that she gave it to the preacher that she had done so was apparent to every one in the church except the earnest divine himself mom kitty was at our church one sunday morning it was the pastors custom after the service to shake hands with every single one of his congregation

when he shook hands with alma that morning mom kitty squeezed my arm to attract my attention to them and said dat gal sholy does love dat preacher all durin de preachin she set almos holdin her bref to ketch evry word he said an jes eatin him up wid her eyes

almas love for wilson after a time made her unhappy she knew he was not thinking of her in that way the pastor thought the girl was unhappy about her soul and so redoubled his efforts to lead her to the holy one while alma the meantime grew still more unhappy

three weeks after zeke had told us how he lost his deyconry isaac scattergood drove by and asked me to go out to his truck farm to see juddy hill who was sick i drove by harpers on my way out to get wilson to take him for a drive and to see the sick woman that was about three in the afternoon

as soon as wilson came to the buggy i saw at a glance i knew him so well that he was in the seventh heaven of spiritual fervor for he had on his face the look it wore when he was at his best in the pulpit i found he had just had a talk with alma which he was overjoyed to believe would lead her to the light

he gave the following account alma had finished her work changed her dress and was on the secluded vinesheltered side porch in a comfortable rocker resting after having cleared up the dinner dishes here wilson found her and pleaded with her to give herself to the savior explaining that she had only to take him at his word as in all the relationships of life we every day take men at their word said he alma i am but a poor sinful mortal yet if i told you that i loved you and asked you to surrender your heart and life to me you know me well enough to know that i would not disappoint you now here is the saviorâperfect sinless and loving you so much as to die for you why will you not trust him alma you would trust me if i told you that i loved youâwhy will you not surrender to him

when i said that he went on rapturously she burst into tears and the next moment threw her apron over her face and rushed upstairs to her room

i had a struggle to keep from laughing in his face i was sure it was human affection and not as he supposed divine love that made alma flee his presence but wilson the dear fellow with his head in the cloudsâhe didnt see the situation he did not see that alma loved him and that his personal appeal had stirred up her feelings and under the circumstances i would not for the world have disillusioned him for to have done so would have rendered him selfconscious and turned him aside from trying to lead alma to the fold

sure enough events proved that i was right

i am sure wilson expected that alma would find peace by the time we returned from scattergoods when we arrived at harpers gate she came tripping down the walk to the buggy wilsons excitement was visible he thought she was coming to tell us of her newfound joy instead of that she began in brisk breezy manner to talk commonplaceâasking after juddy hill and belle poor wilsons spirits went down to zero he was so disappointed that he did not get out of the buggy but went on down town with me

when moses came down from sinai from holding communion with jehovah the lawgivers face shone but he knew it not wilsons face shone from a like communion i loved him because it did and he knew it not i was quite anxious that he should lead alma to the cross she was a fine girl and all the church folks loved her

yes i was anxious that our pastor should succeed in bringing her into the kingdom but nevertheless belle and i had many a good laugh that night at wilsons holy blindness to almas love

a little child shall lead them 

a little child shall lead themâtsa it

it was wednesday i went to scattergoods friday i had to go out again besides this i had an engagement to take wilson out to the poorhouse jeter had sufficiently got oer his jimjams to know he was very sick he feared he was going to die and strange to say begged to have not granville but wilson to come and see him this my pastor had several times done

about three oclock friday afternoon on my way back from scattergoods i stopped by harpers for wilson but he was out alma knew not where dressed up as if she expected a visitor i found alma on the vineclad secluded side porch she was alone except for alfred junior a pretty chubby hazelnut colored chap in frocks as i sat talking to alma where i found her alfred left off playing with his tin soldiers and came to me and resting his elbows on my knees he silently for a while fixed his dreamy eyes in my face then he startled me by saying decisively dr wade you is a lie

alfred chided alma you mustnt be naughty

well auntie piped he in injured tones didnt you say at folks at dont do like they say they is goin to do âdidnt you said las week they is a lie

yes pet hut you must not be rude and speak like that to dr wade

well persisted the little logician in kilts he promised me a penny las week an he aint gie it to me he owes me my penny

oh ho little man said i stooping down and kissing the child and laughing at his holding me to my promise thou are more righteous than i now sir you shall have your penny and more too

i gave him a tencent piece

no sooner did the little fellow feel the dime in his chubby fist than he bounded off the porch to go to a nearby store

what do you say to dr wade she called after the fleeing urchin at whom we were both laughing

fank you dr wade an much obliged tool came back the sweet baby voice

when he saw my horse at the gate he called auntie im goin to buy cake bosses today but when i git a man im goin to buy sho nough bosses real meat bosses auntie

all right darling she laughingly answered him her voice full of love

we heard his little bare feet slapping the unpaved sidewalk as he hied toward the corner grocery in his own eyes a multimillionaire

i looked in silence for a moment into almas eyes and slowly said and a little child shall lead them

there is faith for you alma what a pity that we dont all take god at his word and just depend on his promises as a little child holds you to your word

for a moment she looked in silence on the floor then lifting to my gaze a face full of feeling she asked irrelevantly did mr wilson tell you anything day before yesterday 

he told me he had been having a talk with you he wholly misunderstood however why you rushed upstairs and left him

how do you know why i did you werent here she said her mood entirely changing

in response to her changed moodâand i suppose she detected the mischievous twinkle in my eyesâi said no i wasnt here but still i know why you rushed upstairs

how do you know youre always prying around into something

no i didnt pry into that havent you been talking to julia and doesnt julia talk to belle indeed dont you yourself talk to belle

thats the way with married women snapped she they cant keep a thing

ive been on the point several times of telling mr wilson which way the wind is blowing said i with a quiet smile

no dont you if you do dr wade i declare ill never speak to you again flared she rising to her feet in her excitement

keep cool keep cool girlie im just joking

i declare laughed she shamefacedly at betraying her feelings thats why a girl cant keep up her friendships with married women they tell their husbands alt they know

you dont mind my knowing do you

no use if i do youre always prying into things

no little girl i dont pry i just open my eyes and see what is to be seen ive seen for some time that you are in love with your pastor

my pastor i have no pastor she said sadly no you have not but i trust you soon will have oh alma let little alfred teach you you have only to take christ at his word and love him back again for his love to you

cant you will you not do that alma

with deep feeling she answered i will try dr wade

a sunday in june

all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame are but the ministers of love and feed his sacred flame

âcoleridge

a rare day in june was the sunday following the friday i had the talk with alma zeke brown was visiting our church fulfilling the promise made to our pastor decoration day though president holt was preaching that morning for rev walter granville except mrs holt who was with her husband the rest of the norwalkers were at our church this perfect day in june and a goodsized congregation besides

i felt sure mr wilson had prepared his sermon with almas need on his heart i felt sure of this as soon as he began to preach this is the text god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life

for nearly threequarters of an hour we hung on the preachers spiritbreathed words i could see the quivering of almas whole frame at times the fountains of the great deep of her soul were broken up in closing the pastor used the same illustration he used with alma on the vineclad secluded porch tall walnutcolored thin and refined of feature i can see him now in the fervor of appeal lean gracefully forward both hands extended as he said i am but a poor sinful mortal yet if i should tell you that i loved you and should ask you to surrender your hearts and lives to me you know me well enough to know that if you did this so far as my ability goes i would not disappoint you must i say why will you not trust the sinless savior who is all love and all power no i need not say that you do trust him  you do surrender to him  i know you do you cannot but surrender to one so tender so loving

how thrilling was his voice

i saw a wave of feeling go over the congregation almas whole frame quivered down dropped her head on the back of the pew in front of her she was on her feet the next instant her hands clasped out high tremulously her musical voice rang out blessed savior i do surrender tis all i can do

down she sank in the arms of her sister in the pew with her the effect was electrical sobs could be heard all over the congregation

how they did sing the closing hymn rock of ages then followed the benediction

rockford colored people in general believed in noisy emotional demonstration the more demonstration the more piety was the prevailing notion during his ministry wilson sought to teach his flock better but his teaching was put to a severe test that morning for when services closed they made a joyful noise unto the lord over almas conversion

our church was like one family

from group to group the happy girl went shaking hands receiving an embrace here bestowing one yonder among those who had long known and loved her alma received an embrace from each relic and julia and bestowed one on fairfax and myself but i was amused to see that she gave wilson who was in ecstasy only a handshake

zeke brown made plenty of noise over almaâde darter of my ole frien a chile ive knowed befo she knowed herself later as we were going home when he was about to turn off from our party consisting of julia fairfax belle and myself he said when alma hugged me today hit done ma very soul good humph i hope ill be at you alls chucli when some mo goodlookin gals gits religion ef dey all is gwine to do dat away

we laughed at this

when zeke was gone i said to julia what did you say to brother wilson when i saw you go up to him that made him start and look at alma so strangely i hope you didnt tell him that she learned to love the savior by first learning to love him

no replied she im not a man and so i didnt put it that way

what did you say asked fairfax

i congratulated him on the fact that alma had learned the divine love by what she knew of the human she replied

well thats the same thing and i am sure from the way he looked and acted he understood it replied her lover

i wanted him to know answered julia

said i oh julia how could you disillusion himâ and that too today when he is on the mountain topi im sure he has not thought of alma except as one to lead to the master

replied belle but alma loves him and though he doesnt know it its my opinion that mr wilson loves her why are men so blind

men so blind laughed fairfax ive known women to be blind i knew one lady that needed a runaway horse to open her eyes

oh you you pouted belle pointing her finger in smiling protest at fairfax while the rest of us laughed at her discomfiture

said i one thing is certain brother wilson will not longer be blind to alinas feelings

i just hope something will happen to open his eyes to his own heart for alma would make a fine pastors wife said belle

said i there you goâmatchmaking

no no matches are made in heavenâthat is the happy ones she answered

the happy ones who makes the unhappy ones then asked fairfax

i dont believe they are made in heaven stoutly maintained belle

ho ho madame darling laughed the professor well have to have you up for heresy for thats mighty poor theology and still poorer logic if all things are not controlledâunhappy marriages too then some uncontrollable thing might upset some decreed matter what becomes of the divine sovereignty if gods plan can be upset as mens can

oh get out with your logic said belle cornered

we are talking about love not logic put in julia what has logic to do with love

not a thing he answered with unction his eyes in julias

if it had thered not be a ghost of a chance for a fellow like me

her answering look indicated that he had more than a ghost of a chance with her when nature that glorious june day was in tune with our happy hearts how sweet seemed love and the beautiful sermon and almas new beautiful joy helped us to know more of divine love by what we knew of pure human affection

as we turned up the street leading to our home a sight met us that made julia and belle instinctively cling close to fairfax and myself evidently jeter horns recuperative powers had been underestimated quite as evidently he had broken out of the poorhouse for stepping high and wide down the middle of the street his arms held up as a hen lifts her wings when about to fly came jeter crazy drunk barefooted his hat in one hand his head thrown back his eyes rolling staring glassy ghastly i a profanation of the holy calm of that glorious sabbath day was the delirious rigmarole he was getting off in a voice highkeyed and loud im a man you dont see every day circumstances alters cases skimmed milk masquerades fo cream de bottom rail done got on top fo de niggas whose daddies was branded wid deir marstas name like cattle done got eggucation an is actin jest like whiete folks an ole jeta horn is glad to see his color a risin in de worl ef he is gwine down hissef

goodmornin ladies an gentmuns he addressed us bowing profoundly and swinging low his hat gawd bless de ladies dont dey look sweet jes like fine whiete folks

whatever else he would have said was cut short by the clatter of the police patrol wagon which thundered around the corner after the crazed old sot

with a bloodcurdling shriek he started to run but was soon overtaken and carried yelling back to the poorhouse to be guarded thereafter more carefully lest he should again break out and find the means of getting drunk

the streets at the time of his arrest were filled with people of both races going home from church and the exhibition that jeter made in the face of all rockford for there were as many as six churches in the neighborhood of his arrest made us ashamed for our race

as for me it filled me fullâfull of thought

zeke browns vision

which things are an allegoryâgal 

the next day when late in the afternoon i saw zeke brown in the park he said to me ive been thinkin all day long bout dat sermont i heerd at you alls chuch yestiday an bout alma her daddy jim montague an me was fellow sarvants an jes like bruthers she looks like her daddy an shes got fine feelins an a sweet voice jes like him

when she fessed yestiday her voice fotch up to my mind jim montague an ole times

if she is the daughter of your dead friend i can understand how happy it made you to see her start for the kingdom

yas in deed when i heered dat chiles voice yestiday so full o feelin hit brung up ole times when me an jim used to make up shouts an sing em i tell you what it is jim montague was a shout songster shos you bon fact is de white folks said jim was some sort o poet he made up one piece o potry dat i liked so well dat i learnt hit by heart an i used to speak it so much dat one night i had a dream an i dreampt dat i spoke hit to de whiete folks i tole my dream an de people said i had done had a rale vision like de ole bible prophets used to have den de folks gun to call me prophet

i knew he was called prophet hut supposed it was because of his name and i said as much to him

no sail replied he i spose id a been a preacher dis very minute ef it hadnt been fo dat ole nigga jeta âthis with warmth

how so i asked

oh cause when he knocked me outen my deyconry he knocked me outen bein a preacher too dat nigga sholy he has bin in my way in dis worl

i hope you dont hate him

no doctor wade i dont hate ole jeta but i dont love im hit takes so much of my strength grinned he to keep fum hatin him i aint got none lef to love him wid

i chuckled over this

his mood immediately shifting in a low dreamy voice he continued ef my liza had o lived id jes had to leave rockford hit nigh bout kilt me to see her wid dat low down man an me fairly warshippin de very groun she walked on a dreamin an a dreamin bout her night an day

you see me gwine bout laffin an runnin on so but dr wade hit peers like to me i jes cant git over liza nobody but gawd knows how i has cried in my heart

i felt my throat tighten

mingled with the old mans plaintive voice the music of a nearby playing fountain fell on the balmy june air where in a secluded spot we sat on a park bench beneath a lordly beechtree whose top was glorified by the setting sun

i asked him to tell me the dream which the folks had called a vision he informed me that he had had it written down so as not to forget and offered to let me read the manuscript but i wanted to hear it in his own picturesque dialect so i got him to promise to let me see the manuscript later from the manuscript and the narrative hot from his lips i am able to give the following account of zeke browns vision

he was keenly alive alike to the humor and pathos of it

as has been said he was a capital storyteller it follows therefore that no reproduction in cold type can do justice to the old mans dramatic rendition of what the folks called his vision

zeke brown had a way of pulling his mustache when he was about to tell a tale when you go fishing if you wish to catch anything even if you have good bait you must keep quiet i kept quiet when he began after his mustache with good bait zekes own vanity and by keeping quiet by tactful angling i was at last able to land the following story hit was a long time ago dat i seed de vision or ruther dat i had de dream

this statement is to be credited for the manuscript brought me later was yellow with age

hit was durin de time i was in my deyconryâin fac i was in de highday of my deyconry i dont know how i come to dream de vision les twas our eldaânot granville he want knee high to a duck denâgin dat sunday night a mighty powerful sermont bout satan showin chris all de kingdoms of de yearth an said all dese will i give you ef youll only fall down an warshup me

âsonnet xxixâshakespeare

i am afraid wilson felt a trifle chagrined over his labors with alma when he found out that she loved him

at first he was disposed to doubt her profession he said to me i was thinking only of christ while she was thinking only of me

oh no said i i dont think that i think rather that her love for you taught her what it is to love the saviour

thats what julia told me at church he replied

thats what your church folks all believe said i and it seems to me you are to be congratulated that it is so

a pained look came into his face

you misunderstand me i quickly assured him what i mean to say is that i think you are to be congratulated that you are able to inspire a pure young woman with such a love as leads her to give her heart to the saviour

my pastor said nothing to this his long silence seemed to indicate that a new idea had dawned on him

i had this conversation with him wednesday following the beautiful sabbath

as time went on alma was so differentâwilson living in the house with her had abundant opportunity to mark this differenceâthat no one knowing her could doubt that she had experienced a change of heart the young preacher ceased to feel chagrined that so interesting a young woman was in love with him when alma rang the true gold of the kingdom although he declared that he was not interested in any woman

he saw just as much of alma now as he did when in season and out he besought her to surrender herself to the master

that young lady must however have made some discovery about the preacher who persisted in declaring that he had no interest in any woman for almas love ceased to make her unhappy as it had formerly done

belle had said that she hoped something would happen to open our pastors eyes to his heart well that something did happen

monday the fifteenth of july rev walter granvilles church gave a steamboat excursion down the river now who does not know that colored folks love watermelon chicken and excursions well if they love these three things more than the white people it is doubtful if they get more of the three things than the white people do

negroes are often scolded for the money expended on summer excursions it is not to be forgotten that they have fewer outlets for pleasure than white people have indeed while we laugh over the fact that colored people go to funerals as recreationâthat is certain classes of themâyet it remains true that the negro church furnishes the principal pleasurable occasions open to the race all the public amusements open to white people of the south are closed to the people of color

the foregoing prepared for the announcement that rev granvilles church picnic carried an immense crowd  chicken chicken and chicken and so many watermelons that a colored green grocer a droll wag said  watermillions is gone up in price cause so many darkeys has gone down de river

wilson was the only one of our coterie left in town it will be understood that he would hardly care to go on granvilles excursion alma did not care to go with the harpers but with belle and myself so that she could be with julia

we had a most delightful time fairfax and his sweetheart were so happy that everybody remarked about it it was an open secret that they were to be married after the opening in september of rockford college so that the faculty and such students as they desired to be present might attend the marriage which was to be an elegant home affair

mom kitty who was standing with belle blake warren pogue and myself remarked looking at fairfax and julia aint dem chillun happy

yes replied blake with a sigh very happy indeed

hit does my soul good to see em so happy continued she with sweet motherliness

a look flashed between belle and myself as we saw pogue flush in silence while around handsome blakes mouth lurked a sardonic smile apropos of julias engagement a white man one of the trustees of rockford college remarked at commencement i cant see why she accepted the blackest one of all her suitors

blake was julias own color while pogue looked what he was he was dr warren pogues son and his mother was an octoroon mrs holt i fear held the white mans view about her stepdaughters preference but who can give the why of any womans choice or for that matter of any hearts choice of a mate

we had a most delightful day off on the historic river and in the pleasant wood where the picnic was held the excursionists were due in rockford at seven oclock that evening but we did not get hack until ninethirty the cause of this is that we had a slight breakdown this however was soon repaired but when the news of the trifling accident reached town it had grown as traveling news has a trick of doing out of all semblance of the truth the rumor of our mishap gathered as it rolled so that when it reached rockford this is the size of it the boat has sunk lots of folks have been drowned 

now although the exact truth came lagging into town some time after the wildeyed dishevelled rumor nevertheless when our steamboat sided up to the wharf a large anxious crowd were awaiting it

wilson was in the assemblage the rumor that had smitten colored rockford had evidently hit my dear pastor and classmate so hard as to open his blinded eyes to his own heart zeke brown told me afterwards in great glee i seed elda wilson gwine down town like ole satan was arter him  t tried to run on wid him fo walkin so fast i saed hold on dah eldaâtake yo time dont you know you is free you is dressed up like a white man but runnin like a nigga jake simpson said to me hush man dont you know de boat done sunk

dat was de fust o my bearin de news but lawsee man elda wilson was gwine down town dat fas dat he didnt pay a bit mo tention to me dan a rabbit well to make a long story short de elda had a carriage at the wharf and then and there wilson did the only ungenerous thing i ever knew him to do

mr and mrs harper were there ready to go home he had a doublehorse fourseated landau did my pastor offer mr and mrs harper seats in his carriage not a bit of it he took only alma home in it afterwards he told me in high feather that although the hackman drove like jehu nevertheless before they got to harpers gate it was all settled that his convert over whom he had worked so faithfully was to be his wife

wade old boy i dont blame you folks for laughing at me as i look back over my experience with alma i have to laugh at myself but wade old fellow im not blind now alma is as zeke brown would say jes de sweetis thing dat evah drawed breath

we were all happy in our dear pastors happiness

hamlet

soon after rockford commencement the hon nathan f cleggett had been moved by his hurt of heart over negro uplifting to vow to introduce a bill in the coming session of the legislature to turn the institution into an asylum for the colored insane now confined in jails

the proposal of this magnanimous solon had been pretty thoroughly ventilated by the state press since commencement this chivalrous gentleman was evidently seeking popularity by kicking the negro but the highsouled lawmaker found that he was about to miss his aim the trouble was that this gallant member of the assembly proposed to kick the black man too hard there were a large class of people whose sense of fair play would not allow them to stand for kicking the people of color of the state still others felt that the state would be ashamed in the eyes of the nation by such an injustice yet another class believed that while negro education both lower and higher is a gratuity nevertheless that it is beneath the dignity of the anglosaxon to withhold this boon from those he considers his inferiors still another class felt that negroes must be uplifted by the white people or else they would drag the white people down

by autumn the statesman cleggett was thoroughly convinced that in threatening to turn rockford into an insane asylum he had bitten off more than he could chew just as thoroughly was he convinced that if he was to make the port for which he had set sail namely to land in the harbor of political prominence and power he must tack and tack quick to catch the strong wind of public opinion

this he did

he saw that the people of the state were against his chivalrous proposal to pluck up rockford college by the roots if he was not to be relegated to his native obscurity he must find some way to let himself down easy and still on his feet well now how did this great friend of the pepul manage to let himself down easy simply enough

he told the absolute truth he said his primary desire was not the destruction of rockford college that was the truth but and this was not his real object was to focus attention on rockford college so that the white people could decide whether or not it was wise to spend money for negro higher education when the state had so many other demands upon it

the springing of the negro higher education issue was a master stroke it brought the feline lawmaker down on his feet not only easy but firm to change the figure he found his sail bellied with the strong wind of popular approval he felt sure that by january he who proposed that rockford college should cease to be a college and become simply an industrial normal school he felt sure that the man who championed the measure would certainly make the harbor yes this political tumble bug and you know the tumble bug works in filth it rolls together a ball of filth in which it deposits its eggs had by kicking a lowly people secured his future

of course as holt and the colored people had put forth most strenuous efforts to keep rockford from being turned into an asylum so now they had done all in their power to keep it from being turned into simply a normal and industrial school

to avert the destruction of rockford fairfax had seen the attorneygeneral and wilson the kindhearted governor the latter gentleman notwithstanding his theory that negro education is a gratuity was quite hot in his opposition to converting the college into an asylum

he went so far as to say that any white gentleman and gentleman in his mouth meant aristocrat ought to be above advocating any such scheme now the hon nathan f cleggett was one of the souths new men zeke brown called him one o dem rich poo white folks dat aint used to nothint all

the governors outspoken opposition to cleggetts project led holt to expect the support of the chief executive and the aristocrats in retaining rockfords college department

when the president saw his excellency however holt found him noncommittal on the higher education question he said to my classmate im a friend to your race and to the school but since the white people pay most of the taxes you people had better let well enough alone about rockford college youd better let the taking out of the college course alone for fear the white people will get angry and tear up the whole school by the roots as mr cleggett first proposed

you can imagine that after hearing the most staunch champion of our school talk that way you can imagine that holt did not have much hope of retaining the college course however the president thought it wise to do his best to avert the change threatened so he had asked both fairfax and wilson to go to the capital

waiting were the professor and the minister to be sent for in the interest of retaining rockfords higher course

twas monday september twentysixth rockford college had been in session three weeks autumn has been sung thus the melancholy days have come the saddest of the year

but it was of a northern autumn and the month of november too at that which bryant sang as the melancholy days

you could hardly get any rockforder certainly not any one with any sense of beauty in his or her soul to agree that these closing days of september were the saddest of the year no for the frosts had turned the forests into a fairyland of gold and green a variegated mass of color that beneath the cloudless sunshine reminded one of the eleysian fields of the classic greeks

now whoever else might regard those autumn days as melancholy it is certain that professor fairfax and miss julia holt did not so regard those days which witnessed the issuing of their wedding invitations

these went out on wednesday the twentieth in the holt home which had been tastefully decorated for the occasion the grand affair was to take place thursday the twentyninth in the parlor in the recess of the large baywindow the bride and groom standing under a flower bell and facing the window where was to stand the celebrant of the marriage president david j holt i wonder how a man feels marrying his own daughter several were to wait on the couple but wilson was to be the best man and alma best maid julias sisters olga and gladys aged six and seven were to be flower girls while on the piano in the broad hall down into which came the wide stairway belle was to play the wedding march from lohengrin

two hundred invitations had been given to the house announcement cards were to be issued everybody of note in colored rockford society some students and all the faculty of rockford college were bidden mrs holt wanted to have a wedding supper but her husband said he was satisfied that the refreshments should be cake and cream the new couple were to have a room in rockford college as all the teachers for the sake of discipline were required to do

monday night september twentysixth belle gave a bridesmaids tea i called it a henparty because belle decreed that no man should be presentânot even myself

julia mrs holt alma all the bridesmaids and even little olga and gladys were present they had a fine supper and a jolly time

of course the affair came off early in the evening

holt was to go over for his wife and little girls but julia was to stay all night with belle

that very morning wilson and fairfax had been called to the state capitol in the interest of rockford college higher course

a wedding gift

et heed thou wisely these give seldom to thy better for such obtrusive boon shall savor of presumption

moreover heed then this give to thine equal charily

the romans and the greeks worshipped idols of wood and stone

the dog the cat the bullâthese were gods among the still more refined ancient egyptians

why did so refined a folk as the greeks bow down to wood and stone why were the wonderfully artistic ancient dwellers on the nile such gross nature worshippers

at first blush this may seem strange but you have only to look around you to see the reason why these peoples bowed down before objects so ignoble both the dwellers in hellas and those on the nile bowed before objects at first intended as symbols of either the deity or of some benevolent or malevolent power of supposed divine origin but after the lapse of time the idea which was symbolized was forgotten then there remained nothing but the symbol

in all religious and social affairs how easy it is to forget the idea for which a form or symbol stands  how easy it is to degenerate into holding on simply to forms and symbols

these holidaysâthanksgiving christmas and easterâwhat are they to the vast majority but empty symbols meaningless ceremonies idealess heartless forms 

so it is with many social customs a wedding gift ought to mean love how often it means fearâthe fear of being considered short if one is not sent when an invitation is received

how often wedding invitations are sent out in the spirit of greed this is frequently just as surely the meaning of a wedding invitation as if it was printed on that invitation please bring or send a present silver is preferred

holt insisted that julias invitations should be verbal he said to me i told myrtle that she wanted to send cards to everybody she ever heard of so as to reap a rich harvest of presents julia feels about the matter as i do

now it cannot be denied that even a few verbal invitations brought in a rich harvest of presents but while there was some toadying as there will be on all such occasions yet what president holt said is a fair indication that the fairfaxholt verbal invitations were not sent in the highwayman spirit of stand and deliver

but as has been said among colored people as among white folks there is plenty of toadying some thereforesent presents to the presidential residence of rockford college principally because it would never do in the world not be to be connected with the wedding of the accomplished daughter of a college president who was to give her hand to one of the most brilliant men of the race

some other presents were sent by people not in what may be called the social four hundred but by people who wished to pay their respects to the college president who did not think the lowliest of his race beneath his notice and to show love for the kind hearted mother and the lovely brideelect who had helped so many by sympathy and material giftsânot letting the left hand know what the right did

how did i know about julias presents do you ask well i saw them daily

the girls matron mrs ada harmon was a welltodo widow in middle life whose husband left her a wellstocked farm rather left her and her only child a girl of nine

mrs harmon during the vacation had so given her energy to the superintendence of her farm that she returned to rockford at the opening of the term run down physically and mentally typhoid fever had fastened upon her by the time the invitations were out and consequently i was at rockford college sometimes twice a day to see mrs harmon both julia and her parents if i visited the presidential residence showed me the gifts that came inârich and quite varied were the gifts displayed on a large mahogany table in a corner of the parlor on the opposite side of the hall from the parlor in whose baywindow the ceremony was to be performed

monday night the twentysixth mrs harmon grew worse and a messenger was sent for me who arrived at my house just as president holt drove up in a closed carriage to take his wife and little girls home from the bridesmaids tea

i always hate to hitch up my horse that i would have had to do that night if i drove over to the college for my boy had gone home president and mrs holt offered me a seat in their carriage but i declined because i feared id crush the little girls dresses if all of us crowded into the carriage but rather than either to hitch up my horse or to walk to rockford college i accepted holts invitation to go with him by climbing up and riding with the hackman when we got to the college holt went into the house and hurried the little girls off to bed while mrs holt went on into the college building with me into the sick room

you know in typhoid fever the temperature rises at night mrs harmons would continue to rise higher each night until the disease reached its climax hers had not yet reached its crisis i was not therefore alarmed at her condition so did what i could to relieve her and to reassure those who attended the sick lady

i had accompanied mrs holt to the steps of their porch and was about to return to town when she urged me to come to see the very handsome present from mr warren pogue which had been received just before she julia and the little girls had started to my house for tea holt from the porch heard her invitation and went into the parlor where the presents were and lit the gas

we three were standing at the mahogany table admiring pogues present a handsome tea service that must have cost twentyfive dollars when mrs holts eyes fell on a bundleâa present that must have arrived even since the husband went to town after the wife and little girls hastily she tore open the bundle the present proved to be from zeke brown certainly not one of rockfords four hundred he had sent a gift that expressed his appreciation of the kindly notice of him by the holts and the norwalk coteries sympathetic hearing of his tale of how he lost what he called my deyconry he had had retouched an old likeness of the wife of his youth this he had put in a silver frame

my lost eliza was written on a card tacked in one side of the frame

our three heads together we gazed on that photograph then in silence we looked into each others astonished eyes

mrs holt broke the silence now dave what did i tell you

her lips quivered

look at that chin joe wade dont you see thats guss mother ive told you dave holt a hundred times that augustus fairfax is jeter horns son

and down she flung herself in tears in a chair

there was no denying what she said the likeness between the pictured face and fairfaxs was too startling to be accounted for in any other way i had suspected the truth holt had too nevertheless we were deeply moved as we stood gazing at each other and at mrs holt weeping in the chair suddenly she leaped to her feet and pointing a finger at her husband said in a voice hoarse with feeling dave holt if you had listened to me julia would be engaged to someone else

i saw holts back stiffen myrtle calm yourself came in measured masterful tones

ive told you a dozen times that gus is no stranger to us we know what he is no matter who his father is and julia herself shall decide whether or not she will marry him

my god old drunken jeter horns son for my soninlaw she cried wringing her hands and flinging herself into a chair

myrtle be careful of what you say you will be sorry for your words some day

oh dave if you had only listened to me if you had only just listened 

well if i had my dear how would that have helped the matter

moaned she oh julia might have been engaged to someone else

yes to warren pogue and you know you would be perfectly satisfied if she were although he too is a drunkards son

she leaped to her feet and said as she flashed out of the room dave you know i am not prejudiced to color

i thought it was time for me to leave too as i went towards the steps holt wrung my hand and asked joe dont you think im right to let julia decide for herself

i do indeed holt and furthermore i think the thing to do is to keep quiet fairfax has not the slightest suspicion of the truth  neither has zeke for he thinks jeters lost child is a girl i wouldnt even tell julia about it if she does not discover it from the picture so wellâso good if she does then id let her decide for herself

those are just my views of it joe

wringing my hand he said joe i am burdened burdened come in to see us when you come over in the morning now goodnight joe i must go and hunt up myrtle

goodnight i replied holding his hand in a long silent clasp

the night was crisp and cloudless

i too was burdened as i started to walk home where julia was with my wife i hoped belle and i never would have such a disagreement as i had just witnessed between my friends

as i walked beneath the silver stars i thought that if they control human fate as the ancients said they do i felt that the stars were busy very busy that night with the fate the happiness of holt and his wife and of julia and her affianced

who could tell what a day would bring forth

i saw nothing of julia nor of belle either that night for they slept together however i heard aplenty of them both for girl like belle and julia talked nearly all night

my thoughts about what i had on my heart however kept me awake rather than the droning of the voices in an adjoining room

much land yet to be possessed

there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed

josn 

yes so long i kept awake monday night between the burden on my heart and the talking of belle and julia that i overslept myself tuesday morning

when i got up the boy had made the fire attended to the horse and belle had almost got breakfast everything was all straight in the house though we had had a party because belle had got sister adeline hood as it was her custom to do in an emergency to help her clean up my wife would not let me get a cook for her though i was willing and able to do so colored people dont usually like to work for their own color they feel it to be a humiliation to do so then too some colored employers are so afraid that a domestic will encroach on their dignity that welltodo colored employers often prove the hardest masters

what with the colored employers morbid fear for their dignity and the feeling of the average wage earner that it is a humiliation to work for ones own color as big a bugaboo as the domestic servant question is with white employers it is a still bigger one with colored people who must employ help southern people have generated a good bit of heat over the domestic servant question one lady of rockford wrote a newspaper article in which she blamed all the troubles on negro education

asked she quite bitterly in this article are white men going to continue to educate negroes when their wives have to go into the kitchen because you cant get a decent negro that has been educated to be a domestic

there is no use in any ones getting red in the face over the fact the foregoing questions revealed what fact does the query reveal  this that no negro becomes a domestic if that person can find other employment

now ought any one to blame people of color for prefering not to be servants especially if they have by education been fitted to work for themselves white people that can do something else do not prefer to be domestics and human nature is but human nature

there are however special reasons why no negro becomes a servant if she or he can help it

one is that slavery has dishonored manual toil in the south white people are quite sensitive about the matter of manual laborâindeed so much so that it is almost impossible to get white men and women to engage in certain kinds of manual labor which for time immemorial has been done by dusky hands now while both white and black southern folks are learning to set a higher estimate on manual toil yet with reference to the matter of their estimate of labors dignity there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed

then too another thing that makes the servant question a burning one is that in the south domestic wages are poor and the souths treatment of the dusky domestics is what might be expected from employers less than a half century from negro slavery because dixie has been living on hams enforced labor and has had the sunkissed folk wholly at her mercy the southland has no deep sense of how poorly she pays and how badly she treats her domestics slavery in the master class fosters emperious arrogance and in the slave class servility so that it is not strange that the south is impatient that the negro domestic is disposed to resent now treatment that dixie from time out of memory has thought it her privilege to mete out to her black toilers

now while it is true that stern necessity the fruitful mother of invention has taught anglosaxons that live south of masons and dixons line much about payment and treatment of negro domestics that the white people of this section never knew before appomattox yet nevertheless as regards wages and treatment of servants for the southern people there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed

the whole servant question is a matter of the golden rule if people will only in imagniation put themselves in the domestics place pay them better and treat them better they will get a higher grade of domestics and so better service for less and less will it be true that only the least intelligent and least reliable element of the race will hire out in domestic service

i had a boy to attend my horse bring in water and fuel and to make fires but belle preferred to do her own housework a white woman in her position would think her dignity demanded at least one if not two servants that is why a southern negro that does mental work will often save money on an income on which a southern white man in like position will barely eke out an existence

o fond dove

let me alone the dream is my own and the heart is full of rest

jean ingelow

as i started to say belle leaving julia in the guest chamber when i got up had breakfast almost ready

i went into my office intending to go into the kitchen to greet my wife but i was beguiled to sit down at my work to skim my medical journal i had barely time to open it when belle heard me and my heavens last best gift to man came rushing into my office plumped her little self on my knee and gave me such a soulful labial morning salutation as makes life worth living

belle left me to return to the kitchen upon putting my hand in my breast coat pocket i fished out two letters that my wife had given me the night before to post the cat would be out of the bag about my lapse of memory if i called the boy to mail them instead therefore i put on my hat and softly stepped out to go to the star mail box two squares down the street opposite mccalls tobacco factory

an early accident to a laborer at this factory however deprived me of the pleasure of breakfasting with the two sweet ladies at my house my services were called for a boy who had got his leg broken by an elevator i sent home for my satchel containing what i needed with word to belle not to wait breakfast for me

it was nine oclock by the time i had done what i could for the injured youth and returned home as i entered the gate i heard belle accompany julia in o fair dove o fond dove unseen by either of them i stole by the back hall up to the halfopen parlor door and through the crack saw belles shapely fingers gliding carelessly over the piano keys while as the cloudless morning flooded the beautiful parlor with her head thrown back her eyes looking into vacancy stood julia facing me her mellow contralto voice flooding the air with these dreamy words of that plaintive song my love he stood at my right hand his eyes were grave and sweet methought he said in this fair land o is it thus we meet

ah maid most dear i am not here i have no place no part no dwelling more by sea or shore but only in thy heart

o fair dove o fond dove

till night rose oer the bourne the dove on the mast as we sailed fast did mourn and mourn and mourn

the perfect sympathetic accompaniment the rapt tense pose and the feeling surcharged voice of the singerâhow it all thrilled me was that song of hopeless love prophetic would julia be a fair fond mourning dove when she came to know what i already knew

these reflections were cut short however when the piano ceased and i was discovered eavesdropping and overwhelmed with questions about the accident and with sympathy for not having had my breakfast even as belle hurried off to get my dejeuner word came that the closed carriage julia had ordered to take her home at halfpast eleven would be on hand according to order

often colored people complain that the element of the race that are most intelligent and lawabiding get scant notice by the southern newspaper press whereas the disreputable and criminal element are kept constantly before the public gaze

while it is to be feared that in this matter there is method in the souths madness nevertheless the thing complained of is not to be set down wholly to race prejudice

its a fact patent to careful observers that the best things and people never figure as largely in the public prints as do things and persons less worthy the reason of this is that goodness the every day the usual do not constitute news but rather what is unusual and out of the ordinary history says one is an account not of the doings but of the undoings of men accordingly some one else has said blessed is the nation whose annals are brief brief are the annals of rome during the age of the antoines one of the happiest eras of the roman empire

blessed indeed therefore are those days in ones life when there is no news because nothing unusual has happened but instead the current of ones life has flowed uninterruptedly on until something interrupts the flow of ones life we are apt to forget how placid is that flow and to underestimate the strength of the current so too we may underrate the depth and strength of the stream of love until the current encounters let or hindrance

above the falls where the niagara river is not interrupted that stream is placid and commonplaceânot unlike a thousand other rivers of the world but niagara interrupted by its sheer leap down a precipice of one hundred and sixty feet becomes a world wonder sublime and aweinspiring

julias love as i saw it at nine oclock when in mellow voice she poured out o fond doveâjulias love was calm and ordinary but niagara falls magnificent in power did i behold julias love at twelve oclock in her fathers house

my services at mc calls factory made me late in all my morning work hence it was that julias carriage went up the hill to the campus in front of me as i was making my usual morning visit to mrs harmon having seen that lady i was about to drop into holts to talk over matters as the night before my friend had requested me to do

he spied me from his office in the college building and as the dinner bell had rung he made his way home also mrs holt saw me coming and was coming to let me in so that she her husband and myself met in the broad hall she in the door of the north parlor and holt and myself by the door of the south parlor

in the instant of our meeting julia was coming down the broad stairs to meet her father whom she had not seen since last night she had zeke browns present the picture in her hand and in her hazel eyes now dark with feeling the humiliating discovery that her affianced is elizas child and therefore old drunken disreputable jeter horns lost son evidently her lovers likeness to eliza and his mental resemblance to jeter which she had noted so often with uneasiness she could explain upon no other hypothesis than that her promised husband was the lost child and that zeke brown was mistaken in supposing that lost child was a girl now the holts were proud of their familys respectability evidently then when the unwelcome truth that she was bound by promise to the besotted paupers son was thrust upon the proud girl she fled to her room taking the picture with her there to fight her battle alone

now coming to meet her father with the humbling news she was at the foot of the steps the fateful present in her trembling grasp there all four of us stood in silence

julias eyes began to travel backward and forward between her stepmother standing in the door of the north parlor and her father and myself standing in the door of the south parlor what in her mothers face did the girl discover in the face of the mother who all along had been tacitly opposed to fairfax on account of his color whatever she saw made her turn from her stepmother to her father and fling herself in his arms hiding her face on his bosom the while her lithe frame convulsed with silent weeping

how gently in tender voice he patted and soothed her 

the stepmother with high head and blazing eyes disappeared into the study

a moment later back in flight to her room julias sylphlike figure was also disappearing up the stairway two steps at a single bound she was sobbing not loud but deep we two meanwhile stood in awkward silence in the hall where we had been left by the daughter whose pride was sore wounded and the stepmother as resentful towards the brideelect as if she had purposely sought to discredit the family

holt broke the silence between us he asked in thick voice with an irrelevance that would have been laughable had it not been so sad joe wont you stay and take dinner with us

no i thank you dave belle will be expecting me home

a silent handclasp between us and a few minutes later i was in my buggy on the way home to belle wondering whether or not there would be a wedding the holts were proud julia the proudest of the three

as the tents of kedar

i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar

tidings

if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than they

ecc 

holt was anxious for the tidings from the capital about rockford college course so eager that he met the threethirty train on which wilson and fairfax were to return tuesday afternoon the professor got left however and consequently would not arrive until the next train at fivefifteen so that it fell to the ministers lot to apprise the president of the outcome of the missionâ fairfax to the attorneygeneral and wilson to the governor which two gentlemen with the superintendent of public instruction constituted the state board of education

the governor as has been intimated was a fairminded man and a friend to the race but while he personally was in favor of the state continuing to provide higher education for the negro as it did for the white race he did not encourage wilson to hope that the college course would be retained because public opinion was in favor of providing only industrial education for colored people and he thought the coming legislature hoped to make itself a name that would give the party faction which it represented a new lease on power in the state as his excellency was not of that faction he feared he would not be able to do much with the incoming legislature

the attorney  general was more optimistic he pledged himself to do all he could to have the college retained he did not himself think that sober conservative public opinion was against negro higher education

he believed that thoughtful people felt that negroes needed and can take the same kind of training white people need and get

the superintendent of public instruction whom fairfax and wilson saw jointly was quite hot against cleggett who had precipitated the whole discussion about rockford college he went so far as to call him a contemptible nobody who had raised the issue not because he was interested in public welfare but simply to stir up race feeling for his own political advancement the superintendent as he bade wilson and fairfax goodbye called attention to his often expressed position regarding education which is this the best education the state can afford for every child white and black

holt felt encouraged he believed the chances were pretty good for the retention of the college course since both the superintendent of public instruction and the attorneygeneral belonged to the faction that controlled the incoming legislature and the attorneygeneral would probably be the next governor of the state

a man

mine honor is my life both grow in one take honor from me and my life is done

rich ii act iâscene i

of course i emptied myself to belle when i went home to dinner tuesday

we had often talked over fairfaxs case especially after what we had learned by the talk together of mom kitty and juddy hill on commencement day i had not however discussed the zeke brown present episode with her for the reason that julias being with my wfie monday night and tuesday morning up until i went out on my daily calls gave us no opportunity to do so privately and our loyalty to our little friend sealed our lips about the matter

she might never have made the discovery if she had not and gus had not we never would have breathed the affair but now she had unearthed the secret and was miserable beyond words mrs holts lack of sympathy with julia in her crucial hour made her turn to belle i imagine the holts had quite a stormy time after i leftâmrs holt insisting that her husband should call off the marriage but he insisting that gus and julia alone should decide whether or not the marriage should take place the bride in her anguished perplexity had asked my wife to go over to rockford college tuesday night i had taken belle over about eight oclock belle and julia were closeted in the room of the fiancee mrs holt and myself had a long talk over the affair her husband a thing unusual being busy in his office in the college building

i dont know whether he was out of the house because he was so busy or perplexed or because the relations between himself and wife over julias case were a little strained

as i started to say she and i had a long hearttoheart talk about julias affair such as is possible only to lifelong friends at first she was disposed to pitch into me for siding with her husband but i think i succeeded in convincing her at least she said she was convinced that holts proposal to let julia and her lover decide for themselves was the wisest course

this was after we had talked an hour and a half and i was about to go and hunt up holt just as i got seated in his office there was another knock at the door

why its you professor said holt opening the door and letting fairfax in extending the young man a warm hand

i havent seen you since you came back from the capital but wilson told me all about it

no sir i missed the train

have a seat wont you said holt pushing out a chair

i havent seen you either gus said i shaking his hand heartily so heartily that he looked at me curiously and said oh i havent been gone so long or so far

no said holt but you went far enough to do the school a great service i was just writing some important letters about the matter and i want to thank you for going to the capital

i am glad i have been of service to you but i did not call to see you about that continued fairfax rising i was on my way to the house to see you i saw a light in here but i didnt expect to find anyone with you i came to see about a personal matter then there was silence in which he looked at me i stood up as if to go

all right professor i suppose you want to see me alone

dr wade can stay mr president unless you object said fairfax in fact i would rather he would stay

very well said holt

i have something to show you he said advancing towards holt and handing my classmate a companion picture to the one sent julia holt took it and looked at it long and curiously in surprise while fairfax and myself watched him in silence

in a voice of suppressed feeling the young professor asked did you notice anything peculiar about the picture

well yes iâi think i do professor hesitated holt

he drew a step closer to the president and with something of the confidingness of his boyish days when he used to go to holt with his troubles he said with all his soul in his voice mr holt thats my mothers picture that zeke brown sent me as a wedding present i am anonymous no longer jeter horn is my fatherâi remember her ive come to say thisâthis because of julia

here his feelings stopped him we were both full

mr holt continued he regaining selfcontrol i dont think if you had known you would have been willing for me to enter your family and while i feel that i am just as good as anybody that walks gods green earth âand here he straightened up and looked holt straight in the eyesâyet my selfrespect mr holt demands that i tell you all so that you can decide whether or not the âthe marriage shall take place

he was under stress of great feeling without hesitation holt put his hand on fairfaxs shoulder and in a fatherly tone said gus you do not tell me anything i didnt know as dr wade can tell you julia received a like present from zeke brown and we saw what you have discoveredâsaw it last night yes gus we saw it last night myrtle dr wade and myself and my wife and i have reached a decision

here holt paused to let fairfax grasp what he had said

the young man backed a few steps away from my classmates and lifting his eyes to holts asked in a firm but respectful voice and what is your decision sir my decision is to let you and julia decide what you will do i shall not attempt to influence her one way or the other i know you gus i think a man ought to be judged by what he is not by what somebody else is holt was so delicate that he would not say by what his father is

fairfax was deeply moved and greatly relieved and said gently i thank you mr holt for that speech and i also appreciate the fairness of your decision then he turned to go

will you see julia tonight gus

no no mr holt not tonight let me hope until tomorrow 

goodnight dr wade i am glad you were here i am glad you know all about it it seems to me this discovery has made me all alone in the world goodnight mr holt i cant see julia tonight

when the door closed behind him we sat in silence a moment then i said what do you think julia will do dave

i dont know joe while as i told gus ill not attempt to influence julias decision thats more than i can say for myrtle they are both very proud and if my wife continues to try to convince julia that it will bring ridicule on her to marry gusâwell there is no telling what a woman will do out of fear of ridicule yes thats so replied i

no joe continued he with a sigh i dont know what effect myrtle is having on julia but this i know joe gus is every inch a man

it must have been one oclock when belle and i started home but at that late hour the watchman as we were leaving brought a letter for julia from fairfax lover like he changed his mind about communicating with his fiancee that night i imagine however that fairfax must have written a part at least of the letter before he went in to see holt i judged this from the bulk of itâthough a man in his state of mind can write voluminously in a very short time howbeit a fellow in his state of feeling is usually exceedingly critical over what he has writtenâcritical because oversensitive so i guess fairfax must have spent some time on the bulky letter i saw in julias trembling fingers

a progressive fairy tale

duke

i think this tale would win my daughter too

othello act i scene iii

the harpers just before rockford college opened gave a delightful porch party principally for the norwalkers

what a jolly party it wasl one of the amusements was a progressive love story which someone started and carried on to a certain point when someone else took it up until seven had taken part each trying to see how touching how thrilling or how funny each could make his or her part

it was interesting to note how characteristic was the contribution each made holts serious wilsons homiletical belles and mrs holts inatter of fact almas lovefilled julias dreamy and fairfaxsâwell all the best of all the others combined and withal now pathetic now poetic now rollickingly funny

he was by nature funloving your laughmaker is usually such a person the reputation of laughmaker however may become a burden the laughmaker may be very serious minded but his habit of putting serious things in a funny vein may result in his being thought only funny when he is most in earnest i suppose fairfaxs performance at harpers porch party and how proud of that performance julia was led him to adopt the progressive story as the vehicle of his message to julia it evinced the young mans mental kinship to jeter horn that in his circumstances he could thus put a message on a matter of so grave moment to himself and fiancee

also it evidenced julias perfect understanding of her lover that there was not one chance in a thousand that she would think he was trifling

she had learned to know that fairfax was one of those natures that are usually most dead in earnest in meaning when most facetious in expressing that meaning

when julia broke open fairfaxs bulky letter she found that a part of that bulk was made by two sheets of paper pinned together these sheets making eight pages were blank except for the following i love you to the last drop of my blood

imagine these eight pages filled with every term of endearment that has ever been written then you have only a faint picture of my hearts love

the blank sheets did not surprise julia nor did the forthcoming letter evidently started before he called on holt in the form of a progressive fairy tale dear julia once upon a time a fairy youth to fortune and to fame unknown loved a fairy princess rare and radiant

in sooth to fortune and to fame he was unknown for he thought he was an orphan and knew he had no home nor name augustus he called himself and oh he was lonely in the wide world and motherhungry for grimvisaged war that stalked fairy land had filched him of his mother twas thus the race to which the youth and maiden belonged for two weary centuries had clanked loud the thrall that greed of gain had riveted upon their helpless limbsâaye clanked them so long with hoarse cry of pain that men of the other race of the north rushed furious at the throats of their brothers of the south that the enthralled might go free

the battle of the brothersâhow it was brave how it was fierce when the strife had almost spent its fury one night some men of the south fell silent and swift on the camp of the men of the north in the confusion when death filled the darkness and brave men bit the dust the youth a mere child was separated from his mother and ever after moured her as dead

events moved swift in fairyland the youth found for guerdon toil as a tiller of the soil in the north country

a hunger of learning gnawed his soul he sought a court of learning there he met the princess not then a princess her sire was fellow seeker of truth with the youth and for that unfeeling fellow knowledge seekers laid imposing hands upon the motherless fairyboy and against him waged cruel bantering tongues the noble father faced the ribald throng and said whoso toucheth the youth or waggeth unkind tongue against him with me even me must reckon the taunting and imposition ceased and much the youth loved the sire of the maiden and sought his home where oft he beheld the maiden and noted the comeliness of her and the sweetness of her and that she despised him not so as time fled the youth and the father of the maiden wrought at the books until it came to pass that the soul of the youth was knit to the soul of the maiden but he knew it not nor knew she

other years fled and the maiden became a princess in that her sire was elevated to a throne of the realm of learning and he chose his fellow truthseeker to support his throne and be a great lord in his realm then the princess and the youth plighted their troth

how happy they how smooth flowed the stream of love reputed in fairyland never to run smooth

but a bitterness the future held for them

within reach of the realm of the father of the princess was a city about the citys highway there walked an old man addicted to pouring liquid fire down his throatâliquid fire that at first cheers but latterly inebriates long years the old man drank until the fiery fluid had destroyed his manhood made loathsome his body and rendered his name once a fair one a hissing and a byword

an ancient prophet also dwelt in this city of fairyland ezekiel was his name years ago he and the drunkard had the same woman to wife the prophet was by the law that held his race in thrall separated from his wife called eliza and she was given by the same law to the drunkard named jeter

jeter and eliza had born unto them a child which was lost from them in wartime how the prophet hated the man into whose arms his wife had been put

when the youth and princess came to know the prophet for that the love of the maiden and the youth was beautiful in the eyes of the old man he took the youthful lovers to his heart he loved the maiden for her charms and the youth because he reminded him the prophet of his lost eliza

time brought near the wedding night of the youth and the princess the palace was decorated the invitations had gone forth the wedding feast had been prepared how the people of fairyland loved the king of the realm of learning and his daughter and her betrothed l wedding gifts rich and rare began to flow into the palace the brideelect walked on air the groom was so happy that he feared to be happy

monday before the thursday the wedding was to be the king sent augustus on an embassy of grave importance to the realm faithfully and well he discharged his trust and with every drop of blood tingling in blissful anticipation he hastened back to report to his overlord and see his betrothed

it was not quite six of the clock tuesday evening when he returned to his abode as he was preparing to refresh himself with a hath a change of apparel and his evenings repast he discovered on his dressing table a wedding gift from the old prophet he opened it the present proved to be a picture of the wife from whom long years before the old man had been separated when the youth beheld the pictured face the sight made his heart flutter he was partly disrobed as he took the picture towards the window to scrutinize itâall the time his breath quick and hotâin a mirror he passed the youth got a glimpse of himself petrified with astonishment was he how like as two peas were he and the pictured woman

all the past flashed through his mind he needed not to question who the woman was his heart leaped to its feet stretched out eager arms and cried mother mother  twas so at last he had found whom long long heart hungry he had sought his mother who had been the wife alike of the prophet and the swiller of liquid fire

then burst on him the certitude that he was the fire drinkers son since eliza and the prophet were childless

sands of the seashore were ye alt words yet were ye too few in number to tell the youths anguish o miracle of fairyland that he slew not himself

full well knew he the king and queen that they were proud also full wellknew he that the princess rare and radiant would not have plighted him her troth had she known he was the drunken paupers son

until he was weak he had raged against circumstances like a caged lion threshing himself against prison bars until he exhausts himself then the youths better self awoke his honor spoke to him then what did he say he sat himself down and wrote the princess this missive  breath of my body in anguish unspeakable i write thee

we have plighted our troth and oh to the last drop of my blood i love thee but i fear me that hadst thou known me to be such as i have discovered myself to beâi fear me o princess that thou wouldst not have plighted thy troth to me

 i am neither orphaned nor nameless this day as a wedding gift i received a picture of prophet ezekiels lost wifeâmy lost mother what time i gazed upon the pictured face i knew it for my mothers by the same token i knew myself to be the lost son of jeter the drunkard

 since i am not such as thou didst deem me when thou didst swear to bear my name and share my lot my manhood my honor cry to me and bid me release thee from thy vow

not o princess for that i would be unbound but that thou mayest be free to reject or accept me such as thou now knowest me to beâthe son of jeter the shamefulâjeter the swiller of liquid death

 here ends dear julia my part of a progressive fairy tale take it up where i leave it and finish itâtelling whether or not the rare and radiant princess accepted the release that the fairy youth moved by a sense of honor laid at her feet p sâsince i began the above i saw your father and told him the discovery i made when he told me to my great surprise that you know all i have been telling you and that he leaves the whole matter in our hands your knowing this and his leaving the matter with us makes it easier for you to decide it is too late for me to ask a reply from you till morning but oh please remember that in waiting until morning i wait several eternities as ever gus

the fruitage forbidden

womans at best a contradiction

pope

julia did not keep her lover in suspense the several eternities he expected but late as it was in a daintily perfumed note sent him by the burly night watchman a refusal to accept release from her engagement

i had use for my satchel of instruments tuesday afternoon  they were still in the buggy when i drove belle over to rockford college for her to see julia from sheer force of habit for i never liked to leave them in the buggy at night when belle and i alighted at holts i took the satchel in the house with me and set it down just inside of the hall i forgot it when my wife and i started home and did not remember it until we had got down the hill off the campus

we drove back for it mr and mrs holt were in the south parlor she called out to my wife as i stood in the hall belle come in and let julia tell you the news in her letter

in an instant belle was on the way to julias room

what news in julias letter i asked addressing mr and mrs holt who were standing side by side before a sofa from which they had just arisen

oh nothing that you dont know answered holt only that gus has released her from her engagement what do you think of that myrtle i asked why its just fine she replied dave was just telling me that gus had said the same thing to him in your presence

fine what do you mean by that i asked why i mean i think his conduct is just fine his letter to julia is just splendid gus is a hightoned gentleman thats what he is and i am proud of him

why madame i thought you were opposed to their going on with the marriage

who said i was

why myrtle i gathered as much from what you said to me and dave when we first saw zekes present oh joe its a case of forbidden fruit now that gus has practically asked julia for his ring

no dave it isnt that gus himself has always been all right so far as im concerned but joe when i first heard it heard that he was old jetas sonâwell i confess my pride was hurt but now i am so proud of gus i dont care whose son he is

that is very sensible talk my dear said her husband looking at her tenderly just as julia who with belle had arrived at the foot of the stairs in time to hear what her mother said left belle and nestled fondly to her stepmother who put around the brideelect a caressing arm

belle and i left the holts that night all of us greatly relieved

holt looked as if a great burden had rolled from his heart julia was so happy she was almost hysterical while mrs holt seemed more like her own gracious self than i had seen her for some time some one has said that our first parents would not have cared for the forbidden fruit if it had not been forbidden i would not like to think mrs holts change of front was due simply to fairfaxs becoming in a sense forbidden fruit by his releasing julia from her engagement

the flight from a plight

and i of ladies most deject and wretched that sucked the honey of his music vows

o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see

hamlet

my doorbell rang about eight oclock wednesday morning

the boy went to answer the call when he told me president holt was in the parlor you can imagine my surprise

why goodmorning holt extending my hand

goodmorning joe

what on earth has happened you look as if you were at a funeral old fellow

you havent seen him have you joe

seen whom

gus hes not at the school julia hasnt seen himâ wasnt in to breakfast

whew i whistled why no he hasnt been here

hes not at the school no one has seen him julia wrote him last night asking him to call this morning nobody has seen him i thought maybe he was here or at harpers with wilson

no i havent seen him nor heard of him since last night are his things gone

i cant tell i got a master key and went into his room his traveling bag is gone but not his trunk and i dont know how many of his things

i wonder what motive he could have for leaving didnt he and julia make it all right

yes she told me she refused his release and asked him to see her this morning and she and myrtle are almost crazy joe the clouds are all back its a mighty strange thing

it is indeed dave but it may be he is up at wilsons

i believe i will go up and see

why if you dont want to bother with that carriage my buggy is hitched up and i am going up that way and then over to the school ill take you holt

all right and he went and dismissed the carriage

we went to wilsons but no one there had seen him wilson was very much troubled

when we got to rockford college julia and her mother met us at the door

have you seen him asked mrs holt

no we havent seen anybody that has seen him myrtle began to wring her hands while julia in tears fled to her room

she had hardly got there while we three were puzzling our heads when a student came to the door with a note for julia from fairfax which the watchman who had just waked had forgot to deliver

myrtle flew upstairs with the note in the hope that it would give us some clue it ran thus miss julia holt since you can not decide circumstances having decided for you i see no necessity of my seeing you in the morning i had hoped for a kinder fate but your will is your own there is nothing for me to do but to take myself away from rockfordâaway from further humiliation adieu augustus fairfax

julia was wild over the note i never saw her so moved evidently fairfax had regarded her answer as unfavorable and had left rockford

i insisted that she let us know what she had written her lover fortunately she had a copy of the missive she had sent him by the watchman this was her note dear gus there is no need to keep you in suspense tonight from the first hour of my discovery i knew my mind i can not decide what i shall do in relation to you circumstances have decided for me and until death there shall be no revocation of that decision come to see me in the morning and let us talk heart to heart

goodnight julia

at once i saw what the trouble was julia was so positive in her loyalty to fairfax never from the moment she made the discovery thinking of anything else but that she would marry himâi say julia was so settled in what she was going to do that she did not make it clear to fairfax whether or not she accepted or refused his release

 what she meant by saying i can not decide circumstances have decided for me is that the fact that gus was under a great burden by reason of his discovery that fact so thrilled her heart with sympathy for him that if she had tried she could not do anything else but to decide to cling to him

in the light of julias purpose and feeling it is apparent that her note is a most unequivocal declaration of her loyalty to fairfax however hoping fearing sensitive and proud you can see that the note was as ambiguous as a message from the delphian oracle which prophecies were so worded as to be true no matter what happened

holt and i hastened to the depot to make inquiries and found that fairfax had bought a ticket for norwalk and had gone on the train leaving rockford at three oclock in the morning evidently he did not sleep after getting julias note

now the problem was to head him off by telegraph apprise him of his mistake and urge him to return

we left julia in bed with her face to the wall that sign of mental anguish as old as man

mrs holt now as zealous for the marriage to jeter horns son as she had been strenuous against it was drinking a bitter cup of remorse fearful lest some inkling of her tacit howbeit shamefaced opposition to the brilliant young professor had helped him to misinterpret julias note

we sent telegrams as far north as washington beyond which point he could not have arrived at the time we telegraphed

would the telegrams find him a needle in a haystack

that was the problem he was asked to reply so as to relieve us of suspense but a message from holt as late as six oclock informed me that no word had come from the groomelect who fled from what he thought was a very humiliating plight

holt mentioned in his wifes presence how much it had cost to send such full telegrams and so many of them her reply indicated her complete change of heart as to the desirability of jeter horns son as her soninlaw she said with worried tears in his voice well dave my dear thats what moneys made forâto spend now ive always thought that if i were a dollar id like to belong to mrs holt i know i would be fondly cared for

at twilight i love thee so dear that i can only love thee

insufficiency

mrs browning

a tense nervousness pervaded the holt home all day wednesday but rockford college folks thought it only natural in view of the great coming event the marriage of the presidents daughter with the most popular rockford professor augustus fairfax they knew he was away but thought the president had sent his soninlawelect on a pressing embassy in relation to rockfords threatened college course

the holt children had been kept in the dark as to the status of affairs their mothers and julias perturbation of spirit gladys and olga attributed to that anticipated affair which the little lassies thought was going to be the greatest thing that ever transpired because in their pretty dresses of which they talked by day and dreamed by night these little maidens were to take a prominent part as flower girls to jule as they fondly called the brideelect

the shadow upon the holt household therefore cast no damper on the exuberant spirits of these two happy healthy tomboy romps who lived so much out of doors that their mother often said i declare you girls are birds that light at home only long enough to feed and roost

the tense nervousness pervading the holts household all day wednesday was calmed and the gloom that hung thereover at twilight was lifted

nobody was surprised to see fairfax alight from a public carriage that drove up to the entrance of the main building of rockford college nobody who saw him

mrs holt was in mrs harmons sick room trying to find rest by giving consolation the little girls were off to play for it was not quite supper time holt was in the city thoroughly discouraged to make arrangements with the newspapers about announcing the postponement of the marriage none of these saw the carriage drive up and fairfax alight and go to his room no none of these saw this but julia did she was not surprised for had she not all day been straining her eyes for just this sight no she was not surprised but oh wasnt she glad

the truant groomelect must have taken time both to bathe and dress for the college community had gone to supper when looking as if he had just stepped out of a bandbox the young man who was somewhat of an exquisite bent his steps towards the presidential mansion

julia opened the door not waiting for him to ring she shut it and in the south parlor for just an instant in silence they looked into each others eyes nor needed words their lovelit eyes told it all

he opened his arms taking one step towards her oh gusl came in tenderness she walked into them and allowed him to fold her reverently to his heart

my julia  my life my gods gift

after a brief cry she looked up in his face oh gus how could you misunderstand me how could you think that i meant to reject you

i dont know my pride made me misunderstand you i guess

then they sat on the sofa

so you never were undecided he asked

no never not from the first moment

of course my pride was hurt just as yours was gus but from the first moment i knew you would feel alone in the world id give my life to stand between you and all the world

a moisture was in the young mans eyes

i thank god that you feel that way i thank god that you understand me so well

then with a characteristically swift change from the grave to the gay he said with twinkling eyes if the hub of truth had revolved around the axletree of my understanding i wouldnt have gone gooselike chasing off to norwalk to let dear old dr dale hear my tale of woe and now knowing how my princess rare and radiant feels i shall not care how festive the old gent jeter gets what time he is full of the juice of corn

oh gus laughed she that letter was just beautiful  and funny too and what a botch i made of answering it

no that was my blunder and not yours

no she insisted it was mine i ought tohave taken up the fairy tale where you left off and answered itâlet me seeâive got it written offâjumping up from by his side and running with light steps upstairs to her room for it

while she was gone he sat perfectly stillâhis lips moving his hand to his brow

this is what she brought downstairs and they took to the window to read in the twilight and the fairy princess said unto the fairy youth oh augustus little thou knowest of woman if thou deemest i could do aught but cling to thee in this thine hour of sorest need i know thee not as son of jeter but as king of my heart and were jeter ten thousand times more shameful and thou ten thousand times his son still i love and cling to thee i love thee so i can but love thee

fairfax drew julia to him and kissed her again and again when he released her he said this ought to be added to the fairy story and the youth and the princess did wed and ever after they lived happily for the princess blamed not the son for the father and the youth thrust not his father upon the princess nor her family but on the other hand for that augustus loved the truth and despised a lie he made it a point of honor neither to proclaim nor deny the fact that he was the son of jeter the shameful

gus she said nestling close to him you are a man of honor i would not ask you to hide the fact that jeter horn is your father and if you did i could not honor you as i do

he is nobody to be proud of julia but it is the grace of god and environment that make the difference between people in this world

yes all of us are blessed above our merits she replied and they lapsed into silence standing arm in arm by the window in the bewitching tender gloaming the same spell was upon them both

she instinctively knew what he meant by pulling her gently by the sleeve at a chair near the window side by side they knelt each with an arm about the other and in reverent voice with bowed head he said oh lord our heavenly father we thank thee for all thy mercies to us help us we pray thee to serve thee

they arose from their knees he was about to put his arms around her again when into the room like a storm burst sixyearold gladys mamma heres gus 

mrs holt came into the room in her hand was the delayed telegram from fairfax

gus you here i was just coming to julia with your telegram 

why julia i thought you had heard from said surprised

no gus not a thing until i saw you

thats strange he marveled

but you are here gus  exclaimed mrs

yes mother he replied feelingly

she aint your mammal burst out glady mrs holts eyes were moist yes i a kiss me my son

she took a step towards him and he kisseing reverently mother the feeling was dont you want me for another brothernnnrrnmnnt he asked scarcely able to steady his voice

no im going to wait till i get a grown im going to get a husband just like you

this gave them all a chance to laugh a relieve their feelings

holts arrangement with the newspapers the postponement of the marriageâit is needle he countermanded

a voice out of the darkness

do thy duty that is best leave unto thy lord the rest

the legend beautiful

longfellow

whose voice well wait and see out of win darkness out of that existing when julia and fairfa spoke their vows for it was not very dark the ceremony took place early promptly at seven oclock thursday night the invitation reading from seven to ten by ten all the more than two hundred guests had conn seen congratulated chatted admired been served wit a handaround chocolate cake and cream and gone all except the inner circle of friends principally the noi walkers

i can see that scene yet

i wish some of the newspaper men who industriously keep before the public gaze the no account and criminal element of the race could have seen the assemblage a julias marriage rockfords four hundred welltodo welldressed refined intelligent people of color

yes emphatically people of color all shades from the ace of spades to lily white and their dressâwell can not trust myself to describe them for belle tell me i dont know anything about womens clothes per haps i do make myself ridiculous when i undertake to catalogue fabrics colors and styles but nevertheless i know what i like and ive been around rich elegant white folks enough to know when a woman is tastefully gowned

yes rockfords colored four hundred were thereâi believe zeke brown came nearer being a domestic than any other guest that was presentâand negroes money will buy the same fine things that white folks money will

now i testify that these negroes looked like white folks so far as clothes go furthermore they acted like refined white folks ive seen refined white folks both in the south and in the north

yes i say it is a pity that white people of the south seldom see or hear of colored folks like those at that marriage although to northern folks some southern people boast that they know the negro yet they keep themselves in such a frenzy about social equality or rather social intercourse that it comes to pass that in this matter the best negroes and best white people are jews and samaritans that have no dealings

thus it transpires that southern people get most of their notions of the race from their domestics with whom they come in contact and the worthless and the criminal element about whom principally they read in the southern press

its a great pity that white folks are so desperately afraid of negroesâafraid of social equality or rather social intercourse it is a pity for two reasons first because the dread of social equality is baseless negroes no more want to associate socially with white people than white people want to mingle socially with negroes

secondly this baseless fear of social equality betrays the people of the south into many many injustices toward the once enslaved race indeed the fear of social equality is so entirely baseless that when i hear white people sensible about everything else rave about this i sometimes wonder if they are not faking i wonder if this wild talk is not indulged in not because there is real apprehension of social intercourse but to stir up race feeling for political purposes

but i started to tell about the scene when julia and gus said the fateful words i like to call them julia and gus for i feel a proprietorship in them though neither of them is related to me i am proud of them i should feel that god had greatly blessed belle and myself if he gave us a daughter as noble as julia and a son as manly as gus

yes i can see that scene now

lights everywhere falling in mellow tints the welldressed refined goodhumored company massed near the doors of the studyâthe south parlor the broad hall and all around the north parlor belle at the piano in the broad hall holt in the north parlor alcove beautiful with its bell of flowers decorations everywhere a quiet hum of conversation belle strikes up the wedding march from lohengrin a hush falls olga and gladys sweet in white from head to foot each with an exquisite basket of flowers mince daintily amid a hum of loving admiration now they take their places in the alcove one on one side and the other on the other of the father who with book in hand stands waiting

next come the bridesmaids next wilson and alma then mrs holt dowager empress resplendent then a pause

down the broad stair looking like a hindoo princess comes the dainty little bride

fairfax the tall pleasantfaced black prince meets the brown princess at the door a deeper silence marks their measured graceful march up to beneath the bell of flowers before the presidentministerfather celebrant of the marriage

the low soulful music perfectly harmonizes with the sacred tender service absolute silence the ceremony begins

it had progressed to that juncture where on the solemn silence in mellow resonant tones fell these timehallowed admonitions if any man can show just cause why these two may not lawfully be joined in wedlock let him now speak or else forever hereafter hold his peace

upon the deathlike silence rang out at that instant loud shrill and uncanny these words im a man you dont see every day  circumstances alters cases up on dis very hill whah in times pas an gone ole jeta used to slave fo de whiete folks de niggas is got a fine college an is actin poure white ha ha hal

a thrill of excitement quivered over the company

holt waited in selfpossessed silence but his wife clung to the back of a chair as if she feared the owner of that voice would bolt into the room julia trembled like an aspen leaf i saw fairfaxs back stiffen meanwhile he swallowed hard but the interruption was for only a moment for the clang of the bell of the police patrol wagon sounded in an instant after the cry in less time than it takes to tell it all was quiet the patrol wagon was out of hearing jeter in it on his way back to the poorhouseâso weak and ill that he died before the wagon reached its destination

yes the interruption was only for an instant but it was not too brief for this swift tableau between the man and woman before the altar julia trembles like an aspen leaf fairfax drops her hand turns around facing her looks intently into her eyes then at holt julia calms herself lifts her face to fairfaxsâall her soul in her eyes he takes her hand again they turn around the groom looks at holt the ceremony goes on

who of that company could guess the meaning of that pantomime only the norwalkers who alone were in the secret divined that fairfax even at the altar had offered to release julia if she desired to be freed

i am proud of him for making that offer i and of julia for refusing it

the end
