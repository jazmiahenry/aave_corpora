american calvaryman the a librarian romance downing henry f 
john calvert was one of new yorks wealthiest and most influential citizens he owned a palace in the metropolis a castle and a park in the adirondacks automobiles yachts trottinghorses and many other appurtenances and toys of the rich man he was a widower thus smiled upon by fortune he was very happy though contradictory as it may seem not exactly content he was childless at least so he believed

about twenty years earlier than the date of this tale calvert then a poor man was living at a certain port on the west coast of africaâ the agent of a wellknown english trading company â and with him were his wife and daughter the latter not quite two years of age one day the little one and her nurse a native woman were found to be missing search for them was vain eventually however the childs bonnetâ all soiled as though it had been in waterâ was found near the edge of a deep lagoon from this it was supposed that she had been drowned and her body carried out to sea and that the nurse afraid to face her employers had levanted into the hinterland

whatever the facts might have been neither the child nor the nurse was found then calverts wife died as a consequence of his double loss africa became exceedingly distasteful to him so he resigned his post and returned to america he established himself in new york and as his present position discloses prospered wonderfully

twice had calvert run on the democratic ticket for the governorship of new yorkâ hoping that albany would be but a steppingstone to the white house in washingtonâ and both times had been defeated only because the colored voters opposed his election he was much too bigminded to feel a grudge against these people because they were politically antagonistic to him to the contrary provided they kept in their  proper places he was not unwilling to do them any cheap service in fact he employed colored persons as domestic servants in his residences also in all menial positions in the important bank of which he was president

it was the middle of december and the sun was vainly endeavoring to moderate the arcticlike cold that was causing all new york to shiver calvert however sitting before a fire that glowed in an open grate and puffing away at a big black cigar was not concerned because of the low temperature outside he was feeling very comfortable so much so indeed that the entrance of an attendant rather annoyed him

 well what is it  asked he somewhat sharply

the attendant whose entrance had disturbed the banker was a black boy dressed in tightfitting jacket and trousers resplendent with gilt braid and brass buttons he came into the room with a grin spreading his countenance and apparently unaffected by calverts mood continued grinning while he answered  sir a colored lady wants to see you

 robert you mean a colored woman corrected the banker

robert felt very much like arguing the point but durst not

 yes sir said he submissively

 did the person mention her name 

yes sir the la â er â the woman said her name was mrs sarah dale

calvert smiled

 oh mrs dale  exclaimed he  why didnt you mention the name at once however its all right you may show the lady in

 gums   thought the lad  he calls her  lady  himself

 while mrs dale is with me im not to be disturbed added calvert

 yes sir said robert

he went from the room still grinning and a moment or so later ushered in mrs dale

this visitor was a very goodlooking colored person of fair complexion she was costumed fashionably but modestly and her features though more refined resembled calverts very closely the banker while robert was present received her in a most stately fashion but after the lad had gone and closed the door behind him the mans manner relaxed

 goodafternoon sarah said he smiling  im glad to see you

 im glad to see you john responded mrs dale crossing toward him

he drew an easychair up before the fire

 sit down and thaw yourself out said he

 im not cold replied the woman nevertheless she placed herself in the easychair

 now then sarah what is it  asked calvert as his visitor sat down

mrs dale glanced nervously toward the door

 john are we in privacy  asked she

calvert chuckled

 my dear said he  we are in the sanctum sanctorum of a bank president the door is soundproof and no one will enter without my permission poushkin will see to that

 poushkin 

 i referred to the boy who showed you inâ robert he is a poet in posse hence i have named him after the russian shakespeare

mrs dale laughed softly

 john said she casting an admiring glance about the room  what luxury the room is grand enough for a king

calvert himself let his eye pass over the room smiling meanwhile contentedly and said yes it is some all right but i guess its not too good for john calvert but sarah what can i do for you is it cash i hope you are not dissatisfied with the allowance i make you  

dissatisfied of course i am not said mrs dale earnestly  no john you are a very kind brother to me

to my fathers daughter i could not be otherwise

 if all of us ne â

 stop sarah interrupted calvert  dont apply that confounded term to me im not a negro our father was white and my mother was an octoroon consequently if theres any african blood in me its only about onesixteenth of the whole im a white man

mrs dale smiled

 if your white friends knew the truth they wouldnt say so returned she

 possibly not but they dont know and never will if a person was possessed of a quality good bad or indifferent which if his fellows knew of it would prevent him from living his life fully and usefully he wouldnt advertise the fact however whatever else i may be im a calvert so are you and that being the case we belong to the salt of the earth

 maybe so said mrs dale doubtfully  but to deceive people as you are doing it seems to me is really sinful

 well said the banker smiling  if im sinner sarah i guess theres any number of sinners just like me america is a bleachery and i am one of its peculiar outputs the country is full of my kind but thats neither here nor there whats up

i received a letter from liberia this morning  from your son 

 yes

 anything wrong with him  

 im not sure said the woman  i am afraid he is inclined to act very unwisely

 i have always considered him rather levelheaded  he is young john

 he is old enough to know right from wrong but what is he about 

 he is getting himself tangled up with some girl  oh is that all  exclaimed calvert lightly

 quite enough too  

 i dont see why you should let it worry you

 i cant help it

calvert shrugged his shoulders

 very well if it makes you comfortable to worry keep it up said he  but what do you want me to do

 you might write to paul he has not forgotten that the doors of west point were opened for him through your influence and i am certain he feels very grateful to you he would be guided by your advice calvert was flattered and he smiled accordingly

 well sarah said he  if you think a letter from me will keep him out of mischief ill write with pleasure is the female a liberian  

i â i suppose so replied mrs dale hesitatingly  it very much depends upon what one means by liberian she is a native

 a savage  exclaimed the banker amazed staring at his halfsister

 yes said mrs dale and she sighed

 i admire his taste

 according to pauls description she has a very fair complexion with brown eyes and hair

 a freak 

 possibly paul states that her mother reesha is a negress pure and simple

calverts countenance assumed a thoughtful look reesha reesha repeated he reflectively

 yes

 it seems to me that ive heard the name before

said the banker his brain still exploring the past

 probably you heard it when you were residing in africa suggested the woman  it may be in common use among the natives

 i suppose thats it and now â 

just then robert entered the room

well cried calvert addressing the boy

 a gentleman wants to see you sir explained the lad and he handed the banker a visiting card

 ask mr paton to please wait said calvert glancing at the card  ill see him in a moment robert departed to deliver his masters message and mrs dale the object of her visit now accomplished arose saying she would leave at once

 john youll not fail to write  she questioned

 ill do it today promised calvert

mrs dale thanked him said farewell and went from the room mr paton entered shortly afterward

 goodafternoon paton said calvert as the man entered  what may i have the pleasure of doing for you 

you may fork out some cash replied paton and he settled himself in the chair that mrs dale had just vacated warming his hands at the fire he added  im up against it hard 

 chronic  remarked calvert smiling

 tisnt fair to hit a chap when hes down said paton  you should be a good christian and help him out of the hole

 humph you shouldnt get into a hole

 i agree but if the pitfall wasnt in sight how was i to avoid it youve come some croppers yourself

 none that embarrassed me but how much do you want 

 a mere bagatelle said paton and he cleared his throat somewhat nervously

 how much  repeated the banker

 ten thousand

security

 two thousand  nightingales 

calvert smiled and gazed quizzically at his visitor

 im afraid your nightingales  might turn out to be mocking birds said he

 do you suggest that i am trying to do you  asked paton somewhat angrily

 my dear paton of course not replied calvert suavely  alls fair in business just as in love and war you know i merely mean that your birds may sing the wrong tune try again paton

 ill see what i have said the wouldbe borrower

he took a small notebook from his pocket and in doing so pulled out a little heartshaped locket which unseen by its owner but perceived by calvert fell to the floor the latter picked up the trinket with the intention of handing it to paton who was studying his book he naturally glanced at it at first he did so carelessly then more attentively and at last eagerly while his face became pale

 perhaps i may be able to â began paton still examining his notebook

 a moment please broke in calvert with just a suggestion of agitation in his voice

paton glanced up and perceived his property in the bankers hand

hello thats my mascot cried he surprised  how did you get hold of it 

 you pulled it out of your pocket with the notebook but where did you get it from 

 i picked it up in london

england

 yes at the white city

 strange  murmured the banker thoughtful

whats strange asked paton his curiosity aroused

 how came it into your possession  asked calvert his tone mandatory

paton frowned he disliked being spoken to thus

 im not in a witnessbox said he somewhat tartly

 no you are in the bank of  seeking a loan

retorted calvert dryly

paton lowered his crest

 by george so i am  exclaimed he  are you going to accommodate me 

well attend to one thing at a time rejoined the banker  before we talk money suppose you tell me all you know about this trinket

 theres nothing much to tell i purchased the thing from a nigger in the native kraal at the white city

was he from africa

 yes liberia he said it was a goodluck fetich and as good luck was then one of my greatest needs just as it now is i bought it shaking his head sadly he dolefully added  i cant say that its brought me any luck for ive been dodging the hammer more often than not ever since i purchased it the confounded coon cheated me 

 it may have more virtue than you think said calvert  did the native mention how it got into his hands

 yes he said an old native woman gave it to him in exchange for a bunch of beads

calvert dried his perspiring forehead

 did he mention the womans name  asked he

yes he said it was â wasâ confound it i cant bring it to my mind i remember however that it was a very outlandish name

 think of something else that you heard at the time and probably youll remember the name suggested calvert

 the young nigger told me that she â oh by george yes her name was reesha  

 i thought so said calvert to himself and he placed the trinket in his pocket

what are you doing with my mascot cried paton unwilling to be deprived of his property

 i propose to keep it said calvert shortly

no you dont objected paton

 not if i purchase your  nightingales  

patons objections were removed

 oh if thats the game its all right  cried he  whats your figure 

 five thousand dollars

paton was not a nincompoop he suspected that some very compelling reason was moving the banker to retain the trinket and he was not unwilling to oblige him â at a price

 not good enough said he smiling knowingly into the others now impassive face he went   nightingales  alone five thousand wdth the trinket ten 

 you are an opportunist said calvert sneering

 the nigger said it was a goodluck fetich and one shouldnt sell ones good luck for a song you know said paton smiling

 very well said calvert resignedly  deposit the stock and the ten thousand will be handed over to you now if you dont mind im very busy

 right you are  exclaimed paton rising inwardly he chuckled as he thought by jove ive pulled his leg famously aloud he cried  ta ta 

and went from the room

calvert rang for robert who came at once

robert said calvert  tell jones that im going to washington tonight to see the president i want him to secure a drawingroom for me on the congressional limited

the lad replied and left the room

alone calvert fished the trinket from his pocket and as he gazed at it his face worked with emotion and his eyes became moist with tears

 goodmorning miss pattie  said captain paul dale as he entered the parlor of the mission house

miss helen pattie was sewing she was an elderly motherlylooking spinster who had spent more than thirty years of her life and the whole of her small income in the somewhat fruitless endeavour to imbue young liberia with a respect for sexual morality and a regard for truth she glanced up from her work smilingly returned dales salutation and invited him to be seated

the captain thanked the good lady drew a chair to an open window that overlooked the roadstead and sat down though thinking of something quite foreign to his subject he began talking about the weather but his hostess knowing what was uppermost in his mind answered his thoughts and not his words

 lupelta is at her lessons said she rising she added  i will send her to you and she went from the room

captain dale was a well setup lightbrown colored man about thirty years of age with straight black hair somewhat prominent wellshaped lips and darkbrown eyes he was an american cavalry officer who had served in the philippines and on the mexican border and was now in liberiaâ loaned by the united states â in command of her lately organized constabulary force

on the morning that dale entered the parlor of the mission house he had been in west africa for longer than one year about a fortnight before he had returned to monrovia from the hinterland whence he had brought a young girl supposedly an imbunda named lupelta

when lupelta was about twenty years of age lodango paramount chief of the imbunda people had come to reside in the town in which she lived the townsfolk received him with much rejoicing feasts were held sacrifices were made and many savage rites were performed young girls wearing wreaths made of flowers danced before lodango and among them danced lupelta her movements were graceful her features beautiful her figure perfect and the imbunda chief admired her above all the other maidens he decided to make her his favorite wife and declared his intention to lupeltas putative mother reesha and the young girl was not unwilling she did not love him it is true for that complex passion was as yet utterly unknown to her but that she had been chosen by the great imbunda warrior lodango to dwell with him in his compound flattered her vanity and pleased her pride

lodangos love for lupelta grew apace and he became impatient to have her all his own but before he could lawfully realize his desire it was absolutely necessary that she should be educated by greegree women into a knowledge of the duties that a chiefs favorite wife is required to perform hence she was placed in the greegree bush to be so trained

this place of instruction was situated about a mile from the imbunda kraal and in the vicinity of the sacrificegrove as a rule greegree students were allowed no companions they were deprived of their hair and their bare skulls were plastered with a cementlike clay twice a day the flesh of their breasts shoulders foreheads and cheeks was upturned with sharp flints or pieces of glass they were not permitted to pass out through the gateway of the barricade of the greegree bush by lodangos command however these severe rules were relaxed for lupelta her skin was not sacrificed her head was not shaven reesha visited her frequently and her maid jaikie was with her all the time furthermore lupelta was not required to confine her movements to the inside of the barricade

and the girl was not negligent of this last mentioned privilege for almost every morning immediately after the early mist had been dissolved by the warmth of the rising sun she left the teachingplace and rambled more or less far afield with jaikie in attendance reesha often accompanied her and in whichsoever direction lupelta at first strolled eventually she sought a certain clear pool fed by cascading water near the edge of which wild flowers grew in great abundance here she would allay her hunger with ripe fruit and juicy berries gathered from convenient tree and shrub and quench her thirst with cool water that spouted from a mossy rock many innocent pleasures would keep her occupied here until toward sundown then all bedecked with flowers and singing happily she would start on her return journey to the greegree bush there to sit through the early hours of night near a fire with the greegree women and learn wisdom from their mouths

lupelta lived in this arcadian fashion one whole month during which time nothing disturbed her peace at the end of the month the day came when she was to leave the greegree bush for good and reside in a new hut which lodango had had erected for her in his compound in the morning of that day she went abroad and bade adieu to the pleasant places she had been wont to visit she lingered here and there but at length she reached the pool here she rested while jaikie and reesha searched natures larder to provide their simple meal and as lupelta was listening to the song of the falling waterâ seeing nothing but dreaming dreamsâ seven swarthy men dressed in flowing robes with cruelty depicted plainly in their hardlooking faces and carrying longbarrelled guns filed into the place from the midst of the surrounding trees discovering lupelta and her companions they gave a loud shout and rushed toward the women

when lupelta and her companions saw themselves thus beset the young girl sprang to her feet and stood trembling fearbound and voiceless jaikieâ equally as alarmed as her mistress but more vocalâ beat her breasts with her hands and screamed and screamed reesha displaying a stern temper and a readiness to combat faced the approaching slavers angrily and when they drew near and essayed to lay hands on lupelta she sprang upon them with fierce cries and endeavoured to tear their faces with her fingernails but the old womans effort availed naught the men struck her to the ground they then seized the girls and forced themâ lupelta almost fainting jaikie screaming and resistingâ from the place into the farreaching forest

soon after they had gone reesha recovered from the dazed condition into which the mens blows had sent her and struggled to her feet she pursued the slavers and though weak with age soon was close up behind them she followed all through the day but toward evening her strength so deserted her that she could advance no further she was filled with despair sinking to the ground she began appealing to her fetich for help and while thus employed she saw captain dale at the head of a company of his constabulary march from behind a clump of flowering plants round which the path ran and meet the slavers face to face

when reesha saw dale and his men she cried out with joy she endeavoured to rise intending to run to them but could not so she crawled on her hands and knees meanwhile dale had halted the slavers and regardless of their clamoring disarmed and pinioned them then the captain and his men marched away taking the slavers lupelta and jaikie with them but leaving reeshaâ of whose presence they were unawareâ still crawling along the path and vainly calling to attract their attention

dale was the first civilized person lupelta had ever seen and his manner clothesâ in fact everything about himâ amazed her she had been told that americoliberians usually treated natives very harshly believing these tales she expected that the captain would be cruel to her but this expectation was not realized for he was not only kind but tender as the days passed lupelta began to feel strangely glad that she was with the captain just as he became convinced that she was charming

dale made up his mind to have lupelta educated and when they reached monrovia four days after the rescue made a start in that direction by placing her in the hands of miss pattie who was a somewhat skilled instructress of the unlettered

moved by a desire to please dale lupelta pursued her studies eagerly and made very rapid progress hence when miss pattie came to her and mentioned that the captain was in the parlor waiting for her to join him she was able to reply in passable english but no attempt will be made to write the language as it was brokenly spoken by lupelta or by any other person civilized or savage who appears in these pages though there are certain peculiarities of speech common among the natives which must be retained however lupelta replied to miss pattie dropped the primer that she had been studying and crossed quickly toward the doorâ altogether too hastily to please miss pattie

 lupelta  cried the spinster admonitively

the girl halted and gazed questioningly at the missionary

yes miss pattie said she

 you are much too exuberant my dear explained the teacher

lupelta was puzzled

 i dont understand said she

 ladies do not run like mad things said miss pattie gently and she picked the primer up from the floor

 oh  exclaimed lupelta enlightened  i forgot pardon me please  she added and though her heart said  hasten  she walked slowly from the room

but as soon as the closed door screened her from the spinsters sight she doffed the ladylike raced down the passage and burst into the parlor and the presence of dale

when lupelta entered the captains heart quickened its beats and his eyes sparkled with joy but before these two had time to exchange any word beyond a greeting jaikie came hastily into the room and she brought consternation with her her arms her face andâ in placesâ her body were tom and bleeding

 lodango is coming  cried the maid as she entered her voice full of terror

lupelta was frightened and turned pale

 hide me hide me  cried she wildly clinging to dale

 lodango shall do you no harm lupelta said the captain reassuringly and he placed his arm about her waist

thus protected lupelta felt safe

the darkness which had deeply enshrouded monrovia all through the long hot night had slowly merged into a thin grey unhealthy mist that after a few minutes passed away it neither lifted nor scattered as fogs in more northern latitudes do but suddenly disappeared all at once as the tropical sunâ a great flaming discâ quickly sprang into sight from behind the edge of the atlantic distant in the east then the waters of the ocean bay rivers lagoons and creeks which a moment earlier had appeared dull to the eye and had sounded sad to the ear glittered in flashes of vivid green and murmured pleasingly innumerable birds brilliant in their plumageâ but alas  tuneless â darted to and fro overhead bees gathered honey butterflies sailed about displaying their varicolored beautiful wings flowers turned their dewmoist faces up toward the heavens each and all rejoicing in and gladly welcoming the newborn african day

lodango the imbunda chief gazed upon this bright scene but out of tune with it frowned heavily the barbarian was standing on a rocky ledge which shelved from the crown of a wooded hillock situated at the extreme edge of the metropolis at its land side he was looking down into the awakening city his solitary figure bold against the background of now cloudless sky resembled a perfectly proportioned bronze statue

except for a small topknot holding a plume his head was bare of hair his eyes were fiercelooking and deeply sunken under heavy brows his chin was square and his full lips curled over two rows of splendid big white teeth filed to points upon his forehead cheeks arms and breasts were symbolsâ little hummocks that had been formed by upturning the fleshâ disclosing that he was of royal rank he wore a loincloth resting against his breast was a small leather pouch pendant from a string of beads that encircled his neck a short spear was in his hand and a broadbladed sword in a rhinocerousskin sheath swung from his shoulder

monrovia at which lodango was so gloomily glowering had few featuresâ other than those provided by natureâ that were appealing to the eye though the streets were broad they were unpaved ditchy stony and covered with rank weed and coarse grass almost without succulence wherein unattended goats and cattle browsed and swine swilled the town contained something like three hundred buildings mostly dwellings each standing in its own spacious grounds now wastes but which a little industry would have transformed into charming gardens

these residences as well as the other structures were located on a portion of the brow and the two sides of a long ridge which stretched undulating from a bold bluff that pushed its nose into the atlantic up to and beyond an eminence overlooking the city the ocean the rivers lagoons and an alluvial country that lay beyond a wide fringe of mangrove and swamp

it was upon this eminence that lodango stood he saw the citizens emerge from their homes into the streets he endeavoured to count them but his untutored mind was unequal to the task the animated scene displeased him and he scowled at it startled by the booming of cannon he gazed toward the harbor whence the sounds were coming and perceived a stately manofwar halfhidden behind a curtain of smoke that curled from her belching guns it seemed to lodango that the vessel was spitting fire and when this peaceful bombardment ceased he heard other guns on the bluffâ over which the liberian ensign was now fluttering lazilyâ begin bellowing an acknowledgment of the visiting warships salute

the savage became disheartened he drooped his head and turned to go away but happening to notice the pouch that was resting against his breast he uttered an angry exclamation halted snatched the thing into his hand held it aloft and addressed it furiously

 o fetich o witch o charm  cried he  gaze upon this big kraal its huts are made of stone they are many see the multitude of warriors on the paths they are so numerous that lodango cannot count them o fetich open your eyes in which of these many huts will lodango find lupelta lodangos eyes cannot see through those stone walls

fetich you have thrown pepper into the eyes of imbunda no longer shall you rest against lodangos breast 

the savage started to tear the pouch from its supporting cord but just then hearing the voice of some woman approaching who was singing an imbunda dittyâ one that he often had heard lupelta singâ he paused and scarcely breathing listened intently he remained thus a few seconds then stole through the shrubbery barely moving it as he passed to a tall tree that stood where the bush hedged a wide path which ran winding down to the city he placed himself behind this tree and fixed his gaze on a bend in the path around which in another moment came jaikie lodango recognized the girl at once he murmured joyfully again he raised the pouch and addressed it â but this time softly and humbly

o fetich forgive lodango muttered he  when lodango is again in the imbunda kraal there shall be a big sacrifice to thee lodango has spoken 

he touched the pouch to his forehead dropped it to his breast and fixed his attention on jaikie who was approaching him deftly balancing upon her head a large gourd from the open wide nozzle of which watei was splashing and sprinkling her comely black face as she walked

jaikie came along the path singing softly and entirely unsuspicious that danger was lurking near she halted opposite the tree that screened lodango and proceeded to readjust her cloth which was loosening and about to fall from over her young bosom and while she was thus engaged the chief sprang to the path rushing towards her she screamed staggered back the gourd toppling from her head and turned to flee

 jaikie will stop  cried lodango and he raised his spear against her

jaikie halted

 fetich help me she murmured and she sank to her knees trembling with fear

the chief lowered his spear and glared down at the frightened girl

would jaikie run away from lodango  asked he sternly

 no no jaikie wouldnt run away from lodango  exclaimed the maid

the chief was disposed to be sceptical

 jaikies tongue is making crooked talk lodango saw jaikie try to run away

 jaikie thought lodango was a lion returned the girl scarcely knowing what she was saying

that one should think twice before speaking is doubtless an excellent rule but if jaikie had followed this precept she would not have made the above excuse and lodangos anger would have remained with him as it was though the chief was flattered to have been mistaken for a lion and his sternness was somewhat appeased

good cried he jaikie will stand up jaikie will guide lodango to lupelta 

jaikie did not reply nor did she arise she merely shivered

lodango grew impatient

slave obey lodango cried ha stand up lead lodango to lupelta  

jaikie continued kneeling and except that she sighed remained mute

lodangos patience never very enduring now deserted him entirely he seized the girl roughly and forced her to her feet holding her firmly he cried  jaikie will speak lodangos ears are open 

jaikie quivered with pain in the chiefs strong grasp and the perspiration rolled down her cheeks in great beads

 lodango will release jaikie then jaikie will speak gasped she

 jaikie will talk truth  cried the chief still holding the girl  if jaikie talks lies he continued  jaikie shall die the death he gave her a shake then saying jaikie will speak  released her

lupelta dwells in the mission house said jaikie quaveringly

the chief growled

 lupelta is glad added the girl

 lodango is sorry  cried the chief  lodango is hungry too much to see lupelta lodango will go to the mission house jaikie will guide lodango jaikie will guide lodango quickly 

jaikie was aware that were she to lead lodango into the city he would be arrested and imprisoned in monrovias antinfested verminous jail for a moment or two she was sorely tempted to thus entrap him but too tenderhearted to do a deed so cruel her compassion got the better of the temptation

 no no jaikie must not guide lodango said she

lodango rewarded jaikie for her display of tenderness in just such manner as the foolish girl deserved

 j aikie shall die the death  cried he fiercely and he raised his spear as if to impale her

the girl gazed affrightedly at the spear vibrating in the angry chiefs hand

stop stop cried she wildly shrinking back lodango must not kill jaikie lupelta would be sorry lupelta would hate lodango 

lodango evidently was not eager to earn lupeltas hate

good  exclaimed he lowering his spear

 lupelta loves jaikie added the girl

 lodango will not kill jaikie whom lupelta loves  cried the chief and he hurled the spear into the shrubbery then with a surprising pathos toning his voice he went on  when jaikies father broke the law did not lodango spare his life did not lodango give jaikie to lupelta famine has come to the imbunda kraal more than once but was jaikie ever hungry no lodango gave food to lupelta reesha and jaikie has jaikie forgotten did not lodango prevent greegree from tearing lupeltas tender skin with sharp stones and glass has lupelta forgotten jaikie is a slave jaikie will guide lodango to lupelta then jaikie shall be free lodango will make jaikie glad too much jaikie shall be married to lodangos bravest warrior jaikies husband shall be set to rule over lodangos largest kraal his granaries shall be filled to overflowing his oxen and his goats shall be too many for jaikie to count jaikie will be rich jaikie will guide lodango to lupelta now 

lodangos pleading so touched jaikies heart that she was consumed with pity in her opinion the chief was a perfect specimen of his sexâ eloquent brave cunning persuasive and cruelâ and she wondered that lupelta could be indifferent to worth so infinite she loved her mistress yet she wished that it might be in her power to assist lodango to secure his hearts desire she knew however that it was out of the question for her to aid him in this direction but might it not be possible she thought to induce him to abandon his pursuit of lupelta she endeavoured so to persuade him

 lodango said she insinuatingly  do eagles mate with doves  lupelta is timid as the water deer water chevrotain mentioned in west african folklore as being exceedingly timid lupelta is soft tears come to lupeltas eyes easily apparently without cause lupelta is not stern enough to sleep on the skins in lodangos hut lupelta â

by thus depreciating her mistress jaikie was maladoite for instead of persuading lodango she thereby displeased him

 jaikie will hush  interrupted he frowning heavily  lupelta is lupelta lodango loves lupelta jaikie talks wind jaikie will guide lodango to the mission house jaikie will do quickly lodango has got no more wind inside himself to talk with 

jaikie perceiving that she had failed sighed

jaikie will make her legs move cried the chief impatiently  lodango wants to see lupelta and be glad jaikie will do quickly 

her appeal to his pride having failed jaikie endeavoured to lead the chief by working on his sense of fear

 lodango said she gravely  the warriors in monrovia are many they are brave and strong if lodango were to go into their kraal to seek lupelta they would seize him they would put lodango in sticks lodango would be sorry jaikie must not lead lodango into â

 jaikie will hush  broke in the chief impatiently  lodango am i lodango will devour them jaikie will do 

 jaikie is not â began the girl

 jaikie is not cunning interrupted lodango angrily touching the hilt of his sword suggestively and glaring fiercely at her he added  jaikie will lose her head 

jaikie shivered and swallowed a sob

 lupelta would be sorry if lodango went to her said she

 jaikie lies  cried the chief vehemently

 lupelta is glad because she lives in the same kraal as dale said jaikie  lupelta has forgotten the imbunda fetich and now worships dales god lupelta wears garments that please dales eyes lupelta is learning dales bookâ is learning to talk his â

while jaikie thus described lupeltas doings lodango fumed and frowned and bit his lips at length unable to listen any longer he interrupted her

 dales witch has made lupelta forget lodango  cried he  when lodango holds lupelta in his arms she will remember lupelta will be glad jaikie will give no more makesorry talk jaikie will guide lodango to the mission house quickly 

jaikie knew that she was skating on very thin ice as it were yet she persisted

 lodango will return to the imbunda kraal and forget lupelta said she

 jaikies head is getting loose too much  cried the chief angrily and he drew his sword

jaikies black face grew greenish with terror

 jaikie will do said she apparently subdued

she turned as though to walk away but suddenly went speeding down the path as rapidly as her legs would carry her and lodango utterly unprepared for the girls maneuver at first was too surprised to move in another moment though he recovered his presence of mind then gave a great shout and pursued her

jaikie was fleet of foot but nothing like so swift as lodango who was the fastest runner of his tribe however doing her utmost she discarded her cloth and ran entirely naked still lodango drew closer and closer to her until at last she despaired of making her escape she was on the point of halting but just then hearing footsteps at the other side of a clump of pricklycactus round which curved the path on which she was running she was encouraged to make a desperate effort she darted into the clump of spiked shrubbery and though tearing her skin forced her way through it to its other side where a small body of the constabulary force was marching

when jaikie sprang into the shrubbery lodango doubtless not at all willing to turn himself into a sort of pincushion halted exclaiming angrily then he became aware of the presence of the constabulary and wisely decided to retreat so he raced back to the tall tree recovered his spear then disappeared in the forest

and while lodango thus showed that his bump of discretion was properly developed jaikie explained the situation to the constabulary who immediately on her finishing her recital began a fruitless pursuit of the imbunda chief then jaikie retrieved her cloth ran down the hill to the mission house and bursting into its parlor presented herselfâ terrified torn and bleedingâ to her astonished young mistress and the american cavalryman dale

whenever a monrovian lady found it necessary to renew her stock of certain triflesâ such as pins tapes and needlesâ she would don a costume of a fashion obsolete years before in europe and proudly promenade to one or another of the petty shops situated in the residential section of the city but if any more important article were required she would descendâ possibly bruising her toes certainly risking ugly tumblesâ the declivity to the waterside and being too much of a lady to toteâ as she would put itâ anything herself a halfnaked native would trudge humbly at her heels to carry her purchase even though it might be but a bodkin

however the waterside was a thoroughfare that ran along the whole length of the rise at its base on one of its sides it abutted several docks and wharfs and the mesurado river which a few yards further on emptied itselfâ between two tongues of sand and over a very shallow shifty barâ into the atlantic ocean

on each weekday morningâ but never of a sunday because the monrovians were sadly afflicted with religiousnessâ shortly after sunrise until eleven oclock secondbreakfast time the waterside was an open market and promenade full of noise color and movement a promiscuous multitude crowded the approaches to the custom house the post office and the government wharf filling all the spaces before the warehouses of foreign merchants from whom liberia receives the larger portion of her small revenue

palefaced assyrian jews displayed cheap shawls rugs jewelry and various other commodities pleasing to the eyes and tastes of the monrovian ladies accra women chaffered with probable buyers over phoophoo and green peppers in the pod kru women sold fish hooked by their menfolk from the deep water of the bay during the night before vie women measured out palmoil from great gourds or palmwine from stone jars bassa women disposed of fruit yams cassava cookedmeat and palmnuts in the bunch

women were there in hundreds some were old some young some ugly some handsome and their complexions varied in color from coalblack to creamywhite the young nativesâ girls and lads alikeâ were for the greater part almost naked the mature and the aged wore garments strange in shape and in many instances as brilliant with variegated color as a peacocks tail

but females did not monopolize the waterside men too were there sauntering up and down its entire length politicians heatedly discussed the question of which great political party would win at the next electionâ the mixedbreeds or the pureblacks government employees anxious about their next payday eagerly questioned the informed as to whether or not there was any cash in the public treasury thirsty government officials high in rank diplomatically maneuvered to secure free drinks of vile spirits the amorously inclined flirted with halfnaked native girls

there was not even one park in all monrovia therefore the citizens had some excuse for thus assembling at the waterside nor did the city contain any public libraries there were two or three private libraries which grouped together would have contained probably two hundred books museums art galleries theaters or music halls in fact places for either the instruction or the amusement of the public were conspicuously absent but there were numerous churches and chapels from the pulpits of which cunning ignorance served out a sort of superstitious pabulum supposedly theological

now on the same morning that lodango and jaikie had their heated interview on the eminence the citizens were assembled at the waterside as usual and among them was the honorable pidgley muffy the private secretary and nephew of the president of liberia mr muffys complexion was yellow and his morals and courage were of about the same color he was somewhat under the average height and delicately made and his countenance usually wearing an ingratiating smile was not at all displeasing when casually glimpsed carrying a cane he languidlyâ monrovians seldom hastenedâ moved along the thoroughfare exchanging remarks with this and that acquaintance but all the time evidently searching with his one good eye cataract had destroyed the vision of the other for some particular person or thing twice he explored the whole length of the waterside in this manner then passed to a sort of dock where in an obscure corner an old native woman was squatting before a small mat upon which were temptingly displayed a number of fetiches charms and other mysterious things mr muffy at sight of this creature exclaimed with satisfaction crossed to the mat halted and spoke to her

 lobue goodmorning said he

though it was an intensely hot morning lobue appeared to be cold for she shivered and drew the ragged cloth that was partly hiding her nakedness more closely about her meager shoulders

 he he he  cackled the hag  muffy is young and his blood is warm so he finds the morning good lobue is oldâ old 

 you should sit where the sun would shine upon you said muffy not hide in this outoftheway place where no one can find you ive been tramping up and down the waterside for the longest time searching for you

 muffy has found lobue said she showing her almost toothless gums in a leering grin

 yes after a lot of trouble grumbled the secretary i suppose you know what pm after 

 no i dont

 ive come for the medicine you promised miss bartle to make for her

 lobue now knows what muffy is after

 it is prepared  

yes

 then hand it over to me

 has muffy brought money to pay lobue for it  asked the old woman  lobue wants gold 

 gold  cried muffy amazed  do you think the stuff grows on trees i was told to give you fifty cents

 lobue wants gold  repeated the crone vehemently

muffy frowned with annoyance as he answered  i have none with me

 go to hulda she will give you a piece

 she is not out of her bed yet give me the medicine and ill hand you the money tomorrow morning

lobue shook her head dissentingly

 lobue will give the medicine to muffy when he hands her the gold she returned stubbornly

 dont you trust me 

 lobue trusts muffy but distrusts his memory when tomorrow morning comes muffys memory may have forgotten the old woman muffys one eye may not see lobue

muffy was hurt in his dignity and he became incensed

 hag cried he angrily  give me the medicine  

lobue again shook her head dissentingly then began advertising her wares

 who wants  who wants  who wants   she screamed in a cracked voice  lobue has fetiches lobue has charms for those who hate lobue has revenge medicine for those who loâ

 stop that yelling and give me the stuff  interrupted the secretary  miss bartle is waiting for it 

lobue grinned at muffy

 he he he  she chuckled  a little while ago muffy said hulda was still in bed now muffy says that hulda is waiting for the medicine muffy is not a good liar gold gold muffy  

muffy was insulted

 you confounded old witch  cried he angrily  if youre not more careful with that tongue of yours ill write a lesson in good manners with my cane upon your shrivelled hide raising his cane over the woman threateningly he added  fork over the medicine at once 

lobue apparently undismayed sneered at muffy

 muffy is a pig  cried she

the secretary his anger by no means decreased by this added insult exploded

 beast  he cried as he brought his cane with much force down upon the womans bare shoulder

immediately on the sticks touching her lobue sprang to her feet with an agility that was most remarkable in one so aged she glared balefully at muffy chattering like an enraged monkey she advanced toward him with hands outstretched as though to attack him

stand off cried muffy springing back thoroughly alarmed

 dog slave rat  cried lobue

 drop it lobue said muffy in a somewhat shaky voice  and ill give you a dime

muffys offer quieted lobues disturbed temper just as oil thrown on perturbed waters smooths them she hushed at once resquatted beside her stockintrade and smiled at the secretary very pleasantly as if nothing disagreeable had taken place and the storm being over mr muffy called back his courageâ such as it wasâ and again approached lobue he halted near her but beyond her reach and took the promised coin from his pocket

 lobue complained the secretary  you are a perfect spitfire 

 lobue is sorry whined the hag with humility

mr muffy was very much emboldened by lobues humility

you seem to forget who and what i am cried he pursing his lips proudly and expanding his chest

 lobue is sorry repeated the woman  give lobue the dime  she added extending her hand eagerly to receive it

will you hand over the medicine asked muffy

lobue drew her hand back and grunted impatiently then she said  lobue must not give it unless she receives gold were she to give it to muffy for silver all its virtues would be lost

 are you speaking the truth 

 lobue is speaking the truth the medicine is a love potion

 a love potion  cried muffy amazed

 aye

 this is interesting thought muffy

 hulda must pay lobue gold  added the woman

 do you know for whom it is intended   asked muffy

 lobue knows

 his name  cried the secretary eagerly

 maybe it is muffy replied lobue grinning

mr muffy flushed and his eye sparkled joyfully

 hulda need not drug me thought he  heavens im already madly in love with her 

 give lobue the coin  continued the old woman

 are you sure i am to be the victim  

 lobue said  maybe 

 confound it be more explicit  cried muffy impatiently  does miss bartle intend to have me swallow the stuff 

 lobue will tell muffy no more said the woman decisively  give lobue the silver 

answer my question and ill give it to you at once said muffy and he held the coin toward her temptingly

lobue glared greedily at the money after a second or two doubtless afraid that unless it were removed from her sight its tempting appearance would overcome her scruples she suddenly dashed it from the mulattos hand and while the coin went spinning through the air to fall into the river some feet away she went on  muffy will tell hulda to come to lobues hut tonight just after the moon begins to shine hulda will fetch lobue gold 

 if i give you gold this afternoon asked muffy  will you tell me everything you know 

 if muffy brings lobue gold lobue will tell him promised the woman

 all right ill show up promised muffy  but now lobue you must tell â 

 lobue will talk to muffy when he comes to her hut said the old woman then she turned away crying her wares as she had before

muffy was convinced that it would be impossible for him to draw anything further from lobue just then so he left her and returned to the thoroughfare he slowly sauntered along until opposite the entrance to the government wharf where he halted to light a cigarette while he was thus engaged a native youth ran from the wharf and brushed against him which caused the cigarette to fall from his hand

the lad perceived what he had done halted and begged muffy to forgive him but the secretary instead of accepting the apology proceeded to cane the young fellow unmercifully mr muffy was not permitted to indulge his cruel humor for long though for dale came upon the scene and stopped him

about the same time that the mulatto left lobue the captain after having convinced lupelta that lodango could not harm her started from the mission house to go to the post office at the waterside when halfway down the hill he perceived muffy beating the lad and at the sight his gorge rose putting on speed in a little while he had reached mr muffy seized hold of his upraised arm and prevented his further abuse of the lad

the secretary taken by surprise at first gazed blankly at dale the next moment though he uttered an angry exclamation wrenched his arm from the captains grasp and sprang back

 wha â what the devil do you mean cried he glaring blackly at the american

 you coward retorted dale  for a cent id break every bone in your body giving a pitying glance at the rescued lad who was rubbing his hurts he added  what right have you to maltreat this youth 

 dale ill â ill get even with you for this  cried muffy passionately  youre not a liberian and ill make things hot for you 

dale smiled down at the fuming secretary

 my dear mr muffy said he  im dead sure youll do me a bad turn if you can so suppose we let it rest at that

 ill have you fired back to america  threatened muffy

 all right responded dale cheerfully  have me fired at the present time though keep your threats between your teeth if you dont you may receive a jolly good trouncing dont tempt me too far but vamoose 

muffy was strongly inclined to make an angry reply but perceiving something in dales eyes that suggested that the captain was losing his patience he muttered an oath and slunk away

then dale turned to the lad

 are you hurt  asked he

 not much

whats your name

whreabo

 and your tribe 

 imbunda returned the lad proudly

dale smiled

 ah an imbunda  exclaimed he

 whreabo is mwambas brother mwambo is a big warrior what is your name asked whreabo

 my name is dale

 good whreabo will not forget whreabo is dales friend wow

the captain pleased with the young imbunda was willing to employ him

 would you like to work for me  asked he

 whreabo will work for dale said the lad

 agreed come along  said dale starting away

whreabo followed the captain

the discomfited secretary anger and hatred eating his heart climbed from the waterside partly up the rise to a small shop which he entered to treat himself to a glass of trade gin hoping that the fiery stuff would help to calm his perturbed spirits he found its proprietress a coalblack negressâ who answered to the euphonious name of mrs sophronia buppâ standing behind her deal counter engaged in a conversation in which she seemed to be very much interested with one of the constabulary force

 mrs bupp gin and angostura please said muffy approaching the counter

the hostess checked her flow of conversation evidently with much reluctance and proceeded to serve the secretary using her apron which was more than ready for the washingtub she wiped a dimlooking tumbler and placed it and a stone bottle before muffy and while so doing made an apology

 im sorry mr muffy said she  but im out of angostura you drank the very last drop i had when you popped in this morning on your way to the waterside will you try peach 

 imported asked muffy as he poured a generous portion of the butch poison from the jug into the tumbler

 no homemade

not fit to drink exclaimed muffy emphatically

he gulped the contents of the tumbler undiluted it scalded his throat brought tears into his eyes and deprived him of breath he gasped

 its from a new lot i bought this morning explained mrs bupp  i know that youre an excellent judge mr muffy do you think its all right she asked somewhat anxiously

mr muffy once more in possession of his breath smiled and smacked his lips suggestively

 it touches the spot mrs bupp he responded approvingly

mrs bupp was pleased that the new lot six bottles suited the cultivated taste of mr muffy who was one of her most critical customers she smiled contentedly and passed him five cents in coppers as change from an english shilling that he had handed her from which to take payment for the gin

 have you heard the news mr muffy  asked mrs bupp as the secretary pocketed the coppers

 no i havent he replied  anything interesting 

 mr boltus here answered the woman indicating the constable  said that lodango is up to some kind of mischief

 you dont say so  exclaimed mr muffy

 i saw him this morning on lookout hill joined in the constable  he was chasing a native girl who had refused to guide him to the mission house

 the mission house  cried mr muffy amazed what did the savage want to go there for

 after lupelta answered the constable

who is lupelta asked muffy

the constable who had participated in the rescue of lupelta from the slavers explained

 a pretty howdedo over a naked hussy  cried mrs bupp shaking her madraskerchiefturbaned head disapprovingly

 do you think the captain will surrender her to the imbunda  asked muffy

not much cried the constable the captain is kinder gone on her

has he made her his woman asked the secretary

no sir replied the constable he treats her just as if she were a civilized lady

mrs bupp struck with amazement rolled up her eyes and held her hands on high

 what next  cried she  the idea of that stuckup american trying to put a heathen native wench upon a level with civilized ladiesâ with a lady like vie its absolutely insulting to us liberians 

insulting why mrs bupp its worse said muffy sympathetically and unseen by the lady he winked at the constable who responded with a grin

yes it is vociferated mrs bupp but what does the man intend doing with the creature do you know mr boltus 

according to what jaikie said he intends to send her to america and after she has been educated marry her

mrs bupp was now not only amazed but shocked

 scandalous  cried she vehemently  really it makes me ill to hear of it who ever heard of such a thing marry her when he could â couldâ well the man has no more sense than a jackass 

 perhaps he loves her remarked mr muffy

mrs bupp snorted

 suppose he does whats that got to do with it  cried she somewhat heatedly  does a person usually say grace before he eats something on the sly the mans a fool i knew that there was something wrong about him for hes never plumped a cent down on my counter i hope the girl will be taken from him even though the loss of her should break his heart he would deserve it 

mrs bupp gave another snort by way of a peroration

 i guess the savage hasnt much of a chance said the constable

 if i were a man id help him said the woman

muffy started mrs bupps words put an idea into his headâ an idea that accelerated the beatings of his heart

 by jove why not  thought he  it would even things up nicely between us

while muffy thus communed with himself the blood rushed into his face and colored it

mrs bupp perceived the flush in mr muffys face and the good soul became very much concerned about him

good gracious mr muffy exclaimed she your face is red as a beet whats the matter are you in pain 

 awful  said mr muffy his tone was lugubrious

 where is it â in your insides  asked mrs bupp

 a sort of gnawing responded the secretary and he rubbed the place wherein gnawings usually reside

mrs bupp became very compassionate

 poor mr muffy  exclaimed she pityingly then perhaps with one of her eyes directed toward business she added  maybe mr muffy if you swallowed another wee drop of the  lixer the pain would vacate your interior

 perhaps it would agreed muffy dolefully

he helped himself to a  wee drop  of the  lixerâ that is he halffilled the tumbler with gin this time however having something at hand to do with which a burning throat and shortness of breath would interfere he did not ingulp the liquor but controlling his impatient appetite sipped it slowly at the same time with an air of indifference he conversed with the constable

 do you suppose lodango has returned to his kraal   asked he

 i should say not responded the constable  it isnt likely that he would have gone away without having made a try at getting hold of lupelta i imagine that he is hiding somewhere near the city

 probably said muffy  do you think you could find out for a certainty where he is the president would like to know

 easily sir answered the constable

very well do so and let me know as soon as you can said muffy

 ill attend to it at once said the man and he hastened from the shop

mr muffy smiled with satisfaction and there no longer being a reason for resisting his persuading palate disposed of the remainder of his gin with one large swallow he then paid mrs bupp bade her farewell and started for the executive mansion

this important structure was situated in the center of the city on ashmun street a short distance to the south of a summit where in december  in the infancy of the republic the heroic ashmun rising from his bed of sickness with thirtyfour brave colonists repulsed an assault made by  savages as did the american legation the dutch consulate and several private dwellings the mansion faced an unevensurfaced square of ground enclosed by a fence made of rough stones loosely placed together in the interstices of which nested lizards scorpions and other kinds of reptiles and insects both harmful and harmless this enclosure was named government square therein the monrovians w tere wont periodically to muster and with much shouting and prancing go through a sort of military drill there newlyelected chief magistrates delivered their inaugural addresses and took part in other functions and there as had happened more than once natives died uncared for and unpitied

though the executive mansion was not a brilliant example of architectural skill it had the appearance of solidity and it contained numerous spacious rooms distributed over two extensive floors and a large cupola the cupola room was lighted by many wide windows from which could be viewed the rivers the harbor the ocean and a delightfullooking country dotted with forests and embossed with hills and containing many other features that gave a charming diversity to the view

the president and his stepdaughter miss hulda bartle resided in the executive mansion the cupolaroom was huldas boudoir and in it she idly spent many hours either watching passing ships at sea or gazing at the faraway hills in the valleys of which were situated the kraals of the warlike imbunda people

hulda was what some persons call a  lovechild but why illegitimate children should be thus named in contradistinction to children born of legally married mothers it is very puzzling to understand however her father a justminded englishmanâ who like the majority of his countrymen was immovably convinced that only englishmen should be permitted to reside and do business in englandâ had seen fit to favor liberia with his presence and huldas mother with his intimate society during a number of years he bartered adulterated new england rum and the like for pure palm oil on weekdays and being a good christian attended church on sundays

in consequence of his honest endeavours he eventually became rich and his wealth made him homesick and filled him with a desire to regularize his relationship with the opposite sex now nostalgia being a complaint for which there was only one curative and liberia offering him no opportunity to reform by connecting himself in legitimate marriage with a lady of his own race he bade farewell to his makeshift wife and his daughter hulda who was then an infant boarded one of the elder and dempster homeward bound steamers and passed from their ken forever it must be placed to his credit that contrary to the practice of the majority of his kind he left a fair portion of his belongings behind him for his castoffs

the deserted mother did not clothe herself in sackcloth nor strew ashes upon her head because of the englishmans departure her courage was braced up by the material benefits his exit had conferred upon her she accepted the situation very philosophically that is to say she began casting her glances about in search of some person of her own race and nationality to occupy the place vacant in her affections

so soon as it became known that the pseudo widow was willing to make a second venture in the realm of matrimony many gentlemen from all over the republic became rival candidates for her hand if not her fortune for a time she found it difficult to select one from the many deserving suitors but at last won by the superior attractions mental as well as physical of a poor but aspiring gentleman she fixed her choice on him

then the wedding bells rang no one mentioned the happy grooms predecessor and hulda then in her late teens participated in the consequent revelries admired by all scorned by none for a soft sin such as the bride had committed was winked at by society in monrovia and illegitimacy was not exactly unfashionable

the wife so used her wealth to promote the fortunes of her husband that he arrived at the pinnacle of his ambitionâ the presidency of liberia shortly after the woman had accomplished this good work she died leaving the greater part of her possessions under the trusteeship of the widower to hulda then over twentytwo years of age

two years had now passed since huldas mother died this morning the girl was in her boudoir reclining in a careless attitude on a lounge and reading a book when mr muffy entered unannounced and without even the formality of knocking

hulda dropped the book sprang from the lounge and frowned at the intruder

 pidgley cried she indignantly  what do you mean 

mean said muffy innocently as he crossed toward her  i dont understand you what are you driving at 

you came in without knocking

mr muffy appeared to be very much surprised

 i did nothing of the kind  cried he  i knocked twice

 i dont believe you 

mr muffy apparently wounded to his very soul looked at the girl reproachfully

 do you for a second suppose i would tell you a falsehood he asked in an aggrieved tone  why hulda id much sooner have my tongue torn out by its roots 

the mans extravagance restored the girl to goodhumor and she laughed

 pidgley dont be a fraud said she  ive caught you fibbing any number of times

 well i havent told one this time

 i give you the benefit of the doubt and apologize now tell me what brought you here 

 dont you know 

 how should i know  asked she

 you asked me to see old lobue

 oh yes so i did i had forgotten all about it have you seen her 

 yes about an hour ago

 did she give you the medicine 

 do you intend to keep me standing 

 certainly not exclaimed hulda and placing herself upon the lounge she motioned him to sit down beside her

mr muffy sat down close to hulda almost touching her this proximity caused the blood to rush through his veins and redden his face

hulda perceived that her companion was flushing and remarked upon it

 why pidgley exclaimed she  whats the matter with you your face is as red as â as a peony 

 its the heat was truthful mr muffys explanation

 youd better cool yourself said hulda and she handed him a fan

muffy was well aware that fanning would not cool his fever nevertheless for the purpose of appearing consistent he used the instrument and in so doing wafted the odor of gin which was emerging from his mouth to huldas nostrils

the effluvium offended hulda

 faugh youve been drinking  exclaimed she disgusted and moving back from him  no wonder youre hot if you dont break off the habit pidgley youll soon become a perfect sot

 something happened at the waterside that upset my nerves and i took a drop of hollands to quiet them said muffy humbly

 what an absurd excuse  cried hulda amused  you poisoned yourself with the nasty stuff because you like it

 i detest it but â

now i know youre fibbing broke in the girl

 but never mindâ tell me about lobue did she give you the medicine 

no

 why not 

 the old hag said you must receive it from her yourself she requires you to be at her hut tonight shortly after the moon shows her face

hulda frowned

 ill do nothing of the kind  exclaimed she

muffy smiled he still believed that the love potion was intended for himself

 it wont matter said he

hulda glanced quickly at muffy out of the corners of her eyes

 what am i to infer from that  asked she somewhat uneasy

muffy wanted to disclose what was in his mind but wisely refrained

 theres nothing for you to infer said he  i was merely thinking that lobues demand was rather cheeky

hulda was satisfied that muffys remark which had somewhat startled her meant nothing and she was relieved

 cheeky is no name for it said she  but now tell me what happened at the waterside that upset you  

muffy thus reminded of his late clash with captain dale scowled

i was assaulted said he

 assaulted  repeated hulda interested

 yes brutally 

 poor pidgley exclaimed hulda her voice was sympathetic was it so serious as that who did it 

 that noseintheair american

 faulkner 

 no daleâ confound him 

as has been intimated hulda was inclined to sympathize with mr muffy but now learning that it was the captain who had done the assaulting her mood changed and it was with difficulty that she prevented herself from smiling in the secretarys face

 the cruel man  exclaimed the young hypocrite

muffy was an alumnus of the liberian collegeâ wherein handicrafts and agriculture are not taughtâ and a knowledge of the doing of the ancients was as the saying goes at the tips of his fingers

 a perfect caligula  cried he

did he flog you asked hulda

muffy glared at hulda wonderingly

 flog me  cried he with much emphasis  have you lost your wits flog me of course not if he had tried to do anything like that maybe i wouldnt have given him what no he merely shoved me

hulda again suppressed a smile

 how did you manage to offend him  asked she

 i didnt offend him at all at least i can see no reason why he should have taken offense i was flogging a native the beastly american had the nerve to interfere i suppose he was moved by his confounded equal rights ideas which we liberians dont thank him for bringing into the country and teaching to the natives the cad i shall pay him out 

 is that so  said hulda somewhat coldly

 yes thats so 

though hulda was not acquainted with muffys character to its muddy depths she knew that he was very capable of doing mean things so his threat to practise against dale somewhat alarmed her and she made up her mind to act as the captains guardian angel

 in what manner do you propose to proceed against him   she asked

 ill persuade my uncle to have him recalled to america answered muffy

 your uncle will not be persuaded said hulda

why not

 because i will not permit him

 you  cried muffy amazed glaring at hulda

yes ii cried hulda firmly

 but hulda said muffy wonderingly  what difference would it make to you 

 captain dale is doing exceedingly good work in liberia said hulda you shant have him sent away 

muffy began floating in a sea of doubts

 hulda what does this mean  said he

 it means said hulda somewhat off her guard  that i will not allow my stepfather to do anything to injure captain dale

 you will not 

i will not

mr muffy suspected the truth and his jealousy was aroused he grew pale

it is possible murmured he half to himself

he glared intently at hulda she returned his stare bravely but was unable to prevent her face from becoming red the mans face on the other hand grew black as night huldas blushes had exposed her feelings to him he felt like murdering the girl

you are fond of the american said he vainly endeavouring to keep his voice firm

 you the presumptuous  cried hulda rising from the lounge  you will leave the room please 

 lobue told me said muffy rising  that the socalled medicine was a lovepotion

huldas face which had resumed its normal color again became red

 pidgley you are unbearable  cried she  go away

 a love potion continued muffy  which you purpose giving to dale

the girl cast on him a look of scornful dignity

 if you wont go i will  she exclaimed and she started toward the door

 you need not said muffy and passing hulda who halted he went scowling from the room

alone hulda threw herself down upon the lounge buried her face in her hands against a cushion and burst into gentle weeping

mr muffy proceeded from huldas boudoir directly to lobue at the waterside he persuaded the old woman into granting him a long interview by giving her an american dollar in goldâ parting with the money with much reluctance for as was the case with monrovians generally his purse was exceedingly flabby later in the day he again saw the constable whom he had met in mrs bupps shop and learned from him that lodango was encamped somewhere in the vicinity of the lake of lilies then about seven oclock in the evening he started for lobues hut which was situated in a lonesome place far away from any other habitation a little over a mile from the city

he arrived at the hovel just before the moon begun shining he entered it without ceremony and found its owner squatting upon the floor close to a fire

 he he he  cackled lobue leering at her visitor as he entered  muffy has come 

 i told you i would didnt i growled the secretary annoyed because of the long walk he had had

 yes muffy told lobue agreed the hag

 have you prepared the other medicine  asked muffy

 it is ready responded lobue  if hulda gives it to dale it will not make him love her it will make him ill maybe it will make him die

 i dont want the stuff to kill him still if he should turn up his toes ill not wear any mourning but perhaps hulda will not show up

 hulda will come said lobue confidently

 how do you know have you heard from her or seen her she refused you know

 hulda will come repeated the old woman  huldas heart will make her come

 i expect â

 sh â  interrupted lobue and she listened intently her ear bent toward the door  lobue hears footsteps

 huldas carriers exclaimed the secretary

 yes muffy will hide himself quickly

where asked muffy excitedly

lobue pointed at a large wooden mortar that stood in a corner of the room

 behind that  cried she

muffy cautioning the old woman to be careful not to disclose his presence to hulda hastily crouched out of sight behind the mortar just in time to escape being discovered by hulda who entered the next moment

 welcome welcome hulda  cried lobue grinning at the girl

 goodevening lobue returned hulda  i am here at the time you set is it ready 

 is what ready hulda  

 you know said hulda reluctant to mention the love potion

 maybe lobue does know maybe lobue does not know hulda must name it

 the â the love potion stammered the girl blushing

lobue nodded her head and grinned

now lobue knows said she

 have you prepared it 

 lobue has

 then give it to me at once so i may go said hulda  i must get back to the mansion before they miss me

 has hulda brought lobue gold 

 yes  said hulda and she offered the old woman a coin

lobue gazed greedily at the coin for a second or two then turned her glance from it evidently most unwillingly

 no no said she as she gazed away from the money  lobue must know more before she takes it hulda must tell lobue his name

hulda grew impatient

 lobue you are trifling with me cried she  give me the potion at once 

lobue unperturbed by huldas angry tone grinned up into her face

 tell lobue said she  the name of the man whose love hulda desires to win

hulda flushed

 i will not  cried she vehemently

muffy listening showed his head from behind the mortar and lobue perceived him she became possessed with a spirit of mischief and nodding wisely at hulda said  is his name pidgley muffy 

 good gracious lobue  cried hulda smiling  what ever made you think of him  

lobue chuckled inwardly

 muffy has only one eye and he is small said she  if hulda was muffys wife she could do things on his blind side if muffy vexed hulda she could flog him

 absurd  cried hulda  why sooner than marry him i would remain single all my life 

hulda laughed and lobue with a broad grin on her face glanced furtively at muffy who was scowling and cursing to himself

 now lobue continued hulda persuasively let me have the potion so i may go home

lobue shook her head dissentingly

 hulda must tell lobue the name first said she

 is it really necessary that you should know  asked hulda

 it is necessary

 do you promise never to mention it to another soul

 lobue will not mention it

hulda after hesitating a moment very unwillingly surrendered

 it is â is captain dale stammered she and ashamed she hung her head

 alas   exclaimed lobue apparently dismayed

 why  alas   asked hulda nervously

lobue groaned lugubriously

 answer me  cried hulda

 lobue must not tell hulda to hope said lobue

 what do you mean asked hulda impatiently

 lobues medicine cannot make dale love hulda explained the hag

hulda uttered an angry exclamation

 if that be so said she  your boasts to me were merely lies

 lobue did not lie hulda  snarled the old woman  shall lobue change hulda into a rat or a lizard or a â

hulda smiled

 hush lobue im not an utter fool she interrupted  if you could change me in that fashion you would have transformed yourself into a pretty young girl long ago

lobue was confounded and for the moment silenced to cover her confusion she grunted and w tagged her head disapprovingly

 but why is captain dale immune  continued hulda

 lupeltas fetich protects dale said lobue

 lupelta â lupelta said hulda thoughtfully  who is â oh yes i remember lupelta is the native girl whom he rescued from slavers  

 yes lupelta loves dale r hulda felt a twinge of jealousy

 a native girl love  cried she  preposterous  

 dale loves lupelta went on lobue

hulda was not ignorant of the fact that the civilized liberian men married and single alike were addicted to cultivating a friendship anything but platonic with native females and she supposed that lobues statement pointed at something of the kind it hurt her to believe that dale in this respect was no better than her own countrymen still it did not cause her to love him less nor was she inclined to quarrel with him because he followed the fashion

im sorry said she somewhat sadly but i suppose hell get over it

 dale will not get over it said lobue  dale will marry lupelta in church

dale was reinstated in huldas good opinion but she did not rejoice she grew pale exclaiming  it is not true i do not believe it 

 it is true said lobue gravely  but there is a way for hulda to win dale hulda must get rid of lupelta

a terrible thought entered huldas mind and she shivered

get rid of her said she almost whispering the words what do you mean

 he he he doesnt hulda know what lobue means 

 murder her  queried hulda in low awed tones

lobue grinned into the agitated girls face

why not why not  cried she

 heavens  exclaimed hulda horrified

 hulda would like to seize lu eltas throat went on the hostess evidently enjoying herself hulda would like to squeeze and squeeze until lupeltas face grew black hulda would likeâ

you wicked wretch hush cried hulda you deserve to be choked yourself if i were to repeat to my stepfather what you have said he would have you hanged

 no no cried lobue trembling with fear  hulda will not tell lobue does not want to die lobue is not ready

 then be careful what you say warned hulda sternly

 lobue will be careful whined the old woman  there is another way

 state it

 give lupelta to lodango advised lobue

hulda stared amazedly at lobue

 why to lodango   asked she

 lodango will take lupelta to his kraal and make her his wife explained lobue  hulda will give the medicine to dale now when lodango has taken lupelta away from monrovia dale will love hulda hulda will be happy 

hulda was sorely tempted

lobue perceived the effect her words were having and she chuckled then intending to send the girl over the edge of the chasm toward which she had been urging her she made a false step

 lupelta is beautiful  cried she  when lodango has taken her away dale will no longer see her beauty dale will see only huldas beauty

hulda was an exceedingly proud young lady and her pride now saved her selfrespect from being wrecked

am i ugly asked she proudly

 hulda is beautiful  responded lobue and she gazed enviously at the girl

 am i less beautiful than lupelta  

 lupeltas beauty is like that of the moon huldas beauty is like that of the sun  said lobue

the comparison flattered huldas vanity and she smiled

 i will not practise wickedly against lupelta said she  i will act toward her justly as i hope she would toward me

 hulda will gave dale the medicine  

no said hulda vehemently i will rely upon such charms i may be possessed of from nature if they fail me ill submit

lobue began to fear she was not to receive the gold from hulda and her heart sank

 hulda will give lobue the gold  said she pleadingly

 there it is  said hulda and she dropped the coin to the floor before lobue goodnight she tersely added and she hastened from the hut

lobue snatched the coin up from the floor and began kissing it meanwhile muffy came from behind the mortar and approached her

 lobue cried the secretary coming toward the hag  youve bungled everything 

 hulda is wise answered the old woman

 and youre a fool  cried muffy turning on his heel and going out into the night

 gold gold  cried lobue gazing ecstatically at the coin held fast within her clawlike hands

bushrod islandâ long narrow and luxuriantly vegetatedâ was washed on one of its lengthy sides by the atlantic ocean on its other by stockton creek and the mesurado river the latter stream separating it from the city of monrovia the beach on this island was inviting and captain dale visited it nearly every morning to bathe in the surf though his monrovian friends had again and again warned him against so indulging himself they were wont to tell him that it was not only conducive to an attack of fever but also exceedingly dangerous because of the possibility of being devoured by maneating sharks

all warnings however were wasted for dale persisted in the practice not that he was at all inclined to be foolhardy but being aware that his advisers invariably did their bathing in pipinghot water contained either in buckets or washingtubs or halfcasks or stewpans he suspected that they cautioned more to excuse their own sybaritism than because they were concerned either as to his safety or health

howsoever dale viewed this matter he crossed to the island and bathed in the surf early in the morning on the day following his little disturbance with mr muffy no voracious monster of the deep disturbed him while at his ablutions though innumerable fiddlers peeped at him from their holes in the sand and a screaming fishing eagle gazed down at him from its perch on a limb of a tall cocoanut tree indifferent to these inquisitive eyes he swam and plunged to his hearts content then left the water wrapped himself in a capacious foulah gown that covered him from neck to ankles and ran across the width of the island to its river side where he found his boat waiting to carry him to the city he was about to embark but as courtesy required of him paused to speak to hulda whom he perceived coming down the path toward the landing

 goodmorning miss bartle  said he to the young girl as she drew near arent you rather early abroad 

hulda returned the captains salutation smilingly and said in reply to his question  ive been to boomas town to purchase poultry for our reception on independence day i thought it would be as well to do the errand earlyâ before it became hot but you are early abroad too 

 oh i come here early nearly every morning replied dale

 to bathe in the surf 

 yes

 how nice  cried hulda  i wish that swimming were one of my accomplishments perhaps you will teach me will you i could take my first lesson this morning

dales naturally healthy appetite had been so sharpened by his late duck that he was now craving his breakfast therefore though hulda was charming indeed and he himself was not ungallant her request did not appeal favorably to him

 are you accustomed to bathing in the surf  asked he

 i have never been in it here responded hulda

 then if you take my advice said dale  youll not venture

 why not 

 it is likely to bring on an attack of the fever said dale and he glanced longingly toward his boat

hulda perceived dales glance and guessed its meaning smiling inwardly she thought  ill tease him well for that

 im not a bit afraid of the fever said she aloud

 but how about the sharks 

 they dont seem to bother you captain replied the girl

 no they dont returned dale thoughtless of where his admission was leading him

 why dont they   asked hulda demurely

dale was in a quandary

 well they â they respect me stammered he then struck by the absurdity of this remark he paused and looked at his companion somewhat confusedly

hulda though she was enjoying dales embarrassment kept her face straight

 yes  said she questioningly leading him on

i â i mean continued the captain floundering in his puddle  that i â i dodge them

plulda who could swim quite as well as any kruman and knew more about the ways of sharks than dale did or ever would wanted to scream with laughter but unwilling to bring the fun to a period she refrained clasping her hands together and gazing admirably at dale she cried  oh captain dale how exceedingly clever you are

 what a fraud i am  thought dale ruefully

 you must instruct me how to dodge them continued hulda  indeed you should set up a school somewhere and teach everybody how to dodge sharks im sure youd make a fortune at it

hulda made this businesslike suggestion apparently in all seriousness nevertheless it seemed so utterly nonsensical that dale became suspicious and he gazed into her eyes expecting them to disclose whether or not she was playing with him but he learned nothing that is nothing other than that the organs of sight were beautiful  for hulda was alive to his intention and defeated it by meeting his glance very innocently his doubts were removed and he marvelled at her simplicity then he thought of what might happen to this  simple  creature were she in the sea endeavouring to dodge a shark and a chill ran up and down his spine actually causing him to shiver

hulda was aware of her victory and smiled

 yes captain she went on  ill be your first pupil after i have become expert ill give you a testimonial which you may have published the fact that you have taught the stepdaughter of the president of liberia how to dodge sharks will be a very catching advertisement

 great scott  thought dale  what will she say next 

you wall teach me wont you added hulda persuasively

 i beg to be excused said dale

arent you mean exclaimed hulda and she pouted her lips in a way that caused her companion to think them well worthy of being kissed

 i am very sorry said dale regretfully  but really twould be altogether too risky

 i am quite willing to run the risk persisted hulda determined to drive dale into a corner

 i am not said the captain firmly

desiring to escape from a situation that was becoming more and more embarrassing each moment dale was now about to bid hulda farewell but she perceived his intention and having no thought of letting him go prevented it before he could speak she pointed at a flower that was showing over and from behind a mass of shrubbery some distance away exclaiming enthusiastically   oh what a beautiful flower 

dale somewhat skilled in the science of botany and passably familiar with the liberian flora recognized the bloom

 it is a plant of the passionflower orderâ a smeathmannia said he not displeased to air his knowledge

 we call it loversgift said hulda

 quite suggestive said dale smiling

 the use we put the flower to gives it a right to the title returned hulda

 elucidate please

 you refused to teach me and i ought to pay you back in your own coin said hulda coquettishly  but i will not be mean we call it loversgift because when a young man is too timid to propose to his ladylove in due form he pops the question by offering one of the flowers if the lady accepts the gift she accepts the giver and soon afterward a weddingcake is cut

 somewhat poetical miss bartle 

 it is not but captain i would like to have the flower perhaps you will kindly pluck it for me 

 hullo thought dale  the young lady is out for a flirtation but im afraid i cant accommodate her though dale was not prepared to exchange soft nothings with hulda he was not a prig ordinarily he was quite as ready to philander with a pretty girl as is any other young fellow who as was the case with himself has warm blood running in his veins but at the present moment he was longing for his breakfast and was not at all disposed to play at lovemaking on an empty stomach at any rte he hesitated to reply hulda perceived his hesitation misunderstood its cause and blushed she proceeded to correct the mistaken idea which she erroneously supposed had entered his mind

 if a young lady asks a gentleman to give her the flower said she  then it is not called loversgift but simply white camellia

dale understood hulda though he was not prepared to do any gallivanting with her just then the thought that she was ready to indulge him was anything but displeasing therefore when he saw that she was not that way inclined his feathers fell

 if that be the case said he somewhat piqued  ill send one of my boys to gather it

he would have summoned one of his krumen from the boat but hulda stopped him

 no dont call him  she cried quickly before dale could shout  the kruman is roughhanded and would crush the flower you must pluck it yourself

very well said dale and he unwillingly went to procure the bloom

hulda watched dale until he passed from her sight behind the shrubbery to reach the flower then she hastened to his boat and spoke to its cockswain

 yellow will said she  i want you to go to the executive mansion at once

 yes mammy replied the kruman

hulda took a small key from her reticule

you will give this key to my maid moona said hulda and she handed the key to the kruman  go at once  she added

yellow will seemed disinclined to obey he gave a glance toward the shrubbery behind which dale had disappeared then gazed at hulda doubtfully and scratched his head

 captain dale continued hulda answering the krumans unspoken question  will return to the city in my canoe make haste yellow will come to me this evening and i will give you a dash

the cockswains doubts were dissipated

 belly good mammy  cried he and a few seconds later dales boat was sailing toward the city

dale carrying the flower rejoined hulda shortly afterward he delivered the bloom to her then looking for his cutter he saw that it was missing

why cried he amazed whats got into yellow will is he mad he asked and glaring at the rapidly receding boat he shouted to the cockswain fruitlessly

 he is too far away said hulda suppressing a smile

 evidently returned dale ruefully  did he say anything to you miss bartle before he went 

 yes

 do you mind repeating it   

 certainly not he said  yes mammy

dale was very much at sea

 i dont understand said he  had you spoken to him 

 im inclined to think so said hulda demurely dales amazement grew

 may i ask what you said to him   asked he staring at hulda   of course you may

 well 

 well what 

dale was beginning to feel annoyed

 miss bartle said he somewhat impatiently  will you please answer my question  

hulda smiled sweetly at dale

 captain dale said she  after you have asked me a question i will answer it with pleasure

dale was amused despite the annoyance he felt

 oh thats it  said he smiling perhaps miss bartle continued he very deferentially  you will condescend to impart to your humble petitioner what you said to yellow will will that do 

hulda laughed

 i told him said she  to take a key to the executive mansion

dale stared at hulda

 did you send my boat away  asked he

 im afraid i did said hulda and there was a slight tremor in her voice but whether it was brought there by fear or amusement may be guessed

 what the dev â began dale angrily but remembering that be was speaking to a lady he broke off short  i beg your pardon miss bartle he concluded

 you need not returned hulda  if letting off a few naughty words will ease your pain captain dale by all means explode ill take care not to hear you whereupon placing her hands at her ears and gazing mischievously at the halfincensed captain she cried  now then 

dale was unable to retain his illhumor in the face of the girls pleasantry he laughed

 thats better said hulda approvingly

 youve interned me said dale

 not for a long time my boys will soon be here from boomas town and when they have come ill take you across in my canoe

 thanks

 meanwhile continued hulda  we may as well make ourselves comfortable indicating a silk cotton tree which was gloriously beautiful with innumerable scarletpurple flowers she went on  shall we sit in its shade until the boys arrive 

dale agreed and they crossed to the tree hulda sunk to the turf in the shadow cast by its overhanging foliage and gazed up at the captain

 arent you going to rest yourself  said she invitingly

 i suppose i might as well responded dale and he placed himself upon the ground beside her

 now captain said hulda hugging her knees  you must amuse me

dale again thought of his waiting breakfast and groaned inwardly

 describe some of your adventures continued hulda  tell me of hairbreadth escapes from death â things like that

now dale had passed through a number of interesting adventures some of them having been thrillingly dangerous but as is the case with the majority of courageous men he disliked to talk about his deeds so though he resembled othello in his complexion and though too hulda was eager to  devour up  his discourse he was disinclined to imitate the boastful moor

 hairbreadth escapes  repeated dale

 yes i want you to make my blood creep 

dale laughed

 im afraid that is a flight beyond me said he  such adventures as ive had were altogether commonplace in these matteroffact days scaly dragons or other terrible monsters exist only on screens in movie shows therefore no matter how eager one may be to play the knighterrant the opportunity for so doing never presents itself

â  hulda shook her finger at dale exclaiming fie fie captain you are not as a native would put it  making straight palaver 

no

 if a tale that ive heard is true then you have been doing the chivalrous quite effectively

dale had no idea what hulda was referring to and was puzzled

 perhaps i have done something foolish said he  but i dont remember

 were you doing something foolish when you rescued a beautiful native girl from slaveraiders   asked hulda and though smiling she watched dale to see how her question affected him

oh exclaimed dale and his brown face became suffused with red

hulda perceived how dale was stirred and her heart grew heavy

you refer to lupelta  continued the captain

 yes said hulda controlling her emotion

 i effected her rescue easily said dale

 dont endeavour to belittle your deed said hulda  arab slavers are not easily forced to relinquish their prey

 perhaps not said dale

 i have been told that lupelta is beautiful is she 

 she is indeed beautiful  exclaimed dale enthusiastically

hulda sighed to herself sadly

 beauty is not lupeltas greatest charm continued dale  she has many excellent qualities of both mind and heart undoubtedly she will develop into a very noble woman

dales words hurt hulda and unseen by him she winced

 yes she is one out of a thousand  concluded the captain

 you praise her very highly said hulda

no more highly than she deserves

 i have been informed that she is very fair 

 yes quite as fair as some white girls ive seen sometime i wonder if reesha her reputed mother who i have been given to understand is a negress pure and simple is really her mother

hulda who had a very fair complexion straight brown hair and hazelcolored eyes while her mother had been almost black thought of her own case and had her tongue not been tied by modesty would have referred to it as an example of how europe frequently tries to bleach africa as it was though she merely remarked  it is not an unusual thing for native women to have children who resemble caucasians

 so it appears said dale understanding the girls allusion

 i would like to see lupelta said hulda

 i thought you americoliberian ladies looked down upon na â

 not all of us captain broke in hulda  anyhow you have interested me in lupelta and i would like to see her and talk with her

in offering to meet lupelta evidently intending to accept her on an equality with herself hulda was making a great concession dale was aware of this he was commensurately appreciative and smiled at his companion gratefully but even as he was smiling a large tarantula dropped from the tree to the girls shoulder and bit it

 heavens  cried hulda as she felt the bite and she hastily brushed the venomous spider from her shoulder

the insect fell to the ground and dale who had sprung to his feet stamped the life out of it

it was generally believed by liberians that the tarantulas bite meant death and hulda who was no wiser than her compatriots in this respect was very much alarmed

 oh its bite is fatal  cried she her voice alive with agitation

dale whose knowledge in this connection was about on a par with huldas also was alarmed he bent over the frightened girl and concernedly asked  where did it bite you  

 on my shoulder cried hulda hysterically

dale acted promptly muttering an apology he at once tore open huldas sleeve and exposed her bare shoulder on which a red spot indicated the place where she had been bitten thinking only of saving her life he placed his lips against the puncture and proceeded to suck out the poison which the spider had deposited there

hulda submitted to the touch of dales lips until she could stand the sweet contact no longer

 i think that will do said she somewhat faintly

dale ceased cupping drew back and wiped his forehead which was damp with perspiration

 perhaps you wont mind pinning my sleeve  continued hulda and she handed dale two pins

dale pinned the sleeve together but since he was a man clumsily of course

 now miss bartle cried he the pinning done  buck up youre right as â as a trivet 

hulda gazed at the captain gratefully her eyes were moist

 you have saved my life said she emotionally

dale thinking hulda was about to make a scene became uneasy hoping to prevent her he proceeded to make light of what he had done

 you exaggerate said he  twasnt nearly so serious as that if the poison hadnt been removed at once probably your shoulder would have been more or less sore for a time but your life was in no danger

despite dales disclaimer hulda believed that he had saved her life and she solemnly vowed that if ever the opportunity offered itself she would reward him she kept this vow

 be that as it may replied she  i am very very grateful 

 here it comes  thought dale rdefully  this is what a chap gets for turning himself into a â

 mammy broke in a kruboy who had approached unnoticed by either hulda or dale  mammy the canoe is ready

the captain thanked his lucky star for the interruption and a moment afterward he and hulda had entered the canoe and were soon crossing the river

it was about eight oclock in the evening the moon had not yet appeared and monrovias dimlyburning streetlamps of which there were no more than six or seven in the whole city lighted the pitchydark thoroughfares scarcely more effectively than would have a like number of fireflies however captain dale following a boy carrying a lighted lantern on his way to the mansion house managed to avoid tumbling over stones or falling into ditches or stepping into the midst of driverants to be half devoured by them and arrived in safety at his destination where he found hulda in her boudoir

 goodevening miss bartle said he advancing from the door toward her  you look fit for anything the tarantulas bite apparently has done you no harm

 thanks to you it has not said hulda had you acted less promptly who can say what would have happened im sure captain dale i didnt thank you half enough this morning so â

 dont please  broke in dale  it strikes me that i was rather â rather â that i owe you an apology

 for saving my life  asked hulda laughingly

 i was thinking of the damage i did i hope the blouse is not damaged beyond repair

 i wouldnt have it mended for anythingâ not for the whole world i shall keep it as a souvenir of the incident it and the camellia are wrapped in tissuepaper and put away in my most sacred place

 wasted sentiment thought dale and while he was so thinking a young negress carrying a tray containing refreshments entered and left the door open behind her

 moona said hulda addressing the negress  place the tray upon the table

moona deposited her burden upon the table and as she did so mr muffy appeared in the doorway

 any admission  asked the secretary

hulda felt like saying  no  and so did dale but they remained silent and mr muffy crossed to the table and sat down near them

 whats the liquid  asked the secretary glancing at the jug on the tray

hulda was inclined to be disagreeable

 its not gin said she shortly then repentant she gently added  its iced lemonade made of real lemons pidgley

you dont say so exclaimed muffy captain dale he continued smiling at the american  real lemons are a treat

 undoubtedly agreed dale communing with himself he thought  evidently the fellow bears no grudge theres better stuff in him than i thought

 hulda went on muffy while dale was turning him over in his mind  where did you get them from 

 from mr moreton responded hulda  he purchased a box from the spanish steamer the other day captain dale mr moreton is my best sweetheart

dale laughed he was aware that huldas mr moreton was over sixtyfive years of age

you may laugh but he is said hulda he is a dear old soul  

 i must give the old man a look up before his stock becomes exhausted said muffy sipping his lemonade

 i wonder that no one in liberia cultivates the lemon remarked dale

 maxton made a try but was compelled to give it up as a bad job responded muffy

 why  asked dale

 he found that native labor was altogether too unreliable explained the secretary

 are you not libelling the native mr muffy  exclaimed dale  it seems to me that under the right kind of supervision he works quite as well as any other unskilled laborer

 under supervision possibly returned muffy  but its there that the trouble lies we liberians have no time to do any supervising certainly maxton hasnt he is fully occupied with his official duties

 since ive never met the gentleman i must not judge him said dale  what is he 

 its much easier to say what maxton isnt than what he is answered muffy  he is any number of things checking the much employed mr maxtons various positions off on his fingers as he named them he continued   maxton is a probate judge a collector of taxes a district superintendent a chief constable a postmaster and a senator

no wonder the country is going to the dogs thought the captain

 pidgley joined in hulda youve forgotten to mention that mr maxton is our high admiral too 

 i did not forget said muffy  but as weve got no navy i thought it just as well not to mention that

 mr maxtons employments are multifarious said dale  he must be an exceedingly able gentleman 

 my stepfather thinks he will be our next president remarked hulda

 did he come from america   asked dale

 yes from georgia i believe answered muffy

 has he been in liberia a long time  said dale

 about ten years responded the secretary

 do you know what business mr maxton followed when he lived in america  asked dale much interested

 he was a sailor said muffy

 a common sailor  exclaimed dale amazed

 a common sailor  cried the secretary  no indeed he was a ships cook

oh exclaimed dale too much astonished to say more

 maxton isnt much of a scholar went on muffy singing the praises of his prodigy  but his eyeteeth are cut and ke knows how to pull the strings

 undoubtedly murmured dale weakly

hulda thought that they had talked about the wonderful mr maxton quite long enough so she diverted the conversation into a fresh channel

 captain dale said she  have you been to the mission house this evening 

 not jet answered dale

 then you are not aware of what occurred there this afternoon  went on hulda

both dale and muffy thought of lodango and the former grew nervous while the latter pricked up his ears

 what occurred  asked dale somewhat anxiously

 your ward lupelta had an unexpected visitor was huldas reply

 lodango   cried dale plainly very much alarmed

when hulda saw that dale was frightened she was glad the next moment though she felt sorry for him and she hastened to set his mind at ease

 am i lodango  cried she

were you the visitor  asked dale eagerly 

  yes replied hulda

dale gave a sigh of relief and his face which had grown pale resumed its normal color muffy cursed inwardly and scowled aside

did you see lupelta  asked dale

 yes and had a nice long chat with her responded hulda after a slight pause during which she got the better of something that was urging her to hush she added  lupelta is a charming creature 

dale gave hulda a smile that did not make her happy and he felt like embracing her

 miss bartle youre a brick  cried he

 shes a whole ton of em  joined in muffy heartily though he was still cursing to himself

hulda smiled

 i have invited lupelta to accompany me she went on  to a picnic that is to be given on the long beach on independence day after the public ceremonies i hope captain youll not refuse to come  

yes captain put in muffy you shouldnt miss the fun well be a jolly party 

 therell be lots of pretty girls to flirt with said hulda smiling

 it sounds all right and i guess the picnic would be a failure without me said dale rising he continued  now miss bartle i must tear myself away i promised lupelta that i would see her this evening

 well if you must said hulda rising

dale bade hulda and muffy goodnight and went away and hulda shortly afterward dismissed muffy who at once hastened to the presidents study

when the secretary left huldas boudoir liberias chief magistrate in his sanctum was reclining in an easy chair his feet were resting upon a writing table which also held in the society of a few books and papers a large tumbler halffull of undiluted spirits and a quart bottle labelled  browns    whiskey his excellencys hands were idle and his eyes were closed he seemed in a dream but probably was thinking of his grave and onerous duties however at muffys knock upon the door he became alert hastily he removed his feet from the table emptied the contents of the tumbler down his throat placed glass and bottle out of sight underneath the table and took an officiallooking document in his hand then the scene being set he bade muffy enter

well what now cried he impatiently as his secretary came into the study

 are you very busy uncle  asked muffy

 does this look as if i were idle  cried the president displaying the document he had taken from the table  of course im busy 

muffy was not deceived by his uncles acting for he had viewed the play many times before

 is it anything of importance asked he humoring the potentate

 do you suppose i would be so disturbed if it were not  returned the president irritably  but dont stand there gawking at me like an empty codfish head sitdown and ill explain

mr muffy seated himself and became all attention

 perhaps you will be able to suggest some way out of the difficulty continued his excellency  the natives at mt chocolate are making themselves troublesome and grant wants me to send dale with some of his men to quiet them i cant spare the captain i need him here lodango is lurking somewhere in the vicinity of the city and he may mean mischief no i cant spare dale 

 i fail to see why not said muffy we certainly have officers quite as capable and brave as the american whats the matter with colonel johnsonsubbs  

the president made an undescribable noise in his throat but the nephew knew what the noise meant and smiled responding to it he said  well maybe youre right

of course i am subbs has just about as much spunk as you have pidgley

evidently mr muffy was not pleased by this sneer at his courage for he gave his uncle an ugly look

 thanks said he  lots of people say i resemble my uncle in many ways

 unmannerly cub retorted liberias ruler  youll never be half the man your uncle is however thats neither here nor there how am i to straighten out the tangle 

 send dale to mt chocolate

 must i repeat that i cant spare him 

 as for lodango continued muffy paying no attention to his uncles interjection matters can be so arranged that hell return to his kraal at once

his excellency was puzzled

 what are you driving at   cried he  explain 

muffy disclosed why lodango was prowling near monrovia then recommended that facilities should be afforded the chief to enable him to abduct lupelta

 when the savage has her safely in his hands concluded mr muffy  hell go back to his kraal like a shot

 but what about dale  asked the president doubtfully  i cant afford to offend him you know

 theres no reason why he should ever learn that you interfered send him to mt chocolate and leave the rest to me

his excellency gazed wonderingly at muffy

 to you  exclaimed he

 yes uncle to your dutiful nephew said muffy and he grinned

 have you a grudge against the brave captain 

 i dont exactly love him said muffy and the expression on his face endorsed his words

 nor do i confessed the president  hes altogether too cocky pretends that the dollar problem doesnt interest him so isnt at all amenable to reason if it was not that i hope to persuade another loan from america id bounce himâ all the other americans as wellâ back to the states in doublequick time

 a good thing too  muttered muffy

 well pidgley continued the president  ill think the matter over come to me the first thing in the morning and ill let you know what ive decided

 all right uncle said muffy rising to go

 by the way said his excellency  have you come to an understanding with hulda  

 not yet replied the secretary pausing on his way out

 delays are dangerous pidgley twould never do for her to marry any one but you

 if she did perhaps some one would find himself in a deep hole said muffy and he grinned at his uncle meaningly

 youve had a share my boy said the president returning his nephews grin  however youd better stir your stumps

 i intend to im thinking of persuading her to make a trip with me to the interior if we are suddenly missed youll know whats happened

 all right but dont put your foot in it now if youll be off ill resume my work

 goodnight said mr muffy shortly and he left the room

the president resumed his work that is he resurrected the bottle and tumbler and refreshed himself with a bumper of whiskey

mr muffy saw his uncle again on the following morning toward evening he and a bassa boyâ the latter carrying a bag containing various articlesâ started for the lake of lilies so named because many waterlilies floated upon its placid surface which was situated in the center of a small glade about five miles from monrovia toward the interior

they arrived at their destination close upon sundown and halted beside a number of broken watergourds which were lying upon the ground near the edge of the lake

 blush said muffy as he gazed about the place  this must be the lake of lilies 

 yes daddy responded the boy  the imbundas will soon come to get water

 how do you know they will 

 those bottles belong to imbundas said blush pointing at the broken gourds

 are you sure of it  asked muffy gazing at the vessels

 blush is sure answered the lad  the bassa people get water when the sun comes up and when the sun goes down and so do the imbundas the sun is nearly down now and the imbundas will come quickly if we dont want them to take our heads more better we make a peacewitch and hide

 well get to work said muffy and pocketing his hands he watched the bassa

blush thus overlooked cleared away the grass from a small patch of ground and piled the uncovered loam into a mound this done he attached strips of rag to one end of a twig from which he had peeled its bark and stuck it rag end up in the center of the mound then from the bag he took a bolt of red cloth several strings of beads a few heads of leaftobacco and last but by no means the least in importance a quart jug of gin he placed these articles upon the mound around the twig then moved back and gazed at the strange creation admiringly

 good  cried he grinning  when the imbundas see peacewitch they will be glad too much   i suppose it is all â

just then they heard a school of monkeys out of sight in the forest begin chattering angrily and blush who was somewhat informed as to the ways of the denizens of the african wild knew that the noises announced the presence of human creatures among the trees he believed that the expected imbundas were at hand so he interrupted muffy

 daddy cried the bassa  the monkeys are vexed with the imbundas we must hide one time 

they secreted themselves in a conveniently situated clump of shrubbery and looking out shortly afterward perceived five imbunda warriors fully armed emerge from among the trees and cross to the lake four of them unslung large gourds from their shoulders waded into the water and proceeded to fill the vessels the fifth a headman remained upon the bank gazing about he soon discovered the peacewitch he glared amazedly at the thing for a second or two then shouted to the men in the water who immediately joined him

from where the imbundas were standing and in the growing dusk they were unable to see clearly the mound and the things upon it so failed to grasp their meaning undecided whether to approach it or run away they remained in this mood for fully a minute at the end of this time though the headmanâ curiosity getting the better of his timidityâ moved forward followed by the othersâ evidently ready to retreat at the slightest alarmâ toward the puzzling object

the imbundas protecting their breasts with their shields and holding their spears ready to launch advanced cautiously at last they recognized the peacewitch for what it was gave a great shout and raced pellmell up to it touching none of the articles upon the mound but gazing eagerly at them especially the bottle of gin they jabbered among themselves excitedly awhile then suddenly hushed and the headman glancing searchingly here and there about the place loudly shouted  stranger poofah has looked at peacewitch poofahs ears are open 

 daddy will make cunning talk to the headman whispered blush to muffy in the shrubbery

when the headman shouted muffy who was watching the imbundas with fear tugging at his heart sighed with relief and now he started a parley as blush had suggested

 is it peace  cried he

the imbundas fixed their gaze expectantly on the secretarys hidingplace

 it is peace  responded the headman

muffy was satisfied by the headmans assurance that the imbundas would do him no harm so he and blush emerged from the shrubbery and approached the mound

 poofah i salute you  exclaimed muffy as he advanced

good returned the headman  poofahs ears are open to hear the strangers name 

 i am the great mr muffy of monrovia  boasted the secretary  i am the presidents mouth and ears 

the savages were very much impressed with mr muffys importance

wow they exclaimed and they saluted the presidents mouth and ears  with their spears

 muffy is  big chief  added poofah

 big chief too much  cried blush

good ejaculated the headman poofah is muffys friend

 and i am poofahs said muffy  i make poofah and his warriors a dash  pointing at each article on the mound as he mentioned it he went on  there is cloth

poofah and his warriors grunted

 there are beads  continued the secretary

again the savages grunted

 there is tobacco  added muffy

the imbundas grunted once more this time with some enthusiasm

mr muffy now pointed at the jug of gin and with a just appreciation of the great consequence of the stuff paused a few seconds before completing his list

then strongly accenting the noun he cried impressively  there is gin 

the imbundas shouted joyfully then poofah after his warriors hushed smiled at muffy very benignantly and remarked  muffys heart is big muffys hands are open  

mr muffy did not deny this flattering allegation but accepted it smilingly

 why is muffy at the lake of lilies   asked the headman

 i would speak to lodango explained the secretary

is muffy brave asked poofah

brave exclaimed muffy of course i am do i look like a coward 

the headman studied muffys face a moment then shook his head as if he were uncertain

 maybe muffy is brave said he doubtfully  poofah will know by and by lodango is vexed lodango sits alone by the fire and broods lodango is sorry about lupelta

 i shall speak about lupelta to lodango said muffy

 lodango will be glad said poofah  muffy will pluck peacewitch from the little hill so the imbundas may take up the dash muffy will do quickly it will soon be dark

 blush remove it said muffy

the bassa pulled the ragdecorated twig from the mound and threw it aside then poofah snatched up the jug knocked its head off placed the ragged neck to his mouth and gurgled the gin down his throat

after he had partly allayed his unquenchable thirst for the civilizing agent he reluctantly passed the bottle to one of his warriors who with his companions afraid that he would be defrauded of a share of the liquor had been watching the headman anxiously the vessel was soon emptied and thrown into the lake then the other things were taken from the mound the gourds were filled with water and all hands blush carrying the bag that still contained presents marched from the glade into the forest toward lodangos camp after a little while night came and though the moon shone in the heavens underneath the overhanging limbs of the thicklyfoliated trees it was exceedingly dark so they advanced slowly however in about fifteen minutes they came to a small shed here poofah called a halt and pointing at the structure said  muffy will rest there until poofah returns the bassa will go with poofah

 do you expect me to remain here all alone in the dark exclaimed muffy nervously

 is muffy afraid  asked the headman

 of course im not afraid  cried mr muffy valorously but a tremor in his voice belied the brave words

good exclaimed poofah and he walked off followed by his warriors and blush

as the savages disappeared in the darkness muffy entered the shed he sat down upon a log and in a little while his imaginationâ which at all times was sufficiently lively but now was exceedingly soâ began playing him fantastic tricks the rustlings of dry leaves the hummings of insects the voice of the breeze sighing among the trees in short each and all of the innumerable creepy noises peculiar to an african forest in the nighttime alarmed him soon he felt like calling loudly for some one to come but except that his teeth would chatter and his body would tremble and jump he remained silent and perspiring at length though when a bat flapped its wings close to his head he surrendered he gave an unearthly yell jumped up from the log rushed out of the shed and to his great joy almost collided with poof ah

 wow  exclaimed the headman as he avoided muffv  whats the matter 

if muffys courage was weak his wits were quick i â i heard you coming stammered he

 muffy came quickly too much  exclaimed poof ah

 i didnt want to keep you waiting explained the secretary and then to prevent further embarrassing questioning he hastily asked  have you spoken to lodango 

 muffy will hold forth his hand said poofah

the mulatto held his hand out and the headman placed a grain of corn in it

 what is this for  asked muffy referring to the corn

 it is lodangos token that he will do you no harm explained the headman  lodango is hungry to hear muffy talk about lupelta muffy will go with poofah to lodango quickly 

saying nothing further poofah walked away and muffy followed him a few minutes later they arrived at the edge of a small grassy open place in the center of which were lodango blush and a number of the chiefs warriors the imbunda prince was squatting by himself near a fire gazing moodily at its flickering flame blush was upon his haunches close to a skin which was spread upon the ground before the chief the warriors were near their ruler and silently watching him

poofah and muffy halted and the former blew a resounding note from an ivory horn which he was privileged to use because of his superior rank and when the horn sounded lodango straightened up and glanced expectantly toward the point from which the sound had come as did blush and the warriors the headman then escorted the secretary across to the skin and bade him sit down upon it and as muffy obeyed poofah dropped to the ground himself and rubbed his forehead in the dust before the chief this act of homage performed the headman arose to his knees and pointed at the mulatto

 lodango cried he  poofah has brought muffy  

 good  cried lodango and he fixed his eyes on the secretary so fiercely that that gentleman felt quite queer

the headman crawled away meanwhile lodango clapped his hands together at muffy and shouted  lodango salutes muffy 

the fearless mr muffy brought a sickly smile to his face and returned the chiefs salute

 muffy is the presidents mouth and ears asked lodango

 yes said muffy

 good  cried the savage  lodango is his own mouth and ears why has muffy come to lodango 

 because i am your friend replied the secretary

lodango frowned

 sometimes the friendship of men who come from monrovia makes the imbunda people sorry too much said he  how is lodango to know that muffy is not trying to throw pepper into the eyes of the imbunda 

 i have brought you a big dash said muffy

the chief now smiled all over his face

 the imbunda lions eyes are open to see muffys dash said he

lodango and his warriors gazed at the bag eagerly and muffy inwardly praying that the gifts would please commanded blush to place them before the chief the bassa obeyed and as he brought cloth tobacco and beads out of the bag the imbundas grunted approvingly but when he took out several jugs of gin they shouted joyfullyâ lodango the loudest of all

we will drink we will drink cried they excitedly

lodangos desire to taste the intoxicant apparently was keen for he snatched up one of the bottles and displaying a dexterity which suggested that he had done the like many a time before knocked off its head with a small stone he raised the vessel toward his lips but before it reached his mouth he paused after hesitating a moment he returned the jug to the ground then glared at his warriors angrily and reproached them

 how now imbundas cried he  would you make glad when lodango is sorry wait muffy has brought lodango a message from lupelta when muffy has spoken lodango will be glad then lodango will drink then lodangos warriors will drink lodango has spoken 

the warriors evidently very much disappointed grunted and the chief after giving another glance at the jug which was tempting him sorely resumed his conversation with muffy

 muffys dash is good  cried he  what message has muffy brought to lodango from lupelta muffy must not lie if muffy lies he will die the death lodangos ears are open  

the chief glared at the secretary expectantly and the latter saying to himself  when the savage learns that ive brought no message i wonder what hell do shivered with apprehension

 lodangos ears are open  repeated the chief sternly

 lo â lodango said muffy haltingly  i have brought you no message from lupelta but there is â

 wow  broke in the chief and he sprang to his feet towering over the shaking secretary he fiercely continued  muffy has lied to lodango muffy shall die the death 

muffy shall die the death echoed the warriors ominously and they struck their spears against their shields meanwhile mr muffy was feeling very weak and was cursing himself for having ventured to introduce his precious self into the imbunda camp

 muffys head is coming off  added lodango and he raised his sword as though to decapitate the secretary right then and there

when the chief raised his weapon blush gave a yell rolled over backward sprang to his feet and disappeared into the forest and as the bassa gave voice muffy did the same

 stop stop   screamed he wildly gazing up at the angry chief holding up the grain of corn which poof ah had handed him he quickly went on  your token your token lodango the law says you must respect it 

lodango gazed at the token a moment then evidently with much reluctance lowered his sword and the surrounding savages deprived of a bloodfeast groaned with dissatisfaction

 i have not lied to you added muffy

lodango grunted and resumed his squatting attitude and mr muffy gave a sigh of relief

 i do not know how to lie concluded the secretary

 poof ah told lodango that muffy was bringing a message from lupelta said the chief

 i told poofah nothing of the kind  cried muffy

lodango muttered something and gazed darkly at the headman who shivered with dread while the other warriors moaned

muffy perceived that poofahs life hung as it were by a very slender thread which under the slightest added strain would surely snap nevertheless indifferent as to who might lose his head provided his own were left upon his neck he applied the fatal weight

 poofah lied to lodango  cried he

 poofah will lie no more  exclaimed lodango and he nodded to the headman

the warriors again moaned

poofah again approached the chief and laid his weapons and the ivory horn upon the ground before him

 lodango is poofahs chief  said he humbly

good ejaculated the prince and he waved his hand

 poofah will clear the path for lodango said the headman then he walked away with his head bowed and passed out of sight among the trees

two warriors unsheathed their swords and followed poofah and shortly afterward returned without him

 muffy said lodango as poofah started to go away  lodangos ears are open 

lodango rejoined the secretary the president wants you to remove lupelta from monrovia lodango nodded his head and smiled

 the president is cunning said he  muffy will tell him to send lupelta to lodango

 he cannot send her to you returned muffy  but i have a plan which if you will carry it out will put the girl into your hands

 lodangos ears are open to hear muffys plan said the chief eagerly

 you must first agree to do something for me said muffy

 lodango will do  responded the chief

 you must give me some sort of a pledge that you will keep your promise said muffy

 muffy is cunning  said lodango

he got upon his feet and holding in the air the pouch from his breast addressed it thus  o fetich o witch o charm lodango the great warrior lodango the slayer of men lodango the imbunda lion gives muffy a pledge â

the savage paused and gazed at his warriors and they holding their spears on high solemnly cried  o fetich open your ears 

 o fetich continued the chief  open your ears should lodango break his pledge may his arm wither 

 may lodangos arm wither   echoed the warriors

 may lodangos blood in his veins turn to water  went on the chief  may brave men scorn lodango may old men and old women laugh at lodango may children mock lodango 

the warriors moaned

 may lodango eat dirt  added the chief

 may lodango eat dirt  cried the savages

 lodango has spoken  concluded the prince and he again squatted himself then he turned to muffy and asked him if he were content

 quite said the secretary

 muffy will now tell his plan to lodango said the chief

 very well said muffy and he disclosed his plan

when the secretary had finished lodango shook his head doubtfully and said  if lodango does as muffy desires the president will send his fighting men to make war on the imbundas

 are you afraid of war  asked muffy   lodango will do  exclaimed the chief tersely then springing to his feet he shouted  imbundas lodango will devour them 

 lodango will devour them  chorused the warriors

the chief now pranced up and down brandishing his sword and boasted

 lodango am i  yelled he

 lodango lodango  screamed the warriors and they clashed their spears and shields together

 imbunda lion am i  shouted the chief still prancing  beloved of fetich am i lodango mil take the presidents head 

 lodango lodango  chorused the warriors wild with excitement

wow ejaculated lodango and he halted wow wow wow vociferated the savages then they hushed and pointed at the jug of gin

 good  ejaculated the chief  lodango is glad lodango will become drunk  he added

then snatching the jug up from the ground the imbunda lion drank deeply

the cuckooclock on the mantelpiece of the bedroom in which mrs colonel johnsonsubbs and her gallant spouse were slumbering began cuckooing the matron opened her eyes gaped sat up and proceeded to arouse her bedfellow

 colonel johnsonsubbs its five oclock  exclaimed she

the colonel snored on

 sleepyhead open your eyes  cried the lady  youre not dead wake up wake up 

the colonel still snored

 dont you hear me continued the woman somewhat impatiently  youre worse than the seven sleepers wake up 

the slumberer grunted opened and closed his eyes one at a time rolled over to his other side and resumed snoring

 drat the man he sleeps like a log  muttered the wife she punched her husband crying at the same time  wake up wake up i tell you if you dont hurry up youll never get to the fort in time wake up

the sleeper slept on

mrs johnsonsubbs now became convinced that more drastic measures were required accordingly she got out of the bed took up a jug of water and carried it to the bedside

wake up i tell you she shouted sprinkling her husbands face

evidently cold water did not agree with the colonels constitution for he spluttered and sat up at once

 good lord woman  cried he sufferingly  what are you trying to do  are you after giving me my death of cold 

 if you dont jump out of that nest just as quickly as the good lord will let you cried the wife  ill give you more than your death of coldâ ill drown you and she raised the jug as though to douse him

the colonel holding the bedcovering up to protect himself from the threatened shower cried stop itâ stop it sisserretta do you think im a fish 

sisserretta unmoved by her husbands appeal still held the jug on high

 if you dont get a move on yourself cried she ill make you wish you had fins you havent got the sleepydisease it soon will be sunrise have you forgotten what day this is should you fail to fire the gun off this morning the president will have you courtmartialedâ your commission will be taken from you and ill no longer be mrs colonel sisserretta johnsonsubbs get up this is independence day 

 gehosophat so it is  cried the colonel now wide awake and he jumped from bed and proceeded to dress himself

 colonel johnsonsubbs said madam as she returned the jug to the washstand if youd only work as hard as you sleep wed soon be rich covering her coiffure de nuit with a loose headdress she went on  you must have been born in the land of nod

 sisserretta growled the colonel dressing  you rattle away just like an empty barrel rolling down a hill   when you shoot the gun off look out it doesnt explode and blow you all to smithereens said the lady and laughing she started for her kitchen to scold her native servants into wakefulness

the colonel soon afterward strutted from the house in fulldress military uniform he climbed the hill and arrived at the fort just as the sun began pushing its big red face over the edge of the atlantic and at once hauled the  lone star  states flag to the flagstaffs peak and discharged a cannon

thus it was announced to monrovia that the sun of liberias â th independence day had risen

soon after this announcement busy hands began decorating the city flags were raised over the executive mansion the college the several consulates as well as many private dwellings and while these things were being done the housewives started pots to boiling and pans to baking perfuming the atmosphere with appetiteprovoking odours then in a little while visitors from  up the river  and natives from the hinterland all in holiday attire and curious to see the sights began promenading through the streets groups of krufolk of all ages and both sexesâ some fantastically dressed others practically nakedâ capering shouting and singing moved from house to house soliciting copper coin and rum several gaudily uniformed militia companies paraded as did civic organizations badged and scarfed and wearing tophats and longtailed coats they dancingly quickstepped to the lively music of fifes and drums or to the wonderful noises made by the citys only brass band

this changing scene continued until about eleven oclock then the citizens adjourned with their guests to breakfast tables and partook of the good things which as has been intimated had been titillating their olfactory organs during the entire morning they did not linger over the sumptuous meals a long time however for the most important function of the day soon drew them to government square

they assembled in the enclosure around a beflagged platform which had been erected underneath the spreading limbs of a mammoth mangoplum tree upon the floor of the platform were seated civil naval and military officials representatives of foreign countries all except the american ministerresident wearing uniforms decorated with ribbons and stars and scattered among these were a few ladies belonging to monrovias real aristocracy hulda was amongst the elite upon the platform but lupelta miss pattie and whreabo stood upon the ground among the common folk as became their more humble rank

shortly after the people had thus gathered the president of liberia the vicepresident the orator of the day the chief justice of the supreme court and his two associate justices the cabinet ministers mr muffy and the chaplain of the senate emerged from the executive mansion escorted by a militia company and preceded by the brass band striving to play coleridge taylors  ethiopia saluting the colors they marched into the enclosure and ascended to the floor of the platform a master of ceremonies read the program of the day then the chaplain his audience all standing and the mens heads reverentially bared invoked providence to shower blessings upon the republic next the president read the declaration of independence after which the orator of the day orated when the forensic business was finished the guns of the fort fired a national salute and the multitude their tuneful voices harmonizing sang liberias national hymn with most pleasing effect the brass band playing a respectable accompaniment

the next and last number on the official program was the presidential reception which was to be held in the executive mansion but as this function for which all the ladies in monrovia had procured new costumes was not to begin until eight oclock in the eveningâ hours henceâ the assemblage dispersed

lupelta miss pattie and whreabo returned to the mission house and all the time they were going there and after they had arrived the young folk chatted about the various things they had witnessed lupelta who had been both astonished and amused and was still in the  seventh heaven of delight was so voluble that at last whreabo remarked upon it

 lupelta talks fast too much  said he

why shouldnt ip exclaimed lupelta everything was so splendid and hulda was â

lupelta broke in miss pattie gently

yes miss pattie  said the girl questioningly

 you should not call miss bartle by her first name explained the spinster

lupelt gazed wonderingly at miss pattie

 why not  asked she

 because it is impolite replied miss pattie  miss bartle is the presidents stepdaughter and is entitled to be treated with great respect you should use her surname

 surname  was a flight above the understanding of miss patties companions and they were puzzled

mammy what is surname asked whreabo

miss pattie did her best to make the young folk comprehend the meaning of the word but it cannot be truthfully stated that either of them became much enlightened nativelike though in the interest of politeness they pretended that they were and the missionary was satisfied that her lesson had been read to attentive ears and would bear good fruit

 yes my dear she added after finishing her short lecture  thats the reason you should not use her christian name

 but she told me to call her hulda  objected lupelta

 oh exclaimed miss pattie the wind taken out of her sails  if she gave you permission then its all right but what were you about to say regarding her 

 i was on the point of saying she was charmingly dressed said lupelta

miss patties countenance assumed an expression that suggested that the good ladys opinion was scarcely in agreement with lupeltas

 well im not sure said she doubtfully  while i do not pretend to be a judge as to what a young lady of miss bartles rank should wear i suppose it will hurt no one if i express my opinion under my own roof it struck me that her dress was altogether too loud 

the young folk were again mystified and they discussed together in whispers speaking in imbunda the matter of huldas dress being loud

 whreabo said lupelta  how could huldas dress be too loud clothes cant talk  whreabos head is empty of know replied the lad

 lupelta wants to know said the girl somewhat petulantly

 whreabo has found it  responded the lad grinning dale gave lupelta a box with a big horn

 yes whispered lupelta

 the box sings talks and makes music  continued whreabo

 yes said the girl

 huldas dress is like the boxâ it talks  said the young imbunda and he gazed at lupelta triumphantly

 whreabo talks wind  returned lupelta  huldas dress has no horn

 maybe the horn is underneath the dress suggested whreabo

 whreabo talks wind  repeated lupelta

the lads feelings were slightly hurt

 whreabo was trying to know said he reproachfully  so lupelta would be glad

lupelta perceived that she had wounded whreabo and became repentant

 lupelta is very sorry too much said she contritely

whreabo forgave the girl and smiled at her

 good  said he  lupelta shall know whreabo will ask miss pattie then speaking in english as he spoke it and more loudly he went on  miss pattie you said miss bartles clothes were too loud lupelta and whreabo do not understandâ their ears are not open to that kind of talk plow can clothes make palaver 

 i used a figure of speech responded miss pattie this explanation did not help the inquirers after knowledge to the contrary it rather increased their perplexity

 wow  cried whreabo and he scratched his head the lads ejaculation evidently expressed what was in lupeltas mind for she smiled at him and nodded assentingly then addressing the missionary she said  funny english words make lupeltas ears tired miss pattie will speak imbunda and then â

 certainly not  broke in miss pattie with emphasis  captain dale is very anxious for you to learn to speak english properly and if i talk to you in imbunda youll never learn

 i am sorry murmured lupelta

 english talk isnt so good as imbunda grumbled whreabo standing up for his own

 you know nothing about it retorted miss pattie  yes lupelta when captain dale returns from mt chocolate he will be very much pleased to find that youve improved

 dale was not kind said lupelta

 not kind  exclaimed the spinster why captain dale is one of the kindest men ive ever met 

 he should not have gone away on independence day said lupelta

 my dear said miss pattie  he was compelled to go the president ordered him captain dale is a soldier and all soldiers have to obey the orders of their superiors but its growing late at what time did miss bartle say she would come to take you to the picnic 

 at four oclock replied lupelta

 its close upon that now remarked miss pattie  so you had better go to your room and get ready twould never do to keep miss bartle waiting

 ive only to put on my bonnet said lupelta and she went from the room

miss pattie took a christian herald from the table and proceeded to read it whreabo crossed to the window and looked out into the street just in time to perceive hulda reclining in a doublehammock carried by two strong natives approaching the front door of the mission house

 mammy coming  cried the lad

 good gracious and lupelta not ready  exclaimed the missionary as she dropped the paper and arose  tell her to hurry up whreabo she added then hastened from the room and the house and joined hulda in the street

 goodafternoon miss pattie exclaimed hulda greeting the spinster with a smile  is lupelta ready 

 she is putting on her bonnet miss bartle im sure you are exceedingly kind to trouble yourself so much

 not at all i promised captain dale that i would take lupelta with me to the picnic and i must not break my promise

yes a promise is a promiseâ began miss pattie evidently intending to deliver a lecture but hulda perceiving lupelta emerge from the house interrupted her

 ah she is here  cried hulda

lupelta drew near the hammock saluted hulda bashfully and apologized for having kept her waiting

 its all right my dear said hulda  jump in 

the carriers lowered the hammock lupelta essayed to climb into it but never having boarded a swinging vehicle before failed and had whreabo who was standing near not caught her she would have fallen to the ground she persevered however and after several fruitless attempts productive of many exclamations and much laughter finally succeeded

 i hope you will enjoy yourselves said miss pattie as lupelta settled herself beside hulda in the hammock

we intend to   said hulda brightly  all right boys 

 goodbye miss pattie  cried lupelta over her shoulder as the carriers started

the missionary bade the girls farewell then she and whreabo wratched the hammock until it disappeared down the incline on the wide road that ran to the  long beach they then returned to the house and shortly afterward the young imbunda with a hamper of provisions upon his head also started for the picnic ground

in the meantime hulda and lupelta borne by the carriers jogtrotting passed the cemetery an unsightly place containing uncaredfor graves rank grass ant hills and puddles of stagnant green water and crossed a rivulet they alighted here and proceeded to gather wildflowers while the carriers went on ahead with the hammock and passed out of sight

as the girls laughing and shouting were thus employed lodango and a number of his warriors darted from the bush and seized them lupelta screamed and fainted hulda fought to release herself but the savages overpowered her raised her from the ground and bearing her off followed lodango who carrying lupelta had already disappeared in the bush

when lodango and his warriors sprang from the bush whreabo was coming down the road more than a hundred yards away the lad perceived what was happening he cried out in alarm dropped the hamper and shouting loudly and angrily raced at topspeed towards the rivulet before he had run half the distance though the abductions were accomplished convinced that it would not only be useless but a waste of valuable time for him to pursue the abductors he halted and after having made up his mind how to act turned into the cemetery whence he passed running to a path that extended in the direction of mt chocolate

about a quarter of an hour later lodango carrying the still unconscious lupelta reached an open place in the forest and here halted to await the arrival of his warriors who were bringing hulda

 now he remarked as he halted lupelta will walk and unaware of her condition he lowered her from his shoulder expecting her to stand but the girl slipped from his hands to the ground

 wow  cried he as lupelta fell he gazed amazedly at her for a moment then cried  lupelta will get up 

of course she did not move

lodango gave vent to an angry exclamation then he bent over the girl and perceived that her eyes were closed he thought that she was sleeping

 lupelta will wake up  cried he shaking her gently but when she did not move he gazed at her more closely and perceiving that her face was pale as death itself he became alarmed he placed his ear over her heart but its pulsations were so weak that he failed to hear them he laid his hand over her mouth but he could not feel her breathe he concluded that she was deadâ that some witch had killed her

 wow  exclaimed he rising  witch has killed lupelta

apparently lodango was more angry than grieved

he began cudgelling his brain hoping thus to discover the guilty witch and while so employed his warriors brought hulda into his presence

when hulda saw the chief she wrenched herself free from the hands of her captors and crossed to him

 lodango began she angrily  how dare â

 hulda will hush  interrupted lodango pointing at unconscious lupelta he added i hulda must not make big talk in the presence of the dead 

when hulda saw lupelta stretched upon the ground she became filled with apprehension and for the moment forgetting her own trouble angrily exclaimed  cruel savage what have you done to her 

then crossing to the recumbent girl she noticed that lupelta was merely in a faint she murmured thankfully snatched a watergourd from one of the savages and proceeded to bathe lupeltas face

lodango seeing hulda thus employed became convinced that she was the witch who as he now believed had killed lupelta and that now not satisfied with the mischief she had already done was disfiguring the supposed remains

 hulda will stop  cried he angrily and he snatched hulda away from lupelta and thrust her to one side

with difficulty hulda saved herself from falling then she faced the enraged chief

 lodango cried she  what do you â

 hulda killed lupelta  broke in the chief

the surrounding warriors glanced at hulda and murmured angrily

 i killed her  exclaimed hulda wonderingly

 hulda was making dead lupeltas face ugly  continued lodango

what do you mean asked hulda thoroughly at sea

 hulda is a wicked witch  said the chief  hulda was vexed because lupelta wanted to go to lodangos kraal hulda killed lupelta  

his warriors again murmured angrily

hulda perceived the error that lodango was laboring under and felt like laughing in his face but an idea flashing into her mind that the situation might be utilized to benefit lupelta and herself she refrained

 hulda shall drink sassawood  continued lodango

hulda acting upon the thought that had come into her head brought a strange expression into her face and advanced toward the savages waving her hands mysteriously and moaning

lodango and his warriors were not easily frightened by things mundane but here was something that smacked of the supernatural and it alarmed them anyhow when hulda advanced in the manner described they murmured with dismay and retreated from her

hulda remarking that lupelta was regaining consciousness halted close to her and still waving her hands at the imbundas cried  hulda is a terrible witch hulda will resuscitate the dead 

the savages glared at hulda and uttered awed murmurings

lupelta sighed

 lupelta breathes  cried hulda and she pointed at the recovering girl

the savages their eyes bulging broke into cries of amazement

lupelta sighed again opened her eyes and endeavoured to rise and hulda still pointing at her exclaimed  behold lupelta once more is alive

when the imbunda lion and his warriors saw lupelta start to rise they gave a terrific yell and ran higgledypiggledy each doing his very best until they had put several yards between themselves and the two girls then they halted and jabbered excitedly among themselves while hulda assisted lupelta to her feet

 why hulda said lupelta gazing about dazedly  what has happened where are we what does â then catching sight of lodango she remembered and broke off uttering an exclamation of distress she clung to hulda a moment then crossed to the chief and knelt at his feet

 oh lodango cried she plaintively  why are you so cruel why have you stolen lupelta from monrovia 

 lodango is taking lupelta back to her home said the chief

 lupelta does not want to go back to â began the girl

 lupelta talks wind  broke in lodango turning to one of his warriors he said  moofa will take lupelta away quickly before witch kills her again

 moofa will do  cried the warrior and he seized lupelta

hulda incensed by this treatment of her companion advanced toward the savages angrily crying stop stop

 witch will not come too close  cried lodango to hulda and he raised his spear against her

hulda halted wondering what she should do she was almost sobbing

moofa raised lupelta to his shoulder and bore her from the place just as mr muffy and two imbundas entered at its other side

when hulda perceived muffy she uttered a cry of joy as well as surprise and ran toward him

lodango grunted and lowered his spear

 pidgley you here  cried hulda to the mulatto as she joined him

 as you see returned muffy

 are you a prisoner too   asked the girl

 it rather looks that way said the secretary

 how strange  exclaimed hulda  how did it happen  

 it happened because i thought more of you than of myself said the selfsacrificing mr muffy

hulda gazed amazedly at the gentleman

 because you thought more of me than of yourself said she wonderingly

 yes exactly said muffy  when lodango carried you off i was coming down the road and saw everything i was distracted with alarm of course careless of what might happen to myself i followed the savages into the bush indicating the two imbundas who were with him he added these beasts pounced upon me and here i am

hulda felt very grateful to the heroic mr muffy and gazed into his one eye in a way that made his heart flutter joyfully

 dear pidgley said she tenderly  ill never forget â but now you must speak to lodango you must persuade him to let us go we must get back to monrovia at once so that i may have troops sent to rescue poor lupelta youll not find it difficult to induce him to release us for he is afraid of me he thinks im a witch taking hold of his arm she pleaded  come pidgley and endeavoured to draw him toward the chief

mr muffy pretending to be much disquieted stood fast

 wait a moment said he  before i speak to the savage you must tell me all thats happened why does he think you are a witch 

hilda explained and when she had finished muffy seemed to be thoroughly upset

 im afraid hulda said he gravely  that youve made a very serious mistake if the imbunda really believes that you are a witch hell be unwilling to let you go

 surely the savage durst not keep me exclaimed hulda

 i imagine he has nerve enough to do almost anything said muffy

 ill frighten the life out of him  cried hulda  ill threaten to bewitch him and all his tribe if he â

 hush hulda broke in muffy  if these savages who have me in their charge were to hear you and report to lodango we would be dragged to the imbunda kraal as sure as fate you stay here while i speak to the chief

 very well agreed hulda  bring him to his senses

 if i can responded muffy and he left her

 good  cried lodango as the secretary approached him  muffy is welcome muffy must take the witch away at once

witch what witch cried muffy apparently very much puzzled

 hulda answered the chief pointing his spear at her

the warriors grunted and glared nervously across the open at hulda

 hulda a witch  cried muffy amazedly  why lodango have you got a screw loose 

 hulda killed lupelta  returned the chief  hulda brought lupelta to life again hulda has a big fetich 

muffy laughed loudly he was seemingly very much amused

 muffy will take hulda away quickly  the chief insisted scowling at the mulatto

 she fooled you said muffy sobered by the chiefs black look

 lodango saw retorted the chief stubbornly

 lupelta was merely in a faint said the secretary

 no  cried lodango vehemently  an imbunda woman would not faint unless she was hurt too much lodango did not hurt lupelta lupelta was dead 

 lupelta was dead  echoed the warriors

 absurd   cried muffy  come lodango lets start for your kraal

 hulda must not go to the imbunda kraal said the chief firmly

what about the pledge you gave me asked muffy

lodango and his warriors burst into exclamations of dismay and gazed at each other evidently in great perturbation

the pledge must not be broken you know added muffy

the chief had no choice but to keep his pledge so he reluctantly gave way

 lodango will do said he surlily  muffy will bring hulda to the imbunda kraal muffy will walk with hulda behind lodangoâ a long way behind

the warriors groaned lugubriously

 a long way behind  repeated the chief and he followed by his warriors who grunted and shook their heads doubtfully hastened from the place

muffy walked slowly toward hulda endeavouring to invent some sort of a tale plausible enough to deceive her but before he could build up a figment that suited him hulda too impatient to await his coming ran forward and met him however as the event proved he was excellent at improvisation

 well pidgley said hulda eagerly as she raced up to him  has lodango consented 

mr muffy apparently very much dejected gazed at hulda pityingly

 no said he sadly

huldas face became pale

 he refused  asked she anxiously

 absolutely

 the wretch  cried the girl angrily  but why  

 you acted the part of witch altogether too well replied muffy  he said your services were required in his kraal

 why didnt you undeceive him 

 i tried to but he wouldnt have it

 did you tell him that my stepfather would make him pay dearly for his folly 

 yes but it didnt seem to disturb him a little bit

you might have bribed him

 i tried to but i might as well have been offering parched locust to a white man the savage was not to be moved by threats nor promises

 well said hulda vehemently  i for one wont go to his horrid kraal 

 you will be compelled said muffy and he pointed at the two imbundas who were standing near

 pidgley there are only two of them and we are two said hulda suggestively

this suggestion evidently did not agree with mr muffys temperament for he shivered and his yellow face grew more yellow

 they are big and strong and i am no giant you know said he somewhat weakly

hulda glanced pityinglyâ contemptuouslyâ at muffy

 no you are not agreed she then unaware that muffy had motioned to the warriors and that they were approaching her she went on  one of us could escape im sure if you were to run in one direction while i â

 hulda will come   growled the voice of one of the savages and he laid his hand heavily upon the girls shoulder then when she drew back he and his companion raised her bodily and carried her from the open

and muffy laughing inwardly followed

about thirty hours later lodango and his warriors led their prisoners and mr muffy into the imbunda kraal lupelta was delivered into the care of reesha who was much rejoiced at the girls return and hulda was placed in the guesthut with a young girl named saafa as her attendant

lupelta and hulda arrived thoroughly exhausted hence despite their sad situation they soon slumbered muffy also was fatigued but too elated and excited to sleep he passed the remainder of the night at the palaverground watching the townsfolk rejoicing with singing and dancing over the successful issue of their chiefs expedition and his safe return to the kraal

on the following morning reesha and lupelta were in the formers hut the old woman was squatting before a native loom and weaving countrycloth and every now and then she would glance at lupelta sleeping upon a pile of skins spread upon the floor

after a while lupelta awoke at first she thought herself dreaming the next moment though the truth dawned upon her then she sighed so sadly that reesha became concerned stopped her labor and crossed to the young girls side

 lupelta said reesha as she drew near  whats the matter  squatting herself upon the skins beside the girl she went on  lupelta sighed big is lupelta sorry 

lupelta really loved reesha was fond of her playmates and of the simple life from which the slavers had torn her yet she was longing to return to monrovia she wreathed her arms around the old womans neck and wept softly against her bosom

reesha caressed the weeping girl tenderly

why does lupelta shed tears asked she anxiously

 oh mother murmured the girl  i am afraid 

 afraid my child 

 yes mother

 is lupelta afraid of the cruel men who stole her from reesha 

 i am not afraid of them mother they are imprisoned in monrovia

 is lupelta afraid of â of â ah yes his name is dale is lupelta afraid of dale 

 yes mother replied lupelta mendaciously blushing at her fault

 lupelta need not be afraid said reesha reassuringly  if dale comes to the imbunda kraal after lupelta lodango will take his head lodango will devour dale 

lupelta was certain that dale would attempt to rescue her and reeshas words set her all ashiver with dread she must stop his coming but how in the briefest time possible any number of plans entered her head only to be dismissed as being infeasible however she continued the thinking process and at last got hold of a project which seemed workableâ and upon this plan she fixed pleased by her success she exclaimed joyfully

reesha supposing from the girls exclamation that her direful remark had reassured lupelta smiled

 yes lupelta said she  if dale comes to the imbunda kraal lodango will make him sorry too much 

lupelto took the old womans bands in her own and held them

 mother said she gazing pleadingly into the others eyes  do you love me 

 yes reesha loves lupelta was the tenderly voiced answer  reesha loves lupelta more than she loves her own life

 if i were unhappy would you grieve 

 reesha would grieve too much  said the old woman  but why does lupelta ask 

 if dale were harmed my heart would break replied the girl

 why would lupelta be sorry  

 he has been very kind to me said lupelta reluctant to speak of her love

 good is dale cunning 

 he is wise indeed  cried the girl

 if dale is cunning he will not come to the imbunda kraal

 he is also brave said lupelta

she was still wearing the garments of civilization rings were on her fingers a necklace encircled her neck directing reeshas attention to the ornaments she went on  these jewels belong to dale he will come to recover them i would prevent him from coming

 lodango will prevent dale said reesha shortly  mother lodango would not be able to stand before dale dale has too many fighting men

 then lodango would run away responded reesha  he would take lupelta with himâ the jewels too  no mother said lupelta  lodango would not run away he would fight dale one or the other of them would die

reesha had shot her last bolt and she confessed as much

 reesha has no more cunning said she  lupelta must ask fetich to help her

lupelta smiled scornfully

as well ask help from the winds  cried she

reesha started with alarm and glanced nervously toward the open door and lupelta not perceiving the old womans agitation continued throwing mud as it were at the faith of the imbundas

 yes mother she said  i now know that fetich is but a myth i know there is a god i worship â  lupelta will hush whispered reesha her face livid  lupelta and reesha will be given to the tormentwomen

 no one heard said lupelta lowering her voice reesha perspiring with fear arose and closed the door then returning to lupelta said  lupelta must be more cunning

 i was careless admitted lupelta contritely

 lupelta said reesha after a brief pause  when reesha was young she lived with a white man and his wife in their peoples kraal near the big water they told reesha about their god but acted contrary to the way they preached they were cruel to reesha too much reesha could not believe in their god reeshas face smiled but her heart hated reesha made the white man and his wife sorry too much 

 why what did you do to them mother  asked lupelta interested

yes made them sorry  repeated reesha reflectively

had the pictures from reeshas past which were floating before the eyes of the mind of the old woman been visible to lupelta the girl would have been astounded as it was though she merely thought of dale and of how to prevent him from risking his life

 very well mother said she  you must tell me at some other time we now have to carry out a plan that ive thought of to keep dale from coming i must send him the jewels and a message

reesha had some idea of the value of the gewgaws and was amazed that lupelta was willing to part with them

 will lupelta give them to dale  asked she

 yes returned the girl though it hurt her to say so  i will give them to dale lodango must send them to him at once

 lodango will not send an imbunda to monrovia said reesha  lodango has stolen hulda from monrovia and the president must be much vexed

 he could send muffy suggested lupelta

 perhaps muffy would refuse to go said reesha

 lodango could compel muffy

 lodango could but would he  said reesha doubtfully

lupelta saw that unless lodango could be persuaded her plan must fail she was nonplused after a moment though she thought of a way whereby provided she had the strength to pursue it the chief could be bribed the method was repugnant to her but the thought that if she held back dale might lose his life was infinitely more repugnant she decided to act upon the idea

 mother said she  if lodango does this thing for me i will marry him at once

reesha smiled all over her face

 lupelta will  exclaimed she eagerly

the girl abhorred the great sacrifice she was committing herself to make but holding her tottering courage up requested reesha to summon the chief

 tell him she concluded  that lupelta will consent to become his wife only that mother

 good  cried reesha and she hastened from the hut to seek lodango

alas alas murmured lupelta then she wept

after a few moments she dried her eyes arose from the skins and prepared herself to receive lodango who with reesha soon entered

lodango smiling happily halted near the door and gazed hungrily at lupelta who stood with her hands clasped her head bowed and her heart beating wildly

 lodango is glad  cried the chief

 lupelta welcomes lodango  returned the girl

good ejaculated the prince and he advanced his arms open to embrace her

 lodango must not  cried lupelta avoiding him

lodango halted lowered his arms and glanced darkly at reesha

 reesha has lied to lodango  cried he fiercely  reesha shall be sorry too

no no cried the old woman alarmed  reesha has not lied to lodango lupelta will do 

 lodangos ears are open  exclaimed the chief frowning at lupelta

 reesha has not lied to lodango said the girl somewhat weakly

the chief smiled

 the vex has gone from lodango said he

 does lodango desire me to talk the truth  asked lupelta

lodango thought a moment then he said  tis better to be made a little while sorry by truth than to be made a little while glad by bad lies

lodango is cunning joined in reesha flattering the chief

 lodango is cunning too much  agreed the prince  lupelta lodangos ears are open 

 lodango i do not love you said the girl tersely truth is making lodango sorry too much said the chief ruefully

 only for a little while cried reesha encouragingly

lodango grunted

 i have left my heart in monrovia went on lupelta

lodango was not a sentimentalist

lupeltas heart may be in monrovia said he grinning  but her body is in the imbunda kraal

i â i â love dale confessed the girl

 good  cried the chief not at all upset  dale will keep lupeltas heart lodango will keep lupeltas body if dale comes to the imbunda kraal after lupeltas body lodango will make dale sorry wow

 lodango will take dales head  cried reesha

 lodango will devour dale  cried the chief  dale is a coward 

the chiefs disparagement of the captains courage so incensed lupelta that she became indiscreet

 dale is not a coward  cried she angrily  he is a brave warrior he is â

 lupelta talks like wind  broke in the chief  lodango will send for dale to come to the imbunda kraal lodango will fight dale lupelta will see who is the braverâ lodango or dale wow

 dale shall not come  cried lupelta heatedly  if he does lodango i will not marry you 

the chief scowled

 if lodango commands said he  what can lupelta do but obey  

 i can die  cried the girl proudly

lodango chuckled

 lupelta died once and hulda brought lupelta to life said he  if lupelta dies again hulda will bring lupelta to life again

lupelta quite as much in the dark regarding swooning as was lodango hushed confounded but reesha better informed became alarmed

 lupelta must not die  cried the old woman  lodango she continued appealing to the chief  it is but a simple thing that lupelta asks and â

 reesha will hush  interrupted the prince sternly  lupelta knows how to talk

 lodango lupelta is young said reesha  lupelta has not lived long enough yet to have learned cunning

 lupelta is young agreed the chief and smiling at the girl and moderating his tone into gentleness he went on  lupelta need not be afraid lupelta will tell lodango all that is in her mouth lodangos ears are open big for lupeltas talk 

lupelta sighed sadly drew the rings from her fingers and removed the necklace from her neck she gazed wistfully at the ornaments for a moment or two then swallowing a sob pushed them hastily into lodangos hand

the chief took the jewels eagerly and examined them admiringly

 lodango will send them to dale said lupelta

the chief his attention still fixed upon the gems shook his head in negation

 lodango must not send an imbunda to monrovia said he

 lodango could send muffy suggested reesha

the chief having fallen in love with the trinkets made a bid for them

 they please lodango said he  lodango will keep them lodango will send dale oil and ivory

he looked at lupelta appealingly as though begging her to consent and it entered her mind that probably she could bribe him with them to release her

 yes lodango they are beautiful  cried she

 beautiful too much  agreed the chief  lodango is hungry for them 

 if they belonged to lodango went on the girl  he would be the best decorated chief in all the world 

wow cried the chief much moved

 if they are sent to monrovia lodango will never see them again continued the girl

 lupeltas words hit lodango hard said the chief dismally

 dales god help me  thought lupelta and turning pale she shot her arrow

 lodango said she appealingly  send me to monrovia and keep the jewels

the chiefs countenance grew stern and he dropped the jewels to the floor

 lodango prefers lupelta to gems and jewels said he

 o lodango cried lupelta unwilling to surrender all hope  be merciful do not be â

lupelta will hush interrupted the chief is the imbunda chief so poor that he must barter away the woman he would make his wife no when the banana fruit ripens lupelta will be glad she is in the imbunda kraal muffy will take the jewels to dale lodango has spoken 

lodangos dictum was not to be opposed so lupelta though most unwillingly submitted

 you will send muffy at once  said she sadly

 muffy is in the guesthut with hulda said the chief  lupelta will tell muffy the message and give him the jewels come

he strode from the hut

 lupelta will go quickly cried reesha

 bring the jewels mother said lupelta

and she followed lodango

saafas costume consisted of a beaded belt a small horn and a thin layer of chalk she was squatting upon her haunches and gazing thoughtfully at hulda

 huldas face is beautiful said the young native

hulda having slept well and breakfasted heartily for the moment was feeling quite comfortable her vanity was pleasantly stirred by saafas naive remark and she smiled cheerfully

 do you think so  said she

 saafa thinks so replied the native after a brief pause she said  is hulda ugly underneath 

hulda laughed

 what a funny question  cried she  of course i am not

 if huldas arms and legs are proper said saafa gravely  they should not be covered up touching her horn she added  no one can see whether or not hulda still wears the horn

hulda blushed and diverted the conversation into a fresh channel

 how old are you saafa asked she

 saafa has not counted the days but she has lived many was the reply

though saafa was fully developed she certainly was not more than thirteen or fourteen years of age

hulda perceived this and was amused by the girls claim to many days

 you are quite a methuselah said hulda

saafa frowned

 is hulda calling saafa bad names  she asked

 bad names  why no 

 what is methuselah 

 it means a very old personâ one who has lived many years explained hulda

 huldas words are misfits said saafa  saafa is not old saafa has lived many days not many years

hulda laughingly admitted her error

 is hulda a witch  said saafa suddenly after a pause

 good gracious saafa  cried hulda impatiently  have you too got that silly idea into your head do i look like a witch 

saafa studied huldas face critically

 huldas eyes are kind said she  and her lips smile tenderly if hulda is a witch she is not a wicked one

 im not a witch of any kind  exclaimed hulda

 if not then why did lodango say hulda must not come to the imbunda kraal 

hulda gazed amazedly at saafa

saafa cried she  what are you talking about lodango compelled me to come

 saafas father said lodango was afraid of hulda answered the girl  lodango did not want hulda to come

hulda was incredulous

 your father must have been mistaken said she

 saafas father does not talk lies saafas father heard lodango tell muffy to take hulda back to monrovia

 what does this mean   thought hulda

 are you sure  said she to the girl

yes saafas father heard repeated the young native emphatically

hulda suspecting that she was on the eve of making a strange discovery became pale

 and what else did your father hear  asked she

 saafas father heard lodango and muffy talk too much

 you must tell meâ tell me quickly  cried hulda somewhat agitated

 saafas father heard lodango tell muffy that hulda was a witch â

she paused and struck at a mosquito that was buzzing near her head

 yesâ yes  cried hulda impatiently

saafa killed the insect

 weeneeweenee wont make sing any more  cried she triumphantly

 never mind the mosquito tell me what else your father heard

 saafas father heard muffy tell lodango that hulda was not a witch muffy forced lodango to bring hulda to the imbunda kraal

hulda was beginning to see the part muffy had played in her abduction and she felt like murdering him

 did your father hear muffy say why he had lodango bring me here  asked she

 muffy wants to make hulda his wife

abominable  cried hulda aflame with anger

saafa shrunk back and gazed somewhat alarmedly at hulda

wow cried she hulda is vexed too much is hulda vexed with saafa 

 not with you saafa returned hulda  you have done me an important service and deserve to be rewarded what shall i give you  

saafa glanced at huldas fingerrings and earrings but none of them exactly pleased her fancy she fixed her choice upon a bright glass button that was attached to huldas blouse

 saafa wants that said she pointing at the button

 you must bring me a knife so i can cut it off said hulda

âsaafa will bring hulda a knife is hulda vexed with muffy 

 yes very angry 

 good if hulda is vexed with muffy saafa is vexed with muffy  she placed her mouth close to huldas ear and whispered  saafa will put witch in muffys food muffy will die quickly muffy wont vex hulda any more saafa will do muffy will go into a hole and â

hulda was far from being one of the angelic kind of her sex still saafas borgialike suggestion staggered her so pushing the innocentminded wouldbe poisoner back she interrupted her hurrying plans for muffys annihilation

hush hush cried she you shouldnt be so wicked 

saafa was amazed

 saafa is not wicked said she  saafa is good hulda is saafas friend saafa wants to help hulda

 twould be murder saafa and to do murder is very very wicked said hulda

 hulda saw saafa just now kill weeneeweenee 

 yes

 weeneeweenee wanted to bite saafa so saafa killed aveeneeweenee wow

perhaps hulda in her heart did not altogether disagree with saafas mosaical tenet but she kept her opinon whatever it was to herself

 you must not give any medicine to muffy said she firmly

 if i do not will hulda make him trouble too much

 i will indeed  said hulda with emphasis

good ejaculated saafa and then evidently impatient to see hulda at work on muffy she added  when will hulda make muffy trouble 

 at once said hulda  go saafa and tell him to come to me go quickly 

 saafa will do cried the girl much pleased and she hastened from the hut

mr muffy entered a few minutes later he bade hulda goodmorning and uninvited placed himself down upon the skins beside her

 i trust you slept well  he added with an air of great concern

hulda though she wds full of wrath smiled at muffy very pleasantly

 i was very tired so slept like a top said she with a disdainful glance around the room she went on  i wonder that i did though for as you must admit pidgley this place is not exactly what im used to

i should say not responded mr muffy his air was sympathetic  the imbundas seem to have very primitive ideas as to furniture and things but patience hulda there shall be an improvement 

 what an untruthful wretch he is  thought hulda

 yes continued the secretary  ill see that you are made comfortable i noticed some things in lodangos compound which youll find useful ill have them brought here

while muffy was speaking saafa entered carrying a long fouredged native dagger she now crossed to the skins and placed the weapon upon them beside hulda at the same time saying  saafa has brought hulda a knife

muffy gazed amazedly at the dagger at saafa and at huldaâ each in turn

hulda smiled at saafa and thanked her

 what are you going to do with that murderouslooking thing  asked muffy

 possibly ill kill a rat with it said hulda

wow cried saafa much interested

muffv scowled at saafa and ordered her to leave the hut

 saafa will stay said the girl contumaciously

 yes saafa you will remain please said hulda

 good  cried the young imbunda and she made a face at muffy crossed to a corner of the room and squatted herself

hulda took up the dagger and felt its point with her finger

 pidgley cried she  it is as keen as a needle  then placing the point of the weapon against his breast she cried  couldnt i  and pushed it through his shirtfront until it actually punctured his precious skin

evidently mr muffy did not like the feel of the cold steel for he turned pale and started back

 great scott are you mad  cried he as he flinched  it was almost in me put down the beastly thing

hulda laughed and dropped the dagger and saafa who had been hoping for quite a different and more tragic denouement grunted with disgust

returning to our subject pidgley said hulda  do you think that lodango will let me have the things  

 if i make the request yes responded the secretary

 you seem to have considerable influence over the savage 

 he has taken quite a liking to me

 if that be so said hulda  why dont you persuade him to release us 

 he is willing to let me go but not you he still insists that you are a witch

 hulda is not a â broke out saafa

 hush saafa interrupted hulda quickly afraid that the girl would say too much

 send her away  cried muffy again scowling at saafa

 the savage is absurd  cried hulda  my stepfather shall make him pay dearly for his folly

 after the event said muffy gloomily

 surely if i pay him his price he will release me dont you think so 

 ive already offered him everything thinkable but uselessly

 ive never before heard of a savage who couldnt be bought over said hulda

 lodango seems to be one out of the ordinary returned muffy

 is there nothing we can do  asked hulda hopelessly

 theres one thing but of course its not to be thought of said muffy and he looked at hulda out of the corners of his eyes

hulda suspected that she knew what the  one thing  was and she felt like strangling mr muffy instead of doing that though she innocently said  what is that pidgley 

 if you were to get married said the secretary  the charge of witchcraft against you would fall to the ground lodango would release you at once

hulda smiled sweetly at muffy but behind her smile was the fiercest kind of anger

 if mr right were to offer himself said she  i might not object

muffy though apparently calm was much perturbed he moistened his lips with his tongue and after hesitating a moment endeavoured to net his fish

 we â well hulda stammered he  to get yourself out of the mess you might â might marry me

 you  cried hulda encouraging him with a charming smile

mr muffy was deceived by huldas manner and he became more bold

 you might do much worse you know said he confidently inflating his chest

 am i to understand pidgley said hulda sweetly  that you are offering me your heart and hand 

 exactly replied muffy flushing

 repeat it when we are again in monrovia said hulda softly with an air such as young ladies usually assume under like circumstances

 and if i doâ what then  

 perhaps my answer wont break your heart returned hulda her voice a soft whisper

 do you mean it  cried muffy eagerly

 why shouldnt i  said hulda evasively

for a moment mr muffy was elated beyond description  then doubts visited him and his face clouded

 but what about dale  he suspiciously asked

well what about him returned hulda lightly

 and the lovepotion  continued muffy

 pidgley what a silly chap you are  cried hulda petulantly

silly

 yes silly did i ever tell you it was for captain dale 

 but you did tell lobue

hulda flushed

 how do you know i did  asked she

 i overheard you

mr muffy now disclosed how he had listened to the conversation between hulda and lobue in the latters hut and while he confessed hulda though she was boiling inwardly with rage smiled and smiled

 is it likely said she  that i was going to bare my real feelings to the old witch of course not 

 then for whom did you intend the stuff  asked muffy his doubts almost removed  tell me hulda 

 i will tell you nothing more until we are in monrovia said hulda  but pidgley dear in the meantime you may wear your thinkingcap

mr muffy was convinced that he was the elect and his eye sparkled joyfully

 hulda do you love me  asked he

 do you have to ask  responded the girl softly

 oh what a fool ive been  cried muffy

hulda displayed an amazement that she did not feel

 a fool  cried she

yes a scheming plotting idiot said muffy rising  and all unnecessarily

 why what have you done something terrible 

 since you love me its nothing said muffy

you must tell me persisted hulda and perceiving that the crisis was at hand she arose to meet it

 ill tell you when we are homeward bound promised muffy

 when will that be 

astute mr muffy thoroughly befooled exposed himself utterly

 as soon as i have spoken to lodango said he  ill go to him at once but first darling you must bribe me

saying this he advanced to embrace hulda and the girls anger broke forth  keep off  cried she avoiding him

mr muffy was flabbergasted he glared wonderingly at hulda and his yellow face grew sallow

 wh â wh â why what the devil do you mean cried the mulatto recovering his speech

 i mean pidgley muffy returned hulda heatedly  that youre about the lowest most contemptible thing ive ever seen 

mr muffy perceived that he had been overreached and the very worst in his nature was aroused

 so said he sneeringly  youve been pulling the wool over my eyes 

 i have fooled you into telling me the truth said hulda

  well i hope you like it said muffy with an ugly look in his face  you are in my power and will have to dance to any tune i may choose to play to convince you of the fact wont be difficult

 coward  cried the girl defiantly

yes you are mine cried muffy and he sprang toward her

hulda snatched the dagger from the skins and stopped muffy with its point

 stand off or ill kill you  cried the angry girl threatening him with the weapon

muffy stood a second or so and gazed blackly at hulda then he sprang forward suddenly and struck her wrist

hulda uttered a cry as the dagger dropped from her hand to the skins and stood upon its haft point up

 you vixen  cried muffy and seizing her he tried to reach her lips with his

 scoundrel  cried hulda and she threw him off

mr muffy staggered back caught his foot in the skin and fell down upon the upstanding dagger

the sharp instrument penetrated the secretarys chestâ right up to its iron hilt

 my god  cried hulda filled with consternation

 wow  yelled saafa filled with joy

hulda was terribly shocked trembling and wringing her hands she screamed loudly and just then lodango and lupelta entered the hut

when the chief and lupelta saw what had occurred they were too much amazed to either move or speak

unfortunately mr muffy raised himself to his elbow

 lodango gasped he  the witch has killed me 

then muffy lost consciousness

wow cried lodango and he dragged lupelta hurriedly from the hut

at noon on independence day captain dale with his second in command lieutenant brown and a body of the constabulary force marched from monrovia for mt chocolate in pursuance of an order that the president had issued earlier in the morning they worked their way through the mangrove and swamp which rather widely margined the city until about two oclock when they entered a parklike district

the sun was then high in the heavens and the heat intense and dale aware that it would be very unwise to march his men for any length of time exposed to the rays of the fierce luminary placed them in a shady placeâ protected by trees and where there was running water and allowed them to rest

toward sundown lieutenant brown who with dale was reclining upon the turf ordered a sergeant to parade the men preparatory to resuming the march he then turned again to the captain and continuing the conversation which he had interrupted to speak to the noncommissioned officer remarked  and you think that its possible for the country to be made prosperous  

 undoubtedly replied dale with conviction

 theyve had lots of assistance and abused it said brown

  abused  is hardly the correct word because of their ignorance they have failed to use opportunity wisely one should not expect children to perform duties such as experienced persons would have found it exceedingly difficult to accomplish liberias present misfortunes are the outcome of the false training of a ruling class lacking in mental and moral virility the infusion of new life into the country would set things right

 you mean that a people fresh from a condition of enforced servitude uneducated inexperienced and without pecuniary capital were not likely to succeed in building up a successful republic  

 exactly said dale

 and whats the remedy 

as i just now said infusion of new life if a few hundreds of our people skilled in farming and other industries would come over the country would be bucked up

 well returned brown doubtfully  i imagine it would take some doing i think â

he paused and gazing toward the distant mangroves listened intently

 what is it  asked dale

 i thought i heard some one shout

 twas one of the men suggested the captain

 no the voice came from the man â

he again heard the voice and this time very plainly dale heard it too

 dale  dale  it shouted

by jove cried the captain hes calling me

they sprang to their feet and the next moment saw whreabo dart out from the mangroves and run toward them

 its whreabo  exclaimed the captain as the lad appeared

 i wonder whats up  said brown

 i hope nothings happened to lupelta said dale anxiously and he advanced to meet the imbunda

the lieutenant followed dale

 whreabo cried dale as he drew near to the lad  whats the matter has anything gone wrong 

whreabo panting and all wet with perspiration halted in front of dale the lad was too breathless to reply but dale filled with anxiety failed to observe his condition and shouted at him

 out with it cried the captain impatiently

 he is winded said the lieutenant

 true said dale and he waited the next moment though whreabo recovered his breath and spoke

 dale cried the lad  lodango has stolen lupelta  

the captains brown face grew pale

 my god exclaimed he

 by george  cried brown

 whreabo is it true  asked dale agitatedly

 dale it is true responded the lad  whreabo would not lie to dale lupelta and hulda were going to the long beach lodango came from the bush near the graveyard and carried both of them away

 miss bartle too i  cried brown in amazement

curse him cried dale

 ditto  exclaimed brown

 ill make the savage wish he had never been born  added the captain

good ejaculated whreabo dale must do quickly 

dale was willing enough to act and that at once but his duty as a soldier stood in the way

but how can i  cried he in distress i must not desert my command

whreabo shook his head with displeasure

 dale is chewing wind  cried he

 perhaps i am said dale doubtfully  brown what do you think 

 under the circumstances replied the lieutenant  i am firmly of the opinion that you should return to monrovia at once i can fill the bill at mt chocolate all right undoubtedly the president will be glad to have you back he will want to send you in pursuit of the savage

 i dont know said dale doubtfully

 im dead sure of it  said brown with emphasis

 if dale doesnt go lupelta will be sorry too much  said whreabo

and miss bartle will have a rough time of it joined in the lieutenant

dale was persuaded

 very well ill return said he

 good  again cried whreabo evidently delighted

dale turned the command of the expedition over to the lieutenant then he and whreabo started for monrovia they reached the city late in the evening and hurried to the executive mansion wherein the presidential reception was in full swing dale entered the building and whreabo went to the mission house and thence after telling miss pattie all that had happened to the captains quarters

dale passed the band which was stationed upon the verandah making discordant sounds and approached the parlor he stood in the doorway and gazed in at the elite of monrovia he searched the animated scene for the president and soon discovered that gentleman chatting and laughing with a certain lady who so rumor said was not unwilling to step into the conjugal vacuum caused by the death of huldas mother

when the captain perceived the chief magistrate thus employed evidently without a single care on his mind he correctly concluded that his excellency was uninformed as yet of what had happened to his stepdaughter

 i guess thought dale as he pushed his way through the crowd  when i enlighten him he wont feel quite so jolly

he halted before the president saluted him and was about to speak but  the peoples choice scowling blackly forestalled him

you here captain dale cried the head of the state as if much surprised

 yes mr president began the captain  i have to â

well interrupted the great man you were ordered to proceed to mt chocolate

yes sir butâ

 but me no buts captain dale cried the president irascibly  why have you not gone 

 i started answered dale  but â

the president had not the slightest reasonâ unless his guilty conscience provided oneâ for supposing that dale had become aware of his duplicity nevertheless he feared that the captain had learned of it and was about to charge him with it

 if he blurts it out here before everybody said he to himself  therell be no end of a row i must gag him and in a sense gag dale he did

 captain dale cried he interrupting the american  what have you done with your command 

 lieutenant brown is leading the men to mt chocolate said dale somewhat snappishly he was beginning to lose his patience

 control your temper please  said the president sternly  sir you are a deserter 

dale keenly felt the presidents charge but it was true and he had no defense

 im sorry sir said he  but i returned because â

 silence  broke in the potentate  i dont want to hear your becauses as i stated you are a deserter

dale now rather angry became indiscreet

 confound it this is in â he began but hearing the surrounding listeners murmuring indignantly he perceived his error and hushed

well cried mrs colonel sisserretta johnsonsubbs who was standing near his excellency  the idea of his daring to speak that way to our president  mrs bupp who was prominently present wearing a costume which miss pattie had she seen it doubtless would have considered  loud  indeed whispered into the ear of her escort the honorable eden swiller secretary of state  mr swiller these americans treat us as though we were mud  glancing disdainfully at dale she added  hes a miserly lot he is  

 yes yes mrs bupp agreed mr swiller  if our negotiations â oh with what an air did he utter the phrase â with germany are successful maybe we wont send all of themâ lock stock and barrel back to yankee land

a good job too said mrs bupp and she snorted

and while the rumshop keeper and the cabinet minister were exchanging confidences his excellency somewhat heated by the several  nips  he had taken during the evening denounced the unpopular american

 captain dale you are impertinent  shouted he angrily  sir i am the president of liberia youve been drinking you will consider yourself under arrest  proceed to your quarters at once and remain there until further orders go sir 

 but your â began dale protestingly

 silence  screamed the autocrat  go to your quarters 

 you idiot id like to punch your head  thought dale but wisely kept this mutinous desire to himself

he saluted the president and feeling somewhat small went from the parlor leaving his excellency very much relieved and the guests talking to each other about his  american effrontery

dale proceeded in very low spirits to his quarters on arriving there he found that whreabo had thoughtfully prepared something for him to eat but almost ill with worry he refused to go to the table

 dale must chop said whreabo

 im not at all hungry said the captain despondently

 if dale doesnt eat he will become too weak to chase after lodango

 oh dont bother me  cried dale impatiently

is dale sick anxiety marked the question

 yes sick at heart the president has turned me down

whreabo was puzzled

 dale said he  whreabos ears do not hear speak words that whreabos head knows

 he refused to listen to me and placed me under arrest

 shall whreabo take the presidents head  asked the lad solemnly

dale gazed thoughtfully at whreabo

 by george  cried he  i do believe you would go for the old man

 whreabo would go for the old man  repeated the lad with conviction

the stern solemnity with which the lad announced his readiness to do for the president so amused dale that despite his misery he smiled

 whreabo would do anything for dale  added the lad firmly

dale was touched

 my lad said he kindly  i believe you but i dont think you need murder the gentleman tomorrow after he has recovered from the strain of todays highjinks business probably hell be ready to act sensibly now you must run away you worry me

 whreabo will not run away said the young imbunda stubbornly  dale will eat then start to chase lodango

dale groaned impatiently

 whats the use of talking said he  the president will not listen to me tonight so i can do nothing until tomorrow

 dale will do tonight  persisted the lad

 singlehanded  

 if the president will not give dale fighting men then we must go to mwamba mwamba will help dale

who is mwamba  asked dale somewhat interested

 mwamba is whreabos brother

 where is he to be found 

 mwamba is in the soolah kraal

 is he a brave warrior 

 mwamba is a favorite of the imbunda fetich  exclaimed whreabo proudly

 he may be a favorite of fetich said dale  and yet quite unable to assist me the question is has he many warriors is he brave himself 

 mwamba is an imbunda  cried the lad emphatically

 which means i suppose that being an imbunda he is necessarily brave is that it 

 that is it agreed whreabo  in many battles has mwamba fought seven lions leopards has mwamba slain mwamba has many warriors lodango has thrown pepper into mwambas eyes mwamba is vexed with lodango too much the imbunda law says  injure those who injure you mwamba wants to obey the law wow 

 now youre talking business   cried dale his hopes rising the next moment though he again became doubtful and went on  but if mwamba is a powerful chief why is he residing in the soolah kraal 

 mwamba is doing service for pootie the soolah chiefs daughter when mwamba has earned pootie he will go to his own kraal whreabo and dale will go to the soolah kraal mwamba will do whreabo has spoken  

 are you certain of your brother  asked dale

 whreabo has spoken  repeated the lad with an air of finality

 very well said dale  well go

 good  cried whreabo joyfully

 yes whreabo said dale now eager  i will speak to the american minister then well start at once

 dale will eat first said the lad

 as i said remarked dale impatiently  i am not hungry

 dale will eat repeated whreabo firmly

dale perceived that whreabo would not let him off so he gave way

 all right said he resignedly

and seating himself at the table he began to eat and after the first few mouthfuls ate with a will

it was well on in the afternoon when about fortyeight hours later dale and whreabo halted near a shallow stream that flowed winding and twisting through the forest in which they were travelling

 dale said whreabo pointing at the stream  the soolahs take water from this river

 then we are close to their kraal  said dale

 from here tis but an infants march

 im glad its not a giants remarked the captain thankfully  im a bit done up

 dale will soon rest we will go 

 right you are cried dale and he followed whreabo who had started ahead

they soon emerged from the forest into an expansive plateau and came to a broad path that ran through cultivated fields of corn and rice and groves of banana breadfruit and palms they advanced along this path and in a little while reached a large clearing in the center of which was an importantlooking barricaded kraal at the edge of this they halted

 the soolah kraal announced whreabo

 its a much larger place than i thought was the comment of dale as he gazed upon the town

 obomo is a big chief said whreabo

 apparently

 dale the soolahs will soon see us and come whreabo will talk to them dale must not speak does dale understand 

 all right if necessary ill be deaf dumb and blind

 good we will go  

they moved across the clearing toward the kraal at every step expecting to see a number of its people come through the gateway to meet them but to their great surprise no one appeared and they reached the gates of the barricade without being challenged finding the entrance open and unguarded they went into the kraal

it wras near the hour when natives usually ate their evening meals women should have been beating rice and pounding cassava near fires burning before the open doors of their huts but no women were present no fires were burning the mortars were empty the pestles were lying unemployed upon the ground and other features of native domestic life which the captain and whreabo had confidently expected to see were absent

there were no young maids plaiting each others hair no lads were chalking themselves decoratively for the dance around the fire at night no little black babies were lying on mats and basking in the hot rays of the sun no anxious mothers were stuffing riceporridge hot with red pepper down the throats of their ailing little ones there was not a single person in sight a deep silence rested over the place

dale and whreabo were amazed

wow cried the lad gazing about wonderingly

what does it mean said dale the huts are empty the streets deserted have the soolahs gone away  

the young imbunda shook his head dissentingly

 dale said he ââ the soolahs are not grasshoppers

then whats become of them 

perhaps they have been devoured by some of their enemies suggested the lad

if thats the case ive tramped here for nothing returned dale in disgust

dale has tramped here for nothing agreed whreabo ruefully dale must not be vexed for weâ 

he heard the sound of many voices coming from the center of the kraal and broke off he listened intently after a moment or two he grinned and said does dale hear them 

yes

the soolahs are alive too much 

judging from the noise they are making i should say so returned the relieved captain but where are they 

they are in the palaverground perhaps they are making a big play

well find out said dale and he started to hurry off

dale will not go  cried whreabo quickly

and why not  asked the captain as he paused

the soolahs may be making secret palaver answered the lad indicating a hut near which they were standing he went on dale will rest in that hut until whreabo finds out what the soolahs are doing

but why should i not go too  asked the captain somewhat impatiently

if dale were to hear the soolahs making secret palaver obomo would be vexed too much explained whreabo  obomo would make dale sorry 

dale was skeptical

 absurd  cried he  the savage would not dare 

 dale will not go  persisted whreabo

 im not afraid

whreabo has spoken cried the lad with finality

dale perceiving that it would be useless to contend further gave way

 ill stay said he shortly  but you must not keep me waiting a long time for im tired and beastly hungry

 good  cried whreabo and he hastened away

dale entered the hut it contained a rudelymade couch an iron pot a wooden stool that was usable either as a seat or as a pillow for the head a delft basin and nothing else it entered his mind to throw himself upon the couch and rest but before he could come to a decision whireabo his eyes sparkling and his face working with excitement rejoined him

 dale will come quickly  cried the lad excitedly as he rushed into the hut  mwamba is gambling mwamba is champion for obomo dale will come quickly 

the captain did not see any reason why he should race to the palaverground merely to witness mwamba gamble and aside from that the couch was now appealing to his tired frame almost irresistibly

 i have no desire to watch your brother gamble said he  ill remain here when mwambas finished you may bring him to me

whreabo grinned

 if dale waits here until mwamba comes said he  maybe dale will wait a long time

 a long time  cried dale  what do you mean 

 mwamba may not come quickly

 does your brother spend all of his time gambling 

 sometimes mwamba eats sometimes he sleeps returned the lad

dale smiled

 probably he does said he

 dales head is empty of know continued whreabo  mwamba may finish gambling in a few minutes or in a few hours or not until many days have passed mwambas opponent is tongha the bakota tongha is champion for waupau the bakota chief mwamba and tongha must gambleâ pausing only to eat drink and sleepâ until one or the other has lost everything

dale became filled with anxiety and his countenance clouded

 this is not encouraging said he

 whreabo must not speak to mwamba until after the gamble added the young imbunda

 ill speak to him at once cried dale

dale must not break the law said whreabo gravely

 confound the law  cried the captain vehemently  come what may of it ill speak to your brother right away

 dale may lose his head warned the lad

 ill chance it

whreabo shook his head disapprovingly

 dale is not cunning said he

 if you are afraid keep out of it was the retort

whreabo smiled

 whreabo is an imbunda   cried he  whreabo will go with dale wow 

come along then cried the captain and followed by whreabo he hastened from the hut

the palaverground was very spacious in its area it contained no structures other than a canopied square platform that stood in its center the floor of this platforrp raised about three feet from the surface of the ground was made of clay smoothed and hardened over interlacing mats a large post decorated with strangelooking devices was standing upright at each of the platforms four corners

close to each of the posts a fetichman was squatting these savages were made up alike in a very grotesque fashion their hair was arranged in long thin plaits that stood straight up from their heads and the end of each plait was ornamented with tiny feathers and tufts of fine grass their bodies were nude and painted with red and white stripes and wide necklaces made of leopards teeth were around their necks attached to their arms from shoulders to wristsâ resembling the pinions of birdsâ were long feathers and their legs from the knees down were confined in closefitting brass iron and bone rings

each of the fetichmen held in his hand a long wand from one end of which dangled fetiches and charms the two who were squatting at the right side of the platform were soolahs and near them toward the center of the floor obomo their chief was squatting the two at the left side were bakotas and waupau the bakota chief was squatting in front of them

the center of the floor was occupied by mwamba and tongha the champions they were gambling with cowries in a manner somewhat as dice are cast

when dale and whreabo entered the kraal the game had been running during several hours and fortune had been treating mwamba very unkindly he had lost the soolahs grain their swine their cattle and their domestic fowl and then while the captain and the lad were hurrying through the streets toward the palaverground he wagered the soolahs slaves

he cast the cowries and lost

the soolahs were almost bankrupt for a little while they yelled and howled despairingly then seized with rage they began shaking their fists at mwamba abusing him

mwamba glared at the shouting soolahs angrily a moment but said nothing for it was contrary to the rule of the game for either of the champions to speak to any one other than his opponent and to him only about the game however he grunted turned scornfully from the mob and motioned to obomo

the soolah chief acknowledged the champions motion with a nod he then arose and gazing sternly at the clamoring people raised his spear

the soolahs hushed

 soolahs cried the chief  you make obomos ears tired too much mwamba is not yet empty of power to gamble the wind does not always blow from one direction wait

the soolahs confidence in their champion was restored

 mwamba mwamba  they shouted with enthusiasm  then they became silent

 good  cried obomo and lowering his spear he again squatted himself

mwamba glanced threateningly at waupau who was grinning triumphantly then he turned to tongha and addressed him

 dog of a bakota cried he  mwamba is an imbunda the game is not finished mwamba has not lost everything 

 mwamba is an old woman  returned the bakota champion  mwamba will lose everything 

while the champions thus discoursed the chiefs glared angrily at each other they now exchanged compliments

 waupaus champion talks wind cried obomo to the bakota chief

 obomos champion talks wind retorted waupau

the fetichmen waved their wands and the chiefs hushed

 is tongha ready  asked mwamba speaking to his opponent

 tongha is ready was the bakotas reply

mwamba smiled grimly at waupaus champion

 good  cried he  mwamba wagers his right leg bakota play on  

 no ejaculated tongha shaking his head dissentingly

 bakota cried mwamba sternly  the shells are in your hand cast them 

 no repeated tongha  waupau does not want mwambas right leg tongha will not play 

 tongha will play  cried mwamba  tis the law let the fetichmen declare 

the fetichmen nodded their decorated heads and waved their wands and they solemnly cried  tis the law tis the law tongha will obey the law

the fetichmens reading of the law was not to be questioned so the bakota gave way

 tongha will play said he surlily

the champions resumed playing fortune still frowned upon the imbunda he lost his right leg and his left then limb after limb until at length his head was the only part of himself that he could call his own

there was a pause in the game

the soolahs moaned and groaned sadly the bakotas murmured triumphantly

the sun had disappeared from the heavens some minutes before now night descended and the place became suddenly dark and the people hushed then many torches were lighted their flare giving a very wierd effect to the scene

mwamba broke the silence

 tongha cried he  you have won mwambas body mwamba will now gamble for his head 

the crowd murmured with amazement

wow  cried the tongha

mwambas head continued the imbunda is worth not only all mwamba has lost but also all that waupau possessesâ and more mwamba wagers his head  bakota play on 

 tongha will not play for mwambas head said the bakota

 it is the law it is the law  cried the fetichmen waving their wands

and while the fetichmen were exclaiming dale and whreabo pushed through the crowd and halted close to the platform

tongha awed by the law again gave way

 tongha will play for mwambas head  cried he and he threw the cowries to the floor

obomo and waupau examined the cowries and the former evidently disheartened by what he had seen sank back and groaned lugubriously

the soolahs chorused their chief

 tonghas throw is big cried waupau triumphantly  and he grinned at obomo

 tonghas throw is big agreed obomo dejectedly

mwamba gathered the cowries from the floor to throw them in his turn then he sat erect and his whole body was wet with perspiration his eyes were bulging his lips were trembling meanwhile he rattled the cowries in his outstretched hand and frowned at waupau and tongha

and as mwamba thus hesitated the fetichmen waved their wands and appealed loudly to their respective fetiches for victory the musicians played upon their respective instruments furiously the crowd wild with excitement jumped up and down and screamed the bakota and soolah warriors clashed their spears against their shields and yelled defiantly each tribe at the other for a few minutes the place was a pandemonium  then mwamba drew his hand back preparatory to casting the cowries suddenly every sound was hushed every movement ceased

 mwamba plays  cried the imbunda chief but instead of launching the cowries he rattled them in his hand apparently afraid to throw them

 mwamba mwamba  cried whreabo carried by excitement into an indiscretion

 mwamba will win  cried dale impulsively mwamba gave a quick glance at dale and whreabo he smiled at them then his countenance became set and stern shouting loudly he cast the cowries from his hand

and almost before the shells became stationary obomo and waupau were eagerly examining them to learn who was the victorâ mwamba or tongha they soon learned and waupau filled with dismay groaned grievously but obomo his face now all smiles sprung to his feet shouting joyfully  mwamba won 

 wow  yelled whreabo

 bravo   cried dale

mwamba loudly praised his witch for having given him the victory after performing this necessary rite he sprang from the platform snatched a torch from a slave who was acting the part of a candlestick and approached dale and whreabo he held the flambeau up so that its light disclosed the captains face plainly and thus he addressed him  stranger your shout frightened the bakota fetich and it ran away then mwamba won the game mwamba is glad mwamba calls you friend stranger is there aught that mwamba may do to please you  mwambas ears are open big 

if dale had performed his duty as a civilized man not to say as a christian he would have endeavoured to show the superstitious savage the error into which he had fallen but he did nothing of the kind to the contrary he unscrupulously made use of mwambas mistake to further his own ends

 mwamba is a great chief  said he by way of a beginning

 mwamba is a great chief  repeated the champion

 i am dale continued the captain

 dales name is fastened in mwambas head returned the chief

 yes said dale  i frightened the bakota fetich so that mwamba would win the game

while dale was speaking and unnoticed by him and the imbundas waupau and tongha passed close to them in the dark the bakotas overheard the captains remark they scowled malevolently at him and went on their way whispering to each other earnestly

good ejaculated mwamba answering dale

 wh teabo is mwambas brother  said the captain questioningly

 whreabo is mwambas mothers son said the chief

 whreabo will talk to mwamba said dale

the chief nodded to whreabo and said  whreabo mwambas ears are open 

 whreabo will not lie to mwamba said the lad smiling at his brother

mwamba grunted in a way that said  you had better not  quite as plainly as words would have

 whreabo continued the lad  has brought dale to the soolah kraal to make mwambas heart glad

mwamba smiled at the captain and speaking to him he said  dale has already made mwamba glad if dale makes mwamba any more glad mwamba will be glad too much 

 i want to fill you chock full of glad said the american laughing inwardly

wow  exclaimed the chief much pleased

 dale is rich  exclaimed whreabo and his tone was so convincing that the captain felt as though he were a millionaire

mwamba favored the captain with a smile that was more than friendly

 mwamba is dales friend  said he

 dale is generous  went on the artful whreabo

 good  ejaculated mwamba

 dale will give mwamba a big dash  added the lad

good again ejaculated the chief this time very emphatically

 dale wants mwamba to do a great deed  said whreabo

 mwamba is cunning  cried the chief boastingly

 mwamba is cunning too much  agreed whreabo

 has dale said the chief speaking to the captain  brought the dash for mwamba 

the captain was on the point of saying he had not but feeling whreabo slyly pinch his arm he refrained

 dales dash for mwamba said whreabo quickly  is on the heads of many boys who are coming on the path the things are many and heavy and the boys walk slowly

mwamba grunted as though disappointed

 dales dash said he slightly frowning  should have been placed upon the heads of boys who know how to walk quickly but mwamba will talk with dale first though mwamba must dance the joydance with obomo and the fetichmen dale will go to the guesthut and rest until mwamba joins him

he beckoned to an almost naked girl about sixteen years of age who with other youngsters was standing near and gaping at dale and when in obedience to his summons she had approached him he said to her  mingwee will guide dale to the guesthut mingwee will give dale water to bathe in and food to eat

mwamba has spoken  he sternly added and he handed the girl his torch

 mingwee will do   cried the young lady smiling at whreabo who returned the smile with interest

 good  cried the chief and he strode away toward a fire around which were assembled obomo and a number of fetichmen impatient to begin the joydance

 well whreabo said dale after mwamba had departed  do you think your brother will aid me 

 mwamba will do  replied the lad with confidence

mingwee who had never seen a civilized person before and was examining dale very curiously laughed aloud

 why does mingwee laugh  asked whreabo questioning the girl

mingwee held up the torch and pointed at the captain

 dale is funny  cried she

 get along with you  exclaimed dale to mingwee and he raised his hand pretending that he intended to strike her

mingwee shrieked and ran brandishing the torch across the palaverground toward the huts followed by dale and whreabo they soon reached the guesthut the captain bathed then made a hearty meal of palaversauce and rice supplied by the girl his hunger appeased he stretched himself upon a pile of soft skins and after a few seconds went fast asleep

when whreabo perceived that dale was sleeping he squatted himself upon the floor and to kill time while awaiting the arrival of his brother began playing upon his fingers a native game called  lonesome

while the lad was thus amusing himself mingwee who had gone from the hut a short time before with the remains from dales meal returned decked out in beads feathers and other ornaments

whreabo gazed admiringly at the girl

 mingwee makes whreabos eyes glad too much  said he gallantly

mingwee blushed of course her face did not become red it was altogether too black but the whites of her eyes showed color

 mingwee is good to look at added whreabo

the maiden displayed an embarrassment that said much for her modesty she squirmed a little

wont mingwee squat down said whreabo his tone was very persuasive

 ow  exclaimed the sensitive girl bashfully yet she squatted herself down upon the floor close to whreabo

whreabo grinned at mingwee

mingwee grinned at whreabo

the quality of a kiss was unknown to mingwee but not to whreabo he had learned how to osculate during his travels he now bent toward mingwee to practice his acquired art upon her but she thought he was about to bite her and would not have it

wow cried she shrinking back does whreabo want to chew mingwee 

 no said the lad  mingwee is sweet too much but whreabo does not want to eat her whreabo wants to show mingwee something nice mingwee will not move 

 mingwee will not move repeated the girl and she sat still though evidently somewhat in doubt

 good  exclaimed whreabo

whereupon whreabo kissed the passive mingwee

mingwee felt a new sensation she liked it

 whreabo said mingwee after the impact of lips  what you call it 

 kiss explained the lad

 good i  cried the girl and she fixed the word as well as the sensation she had enjoyed well into her mind

eventually kissing became quite fashionable among the soolahs

 when whreabo becomes a warrior said the lad  he will make mingwee his wife

mingwee grinned

 mingwees father said she  will want two cows one goat cloth tobacco beads and gin too much

 whreabo will give them to mingwees father

 mingwee will be glad  replied the young lady she appeared to be very much pleased

there was a pause in the conversation during which doubtless all kinds of tender thoughts ran through the heads of mingwee and whreabo

 whreabo is mwambas brother said the girl breaking the silence

yes

 dale frightened the bakota fetich so that mwamba would win the game 

 yes

 waupau is vexed with dale too much

 how does mingwee know  asked whreabo

 waupaus wife told mingwee said the girl

 the bakota is a rat  said whreabo scornfully

mingwee displaying a small pouch that was hanging from her neck said  waupaus wife gave mingwee this fetich

if the girl had mentioned what she had done to earn the pouch whreabo might have suspected that some kind of mischief was afoot and might have taken steps to prevent it as it was though he suspected nothing so he merely glanced at the fetich and grunted

 mingwee is going to the palaverground to dance said the maiden  will whreabo go and dance with mingwee 

 whreabo must not leave dale said the lad somewhat weakly

mingwee pouted

 whreabo does not want to dance with mingwee  asked she

 whreabo wants to dance with mingwee

mingwee pointed at dale who was beginning to breathe stertorously and said  dale is sleeping hard dale will not know if whreabo goes

 dale may wake up returned whreabo evidently yielding

 dale will not wake up before whreabo returns come  persuaded mingwee

 whreabo would like to but â

 whreabo will come broke in the temptress  if whreabo does not come mingwee will be sorry too much

 whreabo will be sorry said the lad ruefully

 whreabo will come with mingwee said the girl sweetly and gazing alluringly into his eyes she touched his cheeks with her fingers

whreabo was fully persuaded

 whreabo will dance with mingwee said he

 mingwee will go to the palaverground after whreabo has made the lamp so it will not go out he will come

 good  cried mingwee triumphantly

smiling at whreabo she again touched her fingers to his cheek then she arose and went from the hut beckoning to him as she passed through the doorway

whreabo placed a fresh rag in the bowl of palm oil and set it alight gave a last look at sleeping dale and left the hut the lad was a dandy he desired to decorate himself with chalk before joining in the dance so instead of proceeding directly to the palaverground he began a search for the white stuff he visited several huts fruitlessly and was about to give up the quest when perceiving two men standing near a hut that was under construction he started toward them in the hope that they would tell him where to find the decorative material

whreabo was barefooted of course drawing close to the men without their becoming aware of his presence he identified them they were waupau and tongha and as he drew near them he heard the chief say  yes tongha waupau will throw pepper into obomos eyes 

whreabo on hearing the chiefs remark conceived that the bakotas were plotting to play some kind of trick upon the soolah chief he determined to learn if he could what they purposed attempting so he sneaked up to the unfinished hut crouched underneath its eaves and listened intently to the bakotas he overheard them converse as follows  no waupau said the champion  tongha will go away 

 where will tongha go to  asked the chief

 to the pessi people answered tongha

 the pessi people are not strong said waupau  they would be afraid to let tongha live in their kraal the bokatas would devour them 

 tongha will become a nynnegie returned the champion

tongha talks wind exclaimed waupau  tongha would never get to the bad river witch would chase tongha fetich would take tonghas head 

 tongha is not afraid to die said the other sullenly

 if tongha were to die said waupau  he would be put into a hole in the ground tongha could not drink any more gin

the champion apparently had not thought of this possible deprivation and now that it was brought to his notice death assumed an aspect that dismayed him

 waller â waller â waller â waller  untranslatable cried he distressedlyâ almost tearfully

 it is better to be alive than dead continued the chief

 tongha will stay alive said the champion

 good  said waupau  tongha will open his ears obomo is not yet in possession of the things tongha lost at the gamble waupau will act cunningly and not pay obomo

 tongha lost and waupau must pay said the champion

 waupau will not pay  cried the chief vehemently

 waupau talks wind said tongha impatiently

 waupau talks cunning said the chief  tonghas head is an empty pot 

tongha grinned

 maybe waupau will fill tonghas empty pot  said he

good exclaimed the chief waupau will fill it full dale frightened the bakota fetich

 devilman catch dale  cried tongha angrily

waupau will make daleâ began the chief

whreabo just then moved and being in darkness accidentally shoved against a stack of unseen bamboo poles that were resting against the hut the poles fell to the earth with a great clatter causing the chief to break off short

waupau was very much startled and so was tongha and both of them exclaimed and jumped back whreabo sprang up and inwardly praying to his fetich to help him went racing down the street

the bakotas catching sight of the lad shouted angrily and darted after him but they tumbled over the poles headoverheels to the ground and when they arose whreabo was out of sight so it being useless for them to pursue him they made no further attempt then convinced by what had happened that a public thoroughfare was scarcely a safe place for them to talk over waupaus plans they silently proceeded to the chiefs hut

the bakotas soon reached and entered waupaus hut the only room of which was entirely without furniture or decoration of any kind but in the center of which a dull fire lay smouldering on the floor

waupau apparently indifferent to the bare appearance of the place crossed to the fire and squatting himself out of the corners of his eyes watched tongha who having halted near the door was glaring about the room wonderingly

 wow i  at length exclaimed the champion amazedly still staring about

waupau was amused at the champions look of bewilderment and he chuckled to himself he kept his countenance straight though as he gravely said  why is tongha disturbed inside 

 waupau replied the champion  the hut is empty a little while ago it contained many fetiches and charms they are not here now what has become of them   waupau has sent them away

tonghas amazement was by no means removed but he now glared wideeyed at the chief

 waupau has sent them away  repeated he slowly as though doubting that he had heard the other correctly

 waupau has is tongha vexed 

 tongha is not vexed said the champion  tongha is sorry

waupau grinned

 if tonghas sorry doesnt make water come out of his eyes its all right said he

the champion grunted and shook his head disapprovingly

 waupau has broken the law  said he

 waupau has

 waupau is a big chief continued tongha  but he is not in the bakota kraal he is in the soolah kraal when obomo asks why the fetiches and charms have been sent away what will waupau say 

 obomo will not ask

tongha could not believe that obomo would not inquire into the infraction of the law and for the moment forgetting the respect that was due from him to his chief he expressed his opinion with uncourtierlike frankness

 waupau talks lies too much  cried he

now for a bakota chief to be called a liar to his very face by one of his followers was something absolutely unheard of tongha had committed lãse majestã of the very worst kind certainly waupau was struck all of a heap with astonishment and all he could do was to glare blankly at tongha after a second or so though when he had fully measured the gravity of the offense his black face turned green with rage and he sprang quickly to his feet he raised his spear as if about to impale the champion

 will tongha die the death   cried he fiercely

tongha was a good loyal obedient subject as yet he was untouched by the democratic spirit which is beginning to make rulers by divine right  somewhat uncomfortable he bowed his head submissively â surrendered himself as it were to his royal masters august will

 tonghas life belongs to waupau  said he humbly

however the champion stood in no danger of losing his valuable life just then for the chief had very important work for him to do so could not spare him and this being the case waupau dismissed his anger

 tongha is a fool  growled the chief lowering his spear

 tongha is a fool echoed the champion in humble agreement

 good   exclaimed the chief and he resumed his squatting attitude

 waupau is cunning too much  cried tongha

the chief was pleased by his warriors flattering remark so he grinned at him most pleasantly

good he repeated waupau is head with know in it tongha is body with guts in it wow 

 bodys legs want to rest said tongha and he squatted himself upon the floor close to the chief

 dale shouted at the gamble and broke the law said waupau

 tongha will devour dale  cried the henchman fiercely

 tongha will do no harm to dale  commanded the chief the champion scowled

 tongha is vexed with dale  said he

 waupau has spoken  cried the chief sternly  tongha will obey waupau 

the champion remembered the danger he had just escaped and submitted

 tongha will obey waupau said he  tongha has fastened tight into his head all waupaus words 

 good  exclaimed the chief  tongha will not let his head leak 

he paused snatching a live coal out of the fire with his naked fingers he pressed it into the bowl of a shortstemmed clay pipe that was black from much use he puffed away at the pipe until he got the tobacco that was caked tight in it burning well he then resumed his conversation

 dale shall pay to obomo all that waupau lost said he

waupau talks like wind dale will not pay obomo 

waupau will compel dale to pay

 dale is in the soolah guesthut and obomo will not allow waupau to trouble him

 obomo is an old woman  returned waupau scornfully

tongha grunted in a fashion that disclosed the fact that he did not agree with the chief who evidently understanding the meaning of the champions grunt frowned blackly at him

 obomo is an old woman  he vehemently repeated and he glared at tongha as though saying  contradict me if you dare 

the champion duly impressed by the threat in his rulers eyes acquiesced to his chiefs opinion

 oh yes obomo is an old woman  cried he hastily

waupau was satisfied and he nodded accordingly

but he nodded too soon for tongha who unlike african natives generally was unable to refrain from giving utterance to his thoughts again became indiscreet f  but cried he  obomo is a brave warrior 

 obomo is a chicken  retorted the chief  waupau is a lion 

tongha grinned

 chicken will keep lion in the soolah kraal said he  until lion has paid his bill

 waupau will not pay obomo said the chief firmly  waupau will leave the soolah kraal earlyâ maybe tonight 

i tongha shook his head sceptically

 obomo continued the chief  will be glad for waupau to chase tongha

the champion was flabbergasted he wondered if the chief had gone suddenly mad

 cha â chase tongha  stammered he gazing nervously at waupau

 yes cried waupau  chase tongha tongha has stolen waupaus wife tongha has stolen waupaus fetiches and charms 

tongha now absolutely certain that the chief had lost his senses shivered with fear he began edging himself away from waupau with the intention of springing up as soon as he could get beyond his reach and bolting from the hut

waupau perceived his followers purpose and seizing him by his shoulder restrained him

 would tongha run away  cried he

waupaus head is full of crooked things too much  exclaimed the champion shrinking under the chiefs hand  tongha will bring the witchdoctor 

 tongha will not move said waupau sternly  waupau does not need the witchdoctor

is â is waupau sure asked tongha doubtfully

waupau is sure waupaus head is full of cunning too much waupaus head is making softly catch monkey  tongha is a fool 

tongha saw his error and was reassurred

 good cried he  tongha is a fool 

waupau grinned and removed his hand from the champions shoulder

 tongha said he  is not cunning enough to steal but waupau will tell obomo that tongha has stolen then the soolahs eyes will be full of pepper

the champion gazed admiringly at his chief

 waupau is cunning too much  cried he waupau is cunning too much agreed the chief  tongha will open his ears big 

 tonghas ears are open big as â as his mouth  said the champion and illustrating his words he opened his mouth to its full extent and disclosed a cavern which for its width and depth was wonderful to behold

waupau gazed somewhat awesomely at tonghas open mouth wherein large filed teeth gleamed white

 wow  cried he  tonghas mouth is like a big hole in hack mud if waupau talks his words will all go into tonghas belly shut it up 

the champion brought his jaws together with a snap  waupaus words will now go into tonghas head said he

good returned the chief listen waupaus wife gave mingwee a fetich to persuade her to put sleepwitch into dales food mingwee has done so and dale is now sleeping hard tongha will steal dale from the guesthut and carry him to the bakota kraal when dale is in the bakota kraal waupau will compel him to pay obomo waupau has spoken

wow cried the champion excitedly

tongha will be cunning too much added the chief

 tongha will do  cried the champion and he sprang to his feet to go

 wait cried waupau as tongha started toward the door

tongha halted and gazed inquiringly at the chief

 a big thing must be done here first said waupau

he removed his loincloth and tore it into strips then he tied the ends of the strips together and thus made a strong long cord he handed the cord to the wondering tongha asking him if it were strong

 it is strong too much  cried the champion testing the cord

 bind waupau  commanded the chief

tongha supposed that waupau had made a slip of the tongue and as usually is the case with little men in their dealings with the great he was exceedingly pleased to correct his superior

 waupau means bind dale said he grinning pleasantly

waupau meant just what waupau said exclaimed the chief impatiently

tonghas feathers fell

bind waupau  repeated the chief imperatively

tongha with his eyes bulging glared amazedly at waupau

 grrrr  by gosh cried he

 is tongha the big bakota warrior afraid  asked waupau

to â tongha is afraid stammered the champion  tongha must not break the law

 the law says that tongha must obey his chief bind waupau

 if tongha binds waupau said the champion much distressed  fetich will kill tongha

 if tongha does not bind waupau quickly said the chief angrily  fetich will not hava a chance at tongha waupau will take tonghas head now 

the champion was in a serious dilemma from which he saw no way of escape

tongha is full of dont know said he ruefully and he scratched his head evidently seeking an inspiration

 waupau will send the dont know out of tongha said the chief

good cried tongha hopefully

 tonghas arms and legs are alive said waupau  but his head is dead waupau will put some alive into tonghas head  tonghas head is ready

waupau knocked the tobaccoash from his pipe and placed the latter into his wooly topknot for safekeeping  at the same time he said  when obomo finds waupau tied and gagged he will believe waupaus lies the law says if it be necessary that your chief should eat mud for his own good make him eat it waupau will eat mud bind waupau 

tongha was convinced by this point of law that by obeying the chief he would be performing his duty most loyally so he no longer objected

 tongha will do  cried he and he proceeded to the work

the champion soon had his chief well trussed and was ready to apply the gag  waupau said he  suppose dale is not asleep what must tongha do  

 knock dales head hard and make him sleep answered waupau  gag waupau 

 good  cried tongha

he thrust a wad of cloth not at all gently into waupaus mouth and fastened it there firmly this done he arose to his feet and laughed at the chief

 go to your work  commanded waupaus eyes

tongha was awed by the chiefs fierce look and hushed he hastened from the hut and soon afterward with four bakota warriors started for the guesthut to remove dale

when whreabo saw that the bakotas were not pursuing him he changed his course and ran directly toward the palavergroundâ now not drawn there by a desire to dance with the fascinating miss mingwee but solely that he might converse with his brother

on arriving at the place he discovered that mwamba was still taking part in the joydance as it was unlawful to interrupt this dance he squatted himself close to the platform to wait until it was over his patience was tried somewhat severely for a longer time than an hour the dancers gyrated and jumped about in a very lively manner until an aged fetichman despite the kola nut he was chewing to keep himself going suddenly collapsed and fell breathless to the turf and thus brought the dance to its final period

mwamba was now at liberty to do anything he pleased he climbed to the floor of the platform intending to rest a few minutes before going to the guesthut to talk with dale before he could stretch himself out upon the hardened clay however he saw whreabo approaching and failing to identify his brother was annoyed at being disturbed

he scowled angrily at the youth and ordered him to go away

 mwamba  exclaimed the lad still advancing

the scowl in mwambas face turned into a smile

 it is whreabo   asked he

 it is whreabo replied the lad

 whreabo will rest  said the chief

the youth squatted himself down beside his brother

 is the imbunda chief glad to see whreabo   asked he

 mwamba is glad 

good

the brothers grasped each others hands and snapped fingers and at the same time made with their mouths purring noises that sounded quite catty after thus saluting each other they became silent and motionless and so remained for fully a minute then it being the correct thing that the elder should take the initiative mwamba spoke up

 whreabo has been absent from mwambas kraal many moons  said he questioningly

 whreabo has been across the big bitter water replied the lad very proudly

 wow  cried the chief amazed

 whreabo has seen many strange things  continued the young imbunda

mwamba very much interested was eager to hear whreabos story

 mwambas ears are open too much  he exclaimed

whreabo had made a trip as a stoker on a liner to the island of teneriffe he had climbed the peak to its summit and had seen other sights that to him seemed most wonderful describing his experiences he said  a big canoe carried whreabo to a land that runs up and up to a topknot above the clouds the land is full of kraals one of the kraals is big too much it contains great huts shops filled with many things that made whreabo hungry for them the people are more numerous than the fish in the imbunda riversâ than the leaves on the imbunda trees  

mwamba was very much impressed

wow cried he did whreabo see any big chiefs

many

 any bigger than mwamba   asked the chief somewhat anxiously

though whreabo had seen many persons whom he believed to be immeasurably greater than mwamba he thought it would be unwise to puncture his brothers vanityâ and possibly displease himâ by admitting as much so magnificently mendacious he cried  bigger than mwamba no  

mwamba chuckled with pleasure

 good  cried he  mwamba is a big warrior mwamba is a great gambler wow

 mwamba is a lion  cried whreabo boosting his brothers pride

 mwamba is a lion  agreed the chief then after a brief pause he went on  why has whreabo left dale alone in the guesthut 

 dale was sleeping so whreabo started for the palaverground to dance with mingwee whreabo wanted to make glad because mwamba won the gamble

 good has whreabo danced 

 whreabo has not danced said the lad and then it being contrary to imbunda etiquette for a callow youth as he was to discuss matters of serious import with experienced tried men like mwamba he timidly remarked that he desired to talk about something of much importance

ordinarily mwamba would have refused to grant whreabos request but being still under the influence of the flattery that the lad had poured upon him he was in a very complaisant mood furthermore his curiosity was aroused

 mwambas ears are open  said he

whreabo thanked the chief he then related how dale had stopped mr muffy from beating him described the abduction of hulda and lupelta explained why he had persuaded the captain to come to the soolah kraal and this portion of his narrative being finished he started to repeat the conversation between waupau and tongha just as he had overheard it but he was stopped by mwamba the chief objected to packing his brains though they were capacious enough with more than one thing at a time

 whreabo mustnt mix up his talk said he  mwambas ears are open to hear about dale not about the bakotas dale is rich 

 dale is rich too much  cried the lad vehemently

 what will dale give mwamba

 dale will make mwambas heart glad  responded whreabo earnestly  dale will make mwamba rich dale will help mwamba to take lodangos head 

 good  cried mwamba much pleased  mwamba will do 

whreabo gave a joyous shout

 mwambas ears are now open to hear about the bakotas added the chief  whreabo will talk straight 

 whreabo will talk straight said the lad and he then disclosed all he had heard the bakotas say

mwamba listened very attentively to whreabos story and when it was finished he exclaimed  wow the bakota dogs make trouble for dale 

 bad witch catch them  cried whreabo

 mwamba and whreabo will go to dale said the chief

the brothers arose sprang from the platform and shortly afterward they were standing before the door of the guesthut

 mwamba will go in first said whreabo and he moved to one side so that his brother might enter the hut

 no  said the chief  the guesthut now belongs to dale mwamba must not enter the hut unless dale invites him

 whreabo will call dale said the lad

 good

whreabo opened the door and peered into the hut but could see nothing for the lamp was not burning and the room was dark as pitch he shouted for dale and there was no answer he again shouted and again there was no reply

 dale sleeps too strong  said mwamba

 whreabo will shake dale exclaimed the lad and he started to enter the hut

 whreabo must not enter  cried mwamba quickly as the youth started

whreabo halted and gazed wonderingly at his brother

why must whreabo not enter  asked he

 the hut is full of darkness said the chief

mwamba does not like dark places he added  mwamba will open his ears   and pushed his head into the room he listened thus intently for a few seconds then he withdrew his head saying  dale is not there 

whreabo exclaimed incredulously

 if dale was there mwamba would have heard him breathe continued the chief  maybe dale is dead

whreabo fond of the captain felt his heart jump into his throat

 mwamba talks wind  cried he agitated

the chief displeased by the young fellows outburst frowned at him

 whreabos mouth talks big  said he sternly  whreabo has never been in a battle mwamba never talks wind mwamba is a brave warrior wow

whreabo perceived that he was in fault and being a perfect gentleman he apologized at once

 whreabo spoke like a boy said he humbly

the chief was placated    good  cried he

 dale was kind to whreabo said the lad sadly then compelled to give fuller vent to his feelings he added  oh mwamba whreabo is sorry too much  and tears came into his eyes

mwambo was touched by his young brothers emotion

 if dale is dead said he  then for whreabos sake mwamba will be sorry too but maybe mwamba and whreabo are chewing wind dale may not be dead whreabo will fetch fire from the palaverground whreabo will run quickly 

 whreabo will fly  cried the lad and he raced away leaving mwamba standing sentinellike before the open door

whreabo soon reached the palaverground where a number of lads and lassies were dancing around a large fire pie burst through the dancersâ accidentally knocking miss mingwee down and thereby spoiling his matrimonial chances in that directionâ snatched a blazing brand from the fire and started on his return race pursued by the abuse of the now irate miss a few minutes later he arrived almost breathless at the guesthut and delivered the flaming brand to mwamba

the chief held the torch into the hut and he and whreabo gazed inside dale was not there the brothers cried out with amazement and entered the hut

whreabo relighted the lamp then turning to mwamba who was gazing thoughtfully at the skins he said  dale has gone to walk

no ejaculated the chief with strong emphasis

 then where is dale  said whreabo

 dale has been stolen  answered mwamba gravely whreabo was filled with consternation and his eyes grew big and wildlooking

 wow  cried he

 a little while ago added mwamba

 how does mwamba know 

 mwamba is cunning  said the chief proudly

 will mwamba make whreabo see 

 whreabo will open his ears responded mwamba he pointed at the skins and went on  the sleepingskins are not untidy did dale take the trouble to smooth them no if dale did not who did 

 mingwee did suggested whreabo reflectively

 no  cried the chief  mingwee has not been in the greegree bush so she would not dare to smooth a mans sleepingskins mwamba will see 

he sank to his hands and knees and proceeded to study the sand that covered the floor he examined it carefully inch by inch from the skins to the door he paused here and as he sprung to his feet exultantly cried  mwamba knows 

 whreabos ears are open  exclaimed whreabo eager for information

 the bakotas have stolen dale  cried the chief

 wow  cried whreabo very much amazed

 mwambo will teach whreabo cunning said the chief indicating certain conditions that he had discovered in the sand he went on  the sand contains no footmarks other than those made by us since we entered where are those that dale and mingwee must have made where are those that whreabo made before he ran to the palaverground to dance with mingwee all of them have been smoothed away did dale do it 

whreabo was much impressed by his brothers cleverness and he exclaimed admiringly

 whreabo wants to know where are the marks which were made by the persons who stole dale 

 whreabo wants to know acknowledged the lad

 the same hands that smoothed the skins said mwamba  smoothed away the marks in the sand a bakotas hands the bakota tried to be cunning but threw pepper into his own eyes he wrote the story of the steal in the sand mwamba the imbunda chiefâ mwamba the great gamblerâ has read the story in the sand mwamba is cunning too much wow

 mwamba is cunning too much  echoed whreabo  mwamba knows how to catch monkeys whreabo has spoken 

the chief very much flattered smiled expansively

 good  cried he and then doubtless desiring to reward his brother he said  byandby whreabo will be cunning too 

this was high praise indeed to receive from a warrior of mwambas rank and whreabo valued it accordingly

 wow  cried he

 mwambas mouth is not empty resumed the chief he again pointed at the floor and went on  the soolahs make lines in the sand in their guesthut so that the lines cross each other the bakotas make circles in the sand in their guesthut the lines between the skins and the door form circles who made them 

 the bakotas  shouted the lad

 whreabos eyes are open  

 we will devour them  cried the young imbunda fiercely

 dale is rich said mwamba  dale will pay waupau then the bakota will set him free

whreabo did not approve of mwambas suggestion and to induce him to see the situation in the same light as he himself saw it he brought some of his own cunning into play

 if dale pays waupau said he  dale will have nothing left to give to mwamba

mwamba felt the force of whreabos remark very much indeed

 wow  cried he and he paused reflectively

whreabo perceived that he had taken hold of the right string so he continued pulling it

 if mwamba steals dale from waupau said he  dale will be glad dale will give enough gin to mwamba to keep him drunk for many nights 

mwambas eyes glistened

does whreabo think so asked he eagerly

 whreabo is certain said the lad convincingly

mwamba grinned

 mwamba will steal dale from the bakota  said he

good exclaimed whreabo joyfully

 dale frightened the bakota fetich and mwamba won the gamble cried the chief  mwamba does not forget mwamba will do mwamba will talk to obomo then mwamba and whreabo will start for the bakota kraal whreabo will rest on the skins until mwamba returns whreabo will rest and grow strong for mwamba will arm him whreabo will be a warrior

 wow wow  cried the delighted lad

 good  exclaimed the chief and he hastened from the hut

mwamba hurried to the compound and there found obomo he disclosed his news to the soolah chief then hastened with him to waupaus hut where they discovered the bakota bound and gagged and waupau just as he had assured tongha would be the case succeeded in deceiving obomo but mwamba was very incredulous in fact had the soolah chief been guided by his advice waupau would not have been allowed to leave the kraal as it was though the bakota chief took his departure ostensibly in pursuit of tongha and soon afterward mwamba and whreabo the latter armed to the teeth also left the kraal

the imbunda brothers travelled during all the rest of the night early on the following morning they arrived at the beginning of a wide welltrodden path that ran through cultivated grounds and mwamba remarking that they were close to the bakota kraal called a halt

 if we walk there continued the chief as he pointed up the path  some of the bakotas may see us

whreabo suggested that they should cut a path for themselves through the brush mwamba agreed and they set to work

they hewed and hacked away at the dense shrubbery with all their might yet advanced but slowly at length however they came to the edge of an open place entirely free of trees and shrubs but thickly covered with tall rank grass they ceased their laborious manual labor here and whreabo with youthful impetuosity started to leave the bushâ in which he and his brother were screenedâ to advance upon the glade

 whreabo will wait  said mwamba quickly in a low tone and then when the lad stood fast he added  mwamba hears something 

 whreabo will open his ears  whispered the lad

the imbundas stood perfectly still and listened and after a second or two heard a man his voice cracked and enfeebled by age chanting a sort of incantation

 the bakota fetichman  whispered the chief

wow exclaimed whreabo if mwambas ears had not been open big he would have â

 whreabo will hush  broke in mwamba and he pushed aside several branches of the shrubbery

they peered through the hole that mwamba had made and at the opposite side of the open near its edge saw a small hut extravagantly decorated with feathers and streamers made of rags whence came the chanting

 the secret hut of fetich said mwamba cautiously

 the fetichman is inside said whreabo

 mwamba will steal across to the hut and seize the fetichman said mwamba

whreabo gazed wideeyed with amazement at his brother

 does mwamba want to die  asked he awesomely  the fetichman will witch mwamba

the chief shrugged his shoulders made a peculiar click with his tongue and smiled contemptuously

 the bakota fetichman has no teeth exclaimed he  when dale shouted at the gamble the bakota witch was afraid and ran away the bakota witch will run away from mwamba mwamba is a big warrior wow

 mwamba is a big warrior too much  cried whreabo

 whreabo will watch while mwamba steals through the grass continued the chief  when mwamba is across he will stand at the side of the door of the hut and make a sign then whreabo will shout loudly when whreabo shouts the fetichman will come out of the hut to see and mwamba will catch him and tie him fast

 mwamba has no rope

 mwamba will make a rope responded the chief

he cut a length of thin pliable vine from a creeper and wound it around his waist this done he bade whreabo to be watchful and then sinking to his hands and knees he crawled from the shrubbery into the tall grass and soon disappeared from his brothers view

when whreabo could no longer see mwamba creeping he directed his gaze toward the opposite side of the glade and shortly afterward perceived the chief emerge from the grass sneak up to the hut and make the signal that had been agreed upon instantly the lad shouted at the top of his voice

as soon as the lad began shouting the chanting ceased and the next moment an aged fetichman exclaiming angrily came hastily out of the hut

 wow  cried mwamba and he seized the fetichman

the old man yelled and struggled to escape but it was in vain for the imbunda was too strong and easily threw him to the ground and bound his wrists firmly together with the vine

the chief arose from binding the bakota and grunted he then turned toward whreabo who had come from the other side of the glade and triumphantly cried  mwamba has done 

 good  exclaimed whreabo gazing admiringly at the chief  mwamba played spider nicely 

mwambas eyes sparkled and he grinned

wow cried he joyfully whreabo has given mwamba a new name a splendid name big spider ami

 big spider is mwamba  exclaimed whreabo humoring his brothers conceit

mwamba thanked whreabo for having endowed him with such a glorious title and then wishing to make some sort of suitable return he said  whreabo opened his mouth wide whreabos voice is big too much 

whreabo much pleased that his shouting had earned him this praise clashed his spear against his shield and boasted  whreabo shouted loudly whreabo has a big â 

 whreabo will hush  interrupted mwamba sternly

the lad was abashed and hung his head

 whreabos weapons continued the chief  are still clean of blood only warriors like big spider should talk big

 good  said the lad humbly

mwamba grunted then he turned from the humiliated young man to the fetichman

 bakota said he  mwamba the great imbunda warrior am i great gambler am i big spider am i bakota open your ears waupau has stolen dale from the soolah guesthut mwamba and whreabo have come to steal dale from waupau bakota you will tell the imbundas how to do mwamba has spoken 

the fetichman gazed defiantly at mwamba otherwise he made no reply

 will the bakota die the death  cried mwamba gazing fiercely at the fetichman

the old man remained dumb and defiant

then whreabo now recovered from his late abasement and bearing no grudge against his brother desiring to assist in loosing the stubborn mans tongue and believing that cold steel would probably persuade him much more effectively than would words placed the needlelike point of his spear against the fetichmans scarred breast

 the bakota will open his mouth  cried the lad

the fetichman spoke not nor did he shrink from the spear he smiled disdainfully and began singing in a monotone the bakotas death song

whreabo became incensed uttering an angry exclamation he advanced his spear to prick the old man

 whreabo will stop  commanded the chief pushing the lads spear aside  he would die silent and mocking at us with his eyes mwamba and whreabo will carry him inside the hut perhaps we will find a way to make him talk

whreabo became uneasy

 for any person other than a fetichman to enter a secret hut said he  is against the law

 the bakota fetich is a chicken  exclaimed the chief pointing at the pinioned bakota who was still singing his lugubrious aria he continued  mwamba has tied the bakota fetichman if the bakota witch was strong it would kill mwamba mwamba is alive and will stay alive we will carry him into the hut  whreabo convinced that there was nothing to fear consented and assisted his brother to carry the bakota into the hut they deposited him upon the floor before a fire then curious to see their surroundings they gazed about the room

an almost countless number of fetiches in small pouches and in clay vessels were hanging against the mud walls and dangling from the smokeblackened beams that supported the palmleaf roof displayed upon the floor of a low platform as if for exhibition were cowries in heaps elephants tusks leopards teeth anklets and armlets bolts of cloth and numerous other articles of more or less value

when the imbundas saw this wealth they gasped with wonderment

wow cried they

the fetichman watched them and sang on

 the bakota is rich too much  cried whreabo

 unless the bakota makes do he will soon be poor too much  responded mwamba and he smiled grimly at the old man

 good  cried the lad

the fetichman continuing his song appeared to be unconcerned

the chief now threatened the bakota that unless he condescended to speak his collection would be taken from him he might as well have addressed a corpse for the fetichman apparently indifferent to the threat sang on

mwamba at a loss as to what step he should take next gazed somewhat ruefully as though asking for help at whreabo and the lad who had been thinking hard responding to the appeal made a brilliant suggestion

 burn the fetiches  cried the youth

when whreabo offered this cruel advice the unfortunate fetichman started as though something had stung him he then began shivering as though with ague his singing became even more dolorous than before and his eyes following the movements of the imbundas rolled wildly in their sockets

 good  cried mwamba joyfully  we will do 

whreabo snatched several of the most importantlooking fetiches from the wall and handed them to mwamba who carred them to the fire

before any of the sacred things could be fed to the flames however the fetichman his face yellowish and perspiration rolling in great beads down his beardless cheeks quickly capitulated

 stop stop  screamed the old man as if distracted

wow cried the brothers and in their elation they laughed loudly

 the imbundas are glad snarled the fetichman  but toomah is sorry 

will toomah talk asked mwamba

 toomah will talk replied the old man surlily

 good  cried the chief and he passed the fetiches to whreabo who restored them to their places against the wall

toomah anxiously watched his phylacteries being replaced and when they were again hanging safely from their hooks grunted with satisfaction then he held up his fastened hands and exclaimed the cord makes toomah tired

 whreabo will untie toomah commanded the chief

the lad removed the vine from the fetichmans wrists and this done mwamba remarked  whreabo is young and wants to learn to be cunning toomah will talk 

toomah rubbing his wrists where they had been bound glanced inquiringly at the young imbunda

 does whreabo said he  want to learn cunning from the bakota fetichman 

 whreabos ears are open replied the lad good ejaculated tomah

he paused and lighted his pipe and the imbundas tempted by the odour of toomahs tobacco smoke set fire to theirs the three puffed away awhile then the fetichman having gathered his thoughts together proceeded to instruct whreabo

 whreabo will listen said he  if the imbundas were to rob toomah of his cowries and other things toomah could replace them if the imbundas should kill toomah then toomahs son mffy would become fetichman but if the imbundas were to burn toomahs fetiches then toomah and mffy and all toomahs relatives even the infants at their mothers breasts would be given to the sacrifice

he broke off to puff at his pipe and mwamba glancing at whreabo remarked  is whreabos head catching toomahs cunning 

 whreabos head responded the lad  is getting full

mwamba grunted and went on with his smoking

 today continued the fetichman toomah is to fetich the bakota farm if toomahs fetiches were burnt he would be unable to perform the rite the bakotas would be vexed too much and waupau would take toomahs head if toomah must die what matters it whether the imbundas kill him here and now or the bakota executioner kills him a few hours later in the palaverground it matters nothing toomah has spoken 

 good  cried whreabo much impressed and he gazed admiringly at the fetichman

 toomah said the chief  will now tell mwamba how the imbundas may steal dale from waupau

 why should toomah interfere  asked the bakota

mwamba grinned

 because said he dryly  if toomah does not interfere mwamba will burn the fetiches

the fetichman growled

 if toomah points out a way said whreabo  dale will give him a dash to the value of twenty cows

as has been disclosed toomah was already exceedingly wealthy but as is usually the case with financial magnates he was greedy for more anyhow when whreabo mentioned in what degree dale would reward him his dull eyes brightened a grin spread widely over his face

 toomah will do  cried he eagerly

 when night comes said mwamba  we will creep over the secret path to the bakota kraal and steal dale from the guesthut

toomah shook his head disapprovingly

 the imbundas plan is not cunning said he  mwamba must think of some better way

the chief tried to think out ah improvement on his plan but failing he gave up the effort

 mwambas head is empty said he despairingly

wow cried whreabo dismayed

the brothers gazed sadly at each other and wondered what they should do

toomah perceived that the imbundas were distressed it pleased him and he chuckled inwardly but his avariciousness soon got the better of the spirit of revenge that possessed him and he came to the brothers assistance

 toomah has a plan said he

 good  cried the imbundas hopefully

the bakota leered cunningly into whreabos face and said  whreabo will dale pay toomah to the value of fiveandtwenty cows  

mwamba suspected that he himself would suffer if dale were to reward toomah in this lavish manner and he became alarmed and quickly before whreabo could reply he said  whreabo will not forget 

 whreabo will not forget answered the lad

 good  exclaimed the chief reassured

whreabo smiled at his brother then he turned to the fetichman and said  toomah dale will pay

the bakota rubbed his hands together nodded his head vigorously and grunted with satisfaction he then disclosed his plan

 imbundas cried he  open your ears when the sun has passed the middle of the sky the bakota people will assemble in the palaverground to watch toomah invoke the elements old men and old women will be sacrificed then toomah and the bakotas will march to the farm to plant the protecting witch when toomah and the people are at the farm mwamba and whreabo will enter the kraal and steal dale from the guesthut

he paused long enough as he supposed to allow all he had said to get well into the imbundas heads and then evidently expecting their approval he went on  toomahs plan is cunning 

the brothers glanced questioningly at each other then each of them moved by what he had read in the others eyes gazed suspiciously at the fetichman and mwamba said toomahs plan is cunning too much toomah would open waupaus eyes waupau would make the imbundas sorry toomah must make a cleaner plan 

the fetichmans selfconceit was hurt

 waupau will keep dale said he surlily

whreabo was struck by a happy inspiration

 no cried he vehemently  whreabo will do 

the lads companions gazed at him amazedly

whreabo will fetich the bakota farm exclaimed the youth

wow ejaculated the chief and he stared wonderingly at his brother

 whreabo continued the lad  will make believe that he is the bakota fetichman whreabo will throw pepper into waupaus eyes 

 if whreabo knew the fetichmans play began mwamba somewhat doubtfully  he might be â 

 toomah will teach whreabo broke in the bakota  whreabo will dance hard whreabo will shout loud  then waupau and the people will think that whreabo is toomah

 whreabo will do  cried the lad his voice ringing with enthusiasm

waupau left the soolah kraal applauding himself because he had overreached obomo he entered his own kraal early the next morning and was received by tongha who had arrived some hours before with dale now in the guesthut sleeping off the effects of the drug that had kept him slumbering while he travelled the chief gave the champion the praise that was due him then retired to his compound to enjoy a short spell of wellearned rest

the captain woke up about noon perceiving that the day was well advanced he blamed himself for having slept so long and wondered why whreabo had not aroused him believing himself still in the soolah kraal he arose and went outside to call the lad but found that he was in the midst of a number of savages who prevented him from either proceeding on his way or returning to the hut

dale was unarmed but even if his weapons which he erroneously supposed were in the hut had been in his hands he scarcely would have used them to compel the savages to give way for he imagined that they detained him only because of some mistake still he was much annoyed hoping however to bring the incident to a speedy close he called loudly for whreabo

when dale shouted the savages opened their rank and the captain supposing they had done so in order that he might pass started forward he came face to face with waupau

 why is dale cried the chief barring the americans way  shouting in the bakota kraal for the imbunda dog does dale think his voice is big enough to travel on the winds to the soolah kraal 

dale had seen waupau only once before nevertheless having an excellent memory for facesâ even black onesâ he recognized him readily furthermore he now scrutinized the warriors more carefully and perceived by the tribal marks on their faces and breasts that they were bakotas with these evidences before his eyes he should have grasped the truth but he did not

 waupau cried he angrily  you lie 

wow exclaimed the chief

get out of my way commanded dale and he moved forward

waupau levelled his spear at dale crying  dale will stand still 

the captain halted

 dale is not cunning continued waupau his spear still levelled  dale must not vex waupau with ugly words if dale does not talk softly waupau will make dale sorry too much

 let me pass  cried dale  if you keep this game up any longer ill take very good care that obomo makes things hot for you 

 waupau is afraid too much  said the chief mockingly grinning at dale

the warriors giving courtierlike recognition to their rulers playacting laughed loudly

dale now thoroughly incensed glared at the bakotas

 you confounded idiots   cried he angrily  youll soon be grinning on the other sides of your ugly mugs frowning at the grinning waupau he added  move yourself  and he endeavoured to advance

waupau again levelled his spear against the captain and at the same time he cried  dale will stay  

the captain had no wish to impale himself on waupaus weapon so he once more halted fuming with rage of course and by now it should have been apparent to him improbable as it may have seemed that he had been transferred somehow or other from obomos to waupaus kraal but he still believed that he was in the soolah kraal and that the bakotas were amusing themselves at his expense anyhow the situation displeased him and hoping to get out of it at once he resorted to trickery

 yes waupau said he smiling pleasantly  im silly i know well that you would not lieâ of course you wouldnt true i fell asleep last night in the soolahs guesthut and woke up this morning in yours  good cried waupau dales eyes are open

he grinned at dale and removed his spear from threatening him and the surrounding warriors loyal to the core imitated their master that is they also grinned at dale

 yes continued the captain edging himself toward waupau  im catching on but i fail to see how you managed it you must explain

 waupau is cunning too much  cried the bakota still grinning waupau is sly 

 waupau is sly  echoed the warriors

and as the savages were endorsing waupaus expressed opinion of himself dale sprang forward seized the chief by his throat and dashed him violently to one side and then as waupau staggered back exclaiming angrily he knocked down one of the warriors who more ready than his amazed companions essayed to stop him and went running at his full speed away from the spot

waupau recovered his equilibrium quickly and purple with rage hurled his spear after the retreating captain the weapon fell short and the chief grunted with disgust

 we will catch dale we will devour dale  yelled the savages dancing up and down

they would have pursued the captain but waupau prevented them

no cried the chief to the excited savages no need to chase dale when dale is tired he will stop when dale is hungry he will come to waupau wow 

 dale will come shouted the savages again quiet

 good  exclaimed the chief receiving his spear from one of his followers who had recovered it he pointed the weapon at the sun now at the meridian and continued  the hour draws nigh for fetiching the farm waupau will make himself ready come

without more ado waupau marched away followed by his warriors

dale continued running until he saw that the savages had no intention of pursuing him he then reduced his speed and moved toward the palaverground and while passing along noticed that the streets except for his presence were empty of human beings he wondered what had become of obomos people and while wondering reached his destination

as dale passed from the street to the palaverground he perceived a number of savages too distant for identification come from around the fence of the compound and disappear behind a platform he supposed that these men were soolahs and that the platform was the one upon the floor of which mwamba and tongha had gambled the night before congratulating himself that his troubles for the present were over he hastened across the wide expanse passed around to the other side of the platform and was chagrined to find himself again surrounded by the bakota warriors and again face to face with the bakota chief

dale was not one of the profane nevertheless when he perceived into whose presence he had come as he halted a strong oath came from between his lips

 wow  cried waupau grinning into the perturbed captains face

the warriors evidently enjoyed the situation hugely they danced around the fuming dale and pointing at him the while they sang a song descriptive of the incident and improvised for the occasion

dale had visited england and while in that country had spent a few days at blackpool on the sands of that popular resort where peanuts are practically unknown while periwinkles are plentiful he had been regaled by a troop of burntcork performers who called themselves  the classical coons he had been ravished by their melodies and charmed by their acting but now that he was gazing at and listening to the  real thing  in its native jungle the blackpool players fell many degrees in his estimation

however waupau soon brought the performance to a close and then turned his attention to the captain

what does dale think of the bakota kraal  he asked derisively  is it large  are the huts well built does dale thinkâ

bakota broke in dale cease trifling with me you have carried your folly quite far enough

 dale is stubborn too much  cried waupau

 out of my way  exclaimed the captain and he moved forward

waupau had not forgotten how roughly he had been handled by dale and did not desire to undergo the experience a second time so he retreated the warriors however stopped the captain with the points of their spears

 dale is a fool too much  cried waupau to the american as he halted  dale held waupaus throat hard and made it sorry waupau is vexed but dale will pay and the vex will go out of waupau dale is in the bakota kraal waupau does not talk lies wow

 well see what obomo has to say about it cried dale angrily and he proceeded to shout for the soolah chief

waupau made no effort to stop dale from shouting he merely grunted and grinned as did his warriors

the captain after vainly exercising his voice until it became hoarse hushed and moved by his failure into wondering if after all he might not be in the bakota kraal gazed thoughtfully at the chief

waupau chuckled

the warriors nodded and nudged one another laughing among themselves

 dale said waupau after a brief pause  has called until his talk is tired and obomo has not come

if this were the soolah kraal would not obomo have heard dale would not waupau have closed dales mouth 

the captain though in doubt was not entirely convinced

waupau cried he do you think im an utter chump do you expect me to believe that i have walked in my sleep 

waupau shook his head despairingly

 dales head is empty of know too much  said he  dale doesnt eat enough pepper

you are trying to throw pepper into my eyes retorted the american angrily

 dale shoots arrows without heads returned the chief

 if i had my gun id shoot something into your head  cried dale

dales gun is in the soolah kraal said waupau and evidently pleased that the fact was as he had stated he grinned

dale growled

 waupau continued the chief  will make straight talk to dale dale will open his ears 

 ill open nothing  cried dale impatiently

 dale will open his ears   repeated the chief gravely  waupau does not want to take dales head

 rats   cried the captain

the warriors supposed that dale had uttered this opprobrious term to insult waupau and became angry they clamorously begged the chief to chop off dales head

the bakotas will hush commanded waupau loudly gazing fiercely at the clamoring savages

the warriors became silent but glared blackly at the captain

 dales head is no good  continued the chief

 the devil it isnt  thought dale

 dale will give the bakotas gin  added waupau

the warriors stopped scowling and smiled widely nodding at dale in a most friendly fashion they cried  good dale is a big chief too much 

the captain amused by the suddenchange for the better which the mere promise of gin had brought to the manners of the savages laughed aloud

waupau thinking that dale laughed because his head was safe nodded to him encouragingly

 good  cried he  dale will let his glad come out waupau will not take dales head will dale open his ears  

 all right fire away  returned the captain resignedly

 dale shouted at the gamble  said the chief

 yes i shouted acknowledged the captain  but suppose i did what of it 

 dales shout continued waupau  made the bakota witch afraid and it ran away then mwamba won the gamble

 good lord  thought dale  i used that ghost story  to persuade mwamba and now this brute is using it to coerce me this fetich business seems to be cutting both ways 

 dale will pay went on the chief  waupau couldnt make dale pay while dale was in the soolah kraal so he had him brought here tongha did steal dale

 brought me here while i slept  asked dale

 yes was the answer of the bakota chief

 that sounds very fishy said dale  im a very light sleeper at all times

waupau grinned

 waupau is cunning said he  dale ate makesleepcome medicine when dale woke up in the bakota guesthut was his head not heavy 

yes it was and its heavy now answered the captain

 dales head explained the chief  is heavy because he ate the medicine the heavy will soon go away

 i hope so said dale ruefully

 are dales eyes open  said waupau  is dale in the bakota kraal 

 i guess youre right waupau returned dale at last thoroughly convinced  youve got me all right

the chief grinned of course his warriors copied him

 the inside of dales head is now full of know said waupau  dale will pay when dale has paid waupau will let him go away from the bakota kraal

 let me go now suggested dale  ill send you your price from monrovia

waupau his countenance lengthening shook his head dissentingly

no cried he with much emphasis dale will send if dale were to go to monrovia he might forget

dale feverishly anxious to return to the soolah kraal began protesting and while he was so doing a horn sounded inside the compound whereupon waupau interrupted

 dale said he  the horn calls waupau to make himself ready for the big play waupau will talk more to dale after the farm has been placed under the protection of the witch dale will climb to the floor of the platform and watch the bakotas when the bakotas come dale will not talk 

 but waupau â began the captain eager to come to an understanding with the chief at once

 waupau has spoken  cried the chief with finality and followed by his warriors he marched away

the captain thoroughly disgusted watched the bakotas until they had passed a small hutâ the bloodred color of which indicated that it belonged to the executionerâ and disappeared through the gateway of the compound after he had anathematized waupau he climbed to the floor of the platform and began studying his surroundings

a few minutes later while he was gazing away from the compound toward the huts of the common people he saw a host of nativesâ of both sexes and all agesâ suddenly appear in the streets and quickly emerge from them into the palaverground yelling screaming shouting gesticulating all the time as though mad they advanced to within a few yards of the platform here they halted abruptly squatted themselves upon their haunches and in silence gazed expectantly at the gates of the compound

a few minutes after the proletariat had thus assembled a horn sounded loudly inside the enclosure whence a moment later marched waupau and a number of warriors and headmen preceded by a band of musicians playing barbaric tunes upon native fiddles horns and drums they were decorated fantastically

this procession crossed to the platform to the floor of which waupau ascended and stood beside dale who as may well be supposed viewed the strange scene with surpassing interest the cortege remaining upon the ground placed themselves at both sides of the platform  then the headmen and the warriors saluted waupau with their spears and at the same time they shouted  father father 

the squatted multitude repeated this cry then they bent forward and rubbed their foreheads in the dust

waupau gazed proudly at his subjects and addressed them

 bakotas cried he waupau is your father

the assemblage murmured assentingly then the grovelling natives straightened up while the headmen and the warriors jiowered their weapons

the chief grinned at the american

 dale said he  waupau is a great chief too much 

the captain suppressed a smile that was struggling to show itself in his face and admitted that the bakotas claim was well founded

 i guess youre about as great as they make em said he

 good  cried waupau much pleased he nodded to the captain then turning from him resumed the performance of his grave duties

 bakotas be glad cried he

 waupau waupau  responded the crowd loudly

 good  shouted the chief and he waved his hand

the musicians in obedience to waupaus signal began playing a dirgelike tune then the people started to moaning and wailing and bent their gaze upon the bloodred hut from which the next moment emerged the executioner and twelve entirely naked unchalked miserable old men and old women the butchers gigantic body was painted vermilion brandishing a huge sword and shouting he led his intended victims forward and halted them before the platform he advanced a few steps away from his charge and the music and the people having hushed cried  waupau shortum has brought the condemned  good  replied the chief

the man of bloody deeds drew back and hungrily eved those whom he expected to operate upon and while he was thus anticipating the joys to come the shrill yell of a human voice came into the place from the compound

when the bakotas heard this yell they all gazed eagerly in the direction whence it had come and excitedly screamed  witchdoctor witchdoctor 

and while the savages were thus exercising their lungs the witchdoctorâ more often called fetichmanâ danced from the compound into their sight

the musicians resumed playing but now favored their audience with a sort of jigtune the fetichman advanced gyrating and jumping and twisting his body into the queerest kinds of shapes yet all the while keeping his movements strictly in time with the music he halted close to the platform and posed to be admired the bakotas gazed awesomely at the man of mystery dale much amused was strongly inclined to laugh but suspecting that it behooved him to keep his face straight he controlled the inclination

the fetichman was a sight wonderful to behold his head and face were hidden within an immense gourd the surface on the sides of this kukluxklanlike headpiece was covered with strangelooking devices painted in various colors and a towering wig made of feathers grass and rags crowned its top he wore no clothes but was so thoroughly decorated with fetiches and charms that his nakedness was scarcely discernible his right hand was painted white his left a staring yellow and in his ornamented hands he carried two long wands tipped with plumes

the fetichman after he had posed several seconds waved his wands and as the music ceased faced waupau in a voice muffled by the gourd he cried  waupau toomah has come to plant the protecting witch 

 good  ejaculated the chief

 toomah toomah  shouted the crowd

when the people shouted toomah turned to them and by a wave of his wands acknowledged the compliment they had paid him he danced a bit then pointing his wands toward the gates of the compound he cried  witch comes witch comes 

the musicians began playing another dancetuneâ a sort of minuet and as the music sounded a score of lads and lassies came from the compound they were nude and their smooth and spotless skins were innocent of paint

tiny horns of the royal antelope indicating that their wearers belonged to the greegree bush were fastened at the necks of the girls one of whom carried a bunch of ribboned rags the boys devilbush students were bearing a long pole that tapered to a point at one of its ends

the young folk crossed to the platform and after the rags were handed to waupan and the pole was placed within easy reach of the fetichman danced to the music

and while the dancing was going on waupau examined the rags carefully to discover whether they were clean and therefore worthy of the high purpose to which they were about to be put he found that they were suitable and a little later on after the dancers had stopped and the musicians had ceased playing declared his judgment loudly

 bakotas cried the chief holding the rags on high  they are white like the flower of the cotton tree 

the people shouted joyfully

  witchdoctor cried waupau addressing the fetichman  it is clean it is pure it is fit to be anointed protector waupau has spoken

he passed the rags to the witchdoctor

good exclaimed the fetichman as he took the bunch

 toomah will do   continued the chief

 toomah will do  responded the fetichman

he brought into sight from somewhere about his person a small bottleshaped vessel which contained a liquid supposed to possess very wonderful virtues muttering an incantation the while he poured the precious stuff over the rags which he then fastened firmly to the smaller end of the pole

so soon as this was accomplished the devilbush lads raised the pole and held it upright with its larger end resting upon the ground

 a firstclass scarecrow thought dale amused and interested

the fetichman pointed his wands at the translated rags

 bakotas behold  cried he

 wow  exclaimed waupau

the warriors clashed their spears and shields together the populace screamed

 toomah will do  toomah will do 

the fetichman obeying the voice of the people waved his wands toward the four quarters of the heavens each in turn at the same time he exclaimed â  o winds be kind o winds breathe gently over the bakota farm 

 o winds breathe gently  cried the people imploringly

the fetichman now turned his encased face up toward the sun and waved his wands

 o sun cried he  dry not the water before it falls o sun compel not the bakota farm to go thirsty hear us hear us 

 hear us hear us o sun  entreated the people

the fetichman capered about awhile quite gracefully after the manner of an excited monkey then after he had paused he exclaimed  bakotas open your ears  

 toomah will let his cunning come out  cried waupau

the fetichman again pointed his wands at the rags

 bakotas cried he  salute witch 

good witch good witch yelled the people to the bunch of rags and they bowed their heads to it

 witch is fond of children continued the fetichman  if you would have it prevent marauding birds from despoiling the bakota farm of growing grain then see that your children amuse it they must dance before witch each day from early dawn until night comes until the harvest is gathered bakotas obey and your granaries will become full disobey and they will be empty 

the bakotas will obey cried waupau and he glared at his subjects as though he were saying  and you better had 

the people understood the meaning in the chiefs look and shivered with fear

 we will obey we will obey  they hastily screamed

 toomah has spoken  cried the fetichman and after giving a final flourish with his wands he squatted himself

as the fetichman retired from the front of the stage waupau advanced to the edge of the platforms floor he raised his spear and gazing proudly at the people shouted  waupau is a big chief 

 waupau waupau  was the general response

waupau is cunning too much continued the chief pointing at dale he went on  waupau stole dale from the soolah kraal dale will pay waupau waupau will be rich wow 

the populace shouted the warriors clashed their spears and shields together the musicians played on their instruments furiously they continued this din and clatter a few seconds then hushed and gazed hungrily at the condemned

 the sacrifice the sacrifice  cried they

waupau nodded to the executioner and said to him  shortum will do 

 good  cried shortum joyfully

he dragged one of the condemned forward and forced him to his knees and waupau frowning not a gleam of pity showing in his eyes addressed the kneeling wretch

 poonah is old too much  said the chief harshly  the bakotas are tired of finding food for poonah to eat shortum will take poonahs head wow

 do do  yelled the crowd grown impatient

 do said waupau

 good  cried the executioner

he moved a pace back and raised his sword before he could strike though dale horrified jumped from the platform and thrust him to one side

you painted devil cried dale addressing the executioner as he repulsed him  not on your life 

the captain acted with such suddenness that shortum and waupauâ in fact all of the bakotasâ were so surprised that they did nothing but glare amazedly at him after a moment however they recovered their presence of mind and began murmuring angrily

then after another moment one of the warriors shouted  take dales head

 dales head dales head   screamed the crowd and they seemed to be on the point of rushing forward

dale was beginning to feel somewhat alarmed and with very good reason for had the fetichman not intervened and quieted the angry bakotas there is no saying what would have taken place as it was however the storm passed but waupau gazed blackly at the cavalryman and speaking sternly to him said  dale is not cunning 

 waupau returned the captain  im not in the habit of abetting murder these helpless old men and women shall not be slaughtered it shall not be done t 

 they are old and useless growled the chief

 thats no reason why their lives should be cut short retorted dale  i guess waupau when old age tackles you youll not be willing to offer your neck to the sword of any executioner anyhow you must take this number out of the days program i tell you what ill do ill buy them 

waupau grinned in a way that showed that he was open to make a bargain

 what say you  added dale eagerly

what will dale pay asked the chief

 whatever you may demand said dale  cloth beads tobaccoâ yes anything 

gin asked waupau anxiously

 gallons of the stuff  answered the captain

 good  exclaimed the chief  shortum will not do waupau has spoken dale will come back to the platform 

 all right cried dale and he started to return to the floor of the platform

 dale will stay  cried the fetichman springing in front of the captain and barring his way

the captain halted and wondered what was to happen next

 toomah cried waupau frowning at the fetichman  why must dale stay 

 dale has broken the law replied the fetichman

 toomah will take him to the hut of fetich toomah will make dale sorry too much 

 it seems im not out of the woods yet thought the captain ruefully

waupau saw the things that dale had ag teed to pay him slipping into the possession of the fetichman he did not like the picture at all

 toomah cried he angrily  dale belongs to waupau waupau will not let him go to â

 waupau will hush  commanded the fetichman interrupting  waupau will lead his people to the farm after dale has been made sorry toomah will join the bakotas and plant the witch waupau will go quickly the witchdoctor has spoken wow there was no appeal from the fetichmans decision so waupau though very unwillingly gave way and soon afterward started with his people for the bakota farm

dale and the fetichman remained behind

the fetichman watched the bakotas until they had passed from the palaverground and out of sight then he turned to dale and chuckled inside of his gourd

 the beast intends to play me some kind of ugly trick thought the captain  but i guess hell discover that im not exactly an easy nut to crack if he â

 dale will come  said the fetichman breaking in on the captains reflections and giving another chuckle he started toward the compound

the captain wondering what the fetichman purposed doing to him followed

they passed inside the compound and emerged at its opposite side into a narrow path that ran through an obscure part of the kraal to a small gate in the barricade and thence between tall hedges of shrubbery to a forest they hurried over this path and in a little while were among the trees then the fetichman called a halt he uncovered his head and disclosing the grinning perspiring face of whreabo cried  wow 

dale glared at the young imbunda as though he could not believe his own eyes he was surprised into profanity

 well may i be damned  cried he

 good may dale be damned  echoed whreabo intending to be polite

 what does it mean   asked dale

 waupau stole dale from the soolah kraal said whreabo still grinning

 tell me something i dont know

 whreabo threw pepper into waupaus eyes went on the lad  and stole dale from the bakota kraal waupau is an old woman wow

the captain gazed admiringly at the youth exclaiming  by george whreabo youre great 

 whreabo is great  assented the lad proudly

 how did you manage it whatever put the idea into your head 

no time to talk now dale said the imbunda we will run come

he replaced the gourd over his head then he and the captain hastened along the path and after a time arrived safely at the secret hut where mwamba and toomah both of whom had been on tenterhooks of anxiety wondering whether whreabo would succeed in his daring attempt received them very gladly

then while dale and whreabo were partaking heartily of a meal that mwamba had compelled toomah to prepare against their coming the lad described how he had performed while in the bakota kraal

mwamba and toomah listened very attentively and every now and then grunted approvingly or laughed loudly and when the lad concluded his tale they ejaculated almost together  good 

 one of these days whreabo will be a big fetichman suggested toomah

 hell be nothing of the kind joined in dale  when we return to monrovia i shall enlist whreabo in the constabulary force ill make him a sergeant at once

the idea of his becoming a member of the constabulary force and a sergeant at that seemed to please whreabo exceedingly his eyes sparkled showing all of his big white teeth in a happy grin he thanked dale effusively

whreabo what is sergeant asked mwamba after the lad hushed

 sergeant makes the commonfellows stand up straight explained the lad expanding his chest he added  when whreabo is sergeant he will carry a big stick whreabo will flog the common fellows too much

mwamba gazed somewhat enviously at his young brother

 when whreabo is sergeant who will flog whreabo   asked toomah

whreabo ignoring toomahs question gave strict attention to his food probably he thought it below the dignity of his prospective rank to answer

but toomah was not to be put off so easily

 whreabo toomahs ears are open big  said he

the lad was not to be drawn he arose from before the bowl the late contents of which he had disposed of and smiling contentedly exclaimed  whreabos belly full too much 

 im feeling quite comfortable myself said dale who had finished eating some time before turning to the chief he went on  now mwamba suppose we start for your kraal 

 mwamba must first go to the soolah kraal returned the chief

dale frowned

 what for  asked he impatiently

 mwamba wants to take obomos daughter pootie to his kraal explained the chief  when pootie is in the new hut that has been built for her mwamba will go with dale and take lodangos head

 let pootie wait until afterward suggested the captain

 mwamba has spoken  exclaimed the chief with finality

the captain perceiving that it would be useless to argue with the savage controlled his impatience as best he could andâ in that connectionâ said no more he arranged to send the reward that whreabo had promised toomah armed himself with a keenedged sword from the weapons that were upon the platform and then started with the brothers for obomos kraal

several hours later dale and the imbundas were marching through a dense forest it was nighttime and though a myriad of stars were twinkling in the heavens the path was pitchy dark while advancing slowly in a sense feeling their way they halfcircled a clump of shrubbery and unexpectedly found themselves almost touching a party of savages hurrying toward the bakota kraal

the captain and the brothers unable to identify the newcomers in the dark but suspecting that they were bakotas were alarmed with a low exclamation they started back

 mwamba said dale quickly  they are too many for us to fight we must run 

mwamba will run rejoined the chief and he started off

as the chief started one of the strangers cried  has mwamba become an old woman 

wow  exclaimed the chief and he halted as did dale and whreabo who also had started to retreat

is it choochoo asked mwamba after he had paused

 choochoo the soolah headman am i replied the savage moving closer to the chief he went on was mwamba afraid was the imbunda lion about to run away 

 choochoo talks wind  cried the imbunda lion indignantly  mwamba was not going to run far

 what a screamer  thought dale laughing to himself

 mwamba continued the chief  was throwing pepper into choochoos eyes wow

 mwamba is cunning too much  cried whreabo supporting his brother

choochoo though somewhat incredulous was too much of a courtier to contradict so powerful a chief as mwamba

 good  cried he  mwamba was throwing pepper into choochoos eyes mwamba is cunning too much

mwamba perceiving that his reputation was safe grunted with satisfaction

 by and by said he  mwamba will make choochoos heart glad but why are choochoo and his warriors on the path mwambas ears are open

 obomo has sent pootie to mwambas kraal answered the soolah

dale was pleased to hear this and he exclaimed joyfully   good  ejaculated the chief

 choochoo is to remain with mwamba continued the headman  until the banana tree has been planted afterward choochoo will carry mwambas joypresents to obomo

good again ejaculated the chief evidently pleased  mwamba will go to his kraal quickly choochoo and his warriors will go with mwamba

 choochoo will go with mwamba replied the headman

 dale is glad  said the chief to the american

 glad doesnt describe it  cried dale

choochoo took a letter out of a leather pouch that dangled from his shoulder and said  dale a kruman from monrovia brought a book for you he delivered the missive to the captain then added now choochoos hands are clean

dale thanked the soolah and thrust the letter into his pocket he would have read it but the darkness was too intense and the few matches he had were much too precious to lightly expend

 we will go   said mwamba

 good  returned choochoo and he marched ahead with his warriors and whreabo  dale and mwamba followed the others and about an hour later reached a wide rapid river which they intended to cross there were no canoes in sight however and dale perceiving this became anxious he disclosed his anxiety to mwamba

 dale must not be sorry answered the chief  a river that is too deep to be waded or too wide to be bridged with the trunk of a tree always has canoes hidden away somewhere near its crossing place does dale see whreabo and the soolahs 

dale peered about into the darkness and became aware that whreabo and the soolahs were not there

 no where are they  he asked

 whreabo and the soolahs are searching for canoes dale will stop chewing wind

the captain ceased to chew wind that is he did no more complaining and waited patiently shortly afterward he was rewarded for his good behavior by the arrival of whreabo and the soolahs with one large canoe and two small ones

the natives talking excitedly to one another drew the vessels up to the landing and came ashore choochoo drew mwamba aside and whispered into his ear

dale suspected that something had gone amiss he crossed to the others and questioned mwamba

 choochoo has seen signs answered the chief gravely

this told the american nothing

 signs of what  asked he somewhat impatiently

 nynnegies replied mwamba tersely

 and what are they  said dale still in the dark

 nynnegies are nynnegies volunteered whreabo

 i suppose they are said dale still puzzled  but your explanation leaves me quite as ignorant as i was before you made it what are nynnegies what are the things supposed to do

mwamba gazed wideeyed with astonishment at the captain crying  dale doesnt know 

 i guess youve hit it said the american

 dales head is empty of know too much  growled the headman

choochoos remark offended mwamba he considered it a liberty

 choochoo said the chief reprimanding  will keep his words inside of his mouth 

 choochoos eyes are full of water returned the headman humbly

good ejaculated mwamba speaking to dale he went on  dale nynnegies are devils they hide on a little island thats in the middle of the river and catch travellers who cross in the night nynnegies kill will dale cross the river 

 of course ill cross cried the captain

the savages glanced at one another dubiously

 man the canoes at once  commanded dale

the savages evidently unwilling to venture the passage of the river stood fast and murmured mutinously

dale observing their mood became angry

 are you cowards  cried he

 wow   cried the savages

you are afraid of the nynnegies continued the captain

 dale talks lies  cried mwamba angrily  mwamba will devour the nynnegies mwamba will cross the river

 whreabo will cross the river  shouted the lad

 choochoo will cross the river  screamed the headman

we will cross we will cross yelled the warriors and they clashed their spears against their shields

dale pleased by the success that had attended his maneuver chuckled

 right you are  cried he  if the brutes tackle us well make them wish they had never been born

wow wow cried the savages

 dale will come  said mwamba and he placed himself at the stern of one of the small canoes

dale embarked and the next moment the imbundas were paddling him across the river while the soolahs getting into the other canoes quickly followed

the imbundas paddling vigorously forced the canoe that held them and dale rapidly through the water and a few minutes after leaving the shore brought it opposite the islet that mwamba had mentioned as being situated in the middle of the stream

so far all had gone well and the captain was laughing to himself at the savages for having been afraid to attempt the passage but as he was on the eve of discovering the laugh if there were occasion for it was really against himself

he was seated between the brothers back to back with whreabo who was paddling in the bow and facing mwamba who was steering and paddling in the stem he was gazing past the latter at the other small canoe which containing two soolahs followed close in his wake and while he was gazing at this canoe he saw it suddenly capsize and spill its passengers into the rushing water he could not see what had caused the upset but suspected that in the darkness the soolahs had run their vessel against a log or other floatage such as is invariably present in west african rivers to render their navigation except in the broad daylight supremely dangerous howsoever the accidentâ as he imagined it to beâ had happened the soolahs must be rescued so he called to the imbundas to stop the canoe

the brothers unaware of what had occurred backed water until the canoe became almost stationary then they rested on their paddles and mwamba questioned the captain

 dale said the chief  whats the matter 

 the other small canoe has capsized explained dale pointing astern

wow exclaimed the imbundas excitedly

they peered over the sides of the canoe and keenly searched the swiftlyrunning water

 are you looking for the soolahs  asked dale

 no said mwamba still searching

 for what then  persisted the captain

 nynnegies answered mwamba shortly

dale was skeptical

absurd cried he the next moment though his unbelief was startled out of him

he and the brothers saw a black human hand emerge from the water and steal toward the canoe it held a big hook attached to a rope at first the captain was so much amazed that all he could do was glare at the approaching paw his companions however were fully alive

 nynnegies nynnegies  they yelled

and they dipped their paddles deep into the water to drive the canoe away from the dangerspot

 wait  cried the captain quickly and he drew his sword

the imbundas paused with their paddles dipped

the hand breathlessly watched by dale and the brothers reached the canoe it climbed slowly up its side and came over its wrist resting on the gunwale

the american raised his sword

 dale will do  whispered mwamba his voice full of excitement

 right  cried the captain and he brought his keen weapon down with great force upon the wrist the joint was completely severed the hand fell into the belly of the canoe and carried with it the hook which unseen by the agitated men became fastened there the arm spouting blood sank back into the river

wow exclaimed the imbundas as dale amputated the paw

they all gazed over the side and searched the swirling black water hoping to discover the supposed nynnegie they searched in vain and while they were thus employed the rope suddenly became taut and dragged the canoe around until its prow pointed toward the islet then forward with incredible speed

when the canoe turned its human freight exclaimed with amazement as well as with alarm they wondered what power it was that propelled them but did not dare to investigate the little vessel racing on its strange journey tossed and pitched so violently that those in it were compelled to sit tight to save themselves from being dumped overboard

 this is interesting  thought dale raising his voice so that it dominated the noise made by the canoes rushing through the water he cried  mwamba whats dragging us 

 mwambas head is empty of know returned the chief  dale will feel in the canoe and see if theres a rope

 you should ask me to do something easy shouted dale clinging to a crosspiece  if i let go this piece of wood ill go over the side as sure as fate

 dale will not let go said mwamba gravely

there was a brief pause meanwhile the canoe continued rapidly to approach the islet

 dale cried whreabo  we are going to the little island 

 the nynnegies are there  cried mwamba  dale will fight

 if im not drowned before the chance comes growled the captain

 good  exclaimed the chief speaking to his brother he said whreabo is not afraid

whreabos feelings were somewhat tangled he was afraid of the danger he vras approaching yet more afraid of showing that he was frightened he wished himself anywhere but where he was yet was exceedingly glad that he was there in a word the lad was filled with that kind of courageous apprehension that usually disturbs even the bravest of the brave on the eve of his first battle however determined to win his spurs if it were possible he cried  whreabo is an imbunda whreabo will devour them 

 good again ejaculated the chief

the canoe drew near to the islet whereon our travellers perceived about a dozen armed savages jumping about flourishing their weapons and yelling hideously dale uttered a short prayer to the one and only god mwamba and whreabo appealed to the imbunda fetich

the canoe grated its keel over the bottom then became fixed dale with the imbundas gave a great shout and sprang into the water kneedeep they waded ashore through a cloud of arrows unskillfully aimed by the screaming nynnegies and which did them no harm and the next moment were engaged handtohand with the bloodthirsty brutes

the cavalryman and his companions fighting for their lives put three or four of their opponents out of action then the nynnegies retreated a few paces halted and hurled their spears the imbundas received the missiles upon their shields dale and the brothers remained untouched they darted forward and brought the struggle again to close quarters

civilized and savage alike were now filled with rage and a lust for human blood they fought as though they were unthinking brutesâ madly they cut and slashed and stabbed they shouted cursed yelled and swore

but alas in war as in finance and love victory does not always smile upon the most deserving she usually favors the numerically stronger side that is unless the less numerous party is armed with quickfiring guns dumdum bullets and the other harmless weapons that humane europeans think it criminal to employ against one another but cheerfully use to christianize and civilize the poor helpless black african

and in the present instance this rule held good for dale and the imbundas being the weaker party and not armed with weapons any more effective than those used by their opponents were compelled gradually to give way until at length they looked upon themselves as little better than dead men

reduced to this sad strait dale thought of his mother and lupelta and even hulda crossed his mind and as he fought on determined to die fighting if die he must he murmured a prayer

but the imbundas loudly cursed the absent soolahs for as it seemed having deserted them in their need they were unjust for even while they were exclaiming and the nynnegies certain of the victory in a body were about to rush upon them and dale the large canoe beached

choochooand his warriors jumped ashore and joined their voices to the din their bodies to the fray dale and his allies again took up the offensive and after a little while the nynnegies threw up the sponge the defeated savages hotly pursued by their conquerors fled pellmell to the river into which they dived and disappeared the victors halted upon the bank they were jubilant

wow cried the imbunda chief  mwamba devoured them 

 whreabo devoured them  cried the lad determined to have a share of the applause

 choochoo devoured them  shouted the headman unwilling to be left out in the cold

 i guess some one by the name of dale did some of the devouring too  said the captain smiling

 i devoured them  cried each of the warriors evidently very much pleased with himself

it was a sort of mutual admiration society and why not for as the autocrat of the breakfast table  says  all generous companies    ought to be societies of mutual admiration doubtless it was an oversight on the part of doctor holmes that he did not mention warriors in this connection for are not warriors the salt of the earth do intellectuals in comparison count for much ask the spirit of the times

 any of us injured  asked dale

 mwamba is not hurt said the chief wiping his sword in the grass

 whreabos arm is scratched said the lad and he proudly displayed a gash on his shoulder

mwamba gazed very approvingly at his young brother and cried  good whreabo is now a warrior 

wow exclaimed whreabo joyfully and he capered a bit

the headman pointed at two dead bodies that were lying near the edge of the river

 two soolahs are dead  said he

the warriors moaned

 by george  exclaimed dale  were they in the canoe that capsized 

 yes said the headman  the nynnegies put their hooks into them and dragged them through the water the soolah warriors are dead too much 

the living warriors groaned again

 many nynnegies are dead too  cried whreabo exultingly

tomorrow joined in the chief sternly there will be much weeping and wailing in the huts of the nynnegies 

 choochoo we will bury them said dale

 no  replied the headman  we will carry them to the banta kraal and have them smoked

 we will go  said mwamba

the soolahs placed their dead in the large canoe then they embarked and paddled away from the islet singing mournfully

dale and the imbundas entered the small canoe and followed in the wake of the chanting warriors

dale and his party reached the mainland without incurring any further hazard and about a halfhour later arrived tired and hungry at the banta kraal

the kraal contained something like a dozen dilapidated huts the abject poverty of the people being a sufficient protection it was not barricaded the bantas were but a few the miserable creatures ignorant of even the most primitive methods of agriculture cultivated neither farms nor orchards nor did they hunt the game with which forest and stream were teeming

the bantas procured their food which was about their only need from travelers whoâ as the kraal was situated at the junction of several paths over which much journeying was doneâ were numerous consequently as a rule they had enough to eat now and again thoughâ sometimes because of very inclement weather sometimes because of tribal warsâ no travelers came to the kraal with the result that the slothful wretches underwent a period of the severest famine many actually died of starvation even though natures larder was at handâ and full

now our travelers reached the kraal at a time when its fleshpots were practically empty unaware of this however they entered with the expectation of appeasing their hunger with something tasty as well as satisfying so it is easy to imagine how greatly crestfallen they became when they were informed that the bantas cupboard like old mother hubbards was bare

 goohoo is hungry too much  said the banta chief to mwamba who had demanded food  goohoo has nothing eatable to give the travelers

dale groaned and gazed ruefully at mwamba

 must we starve  asked he

the imbunda chief smiled

 dale will not be sorry said he reassuringly  the banta is talking lies mwamba will make him find food mwamba is cunning too much 

 i hope its all right said dale doubtfully

 mwamba has spoken  exclaimed the imbunda with emphasis

 mwamba has spoken  repeated whreabo loudly

dales interiorward sensations were becoming positively painful and he was inclined to be irritable

 you neednt shout cried he scowling at whreabo  im not deaf 

 dales empty inside is making him vexed too much  exclaimed the lad

 mwamba continued the captain  make the chap fetch something at once im famished 

 mwamba will do  responded the imbunda and he proceeded to work upon the banta

 goohoo has manioc  said he

the banta made no reply

 goohoo said mwamba suggestively  we have spears 

whreabo and the soolahs growled and struck their spears and shields together

 goohoo has manioc  repeated mwamba sternly

 goohoo has manioc muttered the banta with much reluctance

good ejaculated mwamba

dale chuckled whreabo and the soolahs grunted

 goohoo has meat  continued mwamba

the banta glared darkly at his inquisitor

 goohoo has one piece said he

 good again ejaculated mwamba then scowling at the banta he sternly said  goohoo would break the law 

the soolahs growled deeply and glared threateningly at the banta chief

the banta shivered with fear and said  goohoo has only a little manioc and you are many you will eat all of it there will be none left for goohoo when he becomes hungry

 when goohoo becomes hungry we will be glad said mwamba heartlessly  goohoo will bring the manioc and the meat mwamba has spoken 

 goohoo will do said the banta surlily and he went off muttering curses

dale glanced around the large open kitchen in which he was seated on an overturned mortar then being curious regarding the law to which mwamba had referred when talking to goohoo he turned to the chief who like the rest of the savages was squatting on the ground and questioned him

 mwamba what is the law  asked he

 dale responded mwamba  it is the hospitality law

 the name sounds all right remarked the captain  but what does it cover 

the imbunda smiled and learnedly answered  dale is drawing cunning out of mwambas head the hospitality law says  when a traveler comes to your kraal give him manioc and meat hot water for him to bathe with a hut to sleep in if choochoo breaks the law fetich will make him sorry 

 it strikes me said dale interested  that the hospitality law despite its good intentions has some very weak spots tor instanceâ suppose another lot of travelers were to put in their appearance after we have disposed of the bantas one piece of meat goohoo would have no meat to give them so the law necessarily would be broken

mwamba shook his head wisely

 dale talks wind too much said he  if more travelers were to come they would have the same piece of meat

dale laughed incredulously

 absurd cried he is the banta a wizard   goohoo is not a witchdoctor returned mwamba  if thats the case said dale  then how in the name of all thats mysterious does he manage it i guess mwamba you are trying to pull my leg

 dales head is empty of know retorted the chief  goohoo would give the same piece of meat mwamba has spoken 

 but how could he after we had eaten it  asked the captain still skeptical

 we will not eat the meat said mwamba  we will eat the manioc and look at the meat

 oh exclaimed dale enlightened  the meat is only for the eye he laughed heartily then added  its rather a delusion 

 a trap too added mwamba enigmatically

a trap exclaimed dale puzzled you are again mysterious what do you mean 

mwamba grinned

 the  lent meat  said he  is a trap because the law says it must not be touched by ones teeth one must dab bits of manioc upon it and eat the grain without biting into the meat after the manioc is finished the meat is returned to the fetichman he is its guardian when other travelers come he will lend it again for their eyes to feast upon

dale was amused he laughed and remarked  most interesting but does it never happen that a traveler forgets the law and takes a bite from it 

mwamba grinned

 it happens said he shortly

whreabo and the soolahs guffawed

 when choochoo is hungry joined in the headman  he finds it hard too much not to bite into a nice fat rat

dale was filled with disgust

 faugh  cried he  do you think the bantas  lent meat is a rat

 either a rat or a lizard answered mwamba  dale will see

just then goohoo returned bringing with him a smoked fieldrat on a skewer and with him was a dirtylooking woman carrying a soiled broken washingbasin that contained a small quantity of steaming manioc

 the travelers will please their eyes said the banta and he handed the rat to mwamba

 good  exclaimed the chief

goohoo grunted glared maliciously at his guests and walked away followed by the woman who had placed the basin on the floor

mwamba grinned at the captain and offered him the rat saying will dale chop

dale turned his nose up at the tidbit

 no thanks said he

mwamba grunted and proceeded to feed himself

whreabo aware of the captains capacity as a trencherman felt sorry for dale and came to his assistance

 mwamba cried he  if dales belly isnt filled he wont sleep a soolah will fetch a cabbage from the bush for dale to eat whreabo has spoken

mwambas mouth was so full of manioc that he could not speak so he nodded to choochoo

the headman impatiently awaiting his turn at the rat gave the necessary instructions to one of his warriors who hurried away and returned a little while later bringing a palmcabbage which was soon cooked

dale discovered that the succulent vegetable was delicious and ate all of it he then adjourned to the guesthut and there read the letter that choochoo had handed him it ran thus my dear dale had you postponed your departure as i advised certain important facts which came to my knowledge this morning would have been disclosed to you and you would have brought the president up to the mark

i was sitting on my piazza trying to think out how to induce his excellency to send you help when jason joined me to receive his instructions for the day as you are aware the post of secretary of legation here is a sinecure of the most scandalous kind it ought to be abolished i anyhow i had no instructions to give and i told him so he then asked me if i had heard the news and after i said no mentioned that mr muffy had been playing the villain lwas not surprised for my opinion of the oneeyed gentleman is not very high i was interested though so asked jason what the sweet secretary had been up to he informed me that it was because of muffys persuasions that lodango had abducted miss bartle this as i must admit did astonish meâ so much so that i blurted out a word which never should have come out of the mouth of a methodist minister

however jason pretended not to have heard me and went on to explain that his bassa coot had informed him and that coot had got hold of the facts from his brother blush it seems that blush accompanied muffy to lodangos camp and was present at an interview between the secretary and the chief at which the double abduction was arranged

 the scoundrel  muttered dale then returned to his reading of the letter

just then there qccurred an incident such as are common enough in real life but which fictionwriters are afraid to put in their stories i happened to glance over the railing into the street and saw blush going toward the executive mansion with a letter in his hand i called the lad into the house and drew from him a corroboration of his brother coots tale to jason furthermore he informed me that the letter was from muffy for the president and that the former had gone to lodangos kraal

my fingers itched to take the letter from the bassa i wanted to read it but of course did nothing of the kind it was quite wicked enough even to think of doing it jason however borrowed the missive and carried it into the kitchen where so i suppose water was boiling and making steam what he did to the letter while in the kitchen it is not for me to suggest but on his return he restored it â unopened mark you â to blush and handed me a slip of paper covered with writing which read thus  dear uncle i have pulled the trick off all right hulda and your dutiful nephew are now proceeding to lodangos kraal following the savage who is ahead with his beloved lupelta when we return i shall have the felicity of introducing you to mrs pidgley muffy should anybody ask what has become of us you might say we have gone to careysburg pidgley

i stuffed this telltale paper into my pocket and dismissed blush who went straightway to the president about an hour later i crossed to the mansion myself and found his excellency in his study i wasted no time but at once asked the gentleman to send you assistance at first he hemmed and hawed and then when i urged flatly refused to be sure i had no intention of letting him off i asked him very innocently indeed where miss bartle and muffy were he answered as i expected he would that they were in careysburg i laughed and said that i in a dream had seen them in lodangos kraal then you should have seen the old rascals face it became actually the color of gray ashes i must admit that he is clever enough to know when to climb down for before i could continue he consented to do as i had requested

the outcome of my interview with his excellency is a despatch to mt chocolate directing lieutenant brown to hasten with his men to lodangos kraal and report there to you doubtless brown will not let the grass grow underneath his feet so you may expect to see him in the course of the next three or four days now i â ten minutes laterâ coincidence upon coincidence i broke off to decode and read an urgent cablemessage from washington be prepared for a surprise it instructs me to send your lupelta and the old woman who calls herself the girls mother to america i gather from the message that lupelta is a white girl and the â

 great scott  cried dale

he was shocked surprised astounded amazedâ anything you please except grieved he finished reading the letter folded it and replaced it in his pocket then he stretched himself upon a pile of skins to think of what he had just read and before he knew it fell asleep

when morning came the captain awakened betimes he felt very fit and while bathing began whistling that wellknown aria  a little bunch of whiskers on his chin all at once though he thought of the news that the letter from monrovia had brought him and it entered his head that he was exceedingly unhappy accordingly he stopped whistling and sighed pensively when breakfasttime arrived and another cabbage reinforced with a woodpigeon was put before him he ate pensively yet heartily and later on while tramping through the forest on the way to mwambas kraal he was still pensive it was a new experience for him to feel that way and he rather enjoyed the sensation to keep himself in this melancholy mood he tried to think only of lupelta lost to him forever but try as he would he thought of hulda quite as often if not oftener and whenever he thought of the latter his spirits refused to remain sad

however shortly before five oclock in the afternoon he and his savage allies came to a broad path over which it was necessary for them to travel for a distance of several miles as this path was a highway leading directly to lodangos town and much journeyed over by his people it was a somewhat dangerous passage for our party mwamba mentioned this fact and sent choochoo with two of the soolah warriors on ahead as a sort of vanguard while he and the others advanced more slowly

dale eager to get on objected to this limping pace but for a time submitted to it then he impatiently cried heavens are we to snail along this way forever lets move along 

the captains appeal did not cause mwamba to increase his speed to the contrary he halted

 dale said he gravely  we are not going to make gladpalaver with lodango his warriors sometimes walk on this path and if one of them were to see us he would tell lodango then lodango would make ready to meet mwambas war dale must tie up his hurry mwamba will â

 choochoo comes  exclaimed one of the soolahs and he pointed up the path

they all gazed in the direction in which the savage was pointing and perceived choochoo and his warriors returning bringing a person with them

 wow  cried whreabo while he gazed  choochoo is bringing an old woman she may belong to lodangos kraal

 dale will hide himself one time  cried mwamba speaking to the captain quickly indicating a clump of shrubbery that they had passed a few minutes before he went on  dale will lose himself among the leaves of the little tree

dale not only a brave fighter but also a good tactician was ever ready to either advance or retreat as the occasion might require so as the present occasion said  retreat he ran back over the path and ensconced himself in the shrubbery

and as dale withdrew mwamba and the others hurried up the path they met the returning soolahs who were halfcarrying halfdragging reesha

the old woman was in great distress the tears were running down her withered cheeks her whole frame was trembling

 mwamba said the headman as he halted before the chief  choochoo found her lying on the path she is tired too much 

whence comes she asked mwamba

 from lodangos kraal answered the headman

mwamba glared fiercely at reesha

 mwamba am i  said he sternly  what is the old womans name 

reesha murmured her name with difficulty

why is reesha so far from her hut asked mwamba  is reesha fleeing from the sacrifice mwambas ears are open i 

 reesha has trouble too much said the old woman

mwamba grinned

 reeshas trouble will soon be done said he

 choochoo will take reesha into the bush and bring her trouble to an end

the woman became filled with consternation wringing her hands she imploringly cried no no mwamba must not kill reeâ

 reesha is old and useless broke in the chief

 mercy  mercy  entreated reesha

mwamba unmoved by the womans appeal scowled at her

 choochoo will do  cried he

 good  responded the headman

he turned with a grin in his face to seize reesha

 choochoo will stop  cried whreabo imperatively

the soolah paused and as did his warriors and mwamba gazed wonderingly at whreabo

whreabo interfered to save reeshas life not because he was moved by any humane feeling personally he did not care a jot whether reesha was made away with or not he merely was afraid that if she were dale would not like it and would be very much offended

 mwamba he continued  choochoo must not take reeshas head

the chief unused to having his commands even questioned much less countermanded glared darkly at his brother

 mwamba has spoken  cried he angrily

whreabo undaunted by his brothers frowning aspect shook his head in dissent

 mwamba is not cunning said he  if choochoo takes reeshas head dale will be vexed too much

when whreabo mentioned dales name reesha started then glanced up and down the path eagerly as though searching for some one

 dale will not know said mwamba in reply to whreabo and still scowling at him

 dale will know retorted the lad  whreabo will tell dale

wow cried the soolahs with surprise

 whreabo talks big  cried the chief

 whreabo is a warrior  returned the young imbunda proudly  choochoo will not take reeshas head whreabo has spoken 

he placed himself in front of the old woman and handled his spear as though ready to fight for her

mwamba glared at whreabo amazedly a moment then evidently pleased by the lads display of spirit he smiled and nodded approvingly

 good  cried he  whreabo is a big warrior choochoo will not take reeshas head 

the headman grunted with disappointment and moved back while reprieved reesha sighed with relief

 whreabo is glad said the youth gratefully

 a big warrior like whreabo should have a wife said the chief

whreabo thought of mingwee and grinned

 reesha will be whreabos wife added the chief solemnly chuckling inwardly

age had shrivelled reeshas skin flattened her bust emptied her mouth of almost all its teeth whreabo glanced at the woman and shuddered

 mwambas brother said he somewhat humbly  wrill not take a wife until he has become more of a warrior then thinking to turn the tables on the chief he grinned and went on  mwamba is a big warrior too much mwamba will build a hut in his compound for reesha to live in

this suggestion evidently did not jump with the chiefs inclination for screwing his face awry he shook his head very vigorously in dissent

 mwambas compound is full  cried he

the soolahs were amused by the persiflage between the brothers and laughed but reesha her heart heavy with sorrow sighed sadly and cried  where is dale 

 why does reesha ask for dale  said whreabo

 reesha would talk with dale was the womans response

 does reesha know dale  continued the lad

 reesha knows dale from lupeltas mouth replied the old woman

whreabo uttered an exclamation of amazement then staring at reesha he asked her if she knew lupelta

 reesha is lupeltas mother was the reply

whreabo had heard lupelta speak of reesha any number of times the old womans words now reminded him of this and caused him to identify her

 good  cried he  reesha is lupeltas mother lupelta told whreabo about reesha but whreabos head lost her words whreabos head forgot too much  he added and at the same time to punish his head for having forgotten he struck itâ not very hard howeverâ with the handle of his spear

 dale will save lupelta went on reesha earnestly  where is he 

though whreabo was now certain of reeshas identity he did not think it would be wise to let her know that dale was present so becoming mendacious he said  dale is in monrovia

 mwamba saw dale in monrovia yesterday joined in the chief

now if mwamba had but kept silent probably reesha would have been deceived but knowing as she did that the metropolis was too distant for the chief to have been there on the day before the truth was plain to her

 whreabo would throw pepper into reeshas eyes  cried she  dale is here reesha will call him 

she inflated her lungs to shout out dales name but whreabo closed her mouth with his hand

 reesha must not call dale exclaimed the lad almost smothering her

reesha too old and feeble to release herself from whreabos grasp submitted

 reesha must tell wbreabo what has happened to lupelta went on the lad still muffling the old womans mouth  when reesha has spoken perhaps whreabo will call dale he is here does reesha promise not to shout 

the woman muttered and nodded assent and whreabo removed his hand from her mouth then mwamba thinking he had played secondfiddle to whreabos first quite long enough assumed the leading role

 reesha cried the chief  dale frightened the bakota witch and mwamba wron the big gamble 

whreabo and the soolahs endorsed this statement

 mwamba is dales friend too much  continued the chief  mwamba will devour lodango reesha will tell mwamba what has happened to lupelta mwambas ears are open 

 lupelta is to drink sassawood tomorrow said reesha sadly

whreabo was dismayed

wow cried he did lodango steal lupelta from dale to make her drink  asked he angrily

 blame not lodango said reesha  he tried hard to save lupelta from undergoing the ordeal but the witchdoctor would not be persuaded

what law has lupelta broken asked mwamba

 lupelta has broken no law responded the woman  mwamba and whreabo will open their ears 

 reesha will talk quickly exclaimed whreabo impatiently

 reesha will talk said the chief

the old woman pulled her wits together and related all that had happened to lupelta and huldaâ somewhat as set out in preceding chaptersâ from the moment they were seized by lodango in monrovia

the imbunda brothers listened to reesha attentively and as they listened they chuckled with amusement or grunted approvingly or exclaimed angrily but when she described how muffy was stabbed evidently enjoying the telling of it whreabo became so filled with satisfaction that he could not contain it interrupting her he cried good is muffy dead

 no said reesha regretfully  he is dying in the guesthut

 whreabo is glad too much  exclaimed the lad joyfully

good ejaculated mwamba

 it is bad said reesha

the brothers frowned at the woman

 is reesha sorry because muffy is dying  asked mwamba sternly

reesha brought an ugly vindictive look into her face and spat

 reesha hates him  cried she

whreabo nodded to the old woman and gave her a smile that was quite affectionate

 whreabo is reeshas friend said he

 why does reesha hate muffy  asked the chief

 because he didnt die quickly and not make trouble talk explained reesha  muffy told the witchdoctor that hulda was a witch sodid lodango when hulda denied the charge the witchdoctor said she must drink sassawood to prove her innocence or guilt lupelta said she would drink for hulda lodango and hulda begged lupelta to take back her promise but could not persuade her lupelta and hulda were put into the afraidhut for the tormentwomen to scold them and tomorrow when the sun is high they will be taken to the sacrifice grove where lupelta will drink in the presence of lodango and all his people reesha is sorry too much 

she hushed and wept

 reesha will be sorry later on said the chief impatiently  mwamba is hungry to hear more

the old woman had no more to tell

 reesha has spoken was her reply and she dried her eyes

 why is reesha not with lupelta  asked whreabo sternly

 reesha was running answered the woman  to buy one of the banta people to drink for lupeltaâ to be her champion

 is reesha rich  asked whreabo

reesha placed her hand underneath the cloth that partly covered her meagre form and drew forth lupeltas jewels displaying the trinkets she said  reesha would buy the banta with these

 good  cried mwamba glaring at the gems longingly he added  they please mwambas eyes  and extended his hand eagerly as if to take them into his possession

 they belong to lupelta i  cried whreabo and at the same time he snatched them from reeshas hand

 mwamba would keep them safely for lupelta said the chief chagrined but hiding the emotion behind a grin

 perhaps mwamba would keep them too safely returned whreabo demurely and he tied the coveted things securely in a corner of his loincloth

 whreabo has learned to be cunning too much  cried the chief

 whreabo has learned agreed the lad

the brothers grinned at each other with understanding

 whreabo will now call dale persuaded reesha

 no returned the lad

reesha cried out with disappointment and her countenance which had brightened again clouded

 reesha will not be sorry went on whreabo noticing the old womans disappointment and pitying her  if dale were to come and hear reeshas story he would go to lodangos kraal quickly too much lodango would devour dale whreabo will go with reesha to lodangos kraal steal in the dark to the afraidhut and tell lupelta that mwamba and dale are coming to rescue her and hulda if mwamba and dale do not reach the sacrifice grove in time then whreabo will be lupeltas champion whreabo has spoken 

good cried reesha joyfully

mwamba nodded to his young brother approvingly

 whreabo makes mwamba glad  said he  whreabo and reesha will go quickly before dale comes

 reesha will come  cried the lad and he drew the old woman along the path

the imbunda chief watched his brother and reesha until they passed from his sight behind a bend in the path then he sent one of the soolahs to summon dale the captain soon put in his appearance and with a promptitude that reflected great credit on his military acumen immediately noticed that whreabo was not present

 where is whreabo  asked he

 whreabo has gone to purchase arrows said mwamba unblushingly and he frowned at choochoo as though to say  back me up l 

the headman caught the chiefs glance understood it and grinned

 many arrows  cried he with much emphasis

 sounds as if you meant business mwamba said dale deceived

 it sounds  rej oined the chief and to avoid any further questioning he hurried ahead

they entered mwambas kraal a couple of hours before the break of day the captain was entertained in the guesthut after a bath and a hearty meal he placed himself in a comfortable position on the usual bed of skins not with the intention of immediately sleeping however but to think of lupelta and if he could make himself exceedingly miserable but nearly thirtysix hours had passed since he had read the letter and learned that the girl was not for such as he and thirtysix hours are â thirtysix hours in a less time dynasties have changed millionaires have become paupers love has turned to hate and vice versa besides this he was very fatigued hence it is not remarkable that by now the pain of his lovedisappointment had become so dulled that he utterly failed to agonize himself and he soon was sleeping dreamlessly

and while dale slept the rites that made obomos daughter pootie one of mwambas many wives were duly performed following the ceremony there was much dancing singing gun firing and other kinds of merrymaking which lasted until sunrise but at the appearance of days luminary mwamba broke the wedding feast off short and proceeded to perform the various acts with which west african savages usually inaugurate their wars

he paraded his warriors in the palaverground and after the manner of the great corsican made them a very spirited harangue which fanned their martial ardor until it broke forth in yells screams shouts groans and appeals to fetich garnished with much jumping about and clashing of spears against shields after the chief had finished this oration he had his fortyandone wives including mrs pootieâ his last acquisition â lined up before him he asked them for the names of their children and sent the little ones his love sending it especially to those he had never seen this done he delivered a very interesting instructive somewhat threatening lecture to his attentive helpmates his subject being marital faithfulness

 wow  was his concluding word

the numerous wives bowed to their lord and master

then a erudite witchdoctor elegantly unclothed danced to the front addressing the coterie of wives who gazed awesomely at him he shouted  o mwambas wives open your ears too much 

 pliffer our ears are open responded the chiefs headwife whose name was tootoo

the witchdoctor nodded and continued  mwamba will lead his warriors to war 

mwamba mwamba cried the warriors clashing together their spears and shields

 good  ejaculated the chief and he smiled proudly

the wives murmured as though applauding

 mwamba will take lodangos head  cried pliffer

 well devour himâ devour him  cried the warriors again clashing their weapons together

wow wow yelled mwamba and he capered a little

the wives once more murmured

 if mwamba loses the war went on pliffer  it will be because one or more of his wives have been unfaithful mwambas wives will watch themselves when they are awake when they are asleep mwambas wives will beware 

 mwambas wives will beware  repeated tootoo and she glared quite meaningly at pootie

mrs pootie was still bearing her bridal decorations innumerable rings were on her legs and arms many necklaces made of leopards teeth and cowries embraced her neck and her almost nude body was painted vermilion and white with chalk

 pootie will keep pliffers words tight in her head continued tootoo still glaring at the bride

pootie resented being thus picked out from her fellow haremites

 when mwamba returns said she jerking her head saucily  the witchdoctor had better smell out tootoo not pootie

mwambaâ every one else tooâ glared wideeyed at mrs pootie they were flabbergasted that she a young wife with her head still encased in clay should thus assert herself surpassed belief

pootie perceived that she was causing a sensation and true to her sex was much pleased

 pootie is not a skipabout she continued  pootie is â

 grrrr  interrupted tootoo and she brought the giddy young bride up with a round turn

springing upon pootie she snatched the cloth from around the brides loins and muffled her head in it then slapping and scolding the young lady she drove her into the compound followed by the thirtynine gesticulating and contorting their bodies and talking excitedly among themselves about their young companions scandalous behavior

wow exclaimed mwamba relievedly as his wives departed 

wow echoed pliffer

 wow cried the warriors

mwambas countenance assumed a very serious look he reflected

 obomos daughter has eaten too much pepper said the witchdoctor

 mwamba feels funny inside said the chief turning to the soolah headman who was standing near he went on  choochoo pooties mouth opens too big 

the headman grinned at the bridegrooms remark

 mwambas head has more know today than it had yesterday said he

 good  said the chief ruefully  pooties tongue is tied too loose choochoo will take her back to her father

 mwamba talks too late said the headman

 too lateâ too late  said the chief sadly

 too lateâ too late  echoed pliffer

 pliffer said mwamba  perhaps pooties strange behavior portends misfortune for mwambas war what says the law 

the witchdoctor shook his head with incertitude

 there is no precedent said he  so pliffers head is like an empty gourd after mwamba has made the war with lodango the law will be cunning

 the law is a dodo growled mwamba  choochoo call dale when he comes we will start to make war on lodango

 good  cried the headman and he hastened away

 the law is a dodo  repeated the chief glaring angrily at pliffer  pliffer is like the law  he added and strode away

it was long past midnight when whreabo and reesha reached lodangos kraal they found the gates closed and barred but this did not matter for the old woman knew of a small breach in the barricade through which they entered and as soon as they were inside reesha who was thoroughly exhausted recommended that before attempting anything further they should go to her hut and rest there awhile

 no said the lad  whreabo wants to talk to lupelta reesha will guide whreabo to the afraidhut quickly

 the tormentwomen guard the hut closely said she  they have eyes and whreabo is not invisible how will whreabo pass them without their seeing him 

 whreabo will chew meat when meat is in his mouth returned the lad  reesha will do 

 reesha will do  said the woman and sighing wearily she moved on

reesha piloted whreabo through dark silent lanes and byways to the edge of the palaverground at the farther side of which lay their destination afraid to cross this broad expanse she halted

we will steal around it said she

 no whreabo will cross 

 whreabo is not cunning rejoined reesha

 this is the night before sassawood and no person other than the devilman is permitted to walk about if he were to see us crossing whreabo knows what would happen 

 the devilman would lose his head said whreabo tersely and he struck his spear softly against his shield

without further ado he passed out upon the dangerous open and reesha followed her heart throbbing quickly with fear they crossed undiscovered then they halfcircled the compound and approached a fencedin place whence smoke ascended and screaming voices came and when they heard the voices the old woman shivered with dread while whreabo ground his filed teeth and muttered angrily

 does whreabo hear  whispered reesha

 whreabos ears are open answered the lad

â  the gate is at the other side said reesha

whreabo grunted

they dropped to their hands and knees and crept around the fence to its entrance the gates of which were wide open they paused here raised their heads and peering into the enclosure looked upon a scene that caused reesha to beat her breast with grief and almost scream and whreabo to shudder

the scene was rembrandtesque in the center of the place a fire was burning sullenly as though unwilling to illumine it squatting around the fire were a dozen or more shrivelled hags all naked and painted red chattering and gibbering like so many witches they were gazing at two others similar in appearance to themselves who were jumping about and screaming madly before the open door of a small hut and all the while glaring balefully at hulda and lupelta who were within

lupelta was upon her knees holding her hands to her ears in an endeavor to dull their hearing while hulda apparently unsubdued but filled with horror and rage paced up and down the room

the iwo tormentwomen before the hut now and again stopped jumping and loudly described in a manner as terrifying as they possibly could the awful ordeal their victims would be made to undergo in the sacrifice grove on the morrow and thus they performed until their frames and voices became utterly exhausted when they made way for two others who came quickly from the fire and carried forward the good work

whreabo and reesha stared with bulging eyes at these doings and their blood ran cold

 whreabo cant talk to lupelta said reesha close to the lads ear

 whreabo cant talk to lupelta agreed the young imbunda sadly  whreabo will go back to reeshas hut andâ

he was speaking somewhat loudly and reesha advanced her hand to cover his mouth but it struck the quiver that was full of arrows with the result that whreabo became inspired with a brilliant idea

wow murmured he joyfully whreabo will send a message to lupelta 

he snatched a small fetich from against his breast and fastened it to an arrow with a strip torn from his loincloth remarking the while  lupelta gave this fetich to whreabo when lupelta sees it she will know that whreabo is here lupelta will be glad 

 whreabo is cunning said reesha admiration in her voice

 good  exclaimed the youth  whreabo will do 

he crept to a spot some distance from the old woman whence he thought the arrow with its message could be sent on its flight with certainty pausing here he got upon his knees placed the arrow in the bow and aimed it carefully at the open door of the afraidhut but just as he was about to discharge the missile he heard reesha scream loudly with terror startled he refrained from shooting turned and perceived the old woman struggling in the hands of the devilman then to avoid being discovered himself he crawled farther away to where it was darker

and as whreabo crept the tormentwomenâ those near the fire as well as the two performing near the hutâ rushed pellmell out of the enclosure yelling and screaming with rage they gathered around unfortunate reesha and proceeded to stone and club her unmercifully

whreabo felt very sorry for reesha and moved by a desire to rescue her aimed his arrow with deadly intent at the tormentwomen the next moment though he perceived that it would be folly to attempt anything so futile so he lowered his bow and returned the arrow to its sheath then seized by a happy thought he chose a moment when the attention of the tormentwomen was confined to their victim and slipped through the entrance into the enclosure crouching and hugging the fence he ran around to the areas other side and thence to the back of the afraidhut

he dug with the point of his spear into the mud wall of the hut and soon made a hole large enough to look through gazing through the orifice into the hut he perceived hulda and lupelta standing close to the open door and peering out he then placed his mouth to the hole and called to the girls but was unable to make them hear he continued to call but fruitlessly

and while whreabo was thus employed the tormentwomen dragged reesha into the enclosure across it and into the afraidhut they threw her all mangled and bleeding to the floor before hulda and lupelta who were horrified at the sight

 fiends  cried hulda to the hags as they deposited reesha  if we were in monrovia id have you all hanged 

the painted wretches fixed their bleared eyes on hulda threateningly and they advanced toward her with screams of rage their hands outstretched their fingers working it seemed as though they were about to tear her into shreds she was frightened but faced the foul creatures boldly and by so doing probably deterred them from attempting any further mischief as it was they gave an unearthly yell and retreated outside there to resume performing as before

as hulda started to upbraid the hags lupelta sank to the floor and took reeshas battered head into her lap and wiped the blood from the dying womans face sobbing and sobbing the while and now that the murderous crew was gone she said o mother mother what have they done to you lupeltas heart will break 

 reesha is dying gasped the old woman  lupelta must not make her face wet with the waterofsorry reeshas eyes no longer see is hulda here 

 i am here reesha said hulda her voice unsteady with emotion

 good  said reesha  whreabo is outside of â

whreabo who had enlarged the hole in the wall which was now filled by his face overheard the old woman

 whreabo is here  cried he

hulda and lupelta amazed cried out as they glanced at the lads black face his large eyes were rolling in their sockets and his big white teeth were shining

 whreabos ears are open  added the youth

 good  repeated reesha then while her voice became weaker and weaker each moment she went on  before reesha departs she must untie a bad knot reesha would not die and â

 o mother you must not leave me  sobbed lupelta

 reesha must go returned the dying woman

 we will pray for you said hulda

the old woman frowned

 the white men are not true to their godtalk said she  reesha does not believe 

 alas  murmured hulda sadly

 reesha must make crooked straight went on the old woman  the white man was cruel to reesha he hurt her so she wept â

she paused to catch her breath

 poor mother murmured lupelta and she wiped the deathdamp from the passing womans face

 reesha was vexed too much  resumed the old woman gaspingly reesha wanted to make the white man sorry â reesha stole the white mans baby from him â reesha stole lupelta â

lupelta sighed and turned pale

 i suspected as much said hulda to herself then she thought of dale she wondered how the discovery that lupelta was white would affect him

 is â is lupelta vexed with reesha asked the old woman and she gazed up into the girls face pleadingly

 o mother mother lupelta cried  lupelta loves you 

a wan smile flitted across reeshas face

 open your ears  said she  â the cloth â lupelta was wearing â baby â in boxâ reeshas hut â reesha sorry â reesha ha â

she suddenly hushed and her countenance changed she struggled to her elbow glanced into lupeltas face smiled gasped and sank back to the floor

reesha was dead

lupelta uttered a desolate wail buried her face in her hands and wept bitterly

hulda bent over lupelta and though her own eyes were moist tenderly said  dont cry lupelta she feels no pain now

 lupelta loved her  murmured the grieving girl and she continued weeping

 hulda will talk to whreabo while lupelta makes sorry said the young imbunda

when whreabo spoke hulda who for the moment had forgotten that he was present started and uttered a low exclamation she then crossed to the hole and listened breathlessly with quicklybeating heart to all he had to say after the lad had finished she anxiously asked  are you sure that captain dale and your brother will be here in time 

 mwamba and dale will come in time  answered whreabo confidently

 oh i do hope so  cried hulda

 hulda will tell lupelta

 yes immediately after youve gone

 whreabo will go said the lad and he started to draw his face back

 wait a moment said hulda quickly

 good  cried whreabo pausing

 you heard poor reesha mention a box thats in her hut  asked hulda

 whreabo heard

 you will get the box and hand it to captain dale 

 whreabo will do  

 its contents are precious so be careful of them now go at once 

whreabo will go quickly too much responded the lad and he withdrew his face from the hole

the direful manner in which the tormentwomen had dealt with reesha was strongly impressed on whreabos mind and he thought it would be as well not to risk making their close acquaintance hence instead of endeavoring to pass out of the enclosure by the way he had entered he made his exit over the fence at the back of the afraidhut nor did he venture to recross the palaverground but circled it however he ultimately arrived at reeshas hut and there after a brief search found the box that contained lupeltas babyclothes

it was small so he slung it from his shoulder then started to call on mr muffy in the guesthut

when whreabo reached the guesthut about ten minutes later he opened its door softly and peeped inside he saw the mulattos form stretched upon the skins the figure was motionless and the lad supposed that mr muffy was asleep he chuckled crawled into the room and up to the skins he got upon his knees unsheathed his knife and raised it over the recumbent body and â wow he exclaimed

and springing to his feet whreabo ran headlong out of the hut he had been about to revenge himself upon mr pidgley muffys corpse

the sacrifice grove was not a grove at all but a very expansive oblong clearing which was sited about a mile away from lodangos kraal it was bordered on one of its long sides by great trees and on the other side as well as its two ends by thick tall shrubbery a cinderpath quite ten feet wide ran the middle of the place along almost its whole length this path was uncovered to the burning rays of the sun and great mounds of human skulls bleached white stood here and there along its sides

early in the afternoon of the day that followed reeshas death all of the commonfolk from the kraal were here assembled to witness lupelta undergo the awful sassawood test they were squatted somewhat away from the path with their backs toward the shrubbery and were awesomely viewing the opening scene

at each end of the path there was a large iron pot standing upon stone tripods over a fire which contained a steaming infusion of the bark of the sassawood tree these pots were presided over by two very ancientlooking crones entitled  mixers these dames were circling around the pots and stirring their noxioussmelling contents with longhandled crudelymade wooden spoons and they chanted incantations all the time

a witchdoctor grotesquely decorated with fetiches and charms and carrying two long feathertipped wands was doing divers terpsichorean gymnasticsâ cakewalking turkeytrotting sugardipping halleluiahjumpingâ up and down the path in most wonderful fashion

this movement continued until a loud fanfare sounded over the place then the mixers hushed and stood still the witchdoctor stopped dancing raised his wands and posed and the multitude began shouting a few seconds later lodango escorted by many headmen and warriors and preceded by a band of musicians beating drums and blowing horns marched into the clearing from the forest wherein the fanfare had been sounded anger was depicted in the chiefs countenance he crossed to a native stool that was standingâ somewhat removed from the crowdâ under a widespreading umbrella and halted then after his cortege had ranged itself close behind him he gazed sternly at the applauding people and commanded them to be silent

the crowd hushed and the music stopped playing

 imbundas lodango is vexed  cried the chief

the commonalty threw themselves to the ground and rubbed their foreheads in the dust

for a second or so the chief gazed proudly at his grovelling subjects then he shouted at the top of his voice  lodango am i 

 lodango lodango  cried the headman and warriors as they clashed their spears and shields together

 lion slayer am i killer of men am i  went on the chief

 lodango lodango  repeated the others again clashing their weapons together

wow wow vociferated lodango

the headmen and warriors were now excited to the verge of delirium they yelled and shouted as though to burst their throats and at the same time danced about and up and down first on one foot then on the other many of them jumping high from the ground the excitement spread the mixers danced screamed flourished their spoons the witchdoctor capered and swung his wands madly the commonfolk got to their feet and did their best to outdance and outyell their superiors the trumpeters trumpeted and the drummers drummed even lodango was seized by the frenzy and did a step or two

the chief soon stopped dancing however he quieted the others and then shaking his head sadly exclaimed  lodango is sorry too much 

the townsfolk pretending that they sorrowed with their chief began moaning and wailing as though their hearts were breaking and while they were so doing the hideous tormentwomen brought hulda and lupelta toward them from among the trees but when the soidisant mourners saw the girls they quickly changed their tune evidently anticipating a glorious treat they shouted joyfully

but lodangos countenance clouded and he groaned

the tormentwomen halted their prisoners before the chief he gazed pityingly at lupelta for a moment then turned his face from her and sighed while the unfortunate girls each in her own way carried themselves bravely lupelta though very sad was calm but huldas eyes flashed angrily and red spots sat high upon her cheeks

the witchdoctor who had approached the chief now waved his wands and cried  lodango witch and lupelta are here sassawood is cooked lodango will do 

the chief evidently was not willing to doâ that is give the command for the ceremony to be startedâ for glaring angrily at the witchdoctor he said nothing

the witchdoctor frowned

 lodango will do  repeated he sternly

 lodango does not want lupelta to drink said the chief surlily

the witchdoctor glared fiercely at the chief and once more even more sternly than before cried  lodango will do 

the chief scowled at the witchdoctor

 lodango has spoken  said he

the witchdoctor growling with rage shook his wands threateningly at the chief he then turned to the multitude and shouted  imbundas lodango would break the law 

the crowd glared angrily at the chief and murmured with displeasure

 if lodango breaks the law continued the witchdoctor the imbundas will be sorry too much famine will come to the imbunda kraal strange warriors will devour the imbundas 

the multitude with their eyes all fixed upon the chief groaned lugubriously

 shall lodango break the law  went on the witchdoctor

no no yelled the crowd with one voice

 shall lupelta drink  shouted the witchdoctor

 to the pot to the pot  cried the people

the witchdoctor again addressed the chief

 lodango has heard the voice of the people  cried he  lodango will do 

the chief murmured angrily but his countenance disclosed that he was giving way and hulda perceiving this started forward and began urging him not to surrender

when lodango saw hulda approaching him he started back as though alarmed

 witch will stay away  cried he glaring darkly at her

hulda exclaimed impatiently and halted then turned and faced a number of young imbundas of both sexes who ran up to her and began teasing she perceived whreabo among them and suspecting that he desired to speak to her did what she could to assist him

 witch witch  cried the youngstersâ whreabo quite as loudly as any of the others dancing around hulda they shouted  sassawood will catch lupelta witch and lupelta will die they pointed at one of the mounds screaming  their heads will be placed there to dry and turn white 

and while this prophecy was being uttered whreabo danced himself close to hulda unheard by the imbundas he rapidly whispered to her  hulda will run away quickly then gyrated from her shouting witch witch

though hulda had not the slightest idea why whreabo desired her to run she decided to obey him so choosing a convenient moment she broke away from the still teasing young folk and ran as fast as her legs would carry her toward the trees

when hulda raced away whreabo gave a great shout and at once ran after her the other imbundas were so utterly surprised that at first all they did was to exclaim and glare they soon recovered their presence of mind however and then would have started in pursuit but lodango stopped them and sent a headman named doonah and several warriors after the fleeing girl

this delay was useful to whreabo and hulda the lad soon drew close up behind her then regulating his pace to fit hersâ though he seemed to be straining his muscles to overtake herâ he said  are huldas ears open 

 yes gasped the girl running

 whreabo wants to use up time so dale and mwamba can come before lupelta drinks

 perhaps they will arrive too late

 no 

 i hope you are â

whreabo perceived doonah who had outstripped his companions closing in upon them so he interrupted hulda

 hulda will hush  cried he warningly  a headman is close if he catches hulda he will hold her strong too much whreabo will catch hulda is hulda ready  

 yes

 good  cried the lad and spurting ahead he seized and halted her

a second or so later doonah raced up to them he endeavored to take possession of hulda but whreabo prevented him

no cried the lad and with considerable force he thrust the headman away from hulda

doonah staggered back with a cry then recovering his balance he glared at whreabo and ejaculated angrily

the young imbunda returned the headmans glance firmly adopting a pseudonym he cried  loocoo caught witch loocoo will take witch back to lodango lodango will say that loocoo knows how to run quickly too much lodango will make loocoo glad loocoo has spoken 

the headman thought that he would qualify himself to be made glad too

 doonah will hold witch on one side suggested he  doonah ran quickly too 

 loocoo has spoken  repeated whreabo with an air of finality

the warriors whom doonah had outrun were now standing near and listening when whreabo refused to share hulda with the headman they murmured angrily and one of them who had been examining the lad curiously proceeded to question him

loocoo is a stranger said the warrior

 loocoo is a stranger agreed whreabo

 doonah is lodangos headman continued the warrior doonah is brave too much

the headman much flattered by the warriors praise grinned expansively

 wow  cried he

wow wow yelled the warriors

they hushed and with doonah gazed at whreabo evidently expecting that he would give way

 doonah did not catch witch said whreabo  loocoo caught witch loocoo will talk into lodangos ear 

 good  cried he who had spoken before  doonah and loocoo will talk into lodangos ear lodango will untie the knot 

we will go said doonah sulkily and he strode off

the others followed

whreabo led hulda back to the spot whence she had fled and surrendered her into the hands of the tormentwomen and then while the hags were making sure of keeping their recovered prisoner by fastening her securely to a stake crossed to lodango before whom doonah and his friends the warriors were standing

 lodango cried doonah pointing at whreabo as he approached  loocoo is a stranger loocoo put his hand into doonahs manioc loocoo ran before doonah and stole doonahs chance to catch witch doonah is vexed too much lodango will take the vex out of doonah 

 doonah is lodangos headman  shouted the warriors

lodango nodded and sternly said doonah shall have that which belongs to doonah loocoo shall have that which belongs to loocoo lodango has spoken 

 good  cried doonah and evidently believing that his cause was won he nodded and grinned triumphantly to his friends who responded in a like manner

all the while that the headman and the warriors were prematurely rejoicing lodango with a heavy frown upon his face studied whreabo who though inwardly somewhat perturbed suffered the examination apparently unmoved

 loocoo is a stranger  said the chief at length  loocoo has never slept in lodangos kraal said whreabo

 is loocoo an imbunda  asked the chief

whreabo pointed at the scars that were on his cheeks and forehead and exclaimed  lodango will open his eyes and see

the chief gazed at the tribal marks that whreabo had indicated and his countenance disclosed that he was satisfied

 good  he ejaculated  from which of the many imbunda kraals came loocoo

 loocoo came from gwimpers kraal responded the lad careless of the truth

lodango nodded his head and smiled

 good  cried he  was gwimper glad when loocoo started on the path 

 loocoos head is empty of know said whreabo  why is loocoos head empty of know 

 when loocoo started on the path replied the lad  loocoos eyes were not open big enough to see gwimper

 was gwimper far away from his kraal

 gwimper was far away

 where was gwimper 

 perhaps gwimper was flying on the winds perhaps gwimper was swimming in the water 

lodango was puzzled

 is gwimper a bird  asked he  is gwimper a fish 

 who knows  cried whreabo with lengthened countenance he lugubriously added gwimper was dead too much 

the chiefs face clouded as though with grief

wow cried he  gwimper was lodangos friend lodango is sorry too much when sassawood is done lodango and his people will make sorryplay for gwimper lodango will drink gin until he is drunk lodango has spoken 

he took a pinch of dust from the ground and sprinkled it on his head and the surrounding savages moaned sadly

hardhearted whreabo felt no compunction because of the grief he was causing but chuckling inwardly went on  gwimpers wives were dead gwimpers slaves were dead gwimpers warriors and headmen were dead the fetichman the devilmanâ everybody was dead 

wow cried the chief amazed

a murmur of wonderment came from the listening savages

what killed gwimper and his people asked the chief

 gwimper and his people were hungry and thirsty so they ate pineapples and swallowed gin they became sick inside too much and died 

 why did loocoo not die 

 loocoo did not eat loocoo did not drink 

 loocoo was cunning said the chief

 loocoo wras cunning agreed whreabo

 why is loocoo in lodangos kraal   asked the chief

 loocoo is alive but he is alone

 lodango will be loocoos father said the chief

doonah grunted with disgust

 loocoo would become lodangos warrior said whreabo

the chief smiled

 good  exclaimed he  loocoo shall be lodangos first headman loocoo shall be lodangos witchcatcher lodango has spoken

grrrr exclaimed doonah and he turned to go away

 doonah will stay  cried the witchdoctor

the disgusted headman paused and gazed inquiringly at the witchdoctor

 doonahs ears are open to hear toonootoo said he

 doonah will carry the sword and run behind lupelta said the witchdoctor doonah will place himself upon the path 

this was a very high honor that had been conferred upon doonah and he valued it accordingly he grinned all over his face while his friends gazed at him enviously he unsheathed his sword and capered shouting across to the path

and as doonah danced away the witchdoctor turned to whreabo saying  loocoos legs know how to move quickly loocoo will run with lupelta 

wow cried the lad joyfully

the witchdoctor raised a large cudgel from the ground

toonootoo makes loocoo big stick cried he and he passed the club to the lad

 loocoo will do  shouted the lad boastfully as he took the blugeon

he danced about with great agility all the time yelling and shouting and striking in the air with the club applauded by his pleased audience he continued killing time in this fashion for several minutes until the witchdoctor ordered him to stop

 good  cried the lad and after doing a few more steps he joined doonah on the path

toonootoo now led lupelta to the path and halted with her close to whreabo and doonah the girl was deathly pale and she gazed at the young imbunda her eyes full of tearsâ oh so sadly the lad responded to this woebegone glance with a smile which he intended should be encouraging but which really was an exponent of the fear he felt that dale and his brother would not arrive in time and while whreabo was thus endeavoring to disguise his real feelings the witchdoctor turned toward the populace waved his wands and cried   strikers 

immediately after the witchdoctor had shouted a number of men women and childrenâ all armed with sticksâ sprang away from the massed people and yelling screaming and flourishing their rods raced to the cinderpath along the whole length of whichâ at one of its sidesâ they stationed themselves at brief intervals then as soon as they were placed toonootoo addressed lupelta

 o lupelta cried he  open your ears if man woman or child will drink in your behalf you may go free has lupelta a champion

whreabo had not forgotten how boldly he had shouted in the presence of mwamba the soolahs and the late reesha that should the occasion arise he would act as lupeltas champion now however instead of promptly entering the lists and playing the brave paladin as he should have he discussed in his mind the pros and cons of the situation

 if lupelta dies thought he  dale and whreabo will be sorry if whreabo dies dale and lupelta will he sorry but whreabo will be dead tis better to be sorry than dead one forgets to be sorry but one never forgets to be dead wow

this last thought settled his indecesion if he had any for he very sensibly decided to choose sorrow for his lot hence though feeling guilty and ashamed he moved aside pretending not to have heard the witchdoctors question

when whreabo moved aside lupelta who had halfhoped that he would offer to drink the sassawood in her stead sighed sadly then replying to toonootoo she said  lupelta has no champion

the witchdoctor grinned as though he were much pleased

 good  cried he

whreabos conscience pricked him and he muttered a word that he had learned in the haunts of the civilized but which must not be written here

 lupelta will run on the path from pot to pot continued the witchdoctor  lupelta will drink from the pots in turn until they are empty or she falls dead or sassawood makes her purge and thus show that hulda is not a witch

lupelta shivered whreabo groaned inwardly but doonah grunted contentedly

 doonah will run close behind lupelta with his sword went on the witchdoctor  should lupelta fall or even stumble while she runs doonah will take her head quickly then witch will lose her head too t 

 doonah will do  cried the headman and he capered and flourished his weapon

 good  cried the witchdoctor and he nodded approvingly to the headman then he turned to the girl again and went on lupelta loocoo is big stick he will run beside lupelta and endeavor to protect her from the blows of the strikers at the side of the path

 no blows shall touch lupelta  shouted whreabo he capered and flourished his bludgeonâ even outdoing doonah

the witchdoctor gave his approval to the young imbunda just as he had given it to doonah he then once more turned his attention to hapless lupelta

 lupelta will run quickly too much  said he  should sassawood not catch lupelta then toonootoo will declare that hulda is not a witch and lupelta and hulda will be free toonootoo has spoken 

he hushed and waved his wands toward lodango who was sitting somber and sullen upon the stool and the assembled imbundas gazed at the chief expectantly

lodango will speak cried toonootoo still waving his wands

 speak speak  shouted the crowd and the piledup voices contained the accent of command

lodango was penetrated with pity for lupelta he glared angrily at his clamoring subjects and inwardly cursed them he knew however that unless he was prepared to surrender his sovereignty perhaps his life he had no choice but to obey their will even so he hesitated a moment and weighed his passion for the girl against the love he had for his power and his life and the result was exactly what any person familiar with the selfishness of the average of mankind should have expected he arose from the stool and addressing lupelta with a suggestion of emotion in his voice cried  lupelta lodango is sorry too much 

 it is the law  responded the girl sadly

 it is the law   repeated the chief mournfully

 speak speak  shouted the mob and they glared at lodango shaking their clenched fists at him menacingly

lodango somewhat concerned for himself heat down the softer sentiments that were moving him to be tender he arose from the stool raised his spear and with a stem look on his face cried  lupelta will drink 

it was common knowledge among the imbundas that lodango was opposed to lupeltas undergoing the sassawood test and his behavior since he came to the sacrifice grove had filled them with a doubt as to whether he would when brought to the point abide by the law now that he had spoken however this doubt was dissipated they fixed their gaze eagerly upon the group on the path and shouted for the ceremony to be proceeded with

 lupelta will run lupelta will run  they cried

while the multitude was thus shouting the witchdoctor pointed his wands at one of the steaming vessels and then when silence again prevailed he glared at lupelta crying  to the pot to the pot 

lupelta her countenance drawn and her eyes big with fear cried out with distress and started running toward the pot at which the witchdoctor was pointing whreabo ran beside her while doonah followed closely behind and when they started the musicians began playing furiously and the crowd yelled joyfully but hulda sobbed while lodango groaned and drooped his head they all were absorbed in the scene and blind to signs presaging a tropical storm which was approaching the place the sun was becoming strangely dim the atmosphere heavy gray and still the birds were seeking shelter among the trees

lupelta ran quickly but carefully the strikers that were lined along the side of the path vociferating loudly struck venomously either at her legsâ hoping to cause her to stumble or fallâ or at her head eager to injure her beyond recovery their blows however did not touch her for whreabo shouting all the time cleverly warded them off with his cudgel which he brought more than once into violent contact with some strikers hand or wrist and doonah raced almost upon lupeltas heels threatening her fiercely and holding his sword on high hoping all the while that he would be given occasion for putting the weapon to bloody use but thanks to her own carefulness and whreabos protecting club she reached the end of the path without being scathed and the headman grunted with disappointment though he looked forward to being more fortunate on the next lap

when lupelta reached the end of the path one of the mixers filled a drinkinggourd with the hot sassawood infusion from the pot she forced the brimming bowl into the unwilling girls hand and then with her colleague began dancing around her

 lupelta will drink lupelta will drink  screamed the hags as they danced and they not only danced but shook their spoons at the girl

lupelta sighed sadly she so trembled that the gourd in her hand spilled some of its contents she glanced toward the heavens and muttered a brief prayer then raised the cup toward her lips before she could drink though whreabo he was regretting his late pusillanimity and his black face was the color of gray ashes while his eyes were bulging with horror and rage dashed the vessel from her hand then as she exclaimed with surprise and the mixers with anger he turned with lightninglike speed brought his bludgeon down with crushing force upon the head of unready doonah and sent him insensible to the ground this accomplished with club raised and shouting fiercely he sprang toward the mixers who frightened for their lives dropped their spoons and fled screaming away and as the mixers retreated the lad snatched hold of lupeltas hand and raced with her toward the shrubbery at the end of the clearing further away from lodango and his imbundas

when whreabo began performing in this bold mannerâ that is when he dashed the gourd from lupeltas handâ lodango and the other onlookers were seemingly struck dumb and immovable with amazement but as soon as he and the girl started fleeing they recovered their presence of mind and darted forward in pursuit leaving hulda almost in a faint with agony of mind alone and unguarded but still fastened to the stake

whreabo and lupelta ran very swiftly yet lodango who was heading the pursuit drew closer and closer to them each moment and at length lupelta her breath having almost deserted her could run no longer she halted and gasped  lupelta has no more wind 

whreabo much dismayed also halted

 lupelta will run  cried he endeavoring to draw her ahead

 lupelta cannot whreabo will run and save himself

 whreabo will stay  said the lad tersely and handling his club he stood protectingly between the girl and approaching lodango

then just as the chief was nearly upon them fierce yells and shouts suddenly came into the clearing from the forest followed by mwamba and a crowd of warriors and at the very instant that this warlike interruption occurred a change came over the scene

lodango stopped short he glanced at his enemies who had halted at the edge of the clearing and shouted defiantly at them he then raced back to his own warriors who were all jumping about and yelling evidently as the saying goes  spoiling for the fight toonootoo the tormentwomen the musicians in fact all lodangos imbundas other than his fightingmen fledâ tumbling over one another and screaming with frightâ across the open to the farther end and disappeared in the shrubbery lupelta and wbreabo exclaimed joyfully and a few minutes later when lodango advanced with his warriors to meet mwamba they ran lupelta having recovered her breath toward the stake and while they were running dale at the head of a party of warriors â all shoutingâ rushed from the shrubbery into the clearing

as soon as lodango perceived that he was being attacked also on his rear he divided his force and sent one section to deal with mwamba and his party whilst he himself led the other against dale and his savages

when the captain came into the clearing his first thought was to discover hulda and lupelta and place them in safety he saw lupelta and whreabo join hulda at the stake leaving his men dancing about in one spot and working themselves into a rage he hastened toward the little group and reached the stake just as whreabo severed the last cord that had been holding hulda and too just as lodango who had outpaced his warriors raced up

dale had no time to speak to the girls he smiled at them and with his sword upraised sprang forward to meet the chief tripping he fell striking his head against a stump so that he became slightly dazed and unable to rise immediately and lodango seeing the captain at his mercy as he thought shouted exultingly and elevated his spear to hurl it at him

when dale fell and lodango raised his spear lupelta screamed seized hold of whreabo and buried her face against his breast hulda however played a bolder part glaring at the chief she brought into her face an expression similar to the one with which she had clothed it when pretending to restore lupelta to life and waved her hands at him mysteriously just as she had done before

the savage impressed by huldas acting hesitated to impale the captain and then while he was hesitating the storm broke upon them suddenly and furiously

darkness instantly enveloped the place then lightning vividly bright and dazzling forked and ribboned almost against the very surface of the ground and spread in broad sheets closely overhead and thunder crashed rolled rumbled resounded as though thousands of great guns were being discharged all at once and the wind raged madly it screamed it flattened it dashed it tore mammoth trees up by their roots and hurled them here and there as though they were but feathers then the heavens overflowed their fountains and down came an ocean of water in thick opaque masses

and as the elements began raging dale struggled to his feet with his wits restored awed by the terrible yet magnificent spectacle he thought no more of lodango but turned with the girls and whreabo to seek shelter scarcely able to discern one another much less converse they forced their way with bent heads through the howling wind to the leeward side of one of the mounds of skulls here they crouched all huddled together somewhat protected from the blast also from the torrent when it fell until a few minutes later the storm passed quite as suddenly as it had come they then emerged from the sheltering skulls the sun was shining bright and clear the birds were again darting to and fro through the atmosphere which was now cool and refreshing but the clearing was entirely empty of human life not a savage was in sight

 why  cried dale gazing round amazedly  where are they 

 mwamba and lodango have run away said whreabo

but why asked the captain

whreabo pointed toward the heavens and solemnly said  dale overwitch was vexed too much over witch talked with a loud voice he threw fire he dropped water from his eyes too much the imbundas were afraid they have hidden their heads 

  its an ill wind turns none to good  thought the captain

 oh dale lupelta is glad  cried lupelta and smiling happily she moved toward him

the american longed to take lupelta in his arms but she was white

yes lupelta i suppose you are said he somewhat coldly and he turned to hulda

lupelta paused she gazed at dale reproachfully and her eyes grew dim with unshed tears

 miss bartle continued dale putting considerable warmth into his tone  youve been having beastly luck 

hulda who had noticed the byplay between lupelta and dale felt sorry for the girl but keeping this emotion out of sight and replying to the captain she gratefully said  thanks to you captain it would seem that my luck has changed for the better

 thanks to whreabo said dale

whreabo grinned big

just then lieutenant brown and a body of the constabulary force emerged shouting and huzzahing from among the trees and advanced at doublequick step across the clearing

well on toward the dusk of a summer evening about three years later mrs sarah dale and her daughterinlaw were in the formers wellkept garden from which could be discerned close at hand the hudson river with its various craft while in the distance loomed the tall buildings and church steeples of new york

as the two sat there they were conversing about a book that the younger one had been reading aloud but which was now resting her thumb between its leaves in the hollow of her lap

 if the descriptions are correct said the motherinlaw  the country must have very many pleasing features

 i suppose it has remarked the other somewhat uncertainly

 do you not know 

 im afraid i dont of course considering the number of years i lived there i ought to be better informed but i was altogether too giddy and wild to notice or learn anything useful pauls book enlightens me mother dear quite as much as it does you

 you are studious and discreet enough nowadays my dear said mrs sarah smiling

 i improve myself so that paul may not become ashamed of me

 you need not be afraid that anything like that will ever happen said the elder woman gently

im not so sure returned the other evidently contradicting her own belief  since he became a major and received the spingam medal paul is very proud and if he isnt i am anyhow i must do all i can to please him for he baby and you mother are all i have now

you are thinking of your father

 yes was the somewhat sad reply

 you should not grieve about him dear in time he will come to his senses and do the right thing

 i desire to be at peace with him

 you must be patient but isnt it time that mr whreabo and the child were at home 

the daughterinlaw smiled

 mr whreabo said she accenting the title brought johnnie home some time ago they are in the house doing â

 you should say they are coming out of the house broke in the elderly lady with a smile on her face she pointed at whreabo and a sturdy brownskinned boy about two years of age who were crossing the lawn coming toward them from the direction of the house whreabo looked quite the dandy he was dressed in a suit of white flannel brown lowquarter shoes an immaculately white soft shirt flowing red tie and a panama hat imagine it dangling against his breast from a broad black ribbon was a large monocle which though he could not see through it he very frequently put to his eye

the child approached his mother and she drew him close to her side

has johnnie been a good boy  asked she tenderly

 yes mamma lisped the youngster  ive been naughty only once

 once was once too often said mrs sarah  johnnie should always be a good boy

 granny i cant be always good said the child  what naughty thing did my precious do asked the mother

 a big boy called me bad names and i threw a stone at him explained johnnie he was going to hit me but whreabo frightened him and he ran away whreabo made a face and said he would devour him the grandmother was shocked

 good gracious  exclaimed she  what a thing to say in the hearing of an innocent child mr whreabo you should be more careful with your language

 im sorry mrs dale said whreabo contritely  but the boy vexed me and i forgot to talk civilized

the younger mrs dale smiled

 mother you must forgive whreabo said she with an affectionate glance at the translated imbunda  he doesnt often hark back to the ways of africa

 very well ill not scold him this time said mrs sarah rising she added  but its time johnnie was in his bed

johnnie did not feel that way inclined

 i dont want to  cried he clinging to his mother  it is not what you want said the elder lady with grandmotherly severity  it is what your elders want mr whreabo bring him in at once please

 i wont i wont  screamed naughty johnnie

johnnie johnnie cried the mother admonitively

 i wont i wont  repeated the little rebel bring the naughty boy mr whreabo said the grandmother and she started across the lawn

whreabo took the struggling johnnie in his arms and carrying him screaming and kicking followed the elder mrs dale into the house

the mother so soon as she was alone rested her head against the back of her chair and with closed eyes indulged in daydreams that evidently pleased her for more than once she sighed happily and smiled and while she was thus lost in a world of fancy dale now a major entered by the garden gate he stole across to her halted behind her chair and placed his hands softly over her eyes

 guess who and ill give you a whole cent  cried he

the wife knew the hands that were touching her also the voice and she smiled contentedly

 a cruel monster  cried she

 bullseye at the very first shot  said he laughing and removing his hands from before her eyes placing himself in the chair lately occupied by his mother he went on  congratulate me dear its all right

 have you succeeded  asked she eagerly

yes hands down theyve given me five years leave with permission to go abroad and mr calvert has promised to furnish the cash to carry on the work

 i am very glad of course but do you think your plan to develop the agricultural resources of liberia will be operated successfully 

 i certainly do said dale confidently

 i hope the liberians will appreciate what you may do for them

 the socalled leaders who now fatten on the state doubtless will wish me further but the majority of the people will rejoice anyhow if i succeed the country will be saved from being absorbed by some european power and that will be something gained

 i hope so but mr calvertâ did he make any difficulty about letting you have the money  

 at first he seemed somewhat reluctant but when lupeltaâ i should say miss calvertâ turned her powers of persuasion on him he consented like a shot  paul said the wife after a brief pause  if lupelta had been a colored girl you would not have â  providence has blessed me in a wonderful fashion dear broke in dale

 has blessed me too said hulda in a voice tender with emotion

dale gave a quick glance about perceiving that no eyes were upon them he bent forward and kissed her

father must speak to baby before he goes to sleep said hulda  come dear 

they arose and handinhand moved contentedly toward the house
