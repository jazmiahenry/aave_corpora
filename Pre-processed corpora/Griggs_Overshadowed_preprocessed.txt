if you have time and inclination for such a recitalâthe curtain rises and the play begins

toandfro toandfro with hurried restless tread erma wysong walked her parlor floor forgetful of the young man who sat in a corner and gazed at her with all of his powers of sight apparently doing double duty her hair slightly coarse of thread glistening as if in pride of its extreme blackness was combed away from a brow that was exceedingly pretty and formed a part of a head that forewarned you to expect the possessor thereof to have an intellect of a very high order a few unruly locks of her glossy hair had escaped from the grasp confining the others backward and were hanging forward as if to peep into her tender brown eyes so full of soul or to tantalize a very prettily formed nose  or to tempt a bite from a row of pearls even and gleamingly white  or to nestle upon a cheek the tenderness and ruddiness of which were standing invitations for gentle pressure

erma nearly tall a happy medium between the plump and the lithe the perfection of symmetry her whole frame a series of divinely fashioned curves paced to and fro her beautiful face wearing a look of mental perplexity first her right hand and then her left tossed back with a nervous jerk the straying locks

astral herndon a tall and exceedingly handsome young man who was paying her a call sat in an armchair in a corner of the small room and with body bent forward was looking intently at erma as has been stated his entire soul ablaze with curiosity to know what had so operated upon the mind of the erstwhile winsome laughing merry erma as to cause her to break off abruptly an ordinary conversation and begin her restless journeyings toandfro across her parlor floor vouchsafing to him not a word of apology or explanation and apparently oblivious of his presence the transition from the lively gay to the deathly sad was so quick so queer so utterly inconsistent with all that he had hitherto known of ermaâit was so far from anything warranted by the rather commonplace conversation in which they had been engaged that he was very naturally in the depths of wonderland staring with all his might he saw her thin red lips quiver as if with deep emotion he saw repressed by a wouldbe secret bite of the lips an entire flood of tears save a truant one that would steal its way down anyhow he saw a clasping a griping of the hands as though the fair one was being hurried to the verge of despair he could as it were trace in her actions the progress that her mind was making toward a precipice reluctant to go and yet impelled by some irresistible force

astral herndon sat watching her his surprise and curiosity deepening into concern and anxiety at length when he could bearitno longer he arose and said in a low sweet voice that trembled with emotion erma something in his voice went straight to ermas wandering soul and as though not of herself she turned slowly around and mechanically lifted her gaze to meet the dark glowing eyes of astral herndon she felt her soul leave her with a rush and run to embrace a mate that was coming forth from the eyes before her and she cried oh  i see  oh  i see  oh  i see  and unconsciously stretched out her arms toward astral as if to receive him astral advanced toward erma but this movement on his part broke the spell and she shrank away from him and sat down

astral was now more mystified than ever he vaguely felt that somehow he was intermingled with ermas thoughts but as to how it had come about or as to what was the nature of her thoughts regarding him he was in absolute ignorance erma now fully conscious of how she had been acting vainly sought to redeem herself by an endeavor to conduct an animated conversation not offering however to astral any explanation of her seeming rudeness to him but after a heroic struggle to keep up the conversation she blurted out all of a sudden  mr herndon do you not can you not see that i am in the deepest sort of trouble  why do you not get up and go home  saying this she fell to sobbing violently burying her face in her hands astral arose and got his hat and went on tiptoe to the door just before he went out he cast a look of deepest love at the weeping girl if he had only gone to her and lifted her to a resting place on his bosomâbut the unseen power that ordains that two souls shall journey through earth together also chooses it would seem the hallowed spot chooses the precious and never to be forgotten moment when soul is unveiled to soul chooses the exact degree of the development that shall exist in each at the hour of the mating

so the unseen sent astral forth and not to ermas side as he stepped out upon the doorstep the queen of the night wrapped his noble brow with her silver cords in wanton playfulness the city clock was striking the hour of ten rather dolefully he thought he slowly wended his way toward his home stopping ever and anon to cast a look of love mingled with perplexity in the direction of ermas residence strange sweet girl he murmured softly to himself  i thought that i knew her time and again he stopped and looking in her direction repeated this monologue at last he reached home and throughout the sleepless night uttered the selfsame words

as for erma she sat in the exact attitude in which he left her the hours of the night aided by the light of the moon groped their way through a sleeping world at length the birds ere they went forth in quest of their daily bread held their morning praise service as if to rebuke the prayerless man from their little hearts and throats quivering with joyous emotions they told the god of the sparrow how glad they were that they were yet allowed to flit about in his glorious world the sun remembering his many unfinished tasks of the previous day and suspicious ever of the work of the night came bolting upward and hurled his myriad pointed spear to strike down the morning mists that sulkily obscured his vision the awakened world came rushing forth from the land of sleep and dream

but erma beautiful morning glory bruised over night and failing to respond to the greeting kiss of the returning sun began the performance of her duties perplexed in mind sad at heart weary from much thinking desponding of a solution of the problems that fretted her spirit

the scene of the opening of our story was richmond va the far famed capital of the illfated southern confederacy to all intents and purposes erma wysong was an orphan her mother a negro woman was now dead having passed away two years since though her parents had been silent on the subject erma now knew from the color of her skin and the texture of her hair that her father must have been white as to who he was or where he was whether living or dead she did not know and had no means of ascertaining a few years after ermas birth her mother married a very worthy negro man who generously overlooked the previous sin of his wife never once in all their wedded life alluding to it upon a foundation of repentance and forgiveness this negro family like unto many others had its beginning unto this repentant wife and forgiving husband a son was born whom they named john this son now about eighteen years of age is the only support left to erma her stepfather having gone to his grave shortly after the demise of his wife so erma was practically an orphan girl alone in the world relying for support and protection upon her brother john who dearly loved his erm as he called her he was working at the machinists trade in the bilgal iron works of richmond va and was receiving two dollars and a half per day  and with this was supporting himself and sister and laying by money to lift the remainder of the mortgage encumbering their modest little home erma was a student of exceptional brightness when in school and had been graduated at an early age from the richmond colored high school carrying off the highest honors of her class after graduating from the high school at richmond she went to the tuskegee industrial institute at tuskegee alabama whence she was recalled by the death of her mother you now have her history briefly told up to the time of the opening of our story

astral herndon had been a schoolmate of hers in the richmond public schools graduating in the class immediately preceding her class these two had from childhood a fondness for the society of each other though for a long time neither astral nor erma stopped to analyze this feeling astral was the first to awake to the real situation as it concerned himself and in his shy untutored way had sought to arouse in erma emotions similar to his own  but she did not understand life as yet for a knowledge of love is a knowledge of life and astral remained the same  astry  to her

astral finally decided that his constant association with erma ever since childhood was a bar to his progress toward winning her love and he had decided to go away and spend a number of years in school free from ermas notice he had determined to obtain a thorough college education and return to woo as a comparative stranger the heart of erma in the midst of an ordinary conversation he had mentioned to erma his proposed going away and the rude shock had awakened the sleeping love of her heart not knowing the meaning of that strange fire in her bosom she leaped to her feet and began her restless journeying with which we found her engaged in our opening chapter her mind kept saying  astral going away  he will be a college graduate  he will be a learned man he will be far above me when he comes back  he may not come back at all  but what difference does it all make to me over and over she revolved these thoughts in her mind her perplexity growing deeper and deeper and her heart aching more and more when astral called her and she looked into his eyes she stood revealed to herself her love had broken its chrysalis  but what of astral  does he love me  she asked herself and shrank away from him instinctively she did not wish for him to come to her again as the astral of old her soul craving for solitude to contemplate its new found joy and fearful of giving its precious secret away too soon she dismissed astral when he was gone cupid went busily to work in her mind weaving a web every cord of which was a string from her heartâa web to catch and hold fast her souls one mate these things were certain astral was going away would advance in studies would occupy a more exalted station in life than she it was her task to maintain an equality of station between them  how she was to do it was the great question she being a moneyless orphan but having discovered the full extent that her very existence was wrapped up in astral she was determined to surmount all obstacles of whatever natureâdetermined to find a way to keep pace with him in training to prepare ever for companionship with him to hold herself through all the years of waiting pure noble undefiled a worthy queen for her glorious kingâher astral

she knew that she would never openly seek his love never knowingly reveal her passion  but love ever feels that he has the right of way through the earth  that all things will move at his beck and call  and erma firmly trusted this subtle might of love to accompany astral on his long journey and doubted not but that it would bring him back to her

satisfied on that score erma undertook the task of selfimprovement poor poor girl  could she have caught sight of the large the cruel the unfeeling thorns in her pathway  could she have felt for a brief instant but a small fraction of the mountainlike burden ordained for her shoulders  could she have but dipped her tongue into the bitter gall poured out for her  could she have but dreamed of the nameless sorrows that were to plow wide furrows in her stormswept and tempestdriven soul how she would have trembled and shivered and groaned at the awful prospect before her yet being a woman and being in love she would have gone forth just the same foreseeing all wonder not that god refused to make woman out of dust

if you can so master your feelings as to be a spectator to a fight between a poor beautiful motherless negro maiden and an array of foes that would warrant michael in sending for reinforcements before giving battle we can safely ask you to follow our narrative

two giants clad in the full panoply of war have met and are battling with each other for a kingdom the struggle while fierce fast and furious is conducted with infinite wariness on the part of each combatant for previous battles between these foemen fought with varying successes in every clime of earth have taught them to respect the skill and prowess of each other

the domain for which these two giants are battling is the mind of a young white man of high social standing a member of a family of great renown the name of one giant is love of self and of the other love of others or egoism and altruism respectively the battle has been raging for many months and is now entering upon its final stages

the door of the young mans room is locked the window shutters closed the curtains drawn he is sitting in a chair in a sprawling attitude his chin resting upon his bosom his hat pulled low over his brow his eyes closed his hands clasped behind his head a pained expression upon his handsome face one hand slowly descends to his vest pocket from which he extracts a richly bejewelled watch

 only nine oclock the night is young yet three full hours more of this agony  then i must act well let me employ the intervening time in a full review of the case

so saying he began the following soliloquy beauty of face of form of mind when found in woman exact homage of all men that woman whose peculiar combination of the attributes of loveliness pleases a mans inherent taste in a manner such as no other canâthat woman becomes his queen

i have met the queen of my heart but i dare not breathe her name into mortal ear  i dare not i dare not it is not because i think her charms open to debate that i thus guard her name no no no  none can gainsay those eyes so full of soul  none that grace of carriage none that beautiful form granted by mother nature in a moment of unwonted happiness but she is only onehalf caucasian 

 that does not grate so harshly on my ear  i find it in my heart to ignore that fact altogether so i do sol do if left to myselfânow let only god my creator hear what i have to sayâif left to myself i would marry that girl and count myself highly favored of heaven for the privilege

but society tells me i shall not marry her  on what do they base their objections not i am sure upon the emotions of this tumultuous heart of mine for every heart throb is a cry of love why then may i not claim her for my own for the benefit of the species they say we must preserve our racial identity there must be no mesalliance our own glory the cause of civilization the good of the world demands that anglosaxon blood be not contaminated with the blood of inferior races this is the social dictum do you see how that i the individual am left out of that programme the individual then is to have no consideration i suppose i have only the one life tragic in its brevity beset with many ills at best and yet the philosophers and ethical writers crowd about me and tell me in insistent tones that i am to surrender the best part of that life for the sake of the species

well might tennyson in the night of his sorrow sing   are god and nature then at strife that nature lends such evil dreams

so careful of the type she seems so careless of the single life  society i yield to your mandates i will not ask you to sanction through legal forms that which would be for my individual good but would you say result in your injury i will not marry the girl 

thus far society seems to have won altruism seems to have triumphed over egoism but not so  egoism returns to the struggle the young man resumes his soliloquy

is society sincere in its demand there are in the united states nearly two million peopleâmulattoes begotten contrary to the written code there must be an unwritten code that permits individuals to ignore the demands of society and mate according to choice shall i avail myself of the provisions of this unwritten code  shall i or shall i not  shall i ask that pure girl to go counter to the requirements of all civilized communities and enter a union devoid of legal sanction shall i or shall i not  shall i or shall i not   over and over the young man asks himself the question at last he cries out these interminable codes and counter codes  to the deuce with them all erma shall be mine   so saying he sprang to his feet egoism in triumph altruism put to inglorious rout

he glances at his watch arranges his toilet secures a mask with which he covers his face steals forth from the home of his parents as the hands on the clock are nearing the hour of midnight choosing dark and less frequented streets and alleyways he proceeded on his journey arriving at length at a very handsome twostory brick building he looks about him with quick hurried glances and then gives a slight knock thrice repeated in rapid succession he is evidently expected as the door opens at once and he is ushered into a long dark hallway thence he is led into a large parlor in the far end of which a gas jet is dimly burning giving a weird ghostly appearance to everything the woman who had opened the door for him bade him to be seated she taking a seat at some distance from him

the woman in question was a negro brown of skin with a fat round face small eyes very corpulent and short of stature

the young man begins  mrs smith dolly smith is her name you have been highly recommended to me as a party fully capable of attending to delicate matters

 many thanks to my unknown sponsor remarked dolly smith her little eyes accustomed to the dark making a close scrutiny of the young mans features he having removed his mask in the belief that the darkness of the room would suffice to conceal his identity

the young man continued  you will understand of course that our relations are confidential and whatever is done is to be without prejudice to the good name of any one concerned

 pardon the uncouthness of the remark but please bear in mind that i am no butcher reputations that could not stand a whiff of the air of suspicion have been entrusted to my care and neither my skill nor integrity in preserving them have ever been called into question remember too if you please that i am a woman of standing in my own race and it is of great personal interest to me to be discreet in all my doings was dolly smiths spirited rejoinder

it pleases me much mrs smith to hear you discourse thus the affair which i wish for you to conduct for me concerns a young woman of high standing in your race and i do not desire that any understanding which she and i may reach shall affect her status with her own people added the young man

 have no fear on that score a number of girls in this very city are even now leading the double life to which i presume you to be referring owing to the fact that the social life of the two races is distinct you may be the lowest strata in the one and the very highest in the other without so much as occasioning a suspicion if there be no objection on your part i should be pleased to have you state specifically what brings me the favor of your visit

thank you for the hint to come to the point i desire that you be of service to me in forming the acquaintance of one erma wysong

a look of pain passed over the sensual features of dolly smith and her hands clutched her chair convulsively her lips breathed a soft exclamation  my god the darkness of the room prevented the young mans detecting these signs of excitement

in a voice that trembled slightly with suppressed emotion dolly smith enquired  how far have you proceeded in the matter yourself

the young man thought that he detected a faint note of anxiety in the question but it was not sufficiently pronounced to make a distinct impression he answered  oh i have not so much as spoken to the girl in company with a number of other white people i attended the exercises of the high school on the evening of her graduation on that occasion dressed in a snowy white garment her hair tastefully decorated with a few choice roses she sang liks a nightingale and read a graduating essay that revealed a mind of singular beauty culture and strength yet possessed of that distinct charm which man associates with woman from that hour i have been her slave though no one save myself has known it the time that has elapsed since her graduation i have spent in earnest combat against the powerful current that has been bearing me upon its bosom to an unknown port you may judge the strength of my attachment

this speech had a reassuring effect on dolly she thought within herself i will get his money and save erma as well if i have to choose between money and erma i pity poor erma the integrity of negro girls stands but a poor chance for life in the presence of such wolves as myself but heaven forfend that i be reduced to such a choice for money i must have money i must have  for my enemy nears his grave unscathed by my revenge such were the inward reflection of dolly smith

to the young man dolly replied  i suppose you know that the inveiglement of a girl of ermas stamp requires time patient and skillful handling and often much expense the last two words being pronounced with considerable emphasis

mark anthony surrendered a throne for voluptuous cleopatra surely virtous erma is entitled to the small pittance of a few thousands if there be need

dolly smith could scarcely refrain from bounding from her seat as a result of uncontrollable joy produced by the speech of the young man whom she now set apart in her heart as her gold mine to be thoroughly exploited

the young man arose and approached dolly smith handing to her a one hundred dollar note saying as he did so  this is but an earnest of my good intentions toward you do me faithful service and you shall be happy you shall know me as elbridge noral address me at p o box  i trust that you will have pleasant news for me soon

 rely upon me to do my best mr noral mr noral as we shall call him until better informed now left the parlor followed by dolly she opens the street door and mr noral goes forth from the house where he has formed the first unholy alliance of his life when the door was closed on his retreating form dolly smith threw the one hundred dollar note upon the floor and danced around it a gay voluptuous dance

 there there i am forgetting myself   so saying she darted into a secret closet in the side of the hallway quickly stuffed herself into a large pair of pants put on a vest and a coat seized a large hat and plunged into the street to follow noral the arrangements of the streets in that neighborhood furnished but one outlet from dollys house for some distance so dolly had no trouble in pursuing him though very corpulent dolly was strong and active and by alternately walking and trotting puffing and blowing she soon came in sight of noral whom she followed at a safe distance he and she both keeping as much as possible in the dark noral took such a course as led him by erma wysongs little home here he paused and gazed long and lovingly at the little cottage in which erma lay dreaming of astral dolly was an interested spectator of this night scene which noral supposed to be enacted only in the sight of the silent stars sympathizing angels and an allwise creator even the callous heart of dolly smith was momentarily touched and she muttered to herself   poor fellow  it is indeed a tragedy of the soul that that young fellow is denied all honorable approach to that girl and must resort to me vile woman ha ha dolly smith the trusted emissary of a love in its original form as pure as any that ever took root in the human heart  tut tut a few more ennobling reflections and i would be a good woman which thing is manifestly an impossibility

noral moved on reached the fashionable part of the city and to dollys utter amazement entered the home of occupants well known to her she recalled the features of her visitor and said i might have known it i might have known it  have i struck the right trail at last if i have oh satan prince of evil i crave your help knitting her brows she shookher clinched fist in rage at the house into which the young man had gone having done this to her satisfaction she started home at a rapid pace arriving there in an exhausted condition as soon as she was sufficiently recovered from her exhaustion to permit it she danced a wild joyous sort of dance uttering a succession of savage like shrieks of delight

sleep the tender nurse in the employ of nature soon folded dolly smith in her arms and lulled her to rest as soothingly as she did the innocent girl erma who now became the storm center of the elements let us not find fault with nature because she will not become a party to these human strifes of ours she but follows the behests of the great unknown whose ways are past finding out

ellen ellen oh ellen  ellen sanders  ellen sanders a belle in negro society had just sat down to partake of a  a m breakfast when she heard this call she arose hastily and rushed to the diningroom door that opened into the yard and saw margaret marston another negro society belle leaning over the fence that separated her home from that of ellen margaret was holding a newspaper in one band one arm being thrown over the paling to hold her up as she was standing with her feet upon the lower railing to which the palings were nailed the look of her eye the appearance of her face the shaking newspaper and her almost hysterical shrieks for ellen all betokened a high degree of excitement

 pray margaret  what on earth can be the matter why you frightened me nearly to death girl what on earth is it  

ellen do just come here there is something in this paper that is just too awful for anything

let me see it said ellen running to where margaret stood  is somebody dead   she asked in anxious tones

 worse than that said margaret

i dont see anything margaret said ellen scanning the paper with the haste born of eagerness and excitement

look up there at the top of the column headed  situations wanted at the very first advertisement oh ellen it is just dreadful said margaret as though her heart was about to break

ellen read the piece pointed out to her the paper fell from her hand and without saying a word she staggered backwards until she reached the porch to the dining room from which she had come she dropped down upon the floor of the porch in a sitting posture as though what she had read had robbed her of all strength and had shattered her nervous system finally drawing a long breath she said  well well well did you ever but i always did tell you that erma wysong would come to some bad end and just think  you used to like her so well too

 yes i did ellen but i am done now just think she was the head of our class when we were graduated at the high school and thus she brings disgrace upon our entire class

ah me  it is just too dreadful to think about it has actually made me sick i really fear that i shall have to go to bed from the shock remarked margaret

 i dont feel like eating another mouthful of breakfast said ellen  but it may be that it is not our erma she continued

yes but it is  dont you see that the advertisement refers you to her street number and all replied margaret

 well all that i can say is she is disgraced forever  and as for my part i dont purpose to ever speak to her again  

 speak to her  of course not  if we recognize her that will make us as bad as she isâ particefts criminis the latins would say i just wish i could see her so that i could pass her and turn away my head without speaking i could go five miles out of my way just to catch her eye and then look away from her in disdain said margaret

have you told your mamma queried ellen

no said margaret  give me the paper i had forgotten that 

ellen arose walked to the paper picked it up from the ground and handed it over the fence margaret took it and hurried around the house to the place where her mother was

as fast as she goes let us precede her there and find out what we can of mrs marston it is now about eleven oclock in the day and mrs mollie marston margarets mother is standing before a washtub with huge piles of dirty clothes all about her a piece of white cloth is tied about her head  her sleeves are pushed beyond her elbows and she is wearily rubbing away at the clothes a settled look of pain being upon her fast wrinkling face she is now fiftyfive years of age and her whole lifeâboth the part that lies in the time of slavery and the part that has come afterwardsâher whole life has been one long day of toil with no prospect of a sunset and an hour of rest before the coming of the eternal sleep by taking in washing from wealthy white people she had aided her husband in his attempts to own a little home when margaret was old enough to go to school she had sent her and had managed to keep her there well clad and supplied with books only by the hardest sort of toil before day dawned on a monday morning and while night yet frowned his blackest on saturday night she was found either at the washtub or ironing board striving to make her pints meet she had denied herself all ornamentation and pleasures of whatever sort involving the expenditure of money the barest necessities of life were all that she allowed herself thus we find her at work when margaret rushes around and says  mamma mamma let me read something to you in the morning paper mrs marston straightened up as though the effort gave her pain  she had been bending over the tub in one position so long with a smile of admiration on her face she turned toward margaret and prepared to listen margaret knowing her mothers pride in her accomplishments cleared her throat in order to read in her most pleasing and effective voice the statement that had so horrified her and her classmate  situations wantedfemale help

 a young negro woman erma wysong desires a position as cook washerwoman nurse or housemaid in a white family the best of references address  svlvanus street

now mamma did you ever think that of erma wysong  after her poor mamma and papa both of whom are now dead worked so hard to educate her she is going to throw that education away in the washtub in the kitchen or rolling some white womans baby about if her dead mother only knew how erma was about to disgrace her education she could not rest easy in her grave of course there is no other kind of work open for her to do just now but if she had only held herself up for two or three years she might have gotten a school to teach when some of the other teachers died or got married but as it is she has just gone and ruined herself forever well mamma i promise you faithfully that while you are alive and after you are dead ill starve before i bring disgrace upon the education which you and papa have worked so hard to give me ill never throw my education away by bending over a washtub or by moving about in a white mans kitchen no indeed  depend upon that mammayou dear kind mammasaid margaret with many an emphatic toss of her head she gave her mamma a resounding kiss and leaving the much overburdened woman in the midst of huge piles of clothes she went to renew her gossip with ellen

 what does your mamma think of it margaret asked ellen

oh mamma was just so struck that she could not say a word it is just dreadful why it will have a tendency to stop parents from educating their children if they are to act like that remarked margaret

 yes joined in ellen  and it might make some of our weakminded parents think that we educated girls ought to cook and wash clothes and scrub floors at home

 that would be too horrid why we would then be no higher in life than our slave time mothers who did such work white girls occupying the social station in their race that we do in our race would suffer themselves to be carried out of their homes dead before they would perform such menial tasks and ellen we must hold up our race just as they do their race why just think if we educated girls go to work it can be truthfully said that our race has no firstclass society

 margaret the more i think of what erma has done the worse i feel let us go out and tell all the other educated girls about it before any of them chance to meet erma and speak to her as cordially as ever she is the first negro girl that has disgraced her education by offering to go to work and we must all pounce down upon her so fast and hard that she will be the last all of our set must snub her right and left it may bring her to her senses too

 that is a capital idea ellen  let us get ready at once

so saying they went to their respective rooms dressed themselves in the finest articles of wear in their wardrobes and sallied forth to spread everywhere the news of the disgrace as they termed it of their classmate

as mrs marston said nothing to margaret let us not follow these girls in their crusade but rather let us linger to catch a glimpse of her simple but honest mind and heart as soon as margaret had gone the dear old woman prematurely aged by excessively hard toiling stopped work took up her pipe and sat down to smoke as was her wont whenever she had a knotty problem to solve erma wysongs case was troubling her exceedingly for she had been a favorite girl with her on her way from school erma would always stop in to see dear aunt mollie  and have a gay chat thus she had learned to love her as erma grew older her modest ladylike bearing the more deeply impressed mrs marston who sought in every way to cement the tie of friendship between her daughter and erma knowing that continued association with her was a decided gain for margaret in all of ermas life mrs marston had never known her to be guilty of a wrong or indiscreet act and we put it mildly when we say that she was shocked over the news just imparted to her concerning erma as the advertisement was just out she felt sure that she could find erma yet at home and might after all succeed in preventing her from taking the contemplated step so fatal to her standing in siety with such thoughts coursing through her mind she took the white rag from her head pulled down her sleeves put on a stiff white apron and a broad brimmed straw hat and went forth to save erma

heroic soul perhaps no monument will ever be reared to those noble negro women who emerging from slavery were at once enslaved again by their children and bore their heavy burdens uncomplainingly in a vain attempt to build up upon their poor bruised shoulders an aristocracy such as they had left behind their educated children to be the aristocrats their like will hardly be seen on earth again 

mrs marston on reaching ermas home found her singing gaily and moving about the room dusting and setting things aright erma received her so joyfully that she felt a lump rise in her throat each time she attempted to state the purpose of her visit at length she said miss erm whut erbout all dis awfil news gwine round bout you   ermas smile died away suddenly her breath came quick and fast and she began to tremble all over she said in tones that showed great anxiety  i have not heard any bad news about myself mrs marston what can it be  thar now  i had my doubts bout it frum de fust wyde pore chile doan no nuthin bout it poured forth mrs marston

erma felt a chill creeping over her frame she was so full of fear as to the nature of the charge against her some children that have not been burned dread the fire if the charge involved anything sinful she knew beforehand that she was innocent but it was a terror to her pure soul to have to even contemplate the passing within the limits of the shadow of wrong she awaited mrs marstons further utterances with a nervous twitching of her thin beautiful lips

in trembling tones erma said but mrs marston you have not told me what was being said against me

aint i laws a mussy on my furgitful soul skuse me i hes bin studin so powerfil hard wal miss erm dey tole meâ min you i aint said whut deyâdey tole me you wus gwine ter hire out ter white folks ter scrub an wash an ine an nuss babies an do all sich disgracefil tings for an edicated siety lady

is that the crime that is alleged against me asked erma drawing a good long breath after her prolonged suspense

i doan know bout bein legged agin you whutsomever dat mout be but dey is sayin dat whut i hez tole you is so and dey is sayin it powerfil strong an dat is zactly whut brung me here fir ter see you

with a joyful laugh erma sprang over to mrs marston and well nigh smothered her with an avalanche of kisses sitting on one of mrs marstons knees with an arm thrown fondly about her neck erma spoke as follows  my dear aunt mol lie because our race has borrowed the white mans language manner of dress religion ideas of home philosphy of life we have apparently decided that everything that the white man does is good for us to imitate we do not stop to think that the white race has deep ingrained faults as a race  and thus we proceed to imitate faults and virtues alike indiscriminately and instinctively we unhesitatingly adopt even those erroneous traits in the white mans character that have oppressed us now aunt mollie one of the most baneful evils that slavery has left us is the idea that physical labor is a badge of disgrace and that a condition of luxurious idleness is the most exalted the most honorable the ideal existence the southern white people are the parents of the idea that physical labor is disgraceful and being such an imitative people we have accepted without questiontheir standard of what is honorable aunt mollie the insidious influence of that idea is what makes the rising generation of negro youths so idle and so averse to physical labor they are imitating the wealthy young white man who cites the fact that he does not have to work as proof positive that he is a gentleman the young negro decides that he can and must be a gentleman like the young white man this idea that work is disgraceful is destined to ruin thousands of negro girls who are going to try to play  lady  and abstain from employment no no aunt mollie labor is not in the least degree degrading even if the white people do seem to think so believe me aunty there is no disgrace connected with the doing of any work that is honest work hard hard work has not stained your soul dear aunt mollie you are as much a true woman as any queen as much a lady as that woman who has never deigned to stoop to tie her own shoe

mrs marston shook her head as though ermas way of looking at things was beyond her comprehension

but erma continued coming nearer home in her argument   if margaret were to take her place by your side day by day and do what you do it would not corrupt her soul any more than it has corrupted yours and so long as the soul is pure god loves you and who dares despise what god loves  god loves an honest heart even when the frame that contains it is bending over the washtub it would be so grand aunt mollie if you could get margaret out of that false notion of life borrowed from white people in the south she would be so much help to your overburdened frame i could scarcely repress my tears as you told me how you an aged feeble woman labored so hard for that young strong and vigorous girl to sustain her in a false notion of life yes yes mrs marston l am going to hire out there is a little mortgage on our home that must be paid then too i wish to earn money enough to enable me to finish my education these ends being honorable and desirable i am willing to perform any task that is honorable though menial to attain them now aunt mollie i have an engagement at four oclock and must leave you pray for me for i shall be most viciously assailed by my own people who feel that the stand they take against me has a parallel in the white race where the common laborer is shut out from social recognition by the welltodo element and you know how hard a negro will throw a stone at another if he feels that he has the sanction of the white people nevertheless i shall strive in my humble way to prove that labor is not inimical to ladyhood

 pray for you  god bless yer pew soul  dat i will erm dat i will said aunt mollie brushing away with her horny hands the tears from her eyes she continued disgrace or no disgrace dere is powerfil few lack you erm powerfil few ef you eber needs a home come to your aunt mollie marstons good day so long chile god bless you

mrs marston walked homeward musing over ermas sayings  wal i hez notused dat dem northun wimmin es cums doun here doos wuck i specks dese suverners hes got us blevin wrong ter tink dat a washtub spiles yer ladyship mebbe arter all i hez been a lady anddidunt know it all dis whiul been cheated outen my standing in life foolin arter dese suverners  i declar it begins ter peer ter me dat erm is right do i fess i didunt ketch on ter all de pints in her argifikashun one pint she made prest me powerfil much it mout not hhrt margie so much ef she would help her ole mammy er bit it is gitting hard fir me ter liff and tote dem big tujbs like i hez ter do fir dey shuah air heavy i uster help my mammy ter liff hern margie mout do a little ub de cookin and inin and let her pore mammy rest some i hez been wuckin so hard all my days and i hez nebber had no rest but i aint here fir much longer frum de way my rheumatis feels jesus will be callin me soon thinking thus she went back to her work as she labored the sweet face and tender brown eyes of erma were peeping up through the soapsuds and the sight thereof made her happy and her task the lighter strange to say and perhaps not strange after all her mind did not once go out to her own daughter who in company with ellen sanders was stirring up the entire city against an orphan girl whose only offense was that she had decided to obey the bible injunction to labor six days in the week

we are within the folds of night and elbridge noral is once more a visitor at the home of dolly smith we have the same dimly lighted room and the same parties to the conversation

mrs smith began noral very excitedly i come to ask you in the name of heaven to prevent a catastrophe and to unravel a puzzle that racks my brain i wish for you to prevent erma wysong from becoming a servant girl and i further beg of you to tell me why she seeks to become one

explain mr noral wherein becoming a servant girl is such a catastrophe is not work honorable asked dolly in evident astonishment

 yes yes but ah  the atmosphere surrounding the negro service girl  she is away from her own people not allowed social contact with the family of her employer and usually resides in solitude in a little house in the back yard with alleyways as the only approach such a state of affairs puts a premium on male companionship which may be ever so frequent or at improper hours without the fear of any adverse comment thereon and in fact without its being known this condition of things as might reasonably be expected generates a great deal of immorality while there are service girls of sterling worth a bad odor attaches to the calling if erma goes into service in such fashion the very atmosphere will breed insults for her white youths will feel that she has no further claims to respectability and will proceed to deal with her accordingly so much for the catastrophe the puzzling thing to me is as to why erma should contemplate such a course these remarks were delivered by noral with unwonted energy

well mr noral erma simply needs money i presume to supply her natural wants and satisfy reasonable and legitimate desire such stations as her talents peculiarly fit her for are denied to her because she is a negro girl there is no honorable course open to her save the one that she has pursued away goes the puzzle as to the catastrophe mr noral opinions may differ according to the view point i fancy that i see in her determination to enter service the surest means to the accomplishment of your purpose

norals face betokened a wrathful storm  his voice gave sign of its coming

mrs smith do i understand you to intimate that i am such a sensual degenerate that i am willing to see erma degraded by others as a sort of preparation for me  

 be calm mr noral my meaning was far from that as you will soon discover my plan of action is as follows  now that erma is determined to enter service you select a place where you may become a frequent visitor and can contrive to see erma without exciting her suspicionsas to your ultimate purposes erma is one of the purest girls in the world and you must first establish yourself in her good graces as a necessary prelude to my part of the work if you can inspire regard i will give the necessary downward turn

 a capital idea dolly a capital idea  now let me see where erma might go

how about mrs turner who lives adjoining you  

 what  said noral rising to his feet hurriedly where do i live who told you where i lived he said retreating from dolly as he spoke and adjusting his mask to his face dolly saw at once that she had committed a monstrous error and was much perplexed for a moment as to how to extricate herself

 to tell you the truth mr noral i have known who you were from the very first

 known me from the first  have you had spies tracking me you she devil 

she devil heh  she devil hissed dolly smith in a tone that was full of venom her head shaking with violent emotion she walked up to noral and said  she devil did you say but who made me a she devil  who destroyed my soul  who first started me on the damnable mission of polluting the entire stream of the virtue of my race  who did this  will you tell me  say will you tell me  oh you dont know do you  well you shall know james benson dawson  yes you shall know  

lawsons anger disappeared in his surprise at the torrent of invective that dolly smith poured upon him he answered not a word but stood with folded arms looking at dolly smith he discovered that he had a tigress to deal with and that at the bottom of the heart of this coldblooded callous schemer there were fires as hot as those of the reputed lower regions and it did not take much fanning to cause them to blaze up then too her remarks seemed to have been intended for him individually and were not mere ravings against the world at large the more he thought the more puzzled he was dolly smith after this violent outburst grew very calm and inwardly chided herself for having allowed her temper to perhaps frighten away from her hook a fish on whose capture all the soul that she had was set she summoned all of her adroitness and cunning in an endeavor to regain lost ground pushing open the folding doors and disappearing in the adjoining room she returned shortly bearing in her hand a photograph she brought it to lawson and said here is the spy that tracked you go look at it lawson took it to the gaslight and turning on the light examined the picture

 you see that it is a picture of your father as governor of this state he was more popular with the colored people than any other governor before or since his time true he is a democrat but the colored people love him and his picture is in almost every negro home as soon as i saw you the other night though the room was dark i recognized the likeness i knew where you lived as the papers have been printing pictures of the old lawson mansion as it has been repaired to receive your father just returned from his post as minister to germany now that is the sort of spying i have done dont mistrust me mr lawson your honor is safe in my hands i hold some of the most terrible secrets of your most noted families in this city and they are as safe with me as though they were in the grave locked in the bosom of the dead

dolly smith eyed lawson keenly as she talked trying to discern the impression that her words were making she saw that she had not succeeded in reaching the main current of his thoughts and she planned another effort

 the vigor of my remarks a while ago naturally astonished you well i was once a pure girl and not wholly uneducated nor was i homely either this corpulence has come from drinking excessively well a white woman encompassed my fall she taught me to drink she was such a great white lady i thought that if she could drink i could do so as well i got drunk in public and was forever disgraced she got drunk frequently but the newspapers always said that she fainted or was attacked with nervous prostration her wealth allows her to maintain her social standing among her people while i am an outcast among mine she started me in this business i hate her though i confess i get a great deal of fun excitement and money out of my profession i know i am a she devil but when one calls me that i get angry from thinking of that woman all of this occurred when i lived in another city my previous history is unknown here

lawson was profoundly interested in dolly smiths recital he had not dreamed that a woman so depraved ever allowed her mind to wander back to the days of purity in fact he did not conceive of her ever having had such days thus with these adroitly constructed fabrications she lulled lawsons suspicions to sleep

dolly smith i beg your pardon dont you know i always supposed people of your type were born destitute of moral nature but i begin to believe that humanity at its worst is not as bad as it seems

dolly smith now saw that she had recaptured him

 all right dolly quarrelling aside lets get down to business let me see where were we says noral

 my idea is that some way ought to be found to have erma wysong in the employ of mrs turner your next door neighbor she has no male member in her family put in dolly

â yes but she has a servant replied lawson

 and you have money the servant went there for money and will come away for money pay her a few months wages in advance ask her to get erma wysong and take her to mrs turners to fill her place and the work is done said dolly

 oh you are a daisy said lawson and in his excess of joy at the prospective success of his scheme he seized dolly smith about the waist and kissed her that kiss awakened every demon in dollys nature it took her mind back to the days when the blue of her sky was interwoven with the blackest of clouds and the lightnings of trouble flashed forth therefrom ripping open her every vein and spilling beyond recall all the blood of her life and she pledged in her soul shaking like a decayed and tottering building in the grasp of the wind to crush james benson lawson in her fall

erma wysong was now happily located at mrs turners little dreaming innocent soul of the motives and midnight plottings that had brought her there ignorant of all this she was giving god thanks for having secured for her such an ideal place of service in this happy joyous lighthearted frame of mind she clads herself in her most lovely apparel on the sabbath and goes forth to church while she is on her way there let us acquaint ourselves with the preparations made to receive her

the fact that erma wysong a graduate of the high school had entered service shocked the negro population of the city educated members of the race the school teachers the doctors the lawyers and the recent girl graduates were simply enraged ellen sanders and margaret marston had canvassed the whole city and had persuaded the entire circle of educated colored persons in the city to come out to ermas church to aid them in giving her such a snubbing as had never as yet been administered to a mortal this was their ambitions end just now the complete snubbing crushing of erma for  throwing away her education in a most shameful and disgraceful way by going to work their plan was to have the educated and professional people to sit together in that section of the church where erma usually sat and she was to be thus forced out of her seat and out of their midst if by any means she got a seat near them they were to get up in a body and move to another part of the church so on sunday morning this group was out early and in full force as the hour of the service drew on they grew restless from thinking over the stinging rebuke that they were about to administer to erma ellen sanders had turned her head and shoulders completely around from facing the pulpit and her large flashing eyes were keeping guard on the door so that she might see erma when she first appeared in the doorway

there she is said ellen flopping herself around assuming an attitude apparently as stiff and immovable as a granite cliff

all turned to look and then snatched their eyes away in disdain erma came forward unsuspectingly a sweet smile upon her lovely face her glistening black hair nestled in lovely coils on her queenly head her brown eyes resting complacently beneath lovely eyebrows sparkled with a quiet glow and a tenderness known only to the innocent and happy at heart her dress was a flawless fit and brought out all the graces of her divinely moulded form this pure blushing aspiring orphan girl went up the aisle of her church and stopped opposite her accustomed seat expecting the occupants to make room for her instead of doing this they got closer together erma astonished looked about her and the angry scornful looks cast at her caused a stinging sensation in her face as though it had been stuck by so many sharp needles in her confusion she mechanically tried to enter seat after seat but was barricaded out finding it to be their intention to prevent her from sitting anywhere in that section of the church she went forward to the amen corner and finding a vacant seat there she sat down

the fact that erma wysong a servant had taken an amen corner seat in the leigh street church stirred the group to fever heat ellen gave a faint shriek of horrorâone about the size to express righteous indignation in a christian church on the sabbath day a negro doctor got up and went to two of the ushers and said  sirs i appeal to you  the dignity of this church is outraged  look yonder where that servant girl sits  the idea  this is the most aristocratic negro church in this city and yet you allow that girl to sit there 

 we didnt know that she was going to sit there said an usher obsequiously

 well now you know it sir  do you think that the white folks would allow a white servant girl to sit on the front pew in their church we shall never amount to anything as a race until we learn to do as white people said the indignant doctor

 well what would you say do doctor   inquired the same obsequious usher

what do what do why what would white people do  put her out  put her out  exclaimed the doctor

the ushers nearly tumbled over each other to get to erma to do what they supposed white people would do to a white servant girl under similar circumstances between these two ushers erma was escorted out of the church her face burning with shame they did not turn her loose until she was full on the sidewalk when they left her returning to worship the god of the nazarene carpenter lad

erma looked up and down the street in a lost sort of way a single pair of tears came into her eyes and a sob was forced out of her throat by her throbbing heart thoughts of her lonely unprotected condition in the world crowded upon her visions of her departed mother floated before her eyes  the thought of being ejected from gods house in seeming disgrace came down upon her with terrific force and the poor girl sobbed bitterly burying her face in her handkerchief she felt an arm steal around her neck and heard a voice murmur  pore chile pore chile it was the arm and voice of aunt mollie marston who had followed erma out of the church

she said  i hearn dat niggah doctah tell em ter put you out kase white folks would hab dun it now i grees wid you fully miss erm we is lettin dese white folks teach us too much our church hez dun away wid dem good ole soulstirrin himes in which my soul jes peared ter float right up ter god and now we hez got a choir whut sings de himes which gibs de feelins of white peoples souls which aint alius lack ourn an our elder is done quit preachin an gwine ter readin de gospil ter us an de speerit hes firsaken him an dey hez been tellin us ter do lack white folks an let our feelins stay damned up wen it do feel so good ter let um out an chile bless yer soul dey doan let me shout at church fir fear white folks would laugh at um an fir fear dey would lose de name ub  ristocrats  but bless yer soul hunny i shouts at home

so saving aunt mollie drew her arm tighter about ermas waist and these two religious outcasts went marching home erma crying and aunt mollie singing all the while  de ole time relijun de ole time relijun de ole time relijun am good ernuff firme

erma wysong was sitting in her own home on the following evening her employers mrs turner and daughter having left the city for a vacation of a few days duration lost in a reverie musing over her experience on the sunday just gone when she heard a sort of hesitating knock at her door she went to the door opened it and found standing before her a very dark man low of stature of medium size dressed in a prince albert coat and vest that had seen better days his bow legs were incased in a pair of linen breeches that desired to pass for white and were very much wrinkled a broad grin that showed nearly all of his teeth and well nigh shut up his small eyes was upon his face he opened his eyes slowly to take a full look at erma and the grin depreciated in value about fifty per cent if its value depended upon its size satisfied with the result of his inspection the grin like the cat came back and the eyes again took up their abode in the partial eclipse after grinning at erma a length of time sufficient as he thought to impress her with his geniality he was ready to announce himself

huh he grunted  youdontknowme doyou said he in the deep guttural rolling tone so generally affected by a certain class of negro preachers

oh yes replied erma i have heard you preach on several occasions

 huh he grunted again with a yet broader grin than his greeting one he asked in that tone which was never known to forsake him his wife states that he even snores in that tone  whatismyname  

really i have forgotten that

huh he grunted  mynameisrevjosiahnervedds  his grin increased in anticipation of the effect the information just imparted was to produce

 will you not come in rev mr nerve

 huh said rev josiah nerve still grinning broadly and walking in lifting his feet in his walk a little higher than do ordinary mortals

take a seat please

he sat down taking infinite pains with all due deliberation to arrange his coat tails so that he would not rumple them as his predecessor in the ownership of them had already evidently done overmuch holding his hat in his hand he sat staring at erma alternately lessening his grin so as to look and his look so as to grin as his grin ordinarily closed his eyes nearly and as a full look materially reduced his grin his white teeth and red gums managed to keep in sight however during the fiercest of the fight between the grin and the look having allowed sufficient time for his amiability to become thoroughly apparent through these facial gymnastics he began   misswysongi have  come  to  sympathize  with  you huh

 rev mr nerve i am very sorry to be compelled to tell you that your ambitions are in the wrong direction the mere attaching to yourself the degree will not make you the equal of the white preachers whom you are seeking to imitate for one i very much question the wisdom of the system of degreeing preachers though practiced by all of the leading white institutions of learning oh  mr nerve as i have had occasion to remark before we must learn to quit accepting customs as good and grand simply because the white people have adopted them they are but human and can err even in a body as a race aside from my convictions as to the uselessness of a title in your case my time is so much taken up with other duties that i would not have the time to instruct you but let me impress this one fact upon you your ambition should sink deeper than merely to appear and be esteemed wise and learned degrees mere outside appendages would do you no good

fire  fire   fire   lurid flames leaping in their mad fury through the roof of a huge frame church building situated on laurel street had attracted the attention of a negro woman who had a basket of clothes on her head putting the basket of clothes down on the sidewalk and expanding her chest she had thrown her shoulders back and was screaming as fast and as loudly as she could  for it was the edifice of the church of which she was a member that was afire she was a poor unlettered woman but next to god she loved her church having to labor incessantly from before daylight monday morning until late saturday night and having neither a nice dwelling nor costly dresses about her only pleasure was going to church on sunday she felt that here she heard directly from god out f that mysterious book on the stand doubly dear to her being shrouded in mystery and containing glowing promises of coming joys imagine then the horror excitement pathos despair astonishment that this negro yeoman threw into her screams on that midday no one who heard those screams ever forgot them soon the street was thronged with excited spectators as fast as the colored sisters  came in sight of the burning building they would break forth into loud piercing screams

the  sister who had first screamed ran to the front door and threw herself violently against it it gave way and she dashed down the aisle she thought she saw a long tail coat disappearing out of a rear window she had no time to think of that however her mind was intent on getting the pulpit bible she snatched this from the altar and started for the door a burning rafter fell barely missing her head and striking her on the shoulder dislocating her arm the bible was knocked out of her hands one of the firemen who had now arrived on the scene hearing that a woman was in the burning building ran in in order to rescue her he caught her by the dislocated arm and was pulling her along giving her excruciating pain she said to the fireman lemme go git de bible save de wurd ub god save de wurd

 the wurd be blanked said the irate fireman come along or you will burn up old woman the oath from the lips of the fireman erased every thought of the fire from her mind she forgot the bible her excitement was all gone she was wondering to herself how a human being could speak so slightly about the bible

dese white folks is er sight i kaint see how dey ken eber speck to git ter hebun dat feller done saulted my rebrunce fur de bible dey is enuf ter spile eny bodys ligion ef niggers stay heah in dis country wid dese cole hearted white folks we woan hab no ligion tall such were her inward musings and that too without a knowledge of the higher critics the fire had no more interest for that sister she was thinking of that other and hotter fire sure as she thought to get the irreverent fireman who could cuss a bible in a burnin church

the crowd swelled the sisters screamed the fire raged the firemen worked valiantly but all to no avail the flames glad at being turned loose in the world once more refused to release their grasp and insisted on licking up into their million insatiable little mouths every piece of timber just before the walls crumbled rev josiah nerve d d s came dashing into the crowd the  sisters  all gathered around the parson for he was their parster he put his handkerchief to his eyes as though the sight was too sad to behold with his face buried in his handkerchief his lips were moving giving voice to the sentiments of his heart thank god thank god or the devil even

the excitement over the crowd dwindled down leaving the ashes to the parson and the sisters the brethren being at their work

elder nerve look at de bottom ub yer pants leg the parson looked down and saw a large rent made in his pants and a widespread stain

 dat surely is kerosene oil said another  sister

parson nerve now exhibited an unwonted degree of confusion the sisters attributed it however to the embarrassment of the parson at having his spick and span attire disarranged by a snag and an oil stain

whar did you git it said another sister stooping to look at it

 huh ah i could  not  say  ay  sister jones said the parson again on his dignity

 whar wuz you wen our house got kotched er fire elder   the parsons dignity suffered a considerable collapse again  huh  ah  huh huh let me see why  sister i am so troubled  about  our  house  of  worship  that my  memory  is  sort  of  affected  that  quick huh ah huh  dontthinkaboutmesisters thinkofyourchurch  whatarewetodoabout that much to parson nerves relief the  sisters  turned to the discussion of that theme the greatest on earth to them they began thus early to lay plans for their future

parson nerve soon found a way of absenting himself from the group and repaired to his study where he secluded himself  ha ha  ha   laughed he in his deep resounding voice

going to his desk the parson opened a code of criminal laws and turned to the desired place

  arson  from twoto  twenty  years  inthe penitentiary two totwenty twototwenty now who on earth wouldsay thata man whowould run sucharisk fora housefor godoughtnotto havedd dd dd revjosiahnervedd  come in said parson nerve in response to a knock at his study door

a policeman stepped into the parsons study the parson dropped into a chair quickly and hid his torn pants leg behind the other that grin of his entirely gone for once the policeman failed to observe the parsons hiding one leg behind the other he began parson somebody burned your church house down we know that you and your people are much grieved about it and would like to apprehend the scoundrel i came to tell you that we are on his track the parson looked at the policeman but could not speak he saw a gulf opening its yawning jaws to receive him and he could not even hollow he stole a glance at the open code

 yes continued the policeman  we shall get him before night they are measuring his tracks now from the rear window of the church out of which some one caught a glimpse of him jumping a bloodhound from a near by city will be brought over on the five train and he will certainly run him down the policeman looked over to rev josiah nerve to hear him express sentiments of gratification at the vigilance of the police and the bright prospect of the early capture of the criminal the rev mr nerve looked at the policeman stupidly frozen with fear

 see here  said the policeman drawing a bit of torn cloth from his vest pocket and holding it up to view this is a piece of his pants leg when he is found this will identify him beyond question we found this hanging to a nail in a fence by which he must have run in making his escape rev josiah nerve neither spoke nor moved he pressed the torn pants leg harder against its protector

the policeman anxious to secure some expression of elation from rev josiah nerve and disappointed that he had not thus far secured such said  prom the way the people are talking if the scamp is caught he will be lynched the white people like you and your church yours is the only congregation in town that has not joined the craze to have churches finer than those of the white people thus they think well of you and are sorry for your misfortune i am a policeman sworn to uphold the majesty of the law but i will join a mob to help lynch the scoundrel that burned your church down well i see you are too grieved to discuss the matter good day parson said the policeman rising to go

rev josiah nerve felt a little strength return and he managed to say to the policeman in a husky tone good day and sotto voce  good by the policeman walked away musing to himself  surely niggers must have an immense amount of religion or of something now that darkey preacher is so grieved about that plaguy barn that he cant talk

while the policeman was thus musing as he walked along rev josiah nerve was packing a valise in the middle of that afternoon some farmers not far distant from the city saw a man wearing a long tail coat which was slapping at the wind his hat in one hand and a valise in the other making for the woods at a rapid rate rev josiah nerve d d s was not heard from in richmond again perhaps he at last succeeded in dropping the despised s and lost his identity in the numerous throng of the veneered

the tragic not the humorous in the experiences of rev josiah nerve appealed to erma had she even then a premonition that she too had been singled out by the wheels of the juggernaut  that she too was to be the epitome of all that was tragic in the attempts of the negro and anglosaxon to journey side by side on the terms elected 

night again and at the home of dolly smith dolly smith and james b lawson alias elbridge noral feel that they know each other now and the gas jet is turned full on the room is supplied with furniture of a most costly and gorgeous sort lawson fresh from a home of magnificence is dazzled by the splendor of dolly smiths parlor

 dolly you are certainly finely fitted up finely  i must say that i have not seen better

 it ought to be fine mr lawson it is the price that was paid for the virtue of my race how are matters progressing with you and erma now 

slowly dolly slowly

 have you gotten an opportunity to speak to her yet  

 oh yes  i see her and converse with her nearly every day

 do you call that progressing slowly  

yes and dangerously slow you see my excuse for calling at mrs turners is to see franzetta turner her daughter while my reason is to catch a glimpse of erma now if i keep on going to see miss turner as regularly as i have been why i will just have to propose marriage to her there will be no way for me to back out and i did not bargain for all that so you see i am interested in matters coming to a crisis for a twofold reason first my soul is lost to erma wysong and will never be found until i have her love and devotion secondly i am not overanxious to fall into the clutches of old maid franzetta

 how did you happen to get so many conversations with erma explain the situation to me fully so that i may know the next step for you to take dolly smith said she now concentrated her soul in her sight and ears the realization of her lifes purpose depended upon the depth of the passion of the man before her as lawsons evil genius would have it he chose this woman of all other people on earth to whom to tell the story of his love

lawson ran his hands through his gold colored locks of hair bowed his head as if in meditation and began his recital more as a man musing to himself than as one talking to an auditor therefore he held nothing back

well dolly it was this way a few days after erma wysong went to mrs turners i called over there ostensibly to see miss franzetta turner but in reality to catch a glimpse of erma i spoke to miss turner in the midst of our conversation as follows    miss turner my barber tells me that your servant girl is a belle in negro society and has occasioned about as much ado among her people by becoming a servant girl as your entering a factory to work would do among us is that true mr lawson if she is a belle she is a worthy one i would give a million for her form it is symmetry itself you underrate your own charms and overrate those of your servant is the unpardonable lie that escaped from my lips after sticking to my throat for a century it seemed

oh dont attempt to flatter me by any such outrageous comparisons mr lawson for beauty i am not to be mentioned in the same breath with that girl this expression was so true that upon my word i could not dispute with my tongue that which my heart acknowledged with every throb i sat in silence eager for more words of praise of erma

 and strange to say she continued  the girl is so charming in mind and manner she has a smile that somehow reveals all the sweetness there is in her soul i cursed my soul for that luck that had robbed me of one of those smiles

 she has so many ways of arranging that glossy black hair every way she changes it makes her appear more beautiful of course the thread of her hair is a little coarse i could have slapped miss franzetta for even intimating that coarse hair such as erma had was a defect  and the girl plays superbly i could stand it no longer i should have been destroyed by the process of spontaneous combustion if i had not said  invite her in and let her play  miss turner looked at me inquiringly to see if i really intended that she should call the negro girl to entertain us intend it  of course i intended it was not that why the girl and i both were there  i repeated my request hiding my emotion of course the greatest currents of the human heart whether good or bad seek subterranean passages miss turner rose to call erma and wretch that i am i actually muttered a prayer of thanks to god erma followed miss turner into the room and smiling such a smile as actually lighted that whole room she made me forget everything else i arose to be introduced erma looked just as much at home and as unembarrassed as though she had been accustomed to such scenes all her days

mr lawson let me present to you miss erma wysong the son of the popular exgovernor of our state   asked erma of miss turner

 it is he was the reply

 erma then came toward me and gave me her hand her touch thrilled me and i actually could not return her greeting i am pleased to know you mr lawson   mr lawson wishes you to play some for us erma  erma looked at me and i nodded slowly as i did not care for her to lift those tender brown eyes away from me too soon seeing that it was my wish erma went at once to the piano erma did not flay no  such music as she gave was not flaying she just dropped bits of her heart and soul on that keyboard and the keys cried out in sympathetic tones and we sat and listened in awe since that time i have wondered why people can say flay music music is too serious a matter to be called play

 dolly that girl has a load of some sort on her heart  loverlike i took it to be the cry of a bird for its mate and i said all through the piece  here am i when she was through she politely bowed and left the roomâwithout a word i did so much wish it had been miss franzetta to go out after that day i had miss franzetta to call erma in as often as i could without arousing suspicion often miss franzetta would have occasion to leave the room on some errand or other and then erma would have to talk to me i would just sit and listen to her talk and gaze into the depths of her soulful eyes

now dolly that is as far as i have ever gotten it seems to me that all unholy thoughts die in her presence there is something in the very atmosphere around her that has the effect of destroying the very germs of evil i have been told that white men have no hesitancy about making improper approaches to just any colored woman as there is no way for insults to be avenged for if a negro murdered a white man of standing for any such cause as insulting a negro woman he would be lynched notwithstanding this immunity of the white man from punishment and the protection of the mob spirit accorded him i would like to see the white man with the smallest instinct of the gentleman who could wrongfully approach that girl you wont find the man this side of the lower regions that can look into those tender brown eyes and feel the loving warmth of the pure soul that they bring forth and then part his lips in an attempt to besmirch such innocence the way for a woman to keep pure is to be pure it is an atmosphere that man knows not how to enter

 by heavens dolly i cant i cant i just cant say the word and yet love for that girl is consuming my soul if i could only get a word of love  if she would only kiss me once  if she would but stroke my hair tenderlyâbut âah dolly i am a lost man  

lawson buried his face in his hands and his frame shook with the violence of his emotions dolly smith stood over him and looked the tigress that she was about to spring upon her prey she repressed all these feelings of exultation and taking a seat said  cheer up mr lawson i have discovered a sure plan of action

lawson remained in the same despondent attitude saying dolly i cant carry out the plan after you propose it

 you wont have to carry it out replied dolly

 who then will   said lawson raising his head quickly and flashing fire from his eyes

 be cool mr lawson be cool erma shall be your friend and the friend of none other i am dolly smith and my word never fails my plan is simply this  if you cant approach erma erma must approach you

erma approach me bawled lawson excitedly

calm now calm yes erma shall approach you

how is that to be dolly i am sure you are crazy but then go ahead

we shall see who is crazy erma is to be brought to sin through poverty we must in a most merciless manner drive her to want  if need be drive her to the very door of starvation open but one door for her to walk out and let that be the door of sin she will be less than human if she fails to come out set riches before her and there can be no failure  that would be terrible i would hate to see the poor girl suffer so

very true but it will be better for her in the end your love will sustain her and your money support her while she lives she well might climb the rugged side of the mountain for the sake of the glimpse of glory from its crest

well what is your plan dolly asked lawson

i shall present the details to you in a few days do not be uneasy i pledge you solemnly that they shall bring erma to her knees remember that erma is a woman and that it is not impossible to get a woman to do as her mother and grandmother did she is no angel now all that you are to do for the present is to see erma alone once more if you can and say to her  miss wysong if ever you need a friend remember me that is all that you are required to do in the matter now you shall hear from me soon

well good night or day rather now dolly this is a terrible business but i suppose it cant be helped

goodnight or day whichever it is mr lawson

when mr lawson was gone dolly smith began at once to indulge in her dance of joy she was more jubilant than ever and danced until she was thoroughly exhausted and fell down on the floor had her exhaustion ended in death our story would have been different

erma was at mrs turners faithfully performing her work and ingratiating herself in the heart of her employer she was happy and prosperous the pendulum chooses the highest point of its journey as the proper place to turn back

john wysong you will please call at my office at the noon hour

the foreman of the bilgal iron works a white man addressed these words to john wysong ermas brother at work in these shops as you have been told johns heart gave a joyous bound as he felt sure that he would be informed that he had been reported on account of the splendid record he had worked so hard to make john had received enough of ermas confidence to guess the remainder of her secret and he was working doubly hard to make a good record and to receive a promotion so that he could earn money the faster to pay off the mortgage on their little home sell it and let erma go off to school by means of the proceeds of the sale the mortgage was now overdue but the holder was a kindhearted man well known to johns father and mother and no uneasiness was felt on that score but john and erma were very anxious to pay it off for the reason named above so john experienced much joy between eight oclock and twelve after being spoken to by the foreman he was saying to himself  after all it was well for me to have sacrificed a literary education in order to learn a trade for teaching is now an overcrowded profession and there is nothing else in that line to do now i think i am about to be promoted and will then get four dollars per day i know i am going to be promoted for there are only two reasons for which men are called to the office as i was either to be promoted or turned off i am glad that my record has been such that i know i wont be turned off that was a bully thing in me to stand at the head of the list for the last quarter john went on with his work whistling and singing and planning great things out of his four dollars per day

the noon hour came and john went hurriedly to the office of the foreman he looked so grave that john had some slight misgivings that all was not going to go so well the foreman was busy arranging some papers and did not speak at once at length he said john you have been a good faithful workman and we have all liked both you and your work you have been so polite industrious punctual and painstaking

john felt reassured by these words and said thank you thank you indeed i certainly have striven hard to deserve your good opinion

when john was through the foreman resumed but l am very sorry to say that i have bad news for you

johns hat which he was holding in his hands dropped to the floor and he grew weak from the shock of disappointment he said to himself i am not promoted i shall have to work along at the same old figure

the foreman paused before delivering the next blow  the bad news that i have to tell you john is that you cannot work for us any more

who has been lying to you on me let me face my accuser said john aroused excited

 no one has spoken ill of you john there is not a man in the shop but is your friend it is not that we find fault with your work that you have to go

 what on earth then is it   asked john

 the labor union has ordered us to discharge you

 the labor union  i thought that the bilgal works belonged to messrs morrison and brown

 they do john they do but it is this way the labor union will order all of its members throughout the country to quit working for any shop that will employ any man to work who is not a member of the union all of the men in our shop except yourself belong to the organization and it has sent us word that they will be called out on a strike unless you are discharged you see you are not a member and they will not let their members work with nonunion men

 is that all there is to the matter why i will just join the union then  that will settle the whole matter

the foreman smiled a sad sort of smile saying  i wish you could john i wish you could but you cannot you are a colored man

john dropped into the seat nearest him and he felt his heart rising up into his throat as though to choke him he said in a husky sort of voice  i suppose you will give me a recommendation will you not  

 oh yes john with the seal of the firm affixed but it will do you no good to have it this union controls all the shops in the land and what you meet here you will meet everywhere

john struggled to his feet and picking up his hat pulled it down over his eyes and ran his hands into his pants pockets he then looked upon the foreman like a lion at bay he said in a voice that creaked with the emotion of desperation  must i finish the day  

 no john said the foreman  we were ordered to get rid of you before one oclock today we put it off till the last moment john before you go let me inform you of something for some cause or other you have a powerful enemy somewhereâa white man our men did not report you they all liked you and were sorry that you were reported but we cannot help ourselves good day john watch that enemy

john walked moodily homeward and when he arrived found erma there this astonished him as it was about the hour for her to be busy at mrs turners forgetting all about himself he said erm how is this darling i find you at home  

 john i have been discharged   said erma falling on his shoulder and bursting into tears erma sobbing said  mrs turner drove me out of her house as though i was a dog she dared me to apply for employment anywhere else in richmond  and she would not even tell me why i was discharged and i was doing so well too franzetta was aiding me so much in my studies

john did what he could to soothe erma as soon as he thought it was safe he told her of his own misfortune they sat upon the sofa with their hands clasped silent the road of life was becoming rugged the mail mans whistle blew and erma went to the door and was handed a letter which upon being opened told of the foreclosure of the mortgage on their home erma looked at john and john looked at erma

dolly smith was carrying out her promise

a party had approached the orignal holder of the mortgage with a view to the purchase thereof the mortgagee disposed of his claim after being assured that the purchaser would deal leniently with john and erma this pledge was unscrupulously broken and john and erma were soon turned adrift upon the streets penniless and homeless erma remembered aunt mollies invitation and went to dwell with her john went to a lumber yard for shelter at night

it is labor day business houses are closed buildings are decorated excursionists are present by the thousands from neighboring cities the roads leading from rural districts are alive with buggies wagons and carts all full of people crowding into richmond as a consequence richmond is all agog with excitement there is to be a grand parade of all the local labor unions together with delegations from unions in neighboring cities

to add zest to the occasion the master workman of the labor union of the united states is present and will make a speech that all are looking forward to with burning interest the days celebration is to wind up with a banquet which is to rival in brilliancy any that the south has ever known the excitement of the people of richmond is keyed to the very highest pitch

a carriage drove up to the hotel door where the master workman was stopping and he and the mayor of the city got in to be driven to the starting point of the parade to ride at the head of the procession john wysong was the driver of this carriage being shut out from all of the departments of skilled labor on account of his color he had been forced to join the large army of unskilled laborers grabbing here and there in a desultory manner at every little job of work that appeared having no steady employment the greater part of his time he was idle the labor market among the colored men being glutted on account of the abnormal demand for carriages on this occasion scores of men were pressed into service as drivers thus john happens to be a carriage driver on this day and the master workman of the labor union and the mayor are to occupy the carriage which he drives

surely there must be somewhere in the universe a powerful conscienceless being who delights in bringing together the two beings who more than any others of the millions of the earth ought to be untold miles apart and brings them together at that moment which of all others in the cycle of time is the most inappropriate either that or there is a providence who permits this disastrous meeting of uncongenial spirits in order that out of the collision evil in itself there may come a spark of light as when a negative pole meets a positive and the electric spark results

fit or unfit john wysong is the driver of the carriage of the master workman of the labor union thus the chief officer of an organization whose hand had fallen heavier upon the head of john wysong than upon any other individual in richmond filling his heart with a brood of vipers to be fed and kept alive by continued misfortunes is committed to his care

the parade commences and winds from street to street the master workman and the mayor riding at the head of the procession finally they came to a magnificent brick edifice in the course of erection the mayor pointed over to the building and said now master workman that building is a potent example of how well we have the labor situation in hand in the south that church edifice is one of the very finest in the city and is being erected by a congregation of poor negroes and yet not a brick is being laid nor a nail being driven by a negro our labor union controls exclusively the work of the race to which it belongs and has just as absolute control of the work of the other race our factories make their shoes our tailors their clothes our machinists their stoves our bricklayers build their houses our clerks sell them supplies and at the same time we exclude them from all such employment this remark precipitated a discussion of the relation of the labor union to negro labor and as to why the negroes were debarred

the master workman a northerner the honored guest of a southern city an honor rarely accorded to men of the north riding with an exgeneral of the confederate army the mayor outheroded herod in his denunciation of negroes and expressed unalterable opposition to their ever being allowed to enter the unions he said  the home the fireside is the dearest spot to the anglosaxon and in his family all his pride centers through centuries the anglosaxon has been evolving his ideals and sentiments concerning home life and the place it should occupy socially in the congregation of other homes in order to sustain these ideals a larger amount of money is needed than is needed to sustain the home life of the negro with his ideals at their present stage of evolution hence we cannot afford to enter into competition with the negro for it would not be a question of dollars it would be a question of home against home so we of the labor unions have decided that either our homes must be crushed out or the negro and you know what the anglosaxon does to a weaker foe that does not accept his standard he simply destroys him

here he paused for an instant and then resumed  but the greatest objection we have to the negro is that his nature does not seem to have in it the seditious element to any appreciable degree he will move along patiently enduring evils and debating his rightâactually his rightâto rebel against oppression he has an abnormal respect for constituted authority he does not admit to himself the inherent right to throw off the hand of an oppressor he stands and looks pleadingly at him waiting for the time to come when the better sense of the oppressor will assert itself he really expects for the tyrannous spirit to develop forces within that will overthrow itself ignorant of history he does not know that the spirit of oppression will yield only to force or the fear of it the anglosaxon has never gotten anything for which he did not fight or impress the party concerned that he was ready to fight for it

 now our union wants it distinctly understood that what we labor for we must have we shall have it if we ignore all laws defy all constituted authority overthrow all government violate all tradition our end must be attained at whatever cost if a foe stands in our way and nothing will dislodge him but death then he must die that is the dictum of the anglosaxon the negro lacking this spirit has no place in our ranks

john wysong had heard every word of the conversation up to this point but his mind could go no further it was in a whirl over and over again the words of the master workman rang in his ears  if a foe stands in our way and nothing will dislodge him but death then he must die the clatter of the horses hoofs seemed to say this  the revolving wheels of the carriage seemed to repeat it over and over and the hum and noise of the city seemed to be but a loud echo of the sentiment that had fallen into wysongs already disordered brain time and again be had to be hallooed to by the policemen to keep in the line mapped out for the parade his hands trembled with nervous excitement and his eyes were red and wildlooking

at length the parade was over the mayor suggested that the master workman go to the city hall and enter the tower rising two hundred feet in the air so that he could have a view of the entire city john wysong heard the suggestion and it made him tremble all the more violently his heart thumping loudly the while  if a foe stands in our way and nothing will dislodge him but death then he must die kept ringing in his ears

the reception committee in a carriage following that of the master workman went with him to the city hall they entered that magnificent building and went from floor to floor john wysong following them unnoticed they entered the tower and ascended to the small dark room at the very top having a large window with a low window sill through which window a person looking out could command a view of the city the news spread that the master workman was going to the tower and crowds of holiday loungers gathered about to cheer him when he appeared at the tower window others gathered to find out the meaning of this crowd so the throng swelled and swelled the master workman and his group are now in the small tower room all the members of the group stand back to allow him to look out of the large open window when the crowd below sees his stalwart form appear at this window it raises cheer after cheer the remainder of the group rush to the window to look out over the master workmans shoulders to see the meaning of the noise and the crowd

john wysong who had stood just outside of the door of the tower saw the rush to the window and the soil being prepared the seed of murder dropped into his heart his breath came hot and fast he stepped with the stealthiness of a cat toward the group surrounding the master workman they were all intent upon the cheering crowd beneath and did not notice him he pressed for room but those he touched having their heads out of the window supposed it to be a fellow committeeman and did not look round john stooped down and as quick as a flash seized hold of the master workmans ankles and gave him a quick powerful upward jerk that threw him forward out of the window as he went tossing out a committeeman seized his coat and held him thus for an instant but it was only for an instant the committeman pressed his side against the window facing and held to the coat but it began to rip aided by the violent but fruitless clutching of the master workman slowly but surely the coat was ripping

two hundred feet below the people were paralyzed with horror they saw the form of the man whom they were so wildly cheering a moment before suspended in midair sustained by a ripping coat a thousand hearts stood still a thousand voices were mute  a thousand chills of terror crept over mens shuddering frames the coat gave way and the master workman started down on his awful journey the people turned their heads away from the sickening sight to follow fifty feet from the top of the tower the body struck a protuberance bounded outward and fell plump upon the iron palings two hundred feet below and they ran their narrow shaped heads through his body as unconcernedly as though they were stationed there from all eternity to receive him

the friends of the master workman will take his body and bury it with all the pomp and honor due his exalted station requiescat but we go in quest of the young man with the awful stain of murder upon his soul john wysong was not suspected of the murder without stopping to even debate the matter it was decided that in the jostle of the committeemen to see below the master workman had been accidently pushed out there are times when all of the attention of an entire group is focused on a given point and such was the case when the crime just recorded was committed the mayor stayed to care for the terribly mangled form of the master workman and john wysong drove the carriage to the stable put up and went home early the next morning he went out and got a newspaper to learn the accepted theory of the death no thought of murder was found in the long thrilling recital john now felt partially relieved

yet though undiscovered and apparently safe on the very scene of his crime john was not altogether easy in mind his conscience troubled him he and god were the sole partners in a terrible secret the world passed him by ignorant of his deed but it seemed to him that the terrible load could be the more easily borne if only some one knew it with him he could not endure that solitary companionship with god whenever he wondered if the crime would ever be known his mind could not run out variously to this that or the other possible source of detection no it ran straight to god  and john would not have been surprised to hear god tell the world of his crime any day if god had had a subordinate a human being to tell it john might have thought that god would not concern himself about making it known as it was the responsibility of telling it was with god  and john looked for it to be told any day after god did not tell it john began to think that god was waiting on him to tell it if he did not tell it he felt that his punishment would be twofold but fear of his awful fate restrained him

thus john wysong wandered hopelessly about the streets of richmond day and night he began to grow thin and erma soon discovered that some sorrow was eating away his heart she did what she could to cheer him but all to no avail erma was still at aunt mollies  taking in washing for a living it barely kept her alive and caused her clothes to be of somewhat inferior quality john would come to see erma and sitting in front of her seeing her working so hard so poorly paid so poorly clad would burst into tears this would unnerve erma and set her to crying she would go to john and throw her arms around him and beg him to cheer up and not to break her heart her tears would serve to cause john to quit yielding to his feelings

one day john came to mrs marstons to see erma it was now winter and she was in the kitchen washing out a tub of clothes she and john were in there alone her sleeves were rolled up beyond her elbows laying bare arms that were perfectly rounded and that tapered with exquisite beauty her long black hair had become unpinned and had fallen down over her shoulders allowing two shapely ears to peep out and they seemed content with just that much liberty and just that much bondage to anything so beautifully black as ermas hair her shirt waist was unbuttoned slightly at the throat granting a glimpse of a neck full worthy of partnership with that charming face and well shaped well poised head though at work she was laughing and chatting and joking with john trying to make him lose his moodiness suddenly the kitchen door was unceremoniously opened and a policeman stood in the doorway his eyes first fell on john absolute and unqualified terror seized john and he shrank into a helpless heap on his chair showing every sign of guiltiness of a crime ermas heart stood still she saw the look of terror in johns eye and wondered what crime could be laid at his door womanlike she vowed to be johns friend to the last though knowing not his crime the policeman saw john looking so guiltily that he could scarcely refrain from taking him though he came upon another errand his mission was with erma he turned his gaze reluctantly from johns crouching form as though he was losing  game  rightfully his as he would put it he looked erma full in the face not a line not a muscle escaping his bold gaze as ermas full beauty dawned upon him he pulled off his hat so instinctive is mans homage to beauty at length having finished his survey of erma he handed her a warrant summoning her to appear in court on the morrow in a case of forgery the state vs james b lawson as a witness for the defendant the said james b lawson if her dead mother had stood before her she could not have been more astounded

the policeman having fulfilled his errand turned to go he paused to cast a parting look at john whom curiosity had somewhat bolstered up when he discovered that the policeman had business with erma but the returning gaze of the policeman made him collapse again and the policeman never disliked anything in all his professional career so much as he did the fact that he now had to leave that house without john wysong ever after that when he would see john on the street he would eye him keenly as much as to say you belong to me and john would slink cowardly away but we are just now concerned about erma

a clear understanding of the events to transpire in the courtroom on tomorrow necessitates the bringing to light of some incidents that occurred many years previous

one beautiful day two negro girls sisters sauntered forth from home to make the rounds of the dry goods stores it was their custom to go from store to store inspecting fine garments whether they had or did not have the money to make purchases looking at the fine displays of goods seemed to give these poor girls as much satisfaction as the actual possession of them would have done upon returning home they would delightedly discuss all that they had seen as this was about the only novelty of their humdrum existence the mother deeply engrossed in aiding her husband supply the necessities of life never interposed any objection

at this time exgovernor lawson was a young man and was employed as clerk in one of the clothing stores visited by these two young girls one of the girls impressed him as being more than ordinarily goodlooking and he had some curiosity to know how much her looks could be enhanced by proper attire he made both of them presents of very elegant and costly costumes on the condition that they should not inform their parents as to the true source of the gift and he further stipulated that they should return on the morrow clad in the attire given them by him

the taste for fine dressing having been whetted to abnormal proportions the girls otherwise honest accepted the gifts and began the first deceptions of their lives the beautiful girl looked like a veritable queen when she appeared the next day little by little they were led on and on until lawson and the girl that interested him were meeting clandestinely through the cooperation of her sister it was not long before public disgrace overtook the erring girl through the birth of a child that child was erma wysong

dolly smith was the sister that abetted ermas mother in her sinful course the disgrace was too severe a blow for the mother of the two girls and she soon died of grief the enraged father drove them away from his house cast off they appealed to the partner in their guilt for help he spurned them from him and threatened to have them imprisoned if they besought aid of him again this action was the occasion of dolly smiths vow to consecrate her whole life to the wreaking of vengeance on the wrecker of their happiness

the clerk rose rapidly in the scale of life soon was a merchant himself and later was triumphantly elected governor of virginia and more recently was appointed minister to germany dolly smith never lost sight of him nor faltered in her purpose imagine then her wolfish joy when his son commits his fortunes into her keeping she feels that she can wreck the father through the child

we now pass from the father to the son while erma was at mrs turners young lawson became familiar with her handwriting she having aided franzetta turner and himself in addressing invitations on several occasions dolly smith knew of this and had been faithfully laboring to imitate ermas handwriting she was entirely successful and could write so that it would require microscopic inspection to distinguish between the two

it was a forged letter to young lawson that caused mrs turner to summarily dismiss erma from her service offering no opportunity for an understanding the imitation was so perfect that both mrs turner and franzetta regarded the matter as beyond question

now that erma was lost to lawsons view dolly began to correspond with him using ermas name and handwriting these letters represented erma as making advances toward lawson professing love for him and expressing a desire for lifetime companionship these letters rendered lawson wild with joy he felt that the greatest blessing that the world had in store for him ermas love was at last attained

dolly made erma to say in these forged letters that she desired that he settle upon her a sum of money sufficient to care for her for life in the event that he should die or his affections should wane young lawson assured her that his love was immortal and that she did not need insurance against the possible loss of that yet he deemed it but an act of justice to make ample provisions for her so that she would never be in want under any circumstances that might arise

young lawson at this time had only five thousand dollars in his own right though the prospective heir to a great fortune he desired to settle ten thousand dollars on erma he prepared a note forged the endorsement of a wellknown firm had the note discounted hoping to save enough from his liberal quarterly allowances to redeem the note at maturity the money was paid over to parties named dolly smith having most skillfully arranged this part of the programme this done the fictitious correspondence with erma suddenly ceased and young lawson was enraged at what appeared to him to be ermas duplicity

dolly smith immediately employed a business agency to institute a secret inquiry into young lawsons financial standing she being confident that he would have to resort to irregularities of some kind to raise the sum of ten thousand dollars this inquiry soon brought to the notice of the firm whose signature was forged the note of young lawson which otherwise would have been unmolested until the time of maturity so high and unquestioned was the standing of all parties concerned in the note transaction exposure and the arrest of young lawson followed and we are now to attend upon his trial

long before the hour set for the opening of the court a great crowd of richmonds most distinguished people men and women had gathered at the door of the court room they were discussing from one to the other the alleged forgery seeking to fathom the motive thereof and speculating as to the effect it would have on the family name

the attorneys for the defense had given no intimation as to their proposed course and speculation was rife as to what the character of the defense would be  what if any would be the pleadings in mitigation of the offense the commonwealths attorney was well known to be the bitter political enemy of the exgovernor and it was thought that he might be relied on to do all in his power to see the son suffer according to the requirements of the law

the door of the court room was opened and every seat quickly seized upon by the eagerthrong those not getting seats content to find standing room court was duly opened and the case of the state vs james benson lawson charged with the forgery of the signature of the firm linton  stern was called

young lawson was stationed between his mother and father on the one side and his lawyers on the other in response to a summons from the judge he arose and entered the plea of  not guilty for the purpose as was afterwards explained of having the opportunity to introduce testimony that would provoke sympathy though not disproving guilt

the state proceeded to make out its case submitting the note in question the real signature of the firm the testimony of experts and such other evidence as clearly established the fact of the forgery and the guilt of the defendant thereupon the state rested its case

the defense began its presentation by introducing witnesses to testify to the previous good standing of the defendant nothing more in the way of testimonials could be desired than the tributes paid young lawsons virtues by these witnesses the impression created was that some powerful impulsion was necessary to deflect such a worthy young man from the path of virtue  the motive the motive what was the motive  was the query that was engaging the thoughts of all

the name of erma wysong was called as a witness a murmur of astonishment ran around the court room a woman in the case  a woman in the case   the door of the witness room opened and erma wysong stepped out of it into the court room the cynosure of all eyes her surpassing beauty at once stilled the buzzing in the room her hair was combed back from her brow as if to demonstrate that that face needed no sort of background to enhance its beauty a plain but wellfitting dress allowed her form to appear in its native beauty and symmetry ermas eyes were opened slightly wider than usual as if in innocent fright if she had suddenly developed wings and flown the transition would have been in keeping with the tenor of the emotions of all prevailing for the moment for she possessed the charm of person which is ever associated with the angelic erma had not been apprised as to the nature of the case before the court nor as to the part she was expected to play unaccustomed to court duties of any character she was ill at ease on this occasion but her apparent bewilderment lent interest to her charms

the attorneys for the defense were highly gratified at the profound impression that ermas beauty had made she was escorted to the witness chair the tenor of the questions asked gave the public the first clue to the probable course of the defense young lawson was to be a mark antony in the meshes of a cleopatra

erma was asked to gave specimens of her penmanship which she did readily she was also asked as to who wrote certain detached words and sentences that were placed before her she stated that they had every appearance of being her handwriting with the way thus paved the letters which dolly smith had written to young lawson in ermas name were produced they were masterpieces of ingenuity and were evidently written by a woman who knew all of the inner workings of the heart of man erma sat listening in amazement at the revelation of the adroit effort to capture young lawsons heart she being designated as the culpable party

when ermas beauty was taken into account together with the brilliancy and power of insinuation found in the correspondence the auditors were prepared to account for the downfall of young lawson the defense here rested its case to the surprise of all the commonwealths attorney signified his purpose to offer testimony in rebuttal he also suggested to the attorneys for the defense in a whispered conference that mrs lawson the wife of the exgovernor be requested to retire in view of disclosures to be made the retirement of mrs

lawson brought excitement to the highest pitch and sensational developments were momentarily expected

dolly smith is called as a witness and takes her seat she casts a look of malicious triumph in the direction of the exgovernor the commonwealths attorney questions her as follows   are you acquainted with one erma wysong  

no sir was dollys reply

 are you acquainted with the young woman who has just left the witness chair  

 yes sir

 well is not that erma wysong  

no sir that is erma lawson daughter of the hon mr lawson exgovernor of virginia and exminister to germany

the blood forsook the face of the exgovernor and he looked first to dolly and then to erma in a dazed sort of way the eyes of the auditors flashed from erma to the exgovernor and back again evidently making comparisons the audience was of one mind in believing that dolly had spoken the truth only a cursory glance being needed to see after the suggestion had been once made that exgovernor lawson and erma were father and child they were astonished that they had not made the comparison on their own initiative

 are you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar   resumed the lawyer

i am

 state the circumstances under which you formed his acquaintance

dolly now entered into a detailed statement of all her dealings with lawson setting forth his purposes with regard to erma

 who wrote those letters read here today  i wrote them erma knew nothing of them until she heard them in this trial

erma then has not been a party to the inveiglement of this young man  

no sir on the contrary he endeavored to make a victim out of her and he has been victimized

 how did young lawson happen to approach you

many years ago i first acted as procuress for his father my own sister being the victim perhaps information as to what i could do came to him from his exemplary father

the commonwealth here stated that the evidence was all in and if agreeable to the defense the case would be submitted to the jury without argument the defense however desired to make one speech the prosecution waiving its right to make reply the speech as prepared by the leading counsel for the defense was not delivered the case of his client was ignored altogether and a stirring invective was delivered against dolly smith

as torrent after torrent of scathing rebuke rolled forth from the lips of the speaker dolly smith writhed as one under the severest physical torture feeling unable to longer endure the ordeal she arose and fled toward the door as if by a common impulse the throng of spectators surged about her

tar and feathers   some one suggested

the cry was taken up and soon all were loudly clamoring for tar and feathers   tar and feathers were procured and applied to dolly who was now screaming at the top of her voice and striking wildly in the air she was soon overpowered and followed by a hooting mob of men and boys was led to the railway station where she was placed upon the first outgoing train with emphatic instructions to never again show her face in richmond

the train went rumbling out bearing its unpopular burden while the train was crossing a high bridge a few miles from richmond dolly rushed upon the platform of the car in which she had been riding huddled into one corner and leaping into the air descended upon the unyielding rocks at the bottom of a deep gorge whereupon her soul bade her body an eternal farewell leaving it as food for such fowls of the air as should see fit to feed thereon

to return to the trial young lawson after conviction was solemnly sentenced by the judge to a term in the state prison the exgovernor experienced such a shock from the occurrences that his mind became unbalanced he went forth from the court room a complete mental wreck and wandered aimlessly about the streets of richmond piteously repeating to any one who would take time to listen   the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge

it developed that dolly smith was the purchaser of the home of erma and john and through a provision in her will it was now restored unto them the storm of life bursting over their heads experiences a lull but be not deceived thereby the storm king is crafty

erma is reinstated at mrs turners that ladys heart is now drawn to erma with peculiar warmth as if in atonement for her previous harsh judgment and maltreatment mrs turner is a firm believer in the transcendant greatness of the aristocratic blood of the south and the presence of exgovernor lawsons blood in ermas veins doubly endeared erma to her thus it came about that erma was treated more on the order of one under mrs turners special care than as a servant very frequently the white citizens of richmond called at mrs turners in order to see the beautiful negro girl that was said to be the daughter of exgovernor lawson erma was so clever in conversation that all went away admiring her but ascribing her cleverness to her white parentage an appropriation that is often made whenever a notable performance comes from a person of mixed blood but amid all this erma wysong was by no means a happy girl her brother had at last confessed to her his awful crime and had thus rolled that crushing stone upon her heart in addition to her sorrow over the fact that john her john was a murderer he had left it with her to tell him what steps to take

after his confession to erma johns weight on his own heart materially lessened he had put the matter into the hands of erma and he felt that ermas love for him and her love for god would effect such a compromise as to bring him back to favor with god while naturally deeply concerned as to what erma was to have him do yet he felt that somehow all would be well because erma had the matter in charge two or three times a week he would visit her saying nothing of his crime but hoping that she was ready with her decision her loving heart was touched with this childlike trust on the part of her brother erma also felt that the eyes of her mother were looking down upon her from the skies watching every step that she was taking concerning john whom her mother had commended to her care with her latest breath  be faithful to johns soul erma were the last words that escaped the lips of the dying mother then too erma felt that the eyes of god were upon her and yet again she remembered that she was a member of organized society  was in possession of the knowledge of an awful crime against society and therefore owed something to society how much  was the great question thus in settling this terrible matter she had to deal with her own heart full of love for john  had to deal with johns simple trusting soul with the sacred memory of her mother  with the will of god  with the demands of organized society calling loudly for her guilty brother

sleepless nights weary tossings the allnight prayers the tearbathed pillows were testimonials to the terrific conflict raging within ermas bosom at one time she had about argued her brother innocent to her satisfaction she reasoned thus the labor union drove her brother from employment at the bilgal works debarred him from leaving the city to find other work of the kind drove him to the seat on the carriage where he overheard the labor union argument which corrupted his soul then she argued that the policy of the union was nothing more nor less than a coldblooded attempt at murder by starvation as its principles universally applied would result in the starvation of all negroes her brothers blow then was a blow in selfdefense a blow to strike down that being that was driving him to the waters edge and threatening to overwhelm him therein but these arguments were destined to be soon overthrown in her mind

announcement was made that booker t washington her former teacher at tuskegee would lecture in richmond on the  race problem erma went to this lecture mr washington delivered a strong address showing how the situation of the negro was not altogether a hopeless one and showing the audience how the negro could if he would pull up with all the odds against him  how that there was no need for moping and despondent brooding this erma felt was a home thrust for john for it was just this that had made his soul ripe for his crime as mr washington drew to the close of his remarks his voice began to change from the earnest to the passionate in tones full of the passionate fire of the orator coupled with the pathos welling up out of a grieved soul he said by way of peroration after all after all it may be that the negro has chosen the best weapon for the attainment of his rights and privileges the nihilist of russia appeals to his bomb of dynamite the american indian to his tomahawk  but the american negro has dropped upon his knees in his one room cabin and has sent up a prayer to god after all may it not be that his anguish torn face and sorrowladen prayer of faith are better weapons than the bomb of the russian nihilist and the tomahawk of the indian this one remark determined erma as she now saw it johns error was in adopting the motto of that anglosaxon master workman  if a foe stands in our way and nothing will dislodge him but death then he must die then the thought flashed over her mind that the anglosaxon race whose every advancing footstep had been planted in a pool of blood was about to impart its mercilessness to the negro a being of another mould and john was the first victim over whom the bloody shadow had cast itself she was determined to return john into the ways of his fathers he was to renounce the pathway of blood and have recourse to god erma determined to have john wysong confess his crime and take his chances before a court of justice trusting to god to befriend her and him

 hello christian old boy i am truly glad to see you back

 thank you friend stewart thank you i confess that i am much more than glad to be back i would not have missed beings here this year for anything why we are to have a railroad bill before us and the question of electing a united states senator and nobody wants to miss good things like those

you are right but from the way the papers read you were having a hot time of it and we all gave you up as a gone chap once how on earth did you pull through 

horace christians face took on a serious expression and he looked around and around anxiously and said come with me over to my room stewart and i will tell you the whole story the thing isnt altogether to my credit but i can trust a chap like you

such was a conversation that took place in front of the state capitol at richmond at the close of the first days session of the legislature the sun was just down and flashing a defiant look backward on coming night the speakers were two members of the house of delegates the time is but a short period subsequent to john wysongs confession to erma

horace christian was slightly below the medium in stature had dark eyes and facial features of the most commonplace type there was no marked peculiarity about him nothing that would so impress you that you could point him out again if you saw him in a crowd the two locked arms and went walking out of the capitol yard and over to christians room in fords hotel once there they locked the door to his room and took seats at a table in the center of the room christian offered stewart a cigar and taking one himself lighted it and leaning back in his chair threw one leg over the table sitting thus his hat on his head he began his story the gloom of evening fast creeping on

well stewart my election came about in this way you know my district is a very close one and a fellows election is determined by a very few votes on previous occasions i had paid out a little money and bought up the negro vote to such an extent as to secure my election but this time the republicans put up as their candidate an exgeneral in the confederate army an exconfederate who confesses to the error of his ways and joins the republicans can always rely on the negroes killing the fatted calf for him so my opponent was just sweeping things before him i began to look upon my candidacy as a forlorn hope until an idea which i regarded as a brilliant one flashed into my mind

you know stewart the negros weak point is gratitude to the white man that point in the negro race is over developed i have noticed that a merchant can keep a negros trade forever by merely speaking to him kindly the negro seems to feel that he owes the white man his trade for that friendly greeting and he will not quit trading with him to trade with a member of his own race a smile from a white man will go farther toward getting a negros trade than a days pleasant conversation from another negro the negro feels so grateful for the condescension of the white man if a white man cuts off a negros leg expresses sorrow for it and gives him a cork one accompanied with a kindly pat on his shoulder that negro feels under a debt of gratitude to that white man all his days i reasoned then that my only salvation lay in doing something to get the gratitude of the negro just now all the gratitude of the negroes is lavished upon southern whites who denounce lynching i decided to get an antilynching record but i could not get that record without a lynching if i was to get to the legislature and have a finger in the pie i must have a lynching the question had reduced itself to this simple proposition  no lynching no seat in the legislature or a lynching and a seat in the legislature i argued with myself that it would not matter so much with the universe if one more innocent negro were lynched just one more name to the long list of innocents slain would not be such a great addition besides i argued if the lynching spirit goes on some innocent negro will soon be lynched and nothing gained but in my case there is something to gainâa seat in the assembly at a most opportune time

having toned my conscience down i began to concoct my scheme of course that was the easiest part of the job you know that in the chivalrous south whenever a white woman throws out a hint against a negro he might as well make his will i decided to take advantage of this chivalrous feeling and make it serve my purposes a false charge was trumped up against a negro and he was soon in the hands of a mob according to prearranged plans the negro was being led forth to the place where he was to be hanged when i came upon the scene and besought the mob to halt this they did and listened to remarks from me denunciatory of their proposed actions only the leaders knew of my true relation to the whole affair

 the fury of the mob had been aroused to such a pitch that nothing could induce them to desist that negro did look at me so appealingly evidently regarding me as his only possible hope finally the crowd became impatient at listening to my harangue they started off with the negro i then drew my pistol as if about to kill and be killed for his sake i was overpowered in short order  but that one deed the drawing of that pistol has made me solid forever the poor negro was taken near the scene of the alleged crime and was hanged and riddled with bullets

that night i could not sleep about twelve oclock i got out of the bed and dressed the moon was gleaming down upon the earth something drew me irresistibly to the scene of the lynching the murdered negro was yet hanging there and by the light of the moon struggling through the treetops and falling in spangles over his form i saw a horrible sight the face was ploughed up with bullets his eyes were bulging out his stomach was ripped open and his entrails were visible on his breast there was a placard and an inward voice seemed to say to me  read   with my hair rising on my head and the strangest feeling i ever had in my life stealing over me i crept up to the body i could not see distinctly so i struck a match and read these words  whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap i looked up at the bulging eyes and they seemed to be trying to speak to me and say  thou art the man my strength failed me and i fell forward and clutching at anything to keep from striking the ground caught hold of the dead negro my weight added to his broke the rope and we fell down together my head getting caught under his mangled form

but stewart the story is too uncanny i cant go on with it   his voice now grew loud and wild  i would like to tell you about my dream oh  it was awful but i cant tell it to you  that queer feeling is stealing over me my hair is rising now dont you hear my teeth chattering  light the lamp  light the lamp stewart christian was now standing up grasping the table in terror and shaking like an aspen leaf

suddenly a rap was heard at the door christian cried out with the terror of a child oh dont open that door stewart dont

that nigger will come in   stewart lighted the lamp and this had the effect of restoring christian to his normal condition christian now went to the door and opened it himself

why speaker lanier come in mr speaker come in  your call does me a signal honor he said mr lanier was a large tall man of grave aspect and of a commanding appearance be seated mr lanier be seated speaker lanier sat down and let his eyes rove around the room he caught sight of the grave look on stewarts face and inquired the cause

 oh nothing mr speaker a nigger stood in the way of my coming to the legislature so i just killed him i have been telling stewart about it said christian

in cold blood asked lanier

 oh its a small matter about the sort of blood laughed christian killing a nigger does not amount to anything a man isnt popular these days unless he kills a nigger i have got mine lanier looked at christian contemptuously the subject was so disgusting that he hastened to discard it at once

say boys said lanier i have just come from the house of exmayor turners wife and she has sent me to you all on the queerest mission possible it comes about in this way

you know she has staying with her a negro girl erma wysong who is currently believed to be the daughter of exgovernor lawson this girl has so favorably impressed mrs turner and has so elevated the opinion of the people as to the capabilities of negroes that mrs turner has decided to use a number of negro girls to kill off inimical legislation relative to the negro race which legislation threatens them at this session you know a determined effort will be made to pass a separate coach bill  and also a law so dividing the school funds that negro children shall get only that proportion of school money that comes from taxes paid on negro property of course that means death to the negro schools well mrs turner wishes to defeat these bills and desires to have the credit of the performance here is her idea she holds that the social tie has been the assuager of all racial antagonisms in history and that what makes the negro race problem so hard of solution is that the social factor is missing and ever shall be

she has decided to employ this idea of the power of social influence in dealing with the pending legislation she wishes to hold at her house a number of fetes at which no one shall be present but about twenty young negro women of the very purest and highest type in their race together with an equal number of the leaders in the legislature she wishes to bring you all together in this secret way for a purpose which she regards as lofty even to the sublime

of course as speaker i am not supposed to influence legislation too strongly in a partisan way so i shall not be asked to the fetes but you fellows can go to talk with and listen to the girls one thing coming in contact with the better element of the race you can form a more correct opinion of it what say you boys  

 oh i am in for it hon mr speaker i am in for it i need something to divert my mind this session what do you say stewart  remarked christian

well after your weird tale i need a diversion too so put me down as all right when the music starts i will be there to dance

 one thing boys i was asked to say to you by all means you are asked to pledge your most sacred honor to me on two things  first you are not to breathe the matter to your warmest friends  second as the honor of mrs turners house is at stake you are implored by her to pledge me upon your honor to treat the girls as ladies they come from the best homes and a misfortune would be a most damaging and blighting affair do you promise   oh yes we promise you faithfully said christian winking slyly at stewart

well that is all settled then said lanier  by the way he continued  you will find that erma wysong a gem she is as beautiful as a mermaid and as gifted as any girl i ever met she made a strange request of me just as i was leaving she caught hold of my hand and said excitedly with a pleading look in her eyes  mr lanier they tell me that you are a great man a man of wide influence will you promise an orphan girl sorely troubled at heart that you will use your powerful influence in her behalf if ever she stands in need of it and if such action will not violate your sense of right a man with a heart of stone could not have resisted such pleadings as that from such a source i gave my most solemn word and when the time comes be it soon or late i shall redeem it well boys i must hurry away i have an appointment with the lieutenant governor as to some matters to come up in the senate tomorrow remember your pledges good night

because erma wysong had found favor in the eyes of the rich white people of richmond the colored girls were now ready to receive her back with open arms though in their hearts opposed to her true they grumbled about white folks honoring a servant girl and felt that they the antiworkers the brain force should have been recognized as representatives of the highest type of negro womanhood but grumble as much as they might they bowed to the decree of the whites exalting erma so when erma came to them with mrs turners proposal concerning social fetes with the legislators they received her kindly the clandestine meeting with the legislators though for a most worthy cause looked decidely shady to these girls but when they remembered that the widow of the exmayor suggested it and would be in it throughout they threw qualms of conscience to the winds and decided to embark upon the enterprise

the affair was not at all to ermas liking but four things influenced her first she had the most implicit confidence in mrs turner and from experience had learned that her motives were always pure and exalted and her judgment usually sound second she was profoundly concerned about the education of the negro children and felt that that was a matter that had the right to command any sacrifice not involving the loss of character third she was anxious for the moulders of public sentiment to meet if not but for the once the purity and intelligence of the race the character of a people being so largely judged by their women fourth the overshadowing thought that swept away the last vestige of resistance was ermas hope that she could use these fetes as a place where she could extend her influence over men of high standing and great influence who could be of service to her and to john when he was to walk at her bidding within the shadow of the gallows so the affair was launched upon a grand scale though conducted with the greatest secrecy the young legislators responded with alacrity to each of the numerous calls that mrs turner made the girls would attend the legislature each day listen to the various speeches and at the fetes discuss them intelligently with the young men

mrs turner was delighted with her scheme and noticed how respectful deferential and truly gallant were the young men no personal appeals were made to any of them to change their votes but these fetes afforded the negro girls the opportunity of putting the questions from the view point of their race this could not be done on the floor of the legislature as the negroes had no representation there erma with her quiet sweet genial charming face moved about among them winning the deepest regard of all margaret marston a girl whom you have met before in our story was one of the twenty and distinguished herself by her costly attire her costumes were incomparably finer than those worn by any of the other girls

at length the day for voting on the two measures came all richmond and the state at large were aroused over the question of dividing the school fund and the providing of separate coaches for colored people the debate waxed warm and furious excitement ran high as man after man arose and spoke in ringing tones in denunciation of the measures when the measures in their turn were submitted to a vote they were defeated by safe majorities loud and long was the applause especially so in one corner of the ladies gallery when the result of the vote was announced it was conceded by all that the speech of the day was delivered by the hon horace christian he spoke with so much eloquence and power and so far excelled his every previous effort that friend and foe united in giving him unstinted praise mrs turner gave a fete of extraordinary brilliancy in commemoration of the fact that her end had been achieved for she was indeed happy that was a happy occasion that night the very atmosphere seemed charged with joy

there are spots on the sun

in one corner of the room on a divan sat margaret marston and horace christian margarets womanly form was wearing its most lovely drapery on this occasion her rounded forehead and black curly hair were befitting capstones of this splendid specimen of physical beauty margarets large lustrous eyes are now cast down upon her fan with which she is toying nervously she is speaking in a somewhat low tone to mr christian she half murmurs yes mr christian i have been trying ever so hard to get near you all the evening i must oh i must congratulate you on that speech it was most masterly her manner and her tones not her words awakened sinister thoughts in mr christian he looked down at margaret intently searchingly her eves would not meet his she continued  oh it was just grand  i could havecould havejustjust kissed you there now it is out so saying she arose and casting a timid look in his direction went to another part of the room and avoided his gaze the rest of the evening the party broke up joyously and happy people went home to peaceful slumbers but the serpent had crept into the garden of eden these fetes went on during the entire session mrs turner fearing that an attempt might be made to resurrect the bills and pass them it was afterwards remembered that on two or three occasions all of the young women were present but margaret and that on these same occasions horace christian was likewise away

the session of the legislature came to a close leaving the separate coach law and the bill for dividing the school funds buried under adverse votes during the session erma had won the esteem and friendship of persons high up in business social and political life and she felt that she could rely upon them to do all within their power to give john wysong a fair and impartial trial and felt that they would cooperate with her to secure for him the very lightest sentence possible

erma had john to come to her room she told him of the long list of her influential friends and showed him how each one could be of service to them in the time of need she then told him that as he had violated the laws of organized society which laws the bible commanded him to obey he ought to suffer for his crime she told him that by going to the authorities and surrendering he would commend himself to their sympathy she felt too that the master workmans treatment of john if brought out in court would serve to mitigate the heinousness of the offense in the eyes of the jury thus john willing to suffer many years imprisonment for a crime which his soul had so long since repudiated hopeful of a merciful sentence having faith in erma and her friends trusting in god went down to the police station and electrified the nation with the full confession of his crime he was placed under arrest and remanded to jail for trial

at first the tone of the daily press was somewhat sympathetic and thereupon the various labor unions became enraged the printers belonging to the unions and working for these newspapers refused to set up articles calculated to create sentiment in john wysongs favor they even threatened to strike and boycott the papers showing friendliness to the negro that had murdered their master workman the newspapers finding the current of public sentiment too strong to breast turned and their columns began to be filled with inflammatory articles even the vicious element of the city was aroused and ermas group of personal friends became powerless mr lanier the speaker worked like a trojan in a quiet way but his efforts were of no avail the case drifted into a race question and not one of justice and mercy a happening that so often occurs where two distinct races live together

at length the day for the trial of john wysong came he was duly arraigned tried and convicted of murder in the first degree the jury nine of them being union men and all being white not leaving its seat the penalty was assessed at death on the gallows and sentence was duly passed that john wysong thirty days from that date be hanged by the neck until dead

poor erma

gentle reader we could not if we would and we would not if we could lead you through the darkened chambers of ermas soul on the days succeeding the trial and sentence of her brother the aching of the cords of love that bound her to john the fear of the reproach of her dead mother the jubilation of the mob the seeming abandonment of her by providence were too much for her human frame and she fell dangerously ill adding bodily to spiritual afflictions it was anguish to those whose duty it was to sit by her bedside at her home one day when erma was resting a little more quietly than usual those in attendance upon her handed her a sealed letter the envelope being one of mourning erma looked at the letter fearfully and turned her eyes now full of tears up to god as if in reproach of the way he was allowing the millstones to grind her to powder erma was trembling as she tore open the letter and sought first of all for the signature the letter was from margaret marston it read thus  my dear erma  our family physician came to see me this morning and he tells me that i am a ruined girl i know only too well that all he says is true so i am going to new york to do i know not what i write you this letter to beg you to forgive me for a wrong which i perpetrated against you long since you will remember that our doctor who was here to witness my disgrace this morning had you put out of church because you went to work i was the one who worked up that sentiment against you and caused your ejection i the one who was above work trying to act like the white society girl should have been thrown out instead of yourself it was my idleness my failure to earn money my attempt to keep up with the fashions set by the wealthy that has wrought my ruin horace christian whom we met at mrs turners fete won my love my love of him coupled with my desire to dress my poverty my failure to seek such work as abounded my idleness and that peculiar influence which a distinguished man of a distinguished race exercises over a poor girl too appreciative of what appears to her a condescensionâthese things were forces too powerful for me to resist and so i fell erma never allow mrs turner to bring our girls into such contact again as a young white man has nothing on earth to deter him from wrecking our homes there is no penalty for his offense before the law nor in society no sort of ostracism overtakes him anywhere for taking advantage of the weaknesses of negro girls how free the young white man feels under existing social conditions to prey upon our morals  our families are so filled with contempt over our disgrace that they seek not to avenge our fall so i go on my downward journey and mr christian moves upward to the highest places within the gift of his people do what you can erma to see that a similar fate overtakes not another girl farewell

margaret

let me up let me up cried erma springing from the couch on which she lay

despite the protests and the determined resistance of her attendants erma was soon dressed and walking rapidly toward mrs turners her attendants thinking that the shock had perhaps cured erma of her troubles which were more mental than physical contented themselves with following her at a distance she entered mrs turners home and said  mrs turner i trusted your word that you were introducing us to gentlemen now behold the work of horace christian she thereupon handed mrs turner the letter and waited anxiously for her comment

mrs turners face flushed with anger as she read of the baseness of horace christian she said erma i cannot recall margaret marston to a pure existence tis true but i shall see to it that the same punishment is meted to that scoundrel christian that would befall him if margaret were my own daughter franzetta the honor of my home is involved and be assured that we have come upon one white man the despoiler of a negro home that shall not escape unpunished trust that to me ah erma  i fear that the social factor must be ever missing in the solution of your race problem wherever and whenever in other countries race problems have arisen and there have been many such to arise the softening influences of the marriage tie and social intermingling have acted upon the icebergs of race prejudice like a southern sun but my efforts prove that this factor must ever be missing it is sad sad sad but it is inevitable the marriage tie we do not want all social functions gravitate in that direction we see  the two cannot be disassociated as we do not desire the one we must not tolerate the other i find at so sad a cost i wash my hands of the attempt god knows that my heart was true but christian  christian  tremble wretch wherever you are  stay erma i wish to call up mr lanier she went to the telephone and called up mr lanier urging him to come to her house at once he came and erma retired to another room while they talked they were thus engaged for about three hours finally they called in erma there was a happy relieved look on mrs turners face and a grave one on laniers

mr lanier said miss wysong mrs turner has told me all by the heart of my sainted mother and upon the honor of my virgin sister i swear to you that margaret marston shall be avenged again let me say that to my mind your brother is entitled to mercy and he shall not hang

erma sprang to mr laniers side grasped him by the arm and looked searchingly into his face but he said no more bidding the two adieu he left haunted by ermas beautiful face where all the sorrow of the world seemed to have taken up its abode

lanier walked forth from mrs turners house an enraged man horace christians slighting reference to his christians having killed a negro came back to him now christians utter disregard of the solemn promise made to him relative to treating the negro girls as ladies intensified laniers contempt for his moral nature before taking any action he decided to find out all about each of these crimes of christian the killing of the negro and the betrayal of margaret marston

christian had not gone away from richmond as yet though the legislature had adjourned lanier called to see him and at first engaged him in a conversation on subjects of minor importance to throw him off his guard later he found it convenient to address him as follows  by the way christian you have never told me about that frolic you had with that negro you were telling stewart about it when i called to see you at the first of the legislative session just closed christian said excuse me mr lanier but the deed was too coldblooded to be mentioned the darky had never done me a bit of harm and i have never gotten over what i did

i suppose that that is what made you so gay this session i have heard of your little intrigue with margaret marston

 ha ha ha  have you heard of that  i did not know it was out i suppose there will soon be a young african calling me daddy ha ha ha

lanier was so disgusted with christian that he could hardly repress manifestations of his repugnance he found some way of excusing himself and went to his own room he locked himself up in his room and walked to and fro he had two great problems on his hands one was to save john wysong from the gallows the other was to kill horace christian at length a plan suggested itself to him and he grasped his hat to examine into its feasibility he went down to the jail in which john wysong was incarcerated and being an intimate acquaintance of the jailer he was allowed to visit john privately in his cell in fact the jailer owed his appointment to laniers influence lanier had john wysong to stand up he eyed him closely from head to foot he then had john to turn his back to him which lanier examined thoroughly he next examined his hands and his feet he reached in his vest pocket and drew out a tape line with which he measured john accurately and thoroughly taking a record of the measurements having obtained the information he desired he started to leave when he caught sight of a burned place behind johns ear he stopped and looked at that closely he then said to john  if the jailer seeks to cut off your hair you must not let him plead with him to the very last your life depends upon it so saying he gave another scrutinizing look at john and then left from the jail he went to the tailor shop where a number of the legislators always had their clothes made he took the book in which the tailor kept the measurements of his regular customers and on the pretence of copying his own measurements copied those of christian he now took these to his room and placed them before him by the side of those of john wysong he was astonished at how the two ran together only differing by half and quarter inches he paid christian a visit and while they indulged in ordinary chat he noticed every feature of christians face john wysongs lips were larger than those of christian while their noses were about the same size there was just a shade of difference in the color of their eyes

christians cheeks were not quite as full as those of john other than this if christian were black there would be scarcely anything to distinguish him from john as john was a negro of the most common place type as to features and christian was a white man of the same mould of course there was a world of difference as to their hair lanier was now convinced that shrewd management would enable him to carry out his plans

knowing where the jailers mother lived he boarded a train and went to that place lanier found a person suited to his purpose and left in his possession a telegram to the jailer informing him that a dying mother desired to see him this telegram was dated the day before john wysong was to be executed and was to be sent on that day in time for the jailer to catch the afternoon train leaving for his mothers home by another device he so arranged as to get the death watch who had had special care of john out of the way he next bought a quantity of a solution which is said to be used by burglars and criminals in general of the white race who at any time desire to pass for negroes the secret of the compound was guarded so closely that lanier experienced considerable difficulty in getting hold of it but he secured a large quantity of it as well as the counter solution enabling him to cleanse himself quickly and thus become white again he now goes to christian on the day before john wysong was to be hanged and said  christian let us have a little frolic tonight  let us get our hair cut real close paint ourselves black all over using a solution which i have i have another solution which will cleanse us immediately let us go among the darky belles and have a good time

 bully lanier bully i am in for it since margaret left i have had the blues i want a little fun but say you are a sly chap with your grave looks we would not have thought anything like this was in you yes i am in for it what time will you be here  

at about ten oclock dont fail me now replied lanier

 i wont i wish it was night now said christian

lanier listened out for the news from his telegram it came in and the jailer went speeding out of town but not before lanier had gotten a permit to see john wysong at any time thanks to his other device the regular death watch was out of the way also that night at christians room lanier and christian transformed themselves into negroes and went forth

lanier said  christian if we happen to get drunk tonight and are put in the lockup you must not squeal you must play  darky  to the last or our enemies will get hold of it and we will be done for politically

 dont be afraid of my squealing ill play darky all right i wont mind getting arrested and paying a fine for the sake of the novelty of experiencing just what a darky does go through

 all right now christian be merry play your part like a man

the two go to a house of illfame where christian gets beastly drunk lanier slips out and goes to a place for which he had arranged beforehand he undresses applies his solution and is white again he grasps a valise in which he has a number of things and returns to where he left christian he gets him by the arm and leads him until he comes to the jail in which john wysong was incarcerated he aroused the substitute jailer and showing him his pass was allowed to come in he told the jail officials that he brought along a fellow who was going to do a kindly act for johns sister the two lanier and christian were allowed to go into john wysongs cell lanier left christian in a drunken stupor in the cell and took the jailer and death watchman pro tem aside and supplied them with whiskey to drink it was drugged and they were both very soon unconscious lanier seeing that they were sound asleep returned to john wysongs cell he took out a pair of clippers and soon had all of john wysongs hair clipped off to the scalp he got from his valise a wig made of negro hair just like johns and carefully adjusted it to christians head he took out a syringe and injected a poison in christians upper lip which caused it to swell slightly he looked from christian to john to see how the likeness grew he next injected a small quantity of the fluid into each of christians cheeks and they came out he was astonished himself at the resemblance christian now bore to john he had omitted to fix the lower lip which he now did and stood off and surveyed his work

mr lanier and john together then undressed christian putting christians clothes on john and johns clothes on christian lanier now examined the wig again and saw to it that it was so closely connected with the scalp that only the most rigid examination would reveal that it was a wig he observed that the representation of the scar behind johns neck was in exactly the right place in the adjustment of the wig to christians head christians feet were somewhat smaller than johns but shoes were exchanged anyway john cutting christians open to get his feet into them john did all of this without question erma having so often praised mr lanier and having led him to believe that he would be largely instrumental in saving him how little did she dream of the way in which it was to be done lanier now goes back to the drunken jailer and watchman takes his seat as though he had never moved and finally arouses them from their slumber joking them about being able to stand only a little drinking after awhile he signifies his intention of leaving john wysong acting as drunken christian had acted on coming in sat in the jail corridor waiting for lanier the jailer watchman and lanier walked down the corrider glancing into wysongs cell as they passed the jail door was opened and lanier and john wysong walked forth leaving christian in the cell of the doomed to die the death watchman drowsily took his seat by the side of the cell in which horace christian was sleeping his last sleep on earth

on the night preceding the day set for john wysongs execution erma did not retire to rest she paced toandfro wringing her hands in despair she accused herself of having needlessly murdered her own brother of having cast him into the midst of ravenous beasts destitute of conscience and of feeling she felt that lanier had treated her shamefully to hold out to her a ray of hope only to snatch it away and make the darkness all the more dark she had not seen him nor heard from him since the day he made her such a faithful promise at mrs turners residence whither she had gone concerning margaret this brought margaret to her mind she accused herself of being responsible for that poor childs ruin in that she had allowed herself to be drawn into those social fetes in the hope of saving her brother instead of saving him she had lost him and destroyed that girl as well she thought as the night wore on her agony became more and more intense

despair  despair  despair  night of the soul at the bottom of the pit of sorrow millions and millions deep erma crawled about bitten by vipers put there eyeless to bite all the children of men whom god for any cause sends to them upward from the bottom of this pit erma lifted her eyes but the darkness was so intense that even night would have been swallowed up and lost therein yes though in her room erma was nevertheless in this pit

eventually and without apparent cause a calm stole over erma her burden rolled away as to why this was the case she could not tell and did not know all that she knew was the burden had gone and a calm had settled down upon her soul she opened her front door and let the night air sweep down and kiss her fevered brow

the moon onequarter full was now halfway between the zenith and the horizon the morning star was near at hand evidently endeavoring to outshine its queen the moon not fearful of her throne shone on in unprovoked beauty and the stars were watching the contest forgetful of the fact that the sun was soon to come forth at length the sun burst upon the scene  the unfinished battle was deferred until the coming night as more tragic scenes were to be enacted

if you wish gentle reader you may stay in ermas company on the day of the execution but we prefer to hasten away early in the morning the newspaper reporters gathered at the jail in great numbers they were allowed inside and stationed themselves where they could see through the bars of john wysongs cell at length horace christian awoke from his drunken stupor and gazed blankly around him at first he did not know what to make of his surroundings glancing at his hands he noticed that they were black then it all came to him how that he was playing darky on the night previous in all likelihood he had gotten into a drunken brawl and had been arrested he thought he decided to play darky all the way through he looked through the bars and saw the group of reporters gathered there but he did not know how to account for their presence happening to rub his hand over his head it came in contact with hair and he remembered distinctly of having cut his off he now felt that lanier had put that hair on his head while he was drunk as a joke and having escaped himself had sent the reporters down in order to play a prank of some sort on him he decided that nothing should induce him to betray his identity preferring to take a somewhat severe penalty first the joke of sending the reporters was not exactly to his liking but he was in it and would stick he chuckled to himself as he thought of the antics he was going to play and the witty sayings that he would throw out in the police court at his trial that morning

 have you any message to give to the world through our paper  asked a reporter

yes tell em dat you saw me but you didunt see me saw

can you talk with such levity on an occasion like this   asked another

 boss i dont know nuthin bout yer levity but i knows erbout dese erkasions mos much de police court air my headquarters

breakfast was brought in and it was such a splendid repast that christian now knew that lanier was playing him a joke the jailer pro tem acting in the place of the real jailer gone to his mother brought in a new suit of clothes knowing that ordinary prisoners were not treated thus christian feared that his identity had been disclosed and that they were treating him with such marked courtesy on account of his distinction one thing puzzled him he could not tell where he got that suit which he had just pulled off to put on the new one brought by the jailer after a while he was handcuffed and marched out of the jail the reading of the death warrant having been dispensed with here he met a throng numbering well up in the thousands he began to curse lanier inwardly thinking he had put an account of the episode in the papers and that as a consequence all richmond was out to see the hon horace christian he bit his lip and inwardly defied any man to make him acknowledge that he was white he would defy lanier himself they started on their march and when they got to the corner where turning one way they could go to the police court much to christians surprise they turned in an opposite direction the crowd following them

christian said  say boss you air gwine to de police coat by a roundabout way the jailer looked at him contemptuously they soon came in sight of an open field in the center of which there was erected a large gallows people stood about it on every side as far out as the eye could reach a clearing had been kept open so that the jailer and his ward might go through to the gallows uninterrupted christian now felt an uneasy sensation in his bosom that mysterious monitor that wafts to our ears the notes of the death knell even before they are struck christian walked in the direction of the gallows hesitatingly

come along john come along you must die game you know said the jailer urging him along

hold on jailer said christian what does this mean  

 there is where you are going to be hanged john cheer up dont be uneasy die game

 hanged  hanged  what in the name of god are you going to hang me for  do you hang a fellow for a little midnight fun   asked christian thoroughly aroused and terrified

john that is why you are going to be hanged you looked upon murder as a matter of fun

the picture of the negro tramp whose murder he had caused for political purposes crowded before his gaze he shook tremblingly and began to stagger say he gasped  who told on me  

why you told on yourself john

 i was a blamed fool for telling it i must have been drunk but say he continued  are they going to mob a white man for killing a nigger tramp 

you mean are they going to mob a nigger tramp for killing a white man

i am no negro i am a white man exclaimed christian

 thats enough come on they were now at the foot of the gallows and christian was the very embodiment of abject terror he attempted to cling to the railing on the steps leading up to the platform of the gallows he was whining piteously saying i am a white man i killed a nigger  i am a white man i killed a nigger

his complete breakdown filled the people with disgust and they howled in derision

 it took a cowardly wretch to commit a crime like his said a member of the throng the trembling man was hurried to the trapdoor the noose was adjusted the black cap put on the trap sprung all as quickly as possible the victim kicking scratching clawing the little that he could and bellowing i killed a nigger  i killed a nigger   as his body shot down his last words were o god i killed a the sentence was finished in the other world a few convulsive jerks and the murderer of an innocent fellow being and the despoiler of virtue had gone to his reward

the astounding fact brought to light in our foregoing chapter the successful substitution of horace christian a white man for a negro john wysong would not perhaps have been so easy of accomplishment if its sole reliance had been the likeness which lanier had created and the circumstances already set forth there were other factors that contributed to the success of the scheme which factors we shall now mention in order that so remarkable an occurrence may be the more fully understood

as a result of the civil war four million negroes who had not been permitted individual selfmanagement or family management who had been rigorously prevented from developing and using collective wisdomâfour million illiterate negroes of this description were practically given control of state governments that calledfor a high degree of selfmastery on the part of the units of the governing force  that demanded ability to legislate in a manner that could command the respect of the collective wisdom of an antagonistic group rich in examples of exalted statesmanship

the outcome of the situation was a wedding between thomas jefferson and charles darwin the truism of the household thus formed being  all men are created equal but the fittest survive  in order to dislodge their former field hands who were sitting in the seats formerly occupied by thomas jefferson and john c calhoun the more scrupulous among the whites were allowed to take back seats while the less scrupulous resorted to violence and fraud to restore the government to the hands of its former rulers a result well pleasing to all of them

it can readily be seen that conditions were propitious for the exercise of talents not anywhere in normal times considered as desirable with the highest needs of a community apparently calling for lawlessness and knavery  with virtue stating that she would be foreverdestroyed without the protection of viceâunder such conditions in some sections of the south the reins of government fell into the hands of evil men and the taint of party politics affected everything that these men touched

in this period of transition even the judiciary was sometimes honeycombed with politics the same blighting shadow cast itself over the prison system where appointees were selected with regard to their  political pull this state of affairs will account to you for the latitude allowed to the successful politician lanier a product of his times in his dealing with the condemned negro john wysong

another factor in rendering the substitution so successful was as follows  under the system of slavery the whites being interested in the negroes from many points of view habitually scrutinized their features and were adepts at distinguishing one negro from another when freedom came the necessity for close inspection passed away the altered demeanor of the former slave begat a species of contempt in the former master thus while selfinterest under slavery led the white mans eyes to the negro contempt for what he regarded as insolence led his eves away from him after the coming of freedom the white woman who coined the phrase  all niggers look alike to me is but an illustration of what is here set forth

inasmuch as that the white people generally were indisposed to give close scrutiny to negro countenances and were consequently deficient inability to readily distinguish them lanier knowing these things felt confident of carrying out his plan of substituting horace christian for john wysong

there was one other thing that he had to fear but the situation contained a remedy for that he thought he realized that christian upon finding himself on the way to the gallows would seek to inspire in the minds of the jail officials a doubt as to his being the proper victim but lanier knew that the populace would regard it as a mere ruse to gain time and would take the prisoner and hang him forthwith should the officials hesitate

due to the foregoing circumstances laniers jail delivery was eminently successful he had at last redeemed his pledge to erma and had executed his vow to mete out punishment to horace christian but his work was not yet complete he had to make some disposition of john wysong his first step was to remove john as far as possible from the scene of the crime and in keeping with this desire he and john wysong took a train for florida the same night of the jail delivery

arriving at a city in the central part of florida lanier repaired to a hotel carrying john wysong with him as a servant under an assumed name he went to the room assigned to him accompanied by john lanier lighted a cigar took a seat near a table on which he rested his crossed legs this was a favorite attitude with him when endeavoring to solve a peculiarly knotty problem

 i have a miniature race problem on my hands was his first reflection what must be done with john wysong with that as a starting point his thoughts ran as follows   john wysong has taken human life there was no personal ill will between him and his victim he regarded the master workman as the embodiment of a principle that narrowed his horizon  that turned his face from the hope of prosperity in the direction of starvation his attack was directed at the principle and not the human being embodying it this much in explanation of his crime his error lay in appropriating to his own use the very principle from the effects of which he believed himself to be suffering on account of the color of his skin and the attendant delimitations begotten thereby he felt that other avenues for redress were closed and that he must have recourse to revolution

in view of all the circumstances surrounding the murder i feel called upon to do full justice to society and yet exercise clemency in the case of this youth holding in especial view the fact that he regarded the act as committed in selfdefense

john said lanier to the former who was sitting in a corner of the room  i have saved you from the gallows yet you must suffer in a manner commensurate with your offense the penalty which i am to affix must affect your whole life the murderous instinct is not a part of your being it is merely an accretion that has come to you because of your environments which you were too feeble to alter you are not fit for the rigors of civilized life in america the pace is too swift for you i decree your banishment from civilization and require you to spend the remainder of your days in africa a punishment not lacking in severity to one who has had a taste of civilization to africa you shall go

the look of terror that overspread johns face at this announcement could not have been greater had lanier decreed that he was to be burned alive at the stake within the next five minutes his agony was so apparent and intense that lanier was touched

he said john you do not seem to like my verdict

i shall do what you say said john in tones of utter despair dropping his head upon his chest

 strange  strange  strange  i thought that the one point of cheer in my verdict would be love of his fatherland mused lanier who had now arisen and was gazing upon the picture of woe before him  but love of the fatherland is all gone all gone his love is for a soil where he must run an unequal race and where divers persecutions and injustices must necessarily befall him thought lanier as he continued to gaze upon john aloud he said well john what would be more to your liking

a ray of hope shot through johns darkened soul and with a face lighted up with joyous expectancy he cried  arrange it so that i can go to the penitentiary for a long long term of years i do not wish to leave this country i must not put an ocean between me and lrma

ah replied lanier  but you must never see erma again she does not know of your escape from the gallows nor the method thereof and because of this latter fact you and i both had better beware the dear girl is so deuced conscientious

 just let me stay in this country  send me to prison for as long a term of years as you will

 how can you manage that inquired lanier

 manage it   exclaimed john  thats so you have never been a negro why it is the easiest thing imaginable for a negro to get into the penitentiary

well john you shall have your way change your name never allude to your past life when and how shall you start 

 tonight was johns prompt reply

that night john was caught by a policeman while in a feigned attempt at burglarizing a store he was arraigned duly tried convicted and sentenced to ten years in the florida penitentiary he was taken to the city not far away where there was what is known as the  stockade here he found three hundred negro men women boys and girls chained together with an iron ring around each neck and a pick around the ankle of each john was added to the gang they were awaiting the convict  auction day

the day came and capitalists from all over the south poured into the city to bid on the lot of convicts a syndicate that operated turpentine forests in florida was the highest bidder and the convicts were turned over to it they were marched down to the train and crowded into cattle cars and borne into the swamps of the turpentine establishments they were put in charge of white bosses who had been selected because of their known cruelty on the hypothesis that it took such characters to keep in subjection a colony of negro convicts

necessarily a series of hardships followed but amid all john was happy for he was not in africa and was in the same land with erma notwithstanding laniers prohibition he intended seeing his sister again feeling assured that it could not possibly result in any harm to any of the parties concerned sustained by this hope he witnessed and endured all manner of hardships he saw women of his race forced to labor side by side with men hardened in crime with these same hardened criminals the small boys and girls present in the convict camp for their first offenses had to labor the negro women were sometimes the victims of outrages committed by their white bosses illegitimate offsprings born in prison were taken possession of and doomed to perpetual slavery

men women and children slept together like a herd of cattle as many as sixty being crowded into a room eighteen feet square with a ceiling seven feet high there being no ventilation whatever after hard days work the convicts had to cook their own food fat bacon and corn bread on small fires made on the ground a downpour of rain would not induce the bosses to allow the convicts to quit work and seek shelter slight offenses were punished by brutal whippings  and one aged negro in the prison for stealing food for a starving family was beaten until he died  beaten because he expressed an opinion as to the decency of the conduct of one white boss toward a negro woman his niece in the penitentiary as accessory to his crime

whenever showers of rain drenched the entire lot of convicts they did not have changing garments but had to wear and even sleep in their wet clothing until they dried upon them when the few small houses were filled to their utmost capacities a tent was spread and all fresh comers were assigned to sleep beneath this on the bare ground if some convict more adroit than his fellows made his escape the bloodhounds would soon be on his trail and ere long would have their fangs buried in his quivering flesh

filth abounded on every hand vermin covered everything in the convict quarters and sanitation was a thing unheard of disease walked boldly into their midst and bade death mow down with his scythe twenty out of each hundred this being the proportion of those who died consumption took up its abode in johns bosom and began to eat away his life john dwelt amid all these sickening these bloodcurdling horrors with death gnawing at his own vitals but through it all a smile of joy was ever upon his face hope was alive within his bosom the thought that he might one day see erma again was his sun that beat back the shades of eternal night that were seeking to engulf the vital spark left within him how incomplete would have been the soul of man how powerless to cope with this mysterious thing which we call life were it not that its soil is never impervious to the growth of that fragrant flower which sends pleasing odors even into the nostrils of the dying hope immortal hope 

astrals school life is now over and he is homeward bound during all the years of his separation from erma he has stifled with great effort the cry of his heart to make a bold declaration of love to her but now the courage of desperation seizes him and he has made a solemn vow to declare his passion immediately upon his arrival at richmond the train that bore him on to richmond astral was ready to swear before a notary public was no faster than the slimy animal known as the snail he grew to hate the brakeman who persisted in calling the name of every station save richmond having once resolved upon making his declaration and ascertaining his fate any person that would have suggested that patience ever possessed a virtue would have been in danger of incarceration in the insane asylum if astrals ardent wish could have accomplished that result the train reaches richmond at last as soon as properly attired he proceeds toward ermas home having given her due notice of his coming to see her

since the day of the intended hanging of her brother john erma has lived continuously at her own little home aunt mollie marston who has now lost her husband dwells there with her and erma has taken the place in her heart left vacant by margarets dropping out erma has told mrs marston the secret of her love and informed her of astrals intended visit the dear old soul has done her best at dressing erma for this occasion and has retired to a back room to pray while erma sits in her cosy little parlor to receive astral for a while she indulges in a reverie her mind going back over her past life the thoughts are too sombre however and she dismisses them

the twilight of a mild summer eve creeps over the earth the evening star peeps above the horizon in order to see and report as to whether the sky is clear of the sun so that the timid moon may rise ermas parlor window commanding a view of the street on which her home fronts is thrown open and erma is stationed there  and with her beautiful hands is holding apart the thickclustered vines so that she may catch a glimpse of astral when he reaches her gate erma is clad in black which is only relieved by a lovely white ribbon about her neck vying with her face as to beauty but doing nothing more than enhancing the beauty of the face by affording it this opportunity to triumph over such a lovely foe her hair was rolled in coils and sat in grandeur on the rear of her head a portion of her hair cut short was allowed to bend forward as if threatening to hide her pretty rounded forehead this hair standing guard over her bewitching eyebrows was parted on one side and added delightfully to the charm of ermas face sitting sideways to the window bending slightly forward her small foot incased in a lowquarter shoe protruded slightly from her black silk skirt

it was thus that erma sat awaiting the coming of the man she loved so dearly and to be worthy of whom she had suffered so much and toiled so hard a slight cry escaped her lips astral is at her gate he is changed and for the better his handsome face a shade darker than that of erma has a splendid set of sideburns something that was not the case when he went away on his upper lip there rests a mustache that comports well with a set of thick eyebrows the form is tall and manly he is clad in a suit of beautiful black and a brown felt hat rests on his full large head his look is more grave than when we last saw him astrals heart is beating a wild tumultuous wedding march and he cannot calm it try as much as he may he is now about to meet erma and though he has been planning his little speech for the occasion for years it is now all gone from him and he is trembling with excitement and abusing his mind for going to pieces just at the wrong time erma has arisen from her seat and is walking about her room nervously wondering how astral is going to meet her and what she is going to do and say

how a painter would have gloried to have caught sight of this bundle of beautiful confusion  astral rapped on the door and his heart stood still erma opened it and stepped back to let astral in he looked at erma and his heart gave a bound as though to leave his body erma cast at astral a timid glance which comprehended his entire frame and being in a flash and her soul was satisfied with the verdict turning her head away somewhat bashfully she said walk in mr herndon astral followed erma into the parlor erma had walked to the further side of the room and was now turned with her face toward astral poor girl  her soul was in her eyes she but could not avoid it she tried to keep from looking at astral but she could not do that either instead of sitting down astral started over toward erma with every step that he took his heart grew bolder until when he came to the spot where she was he threw an arm around her waist strained her to his heaving bosom and bent down to press a kiss upon her willing lips and the years of waiting were over

news of the betrothal of astral and erma was not slow in finding its way through the city as society is well supplied with couriers that delight to inform mankind whenever two individuals conclude to form a home the unit of civilization on a matter of such fundamental importance society reserves the right to freely express its opinion

the comment on the proposed marriage was quite varied in character as to the worthiness of the two contracting parties all were agreed but from that point onward there was much divergence of opinion astrals complexion was not as light as that of erma so some were of the opinion that she was making a slight mistake on that score

astral was criticised by some on the score that he had chosen a wife of mixed blood when there were so many girls in the city of pure negro extraction others insisted that he had acted wisely on the theory that each succeeding generation should be as far removed as possible from the original color which had so many ills chargeable to it still another group was found that bitterly opposed the union on the ground that class distinctions were highly essential to the welfare of the race which distinctions astrals course was calculated to obliterate in that he who was to earn his livelihood by mental exertion was to marry a girl who had deserted that pathway and resorted to menial labor

opposed to these were those who agreed with burns in his teachings to the effect that  rank is but the guineas stamp a mans the gowd for a that

thus the conflict of sentiment raged eventuating in no action however save in the case which we are now about to record

ellen sanders true to her conception of ladyship had declined all employment that involved physical labor time after time she had made attempts to be elected teacher in the city schools but some one else of the great number of applicants had always secured the prize repeated failure had somewhat dampened her hope but had not altered her determination to cling to her ladyship to the last of late she had been turning her attention to the subject of marriage as a possible solution one by one the professional men of the city had been favored with her smiles but all to no avail thus far though her smiles had grown to have the appearance of artificiality from such faithful and constant service there was one last string to her bow upon which she relied to bring her success  and as her case was growing desperate she had decided not to allow mere formalities to stand in her way

the hope that had survived had astral for its basis she had been his schoolmate had received some slight attention from him in those days and now felt that the friendship of childhood could be easily transformed into love she had not known of astrals attachment for erma and consequently apprehended no opposition from that source imagine her chagrin and dismay when the news that astral and erma were to wed reached her ears the first effect was to rob her of all inclination to act but this feeling of stupefaction was succeeded by a grim determination to win at all hazards her first move was to bring influences to bear on astral to dissuade him from the contemplated step in the city there were a number of young men who could not be said to follow any vocation who were without visible means of support and yet dressed well and lived in idleness there was much speculation as to how they were maintained but no positive evidence on hand there was a welldefined suspicion to  yes but not in the way that you suppose mr herndon was his response

the comment is unfavorable to me then i presume astral remarked

the young man felt that his time had arrived so he reared back in his chair and closed his eyes preparatory to the delivery of his speech which ellen had helped him to compose

yes mr herndon the comment is decidedly against you society confers upon all men certain blessings otherwise unattainable what would any mans life be worth without the blessings which society confers  in return for these blessings society establishes certain laws and customs which all are expected to obey

here he slightly opened his eyes to see the effect his argument was having on astral noting nothing decisive he closed them again

ellen murmured to herself  good  go on

the young man resumed some of its requirements society enacts into laws and compels obedience thereto others are left to the influence of public sentiment every true member of a community i hold is in duty bound to yield to every demand of enlightened public sentiment

a scowl now appeared on astrals face as he perceived the drift of his remarks but the latters eyes being closed he did not see it

the young man continues  especially is this true on the question of matrimony as from the home society draws material for its construction my opinion is that no man should enter a marriage contract over the vigorous protest of society

astral was now a very angry man and none too safe to deal with

ellen saw that there was danger ahead and was anxious for e moses smith esq to open his eyes so that he might take note of the gathering storm and seek for shelter by a change of course she had no means of communicating her fears without discovering her own presence so the young man remained unwarned

continuing he said you mr herndon are a very worthy man but erma wysongâ

 say it you cur   thundered astral rising and drawing himself to his full height wrathful indignation depicted on every feature

the astounded e moses smith esq opened wide his eyes and one glance at astral explained the situation whereupon in great terror he fled precipitately to the room in the rear ellen having opened the door to readily receive him

having locked the door he thought himself safe and proceeded to conclude his remarks through the keyhole

 mr herndon you are unduly angry sir i was not going to say anything derogatory of erma wysong further than that she had been a service girl and as a consequence was unworthy of so grand a man as yourself

when astral heard the word unworthy applied to erma he proceeded to the door and with one kick wrested it from its hinges the young man who had seen him approaching had jumped behind ellen with a view to keeping her between the irate astral and himself but the frightened girl tore herself from his grasp and ran through the aperture a thick veil concealing her identity when astral entered the room in quest of the young man he found societys advocate coiled on the floor making oft repeated pleas for mercy interspersed with cries of fire murder robber and such other words as in his frenzy he thought would bring others to the scene astral looked down upon him in contempt and strode out of the room leaving him unharmed

the purpose of fallen sanders was by no means altered by the defeat of her plans  to the contrary she was rendered the more determined she saw that there was no prospect of estranging astral from erma in fact no prospect of drawing him into a discussion of the subject she decided to address her attention to erma her knowledge of erma led her to the firm conclusion that it was needless to attempt the use of argument in her case yet she must be gotten out of the way was ellens unalterable determination aside from the fact that she desired astral for her husband she possessed no love for erma who had been an object of contempt ever since the moment she had entered service

selfinterest and hatred are two powerful forces when operating in the bosom of a woman rankling with disappointment ellen determined upon ermas murder when ellen was a very young child her parents had as a neighbor a widow whose name was corella ross the mother of seven children the oldest of whom was called sam mrs ross went about doing housework for various white familes and left her children at home to take care of themselves as best they might sam being the oldest roamed the city at will returning in time to be on hand at night when his mother arrived contriving by bits of candy and direful threatenings to maintain the silence of hislittle brothers and sisters on the subject of his meanderings thus left to himself he became a youth of vicious character but he was ever fond of ellen and carried his affections with him in undiminished force in his downward drift

ellen decided upon employing sam ross to put erma out of her way one dark night soon after the incidents described in our last chapter ellen thickly veiled her face threw a large shawl about herself so as to conceal her form and thus attired made her way to a section of the town known as  hells half acre this settlement contained numerous saloons all conducted by white men and sustained by negroes

knowing of the extraordinary value that a certain class of negroes attached to social contact with white men some white saloon keepers utilized this sentiment to foster their business by a pat on the shoulder a friendly tussle an exchange of jokes or some such mark of fellowship numbers of the more ignorant negroes were held in bondage to these resorts sam ross was one of these victims and ellen is on her way to his favorite resort in the hope of finding him there when she reaches the place she opens the door a little to see if sam is in there there he was in the middle of the floor dancing what is known as the clog dance keeping time to the music of a fiddle in the hands of another negro perched upon an empty whiskey barrel in the corner sams dancing was eliciting much applause from the motley crowd of debauchees who were present in great numbers

 sam  called ellen

sam danced around until he faced the door and nodded to the veiled face that showed itself therein

 sam i would like to see you said ellen

much to the delectation of the spectators sam danced all the way to the door performing some of his most notable feats reaching the door he bowed profoundly and stepped out amid shouts of approval from his fellows

the appearance of a woman for sam did not excite any unusual attention such occurrences in the case of others being very frequent

 sam said ellen  come with me  i want you to do me a kindness

 is that you ellen  whut on earth brung you here  said sam in great astonishment

 i have an enemy sam that is seeking to do me great injury and i need your help

all right ellen  im your man ill kill any nigger that does you harm said sam

 dont say that sam unless you mean it said ellen

 try me was sams laconic response

well well see sam my enemy is a woman

 a woman  i dont like the idea of killing a woman but if you say so ill do it ive done many a shady thing but i aint come to that yet

 i thought you would back out sam

back out who said id back out not this chap of course ill kill the gal but a fellow has got a little conscience and has to feel bad a little bit who is she  

come with me i will show you where she lives and stand there until you are through there is no one in the room with her and you are not in the slightest danger so saying she led the way until at length they arrived at ermas house after assuring themselves that there was no one else near they entered the yard and very stealthily approached the window to ermas room

sam had had previous experience in housebreaking and soon had the blinds removed and an opening made in the window he noiselessly clambered into ermas room having his long keen knife in his hand the lamp was dimly burning on a stand near the head of the bed by the side of the lamp was a bouquet of beautiful flowers which astral had given erma that evening and which she had placed where she could see them in the night if she should awake she also desired that they should be the first object on which her eyes should fall on awaking the next day

sam drew near the bed with uplifted knife

there erma lay in all her beauty a lovely smile upon her face even in her sleep her hair was lying carelessly about her brow and caused her to present the appearance of wild loveliness

sam halted so beautiful was the image before him his arm descended to his side and he continued to gaze he said to himself  if i kill that girl it will have to be with my eyes shut he closes his eyes and creeps closer to the bedside he lifts his hand again to strike and opens his eyes to note the spot where a blow delivered would reach her heart again ermas beauty charms him

sam mutters to himself  ellen told me she wanted me to kill a woman and dad gum it this is an angel so saying he turned around and got back out of the window

 is she dead   asked ellen eagerly

naw dad gum it she aint dead and another thing if ever any harm befalls that girl ill tell about this nights work and ill kill you besides so saying he walked away carrying in his mind a picture of the beautiful erma

ellen thoroughly dejected and full of fear as to the revelations that sam might make returned to her home

when some weeks later word was brought to her that erma wysong had passed away and that it was happy erma herndon now  when word came that astral herndon had declared himself in favor of building a monument to the skies in honor of cupid for having brought him so glorious a prizeâwhen these facts were brought to her ladyship ellen sanders she remembered sam rossâand said nothing

eternity has clasped a few more of her romping children the mad galloping years to her eager bosom since you last gazed upon the countenances of the principal actors in our little drama winter the frozen love of god is upon its annual visit to earth and astral and erma wysong herndon are spending the winter eve in their cosy modestly furnished home before a grate full of live glowing coals while little astral herndon jr a pretty precocious child of seven summers is astride his fond papas knee gazing thoughtfully out of his pretty brown eyes into the fire erma yet wearing black for her brother john has grown more beautiful with the years and her rounded matronly form presents fresh beauties to astrals eyes each time he looks in her direction which be assured is not seldom she is now holding a book before her face and is supposed to be reading but in reality she is furtively watching her boy and notes with a heaving bosom the manlike sobriety on his face

there were strange experiences connected with the birth of that child it was on this wise when erma knew that god would bless her with an offspring she besought astral to allow her to leave richmond and stay until her child was born she asked to be separated from him and from the world until god had fully wrought upon the human being whom he was shortly to introduce into the world through her the volcanic eruptions that had from time to time hurled forth their smoke and lava upon ermas soul had left huge craters in her heart so deep as to be unfathomable by means of mortal measuring lines  so wide that human ken could not span from side to side astral knew and felt this and learned to look uponhis wife as a being in an especial sense the handmaid of god so while not understanding the full meaning of ermas request he stood ready to grant it erma escorted by her husband hied away to the mountains of west virginia and took up her abode on nutalls mountain here astral left her to spend those great days with the plain and simple folk of the mountain fastnesses honest and sturdy and fearless

at the foot of nutalls mountain a few miles distant from the crest lies the kanawha river whose waters quarrel as they tumble over the rocks in the river bed on their way to the sea the path downward from the mountain crest to the river followed alongside of a deep canyon that wound its way serpentlike around the mountain side piloting the mountain streams to their common mother the kanawha river as long as health would permit erma would rise in the morning just before daybreak and descend this long winding rocky pathway to the river delighting to look through the green foliage of the trees rising up from the sides and bottom of the deep gorge mentioned sometimes she would sit upon a huge boulder near at hand and surrounded on all sides by the green foliage drink in the wild untamed beauty of the mountains and commune with the spirit of recklessness and fury that evidently makes the mountain his favorite resort also at night time erma would steal forth and hunting the highest mountain peak would stand and look by the light of the moon from silent sullen range to silent sullen range and marvel at their stillness at these times ermas soul seemed to feel the magnetic sweep of the queenly moon as this lovely woman of the skies gathering her robes about her sped swiftly but noiselessly along the ears of her soul caught the faroff patter of the footfalls of the tiny stars as they journeyed silently on to god the purpose of these protracted communings with the sublime side of nature erma never disclosed to mortal and as soon as astral herndon jr was born and she was able to travel she yielded herself to the yearning arms of her husband who was now present to carry her home

erma watched her child as it grew with more than a mothers interest and noticed with eagerness every expression upon the childs face and every utterance from its childish lips astral soon discovered this preternatural interest in the child and contented himself with watching erma while she watched the child thus it is tonight the child gazes erma watches it and astral watches erma a fierce snowstorm is raging without the mad heavens seem determined to whiten the black earth nothing daunted that all previous efforts in that direction have ended in the slushy mire  something of the fate that has sometimes attended the efforts of reformers to whiten the civic life of humanity the winds seemingly would deter the snowflakes from their fruitless task of whitening the earth catching them just before they reached the ground and whirling them around and around until the snowflakes nimbly twisting out of the hands of the wind fall exhausted upon the earth to learn from experience the treatment often accorded those who would do good the snowstorm continues the child muses the mother watches astral is an onlooker the look of earnestness on the childs brow deepens and deepens and ermas bosom heaves her lips move as if in prayer and the book trembles in her hand by and by the child opens its lips to speak erma leans forward her eyes aglow with strange fire astral feels the fever rising in his veins and somehow regards himself as face to face with a crisis in two souls he realizes that soon his wife and her child shall stand revealed unto each other and a feeling of awe creeps over him

 papa says the child  what do you want me to be when i am a man  

astral can say nothing ermas soul is in her eyes and her heart is thumping as though it would come out the child lifts its eyes and gazes at the burning orbs of its mamma in its simple way it said quietly   mamma i am going to be what you want me to be i can tell that that is what you are looking at me so for

with a scream of joy erma sprang over to her husband and clasped her boy to her bosom while she nestled her throbbing temples on astrals shoulder the soul of the mother had met that of the child and each had discovered its true inward self to the other and erma felt her every prayer answered and her every wish attained

erma said  astral it now makes no difference to the world how soon i leave it  and god may take me at any time

a feeling of terror that caused his innermost soul to shudder stole over astral as he heard these solemn words come forth from ermas lipsâwords that foreshadowed her untimely end verily verily coming events cast their shadows before them

a loud knock at the door succeeded by a dull thud as of a falling body caused astral and erma to spring to their feet taking a lamp in his hand astral went out into the hallway and to the front door he opened the door and a gust of wind blew off the lamp chimney and put out the light the chimney falling to the floor and breaking lighting a lantern he saw the form of a man half buried in the drift of snow before his door astral being a man of considerable strength stooped down lifted the man into his arms and bore him into the room where his wife and child stood in openeyed astonishment

the man was unconscious and astral lay him in the middle of the floor and sought to restore him to consciousness the man had on a long rubber ulster which was buttoned from top to bottom this astral unbuttoned and made the exciting discovery that the man was dressed in the striped clothes of a convict this drew erma to him and she now aided astral in the work of resuscitating him at length the man opened his eyes and languidly fastened his gaze on erma who experienced a strange thrill as she looked into the eyes of this nearly frozen convict the longer she looked the more and more her feelings began to assume definite form and a sensation of terror crept over her until she had to get up and move away the eyes of the convict followed her and continued to affect her strangely

astral did not take note of his wifes discomfiture he asked the man  where did you come from  

he replied in husky tones i have come from hell and am going to heaven the man made an effort to rise and astral aided him he asks is that your wife and child astral nodded assent

send them out of the room or take me out as i have something to say to you

erma grasped up astral herndon jr and went up stairs leaving the convict to talk with her husband but a deep conviction was settling upon her mind and she could not stay there she put her boy down and crept down stairs drawn by an indefinable something to the room where the convict was she did not enter but paced restlessly to and fro in the cold hallway

soon astral came out with the look of a man thoroughly dumfounded he grasped erma by the hand and led her upstairs to her bedroom they sit down and stare at each other astral does not know how to break the news to erma at length he says erma your brother was never hanged he is downstairs now

with a mad leap erma broke out of the room rushed downstairs crying john john   john    when she neared his seat she stopped suddenly her voice ceased abruptly johns head lay limp upon his bosom for his soul had forsaken his body becalmed by a more than human power erma knelt before his chair in which sat the lifeless form and passionately kissed the mute lips that had passed under the ban of eternal silence

oh   she gasped clapping a hand to her heart she attempted to rise but fell forward her head finding a resting place on her dead brothers knee ermas beautiful eyelids closed opened again as if to give a last view and then closed alas forever her heart ceased to beat and her soul stole noiselessly out of her body to return no more

death the subtle crafty relentless foe of human life who lurks within the gloomy shadows which fringe the borderland where time fades away into eternity death who bursting from his sunless home mouldy with the dew of darkness springs upon the unwary traveler and bears him swiftly to the spirit landâ this death walking with ceaseless tread along his dismal pathway has a strange and to us uncanny taste for music when he has borne his victim away he returns to the homes of the bereft wearing a mystic veil plucks with wild abandon at the heart strings of the sorrowing  and with avidity and in ecstasy drinks in the plaintive notes the time beat of which is kept by the steady perpetual fall of drops of blood from the heart however terrible the wail however loud the cry it is but sweet music to the ear of death

but surely surely soulless death for once in his awful journeyings had even his unholy taste for the music of agony fully satisfied as with his ear to astrals throbbing heart he drank in its anguished notes and heard that overburdened thing of grief make its futile attempts to burst through the walls that confined it added to and intensifying his feeling of blighting personal loss his soul was charged with the thought that fate had so needlessly reared a ladder to the unspotted blue of his sky and climbing there had fanned out the sun of his firmament leaving in its stead the sombre shadows the inky hues the gruesome forms of the dread midnight

stunned bewildered dazed astral cast a look of anguish upon the lifeless form of erma and turned away petrified with sorrow he staggered out of the room into the hallway and to the door opening upon the street this he managed to open and stood with bared head facing the storm and welcoming the fury of the elements motionless speechless gazing into the dark abyss beyond astral stood as if rooted to the spot the fury of the skies unconsciously affording congenial association to the wild ragings and frozen sorrows within sulkily the night rolled onward the snowstorm as if grieved to longer beat upon the brow of one in the iron grasp of fate gradually ceased a hush fell upon the winds and they began to speak in whispers afterwards not at all

the remaining hours of the night hearing the ever approaching footfall of the coming dawn leapt over the bars of time and sank into eternity the dawn came cold and cheerless the sun struggled from behind an embankment of clouds and feebly cast a few sickly rays of light over the snowcovered earth and as if ashamed of the feebleness of the effort quickly lifted the clouds to again hide his face and yet astral stood in the doorway as motionless as a stone statue silent as the sphinx

an officer of the law clad in blue and wearing the insignia of his office came trudging along on his way to his  beat when he came opposite to astral he cast a look of earnest inquiry upon the snowcovered man in the doorway the gaze of the policeman in keeping with the wellknown hypnotic influence of the human eye had its effect upon astral suddenly casting his eyes upon the policeman astral sprang toward him grasping him by the shoulder

 sir  cried he  enter my home  enter i say and see the havoc which living side by side with your race has wrought  enter enter i say 

the startled policeman tried to extricate himself from astrals grasp but he continued to drag him to his door the policeman drew his pistol but astral took no notice of this action

perceiving from astrals repeated exhortations that he really desired him to see something and intended him no harm the policeman ceased resisting and allowed himself to be pulled to the door of the room where the dead lay when his eye fell upon the rigid body of the convict on the chair and beheld the form of the beautiful frmaâit too rigid in deathâin terror at the sight he began to struggle to get out of the house astral seemed equally determined to have him drink in the horror of the situation fully the policeman now completely terrorstricken raised the cry of  murder  murder  and struck astral a violent blow on the head as if robbed of life astral fell unconscious upon the floor the noise of the struggle and the cries of the policeman drew a large crowd to the house news of the tragic scenes enacted in that little home spread to the remotest quarters of the city all this while astral lay unconscious on the floor friends now bore his body to his room

a coroners jury was summoned and an inquest was held john wysongs emaciated appearance soon removed all doubt as to what had caused his death the absence of all marks of violence upon erma the calm sweet look upon her face even in death predisposed the jury to look for natural causes for her demise before entering upon the task of finding the cause of her death they all stood and gazed long at her loveliness and a hush of awe fell upon them when at length the doctor had made the necessary examination and pronounced her death due to heart failure the jury filed out before going each juror had cast a parting look at the departed queen of beauty and the last of the official dealings of the anglosaxons with erma were over

friends of astral now took charge of affairs and began to arrange for the interment he being yet unconscious upon his recovery from the swoon he was wildly delirious when made aware by the attending physician that a protracted illness was likely to ensue in astrals case friends saw that it was unwise to delay the funeral services and interment until he could attend

as is well known to the reader erma had an unusually large number of friends among the white people of richmond and these friends petitioned that an opportunity be given them to publicly manifest their esteem in deference to their wishes the funeral services were held at the tabernacle a mammoth structure built for interdenominational use and for union gospel meetings white and colored people by the thousands flocked to the tabernacle to witness the exercises over the remains of erma the services proceeded in the usual way tributes of the very highest nature being paid to the character of the deceased resolutions of respect signed by one hundred of richmonds truest white women were read extolling the name of erma wysong herndon

the last words had been said the organ was playing the final funeral march the pallbearers were halfway down the aisle bearing the coffin to the hearse when lo a loud commanding voice cried halt and the tall form of astral was seen standing in the doorway  bear that coffin back to the front gentlemen said he and with icy clearness all recognized his rights in the matter and the coffin was borne to the front again astral wildeyed fresh from a bed of affliction followed with head bowed and with measured tread mechanically performed taking a position in full view of the entire audience he spoke as follows in a clear calm manner but with a calmness evidently produced by the suppression of powerful emotions ladies and gentlemen  on such an occasion as this only the language of the heart should be heard and it is my purpose to deliver to you a message from my innermost self first of all i wish to give audible expression to the thankfulness that i feel over the tribute of respect paid to my deceased wife by this vast outpouring of citizens of both races

it is your purpose i perceive to bear her remains to your cemetery where her body will obey the summons of nature to return unto the dust whence it came before i can give my sanction to this step there is a question that must be disposed of in a thoroughly satisfactory manner erma wysong herndon was brilliant and true as a girl devoted and worthy as a wife and mother seeking to alter none of your cherished customs aspiring ever and only to live out that life which her soul taught her to be the best yet she suffered countless ills her heart unable longer to bear the strain gave up the struggle and ceased its pulsations while her feet were yet treading that portion of lifes pathway that lies within the summer of mans existence i utter not these words by way of reproach believe me i but recall facts well known by you to be such that you may grasp the full purport of what i am now to lay before you

you now desire that her body shall go to enrich this soil should i allow you to proceed will this land which her dust would help to composeâwill this land render to the son of another mother more than it will to the son that she leaves behind though the two be equal in virtue in intelligence in thrift in all that goes to comprise vigorous and aggressive manhood  i pause for an answer

the silence was oppressive astral resumed  by your silence i understand that you are unable to assure me that her son shall not be confronted with the same unequal conditions that she so often encountered under these circumstances ladies and gentlemen as much as i love this land i must refuse to allow my wife to be interred therein i bid it an eternal farewell

he ceased speaking and strong man that he was fell upon ermas coffin his face buried in his hands one mighty sob forced its way through the bars that held the others back making a supreme effort at selfcontrol he arose and gave notice to proceed the pallbearers lifted their burden again and moved slowly out of the building followed by astral and his son

the great audience continued in silence soberly pondering over the strange and solemn scenes when the hearse had been driven off and the sound of the hoofs of the horses had died away in the distance the people arose and silently left the building departing to their several homes

twilight had come and the dusk of the evening soon enveloped the city drawing closer and closer the curtains of night

that night astral watched by the blinking stars exhumed the body of john wysong and carried it to his home placing it by the side of erma with the room dimly lighted astral took a seat between the two coffins to await the coming of day in the middle of the night he heard a tapping at the window shutters of the room in which he sat keeping company with the dead he arose opened the window and bade the party tapping to enter the invitation was accepted and in stepped a large tall white man of very commanding aspect

 as i expected the man remarked in a low tone aloud to astral he said   mr herndon you are not acquainted with me but your wife was at one time she committed a very grave trust to me and i was faithful thereto but under such circumstances that i dared not to give an account of my stewardship will you let me see the face of this dead man whom you have by her side   astral assented and lanier for it was he stepped to the side of the coffin and gazed long at the features before him he said to himself as he continued to look   yes yes yes  that is john i cannot be mistaken one more secret that by his death is now assuredly reserved for the day of judgment heaving a sigh of relief he turned away and dropped into a chair

astral had resumed his post between the dead lanier now addressed him

mr herndon this is indeed an illchosen occasion on which to approach you on a subject uppermost in my mind yet i must do so now if at all for it is with a view of preventing an action that you contemplate in the near future you propose leaving us i learned at the funeral today

your impression is correct was astrals response

 for the sake of your wifes son hear me for a moment lanier requested

proceed i shall give you such attention as is possible for a man in my situation astral replied

 mr herndon with all its faults this country is by far the greatest on earth you are not now in a condition to decide upon a matter involving your future and the whole life of your child i therefore make a personal appeal to you to abide here and flee not to ills that are certainly worse here he paused but as astral gave no reply he resumed

your status here is but due to conditions inherent in the situation why not bow to the inevitable accept conditions as you find them extract from life as much good as can come from welldirected efforts and beyond this point have no yearnings  develop character earn money contribute to the industrial development of the country exercise your wonderful capacity for humility move continuously in the line of least resistance and somehow all will be well

astral now lifted his head and gazing earnestly at lanier said  i am very grateful to you kind sir for your solicitude one of the most oppressive of the conditions inherent in the situation you say is the fact that one must ever be listening to a sermon on his condition we cannot be guided by the light of our own genius but are the subjects of unending advice the absence of the right of choiceâa right which your presence here tonight deniesâis irksome so irksome

you kind sir have solved the problem of life to your own satisfaction  let me do the like will you especially when i seek not to alter your conditions but to abandon them  without the least purpose or desire to be discourteous may i regard our interview at a close  astrals very soul was in these words and were delivered in such a manner as to startle lanier into greater admiration

no sir mr herndon not until i state that your remarks have won my most profound respect i appreciate the desire of your soul for silence which in your case amounts to a need i abandon the purpose of my visit in whatever direction you may go my goodwill follows you lanier said most feelingly so saying he arose extended to astral his hand and bade him a cordial adieu

astral resumed his solitary watch with his dead when day came he began his projected journey accompained by his son and the bodies of his wife and her brother he went to new york with the purpose of boarding an outward bound vessel

are you returning to your fatherland anxious friends gathered at the pier inquired

astral replied it too is overshadowed aliens possess it

 where then are you going  astral faintly smiled as if in farewell but gave no reply he hurried aboard the vessel and was soon speeding away from the laud of his birth

when in midocean he summoned his fellow passengers about him to participate in a burial service the caskets containing the remains of the two departed were gently lowered into the depths of the ocean and committed to the keeping of the waves

astral then stationed his son upon a chair in the center of the deck of the ship and standing by his side with solemn mien and head uncovered made the following deliverance in the presence of the assembled passengers who had heard previously from his lips the story of ermas life  my son said he  your mother has been buried in these domains because here there abides no social group in which conditions operate toward the overshadowing of such elements as are not deemed assimilable and now i astral herndon hereby and forever renounce all citizenship in all lands whatsoever and constitute myself a citizen of the ocean and ordain that this title shall be entailed upon my progeny unto all generations until such time as the shadows which now envelope the darker races in all lands shall have passed away away and away  

epilogue

a lay to the coming king

erma is dead and disconsolate astral is adrift upon the ocean

we who have followed their fortunes lo these many days are loth to leave them until our minds can fasten on some circumstance external to our being to confirm the thought that perennially rises within and bids us believe that their lives have not been spent in vain  that  somehow good will be the final goal of ill

those who seek for assurance of this hope would do well to recall the romantic circumstances attendant upon the birth of ermas son recall how that on the last night of ermas abode on earth the spirits of the mother and son went forth to meet and stand revealed unto each other these circumstances are pregnant with hope and kindle within one the spirit of prophecy

the spell is upon us  we don the garb of the seer wrest the veil from the face of the future and read in her countenance tokens of the irrevocable decrees written by her in the book of fate

we behold that she hath decreed that astral herndon jr shall not long abide on the ocean that he shall ere long make a landing and give evidence that the mountainimbued son of a handmaid of god is a geniusâone of those few colossal immeasurable spirits that have been permitted from time to time to dwell among men for a season  whose presence is made manifest through the trembling of the frail earth beneath their ponderous tread

under the influences which this child of destiny shall generate the negro shall emerge from his centuries of gloom with a hopeemblazoned brow a heart freighted with courage and a chisel in his hand to carve whether you will or not his name in the hall of fame

verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done in this hope we calmly abide the coming of ermas son astral herndon jr in that day pleasing thought erma shall live again in the wondrous workings of the child whom she has brought to earth all hail to erma
