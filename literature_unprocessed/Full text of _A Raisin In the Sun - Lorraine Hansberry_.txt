To Mama:
gratitude for the dream

What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up
Like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore—
And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat
Or crust and sugar over—
Like a syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags
Like a heavy load.

Or does it explode ?

INTRODUCTION
by Robert Nemiroff-

This is the most complete edition of A Raisin in the Sun
ever published. Like the American Playhouse production
for television, it restores to the play two scenes unknown to
the general public, and a number of other key scenes and
passages staged for the first time in twenty-fifth anniversary
revivals and, most notably, the Roundabout Theatre's
Kennedy Center production on which the television picture
is based.
“The events of every passing year add resonance to A
Raisin in the Sun. It is as if history is conspiring to make
the play a classic”; "... one of a handful of great American
dramas ... A Raisin in the Sun belongs in the inner circle,
along with Death of a Salesman, Long Day’s Journey into
Night, and The Glass Menagerie.” So wrote The New York
Times and the Washington Post respectively of Harold
Scott’s revelatory stagings for the Roundabout in which
most of these elements, cut on Broadway, were restored.
The unprecedented resurgence of the work (a dozen
regional revivals at this writing, new publications and
productions abroad, and now the television production that
will be seen by millions) prompts the new edition.
Produced in 1959, the play presaged the revolution in
black and women’s consciousness—and the revolutionary
ferment in Africa—that exploded in the years following the
playwright’s death in 1965 to ineradicably alter the social
fabric and consciousness of the nation and the world. As so
many have commented lately, it did so in a manner and to
an extent that few could have foreseen, for not only the

restored material, but much else that passed unnoticed in
the play at the time, speaks to issues that are now
inescapable: value systems of the black family; concepts of
African American beauty and identity; class and
generational conflicts; the relationships of husbands and
wives, black men and women; the outspoken (if then yet
unnamed) feminism of the daughter; and, in the penultimate
scene between Beneatha and Asagai, the larger statement
of the play—and the ongoing struggle it portends.

Not one of the cuts, it should be emphasized, was made
to dilute or censor the play or to "soften” its statement, for
everyone in that herculean, now-legendary band that
brought Raisin to Broadway—and most specifically the
producer, Philip Rose, and director, Lloyd Richards
—believed in the importance of that statement with a
degree of commitment that would have countenanced
nothing of the kind. How and why, then, did the cuts come
about?
The scene in which Beneatha unveils her natural haircut
is an interesting example. In 1959, when the play was
presented, the rich variety of Afro styles introduced in the
mid-sixties had not yet arrived: the very few black women
who wore their hair unstraightened cut it very short. When
the hair of Diana Sands (who created the role) was
cropped in this fashion, however, a few days before the
opening, it was not contoured to suit her: her particular
facial structure required a fuller Afro, of the sort she in fact
adopted in later years. Result? Rather than vitiate the
playwright’s point—the beauty of black hair—the scene
was dropped.
Some cuts were similarly the result of happenstance or
unpredictables of the kind that occur in any production:
difficulties with a scene, the “processes” of actors, the
dynamics of staging, etc. But most were related to the
length of the play: running time. Time in the context of
bringing to Broadway the first play by a black (young and

unknown) woman, to be directed, moreover, by another
unknown black “first,” in a theater were black audiences
virtually did not exist—and where, in the entire history of the
American stage, there had never been a serious
commercially successful black drama!
So unlikely did the prospects seem in that day, in fact, to
all but Phil Rose and the company, that much as some
expressed admiration for the play, Rose’s eighteen-month
effort to find a co-producer to help complete the financing
was turned down by virtually every established name in the
business. He was joined at the last by another newcomer,
David Cogan, but even with the money in hand, not a single
theater owner on the Great White Way would rent to the
new production! So that when the play left New York for

tryouts—with a six-hundred-dollar advance in New Haven
and no theater to come back to—had the script and
performance been any less ready, and the response of
critics and audiences any less unreserved than they proved
to be, A Raisin in the Sun would never have reached
Broadway.
Under these circumstances the pressures were
enormous (if unspoken and rarely even acknowledged in
the excitement of the work)nof to press fate unduly with
unnecessary risks. And the most obvious of these was the
running time. It is one thing to present a four-and-a-half-hour
drama by Eugene O’Neill on Broadway—but a first play
(even ignoring the special features of this one) in the
neighborhood of even three ??? By common consensus,
the need to keep the show as tight and streamlined as
possible was manifest. Some things—philosophical flights,
nuances the general audience might not understand,
shadings, embellishments—would have to be sacrificed.
At the time the cuts were made (there were also some
very good ones that focused and strengthened the drama),
it was assumed by all that they would in no way significantly
affect or alter the statement of the play, for there is nothing

in the omitted lines that is not implicit elsewhere in, and
throughout, A Raisin in the Sun. But to think this was to
reckon without two factors the future would bring into play.
The first was the swiftness and depth of the revolution in
consciousness that was coming and the consequent,
perhaps inevitable, tendency of some people to assume,
because the “world” had changed, that any “successful”
work which preceded the change must embody the values
they had outgrown. And the second was the nature of the
American audience.
James Baldwin has written that “Americans suffer from
an ignorance that is not only colossal, but sacred.” He is
referring to that apparently endless capacity we have
nurtured through long years to deceive ourselves where
race is concerned: the baggage of myth and preconception
we carry with us that enables northerners, for example, to
shield themselves from the extent and virulence of
segregation in the North, so that each time an “incident” of
violence so egregious that they cannot look past it occurs
they are “shocked” anew, as if it had never happened

before or as if the problem were largely passe. (In 1975,
when the cast of Raisin, the musical, became involved in
defense of a family whose home in Queens, New York City,
had been fire-bombed, we learned of a 1972 City
Commissioner of Human Rights Report, citing “eleven
cases in the last eighteen months in which minority-owned
homes had been set afire or vandalized, a church had been
bombed, and a school bus had been attacked”—in New
York City!)
But Baldwin is referring also to the human capacity,
where a work of art is involved, to substitute, for what the
writer has written, what in our hearts we wsh to believe. As
Hansberry put it in response to one reviewer’s enthusiastic
if particularly misguided praise of her play: "... it did not
disturb the writer in the least that there is no such
implication in the entire three acts. He did not need it in the

play; he had it in his head.’Such problems did not, needless to say, stop America
from embracing A Raisin in the Sun. But it did interfere
drastically, for a generation, with the way the play was
interpreted and assessed—and, in hindsight, it made all
the more regrettable the abridgment (though without it
would we even know the play today?). In a remarkable
rumination on Hansberrys death, Ossie Davis (who
succeeded Sidney Poitier in the role of Walter Lee) put it
this way:
The play deserved all this—the playwright deserved all
this, and more. Beyond question! But I have a feeling
that for all she got, Lorraine Hansberry never got all
she deserved in regard to A Raisin in the Sun —that
she got success, but that in her success she was
cheated, both as a writer and as a Negro.
One of the biggest selling points about Raisin —
filling the grapevine, riding the word-of-mouth, laying
the foundation for its wide, wide acceptance—was
how much the Younger family was just like any other
American family. Some people were ecstatic to find
that “it didn't really have to be about Negroes at all!” It
was, rather, a walking, talking, living demonstration of
our mythic conviction that, underneath, all of us
Americans, color-aint-got-nothing-to-do-wth-it, are

pretty much alike. People are just people, whoever
they are; and all they want is a chance to be like other
people. This uncritical assumption, sentimentally held
by the audience, powerfully fixed in the character of the
powerful mother with whom everybody could identify,
immediately and completely, made any other
questions about the Youngers, and what living in the
slums of Southside Chicago had done to them, not
only irrelevant and impertinent, but also
disloyal ... because everybody who walked into the

theater saw in Lena Younger ... his own great
American Mama. And that was decisive.In effect, as Davis went on to develop, white America
“kidnapped” Mama, stole her away and used her fantasized
image to avoid what was uniquely African American in the
play. And what it was saying.
Thus, in many reviews (and later academic studies), the
Younger family—maintained by two female domestics and
a chauffeur, son of a laborer dead of a lifetime of hard labor
—was transformed into an acceptably “middle class”
family. The decision to move became a desire to
“integrate" (rather than, as Mama says simply, “to find the
nicest house for the least amount of money for my family....
Them houses they put up for colored in them areas way out
always seem to cost twice as much.”).
In his “A Critical Reevaluation: A Raisin in the Sun’s
Enduring Passion,” Amiri Baraka comments aptly: “We
missed the essence of the work—that Hansberry had
created a family on the cutting edge of the same class and
ideological struggles as existed in the movement itself and
among the people.... The Younger family is part of the
black majority, and the concerns I once dismissed as
‘middle class'—buying a home and moving into ‘white
folks’ neighborhoods’—are actually reflective of the
essence of black people’s striving and the will to defeat
segregation, discrimination, and national oppression.
There is no such thing as a ‘white folks’ neighborhood’
except to racists and to those submitting to racism .”2
Mama herself—about whose “acceptance” of her “place”
in the society there is not a word in the play, and who, in
quest of her family’s survival over the soul- and body¬
crushing conditions of the ghetto, is prepared to defy

housing-pattern taboos, threats, bombs, and God knows
what else—became the safely “conservative” matriarch,
upholder of the social order and proof that if one only

perseveres with faith, everything will come out right in the
end and the-system-ain’t-so-bad-after-all. (All this,
presumably, because, true to character, she speaks and
thinks in the language of her generation, shares their
dream of a better life and, like millions of her counterparts,
takes her Christianity to heart.) At the same time,
necessarily, Big Walter Younger—the husband who reared
this family with her and whose unseen presence and
influence can be heard in every scene—vanished from
analysis.
And perhaps most ironical of all to the playwright, who
had herself as a child been almost killed in such a real-life
story,- the climax of the play became, pure and simple, a
“happy ending”—despite the fact that it leaves the
Youngers on the brink of what will surely be, in their new
home, at best a nightmare of uncertainty. (“If he thinks that's
a happy ending,” said Hansberry in an interview, “I invite
him to come live in one of the communities where the
Youngers are going!”-) Which is not even to mention the
fact that that little house in a blue-collar neighborhood—
hardly suburbia, as some have imagined—is hardly the
answer to the deeper needs and inequities of race and
class and sex that Walter and Beneatha have articulated.
When Lorraine Hansberry read the reviews—delighted
by the accolades, grateful for the recognition, but also
deeply troubled—she decided in short order to put back
many of the materials excised. She did that in the 1959
Random House edition, but faced with the actuality of a
prize-winning play, she hesitated about some others which,
for reasons now beside the point, had not in rehearsal
come alive. She later felt, however, that the full last scene
between Beneatha and Asagai (drastically cut on
Broadway) and Walter’s bedtime scene with Travis
(eliminated entirely) should be restored at the first
opportunity, and this was done in the 1966 New American
Library edition. As anyone who has seen the recent

productions will attest, they are among the most moving
(and most applauded) moments in the play.

Because the visit of Mrs. Johnson adds the costs of
another character to the cast and ten more minutes to the
play, it has not been used in most revivals. But where it has
been tried it has worked to solid—often hilarious—effect. It
can be seen in the American Playhouse production, and is
included here in any case, because it speaks to
fundamental issues of the play, makes plain the reality that
waits the Youngers at the curtain, and, above all, makes
clear what, in the eyes of the author, Lena Younger—in her
typicality within the black experience—does and does not
represent.
Another scene—the Act I, Scene Two moment in which
Beneatha observes and Travis gleefully recounts his latest
adventure in the street below—makes tangible and visceral
one of the many facts of ghetto life that impel the Youngers’
move. As captured on television and published here for the
first time, it is its own sobering comment on just how
“middle class” a family this is.
A word about the stage and interpretive directions.
These are the author’s original directions combined, where
meaningful to the reader,- with the staging insights of two
great directors and companies: Lloyd Richards’ classic
staging of that now-legendary cast that first created the
roles; and Harold Scott’s, whose searching explorations of
the text in successive revivals over many years—
culminating in the inspired production that broke box office
records at the Kennedy Center and won ten awards for
Scott and the company—have given the fuller text, in my
view, its most definitive realization to date.
Finally, a note about the American Playhouse production.
Unlike the drastically cut and largely one-dimensional 1961
movie version—which, affecting and pioneering though it
may have been, reflected little of the greatness of the
original stage performances—this new screen version is a

luminous embodiment of the stage play as reconceived, but
not altered, for the camera, and is exquisitely performed.
That it is, is due inextricably to producer Chiz Schultz’s and
director Bill Duke’s unswerving commitment to the text;
Harold Scott’s formative work with the stage company;
Duke’s own fresh insights and the cinematic brilliance of
his reconception and direction for the screen; and the
energizing infusion into this mix of Danny Glover’s classic
performance as Walter Lee to Esther Rolle’s superlative

Mama. As in the case of any production, I am apt to
question a nuance here and there, and regrettably,
because of a happenstance in production, the WalterTravis scene has been omitted. But that scene will, I expect,
be restored in the videocassette version of the picture,
which should be available shortly. It is thus an excellent
version for study.
What is for me personally, as a witness to and sometime
participant in the foregoing events, most gratifying about
the current revival is that today, some twenty-nine years
after Lorraine Hansberry, thinking back with disbelief a few
nights after the opening of Raisin, typed out these words—
... I had turned the last page out of the typewriter and
pressed all the sheets neatly together in a pile, and
gone and stretched out face down on the living room
floor. I had finished a play; a play I had no reason to
think or not think would ever be done; a play that I was
sure no one would quite understand.... —her play is not only being done, but that more than she
had ever thought possible—and more clearly than it ever
has been before—it is being “understood.”
Yet one last point that I must make because it has come
up so many times of late. I have been asked if I am not
surprised that the play still remains so contemporary, and
isn’t that a “sad” commentary on America? It is indeed a

sad commentary, but the question also assumed
something more: that it is the topicality of the play's
immediate events—i.e., the persistence of white opposition
to unrestricted housing and the ugly manifestations of
racism in its myriad forms—that keeps it alive. But I don't
believe that such alone is what explains its vitality at all. For
though the specifics of social mores and societal patterns
will always change, the decline of the “New England
territory” and the institution of the traveling salesman does
not, for example, “date” Death of a Salesman, any more
than the fact that we now recognize love (as opposed to
interfamilial politics) as a legitimate basis for marriage
obviates Romeo and Juliet, if we ever reach a time when
the racial madness that afflicts America is at last truly
behind us—as obviously ne must if we are to survive in a
world composed four-fifths of peoples of color—then I
believe A Raisin in the Sun will remain no less pertinent.

For at the deepest level it is not a specific situation but the
human condition, human aspiration, and human
relationships—the persistence of dreams, of the bonds and
conflicts between men and women, parents and children,
old ways and new, and the endless struggle against human
oppression, whatever the forms it may take, and for
individual fulfillment, recognition, and liberation—that are at
the heart of such plays. It is not surprising therefore that in
each generation we recognize ourselves in them anew.

-the late ROBERT NEMIROFF, Lorraine Hansberry’s literary executor,
shared a working relationship with the playwright from the time of their

marriage in 1953. He was the producer and/or adapter of several of her
works, including The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window; To Be Young,
Gifted and Black; and Les Blancs. In 1974, his production of the
musical Raisin, based on A Raisin in the Sun, won the Tony Award for
Best Musical.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In addition to individuals and institutions recalled above and
in the American Playhouse and Broadway credits—and the
many others too numerous to record who have contributed
to the current revival—I wish especially to thank:

• Gene Feist and Todd Haimes of the Roundabout
Theatre, without whom what followed could never
have been;
• Burt D’Lugoff, Howard Hausman, Alan Bomser, and
Seymour Baldash, whose support and critical
judgment have been invaluable;
• Jaki Brown, Toni Livingston, and Josephine Abady,
who first dared to dream and then to break the first
ground to bring Raisin to television;
• Esther Rolle and all in the Roundabout Raisin “family”
whose unwavering commitment through three onagain, off-again, touch-and-go years were the rock on
which the production stood;
• Danny Glover, whose name, alongside Ms. Rolle’s,
made the production possible but did not prepare
one for the magnificent actuality of his work;
• David M. Davis and Lindsay Law of American
Playhouse; Ricki Franklin, Phylis Geller, and Samuel
J. Paul of KCET/Los Angeles; and David Loxton and
WNET/New York—who extended every cooperation
and maximum freedom for us to develop and produce
the television production as we saw it; and

• Producer Chiz Schultz and co-producer Steve

Schwartz, who brought to the new incarnation not only
impeccable judgment and assured expertise, but an
integrity of caring dedication to the playwright’s vision
and text that one meets rarely, if ever, at the
crossroads of art and commerce.
I regret that there is not the space to name here, too,
each of the wonderful actors, understudies, designers,
technicians, and staff of both the Roundabout and television
productions who do not appear in the Playhouse credits,
but whose contributions and spirits are joined to those of
their colleagues on screen. I am indebted to them all.
And, finally, two in a place by themselves:

• My wife, Jewell Handy Gresham, who has stood
unbending through the worst and the best of times,
providing light and unfailing inspiration to the vision
we share; and
• Samuel Liff of the William Morris Agency, without
whose personal commitment and extraordinary
perseverance going far beyond the professional to a
true love of theater and art, much that has happened
could never have been.

Act III
An hour later.

ACT I

SCENE ONE
The younger living room would be a comfortable and
well-ordered room if it were not for a number of
indestructible contradictions to this state of being. Its
furnishings are typical and undistinguished and their
primary feature now is that they have clearly had to
accommodate the living of too many people for too many
years—and they are tired. Still, we can see that at some
time, a time probably no longer remembered by the
family (except perhaps for MAMA), the furnishings of this
room were actually selected with care and love and even
hope—and brought to this apartment and arranged with
taste and pride.
That was a long time ago. Nowthe once loved pattern of
the couch upholstery has to fight to show itself from under
acres of crocheted doilies and couch covers which have
themselves finally come to be more important than the
upholstery. And here a table or a chair has been moved
to disguise the worn places in the carpet; but the carpet
has fought back by showing its weariness, with depressing
uniformity, elsewhere on its surface.
Weariness has, in fact, won in this room. Everything has
been polished, washed, sat on, used, scrubbed too often.
All pretenses but living itself have long since vanished
from the very atmosphere of this room.
Moreover, a section of this room, for it is not really a
room unto itself, though the landlord’s lease would make it

seem so, slopes backward to provide a small kitchen
area, where the family prepares the meals that are eaten
in the living room proper, which must also serve as dining
room. The single windowthat has been provided for these
“two” rooms is located in this kitchen area. The sole
natural light the family may enjoy in the course of a day is
only that which fights its way through this little window.
At left, a door leads to a bedroom which is shared by
mama and her daughter, beneatha. At right, opposite, is a
second room (which in the beginning of the life of this
apartment was probably a breakfast room) which serves
as a bedroom for Walter and his wife, ruth.
Time: Sometime between World War II and the present.
Place: Chicago’s Southside.
At Rise: It is morning dark in the living room, travis is
asleep on the make-down bed at center. An alarm clock
sounds from within the bedroom at right, and presently
ruth enters from that room and closes the door behind
her. She crosses sleepily toward the window As she
passes her sleeping son she reaches down and shakes
him a little. At the window she raises the shade and a
dusky Southside morning light comes in feebly. She fills
a pot with water and puts it on to boil. She calls to the boy,
between yawns, in a slightly muffled voice.
ruth is about thirty. We can see that she was a pretty
girl, even exceptionally so, but nowit is apparent that life
has been little that she expected, and disappointment has
already begun to hang in her face. In a few years, before
thirty-five even, she will be known among her people as a
“settled woman.”
She crosses to her son and gives him a good, final,
rousing shake.

RUTH Come on now, boy, it’s seven thirty! (Her son sits up
at last, in a stupor of sleepiness) I say hurry up, Travis!

You ain’t the only person in the world got to use a

bathroom! (The child, a sturdy, handsome little boy of
ten or eleven, drags himself out of the bed and almost
blindly takes his towels and ‘today's clothes” from
drawers and a closet and goes out to the bathroom,
which is in an outside hall and which is shared by
another family or families on the same floor, ruth
crosses to the bedroom door at right and opens it and
calls in to her husband) Walter Lee! ... It’s after seven
thirty! Lemme see you do some waking up in there now!
(She weits) You better get up from there, man! It’s after
seven thirty I tell you. (She weits again) All right, you just
go ahead and lay there and next thing you know Travis
be finished and Mr. Johnson’ll be in there and you'll be
fussing and cussing round here like a madman! And be
late too! (She weits, at the end of patience) Walter Lee
—it’s time for you to GET UP!
(She weits another second and then starts to go
into the bedroom, but is apparently satisfied that
her husband has begun to get up. She stops,
pulls the door to, and returns to the kitchen area.
She wipes her face with a moist cloth and mns
her fingers through her sleep-disheveled hair in
a vain effort and ties an apron around her
housecoat. The bedroom door at right opens
and her husband stands in the doorway in his
pajamas, which are rumpled and mismated. He
is a lean, intense young man in his middle
thirties, inclined to quick nervous movements
and erratic speech habits—and always in his
voice there is a quality of indictment)

WALTER Is he out yet?
RUTH What you mean out? He ain’t hardly got in there good

yet.
Walter ( Wandering in, still more oriented to sleep than to
a newday) Well, what was you doing all that yelling for if I
can't even get in there yet? ( Stopping and thinking)
Check coming today?
RUTH They said Saturday and this is just Friday and I hopes
to God you ain't going to get up here first thing this

morning and start talking to me 'bout no money—’cause I
'bout don’t want to hear it.
WALTER Something the matter with you this morning?
RUTH No—I’m just sleepy as the devil. What kind of eggs
you want?
WALTER Not scrambled, (ruth starts to scramble eggs)
Paper come? (ruth points impatiently to the rolled up
Tribune on the table, and he gets it and spreads it out
and vaguely reads the front page) Set off another bomb
yesterday.
ruth ( Maximum indifference) Did they?
WALTER ( Looking up) What’s the matter with you?
RUTH Ain’t nothing the matter with me. And don’t keep
asking me that this morning.
WALTER Ain’t nobody bothering you. (Reading the news of
the day absently again) Say Colonel McCormick is sick.
RUTH (Affecting tea-party interest) Is he now? Poor thing.
WALTER (Sighing and looking at his mtch) Oh, me. (He
mits) Now what is that boy doing in that bathroom all this
time? He just going to have to start getting up earlier. I
can't be being late to work on account of him fooling
around in there.
RUTH (Turning on him) Oh, no he ain’t going to be getting
up no earlier no such thing! It ain’t his fault that he can’t
get to bed no earlier nights ’cause he got a bunch of

crazy good-for-nothing clowns sitting up running their
mouths in what is supposed to be his bedroom after ten
o’clock at night...
WALTER That's what you mad about, ain’t it? The things I
want to talk about with my friends just couldn’t be
important in your mind, could they?
(He rises and finds a cigarette in her handbag on
the table and crosses to the little window and

looks out, smoking and deeply enjoying this first
one)
ruth (Almost matter of factly, a complaint too automatic to
deserve emphasis) Why you always got to smoke before
you eat in the morning?
WALTER (At the window/) Just look at ’em down
there ... Running and racing to work ... (He turns and
faces his wife and watches her a moment at the stove,
and then, suddenly) You look young this morning, baby.
ruth (Indifferently) Yeah?
WALTER Just for a second—stirring them eggs. Just for a
second it was—you looked real young again. (He
reaches for her; she crosses away. Then, drily) It’s gone
now—you look like yourself again!
RUTH Man, if you don’t shut up and leave me alone.
WALTER (Looking out to the street again) First thing a man
ought to learn in life is not to make love to no colored
woman first thing in the morning. You all some eeeevil
people at eight o’clock in the morning.
(TRAVIS appears in the hall doorway, almost fully
dressed and quite wide awake novv his towels
and pajamas across his shoulders. He opens
the door and signals for his father to make the

bathroom in a hurry)
travis ( Watching the bathroom) Daddy, come on!
(Walter gets his bathroom utensils and flies out
to the bathroom)
RUTH Sit down and have your breakfast, Travis.
TRAVIS Mama, this is Friday. ( Gleefully) Check coming
tomorrow, huh?
RUTH You get your mind off money and eat your breakfast.
TRAVIS ( Eating ) This is the morning we supposed to bring

the fifty cents to school.
RUTH Well, I ain’t got no fifty cents this morning.
TRAVIS Teacher say we have to.
RUTH I don't care what teacher say. I ain’t got it. Eat your
breakfast, Travis.
TRAVIS I am eating.
RUTH Hush up now and just eat!
(The boy gives her an exasperated look for her
lack of understanding, and eats grudgingly)
TRAVIS You think Grandmama would have it?
RUTH No! And I want you to stop asking your grandmother
for money, you hear me?
TRAVIS ( Outraged) Gaaaleee! I don’t ask her, she just
gimme it sometimes!
RUTH Travis Willard Younger—I got too much on me this
morning to be—
TRAVIS Maybe Daddy—
ruth Travis!

(The boy hushes abruptly. They are both quiet
and tense for several seconds)
TRAVIS (Presently) Could I maybe go carry some groceries
in front of the supermarket for a little while after school
then?
rltth Just hush, I said. (Travis jabs his spoon into his
cereal bovJ viciously, and rests his head in anger upon
his fists) tf you through eating, you can get over there and
make up your bed.
(The boy obeys stiffly and crosses the room,
almost mechanically, to the bed and more or
less folds the bedding into a heap, then angrily

gets his books and cap)
travis (Sulking and standing apart from her unnaturally)
I’m gone.
rltth (Looking up from the stove to inspect him
automatically) Come here. (He crosses to her and she
studies his head) If you don’t take this comb and fix this
here head, you better! (TRAVIS puts down his books with
a great sigh of oppression, and crosses to the mirror.
His mother mutters under her breath about his
“stubbornness') ’Bout to march out of here with that head
looking just like chickens slept in it! I just don’t know
where you get your slubborn ways ...And get your jacket,
too. Looks chilly out this morning.
travis (With conspicuously brushed hair and jacket) I’m
gone.
RLTTH Get carfare and milk money— (Waving one finger )—
and not a single penny for no caps, you hear me?
travis (With sullen politeness) Yes’m.

(He turns in outrage to leave. His mother
watches after him as in his fmstration he
approaches the door almost comically. When
she speaks to him, her voice has become a very
gentle tease)
ruth ( Mocking; as she thinks he would say it) Oh, Mama
makes me so mad sometimes, I don't know what to do!
(She waits and continues to his back as he stands
stock-still in front of the door) I wouldn’t kiss that woman
good-bye for nothing in this world this morning! (The boy
finally turns around and rolls his eyes at her, knowing
the mood has changed and he is vindicated; he does
not, however, move toward her yet) Not for nothing in this
world! (She finally laughs aloud at him and holds out
her arms to him and we see that it is a way between
them, very old and practiced. He crosses to her and
allows her to embrace him warmly but keeps his face
fixed with masculine rigidity. She holds him back from
her presently and looks at him and runs her fingers
over the features of his face. With utter gentleness —)
Now—whose little old angry man are you?

TRAVIS (The masculinity and gruffness start to fade at last)
Awgaalee—Mama ...
RUTH (Mimicking) Aw gaaaaalleeeee, Mama! (She pushes
him, with rough playfulness and finality, toward the door)
Get on out of here or you going to be late.
TRAVIS (In the face of love, new aggressiveness) Mama,
could I please go carry groceries?
RUTH Honey, it’s starting to get so cold evenings.
WALTER (Coming in from the bathroom and drawing a
make-believe gun from a make-believe holster and
shooting at his son) What is it he wants to do?

RUTH Go carry groceries after school at the supermarket.
WALTER Well, let him go ...
TRAVIS ( Quickly ; to the ally) I have to—she won’t gimme
the fifty cents ...
WALTER ( To his wife only) Why not?
RUTH ( Simply, and with flavor) ’Cause we don’t have it.
WALTER (To RUTH only) What you tell the boy things like that
for? (Reaching down into his pants wth a rather
important gesture) Here, son—
(He hands the boy the coin, but his eyes are
directed to his wife’s, travis takes the money
happily)
TRAVIS Thanks, Daddy.
(He starts out. ruth watches both of them wth
murder in her eyes. Walter stands and stares
back at her wth defiance, and suddenly reaches
into his pocket again on an afterthought)
Walter ( Without even looking at his son, still staring hard
at his wfe) In fact, here’s another fifty cents ... Buy
yourself some fruit today—or take a taxicab to school or
something!

TRAVIS Whoopee—
(He leaps up and clasps his father around the
middle wth his legs, and they face each other in
mutual appreciation; slowly Walter lee peeks
around the boy to catch the violent rays from his
wife’s eyes and draws his head back as if shot)
WALTER You better get down now—and get to school, man.

TRAVIS (At the door) O.K. Good-bye.

(He exits)
WALTER (After him, pointing with pride) That’s my boy.
(She looks at him in disgust and turns back to her work)
You know what I was thinking ’bout in the bathroom this
morning?
RLTTHNo.
WALTER How come you always try to be so pleasant!
RUTH What is there to be pleasant ’bout!
WALTER You want to know what I was thinking ’bout in the
bathroom or not!
RUTH I know what you thinking ’bout.
WALTER (Ignoring her) 'Bout what me and Willy Harris was
talking about last night.
RUTH ( Immediately —a refrain) Willy Harris is a good-fornothing loudmouth.
WALTER Anybody who talks to me has got to be a good-fornothing loudmouth, ain’t he? And what you know about
who is just a good-for-nothing loudmouth? Charlie Atkins
was just a "good-for-nothing loudmouth” too, wasn’t he!
When he wanted me to go in the dry-cleaning business
with him. And now—he’s grossing a hundred thousand a
year. A hundred thousand dollars a year! You still call him
a loudmouth!

(She folds her head on her arms over the table)
Walter (Rising and coming to her and standing over her)
You tired, ain’t you? Tired of everything. Me, the boy, the
way we live—this beat-up hole—everything. Ain’t you?
(She doesn’t look up, doesn’t answer) So tired—

moaning and groaning all the time, but you wouldn't do
nothing to help, would you? You couldn’t be on my side
that long for nothing, could you?
RUTH Walter, please leave me alone.
WALTER A man needs for a woman to back him up ...
RUTH Walter—
WALTER Mama would listen to you. You know she listen to
you more than she do me and Bennie. She think more of
you. All you have to do is just sit down with her when you
drinking your coffee one morning and talking 'bout things
like you do and— (He sits down beside her and
demonstrates graphically what he thinks her methods
and tone should be) —you just sip your coffee, see, and
say easy like that you been thinking 'bout that deal Walter
Lee is so interested in, 'bout the store and all, and sip
some more coffee, like what you saying ain’t really that
important to you— And the next thing you know, she be
listening good and asking you questions and when I
come home—I can tell her the details. This ain’t no fly-bynight proposition, baby. I mean we figured it out, me and
Willy and Bobo.
RUTH ( With a frown) Bobo?
WALTER Yeah. You see, this little liquor store we got in mind
cost seventy-five thousand and we figured the initial
investment on the place be ’bout thirty thousand, see.
That be ten thousand each. Course, there’s a couple of
hundred you got to pay so’s you don’t spend your life just
waiting for them clowns to let your license get approved

WALTER (Frowning impatiently) Don’t call it that. See there,
that just goes to show you what women understand about
the world. Baby, don’t nothing happen for you in this
world ’less you pay somebody off!

RUTH Walter, leave me alone! ( She raises her head and
stares at him vigorously—then says, more quietly) Eat
your eggs, they gonna be cold.
WALTER (Straightening up from her and looking off) That's
it. There you are. Man say to his woman: I got me a
dream. His woman say: Eat your eggs. (Sadly, but
gaining in pov\er) Man say: I got to take hold of this here
world, baby! And a woman will say: Eat your eggs and go
to work. (Passionately noW) Man say: I got to change my
life, I’m choking to death, baby! And his woman say— (In
utter anguish as he brings his fists dom on his thighs)
—Your eggs is getting cold!
RUTH ( Softly ) Walter, that ain’t none of our money.
WALTER (Not listening at all or even looking at her) This
morning, I was lookin’ in the mirror and thinking about
it... I’m thirty-five years old; I been married eleven years
and I got a boy who sleeps in the living room— (Very,
very quietly) —and all I got to give him is stories about
how rich white people live ...
RUTH Eat your eggs, Walter.
WALTER (Slams the table and jumps up) —DAMN MY
EGGS—DAMN ALL THE EGGS THAT EVER WAS!
RUTH Then go to work.
WALTER ( Looking up at her) See—I’m trying to talk to you
’bout myself— (Shaking his head wth the repetition )—
and all you can say is eat them eggs and go to work.
RUTH (Wearily) Honey, you never say nothing new. I listen to
you every day, every night and every morning, and you
never say nothing new. (Shrugging) So you would rather
be Mr. Arnold than be his chauffeur. So—I would rather
be living in Buckingham Palace.

in this world ... Don’t understand about building their men

up and making 'em feel like they somebody. Like they
can do something.
RUTH (Drily, but to hurt) There are colored men who do
things.
WALTER No thanks to the colored woman.
RUTH Well, being a colored woman, I guess I can’t help
myself none.
(She rises and gets the ironing board and sets it
up and attacks a huge pile of rough-dried
clothes, sprinkling them in preparation for the
ironing and then rolling them into tight fat balls)
WALTER ( Mumbling) We one group of men tied to a race of
women with small minds!
(His sister beneatha enters. She is about twenty,
as slim and intense as her brother. She is not as
pretty as her sister-in-law/ but her lean, almost
intellectual face has a handsomeness of its own.
She wears a bhght-red flannel nightie, and her
thick hair stands wildly about her head. Her
speech is a mixture of many things; it is different
from the rest of the family’s insofar as education
has permeated her sense of English—and
perhaps the Midwest rather than the South has
finally—at last—won out in her inflection; but not
altogether, because overall of it is a soft slurring
and transformed use of vowels which is the
decided influence of the Southside. She passes
through the room without looking at either ruth
or Walter and goes to the outside door and
looks, a little blindly, out to the bathroom. She
sees that it has been lost to the Johnsons. She
closes the door with a sleepy vengeance and

crosses to the table and sits dom a little
defeated)

BENEA7HAI am going to start timing those people.
WALTER You should get up earlier.
beneatha ( Her face in her hands. She is still fighting the
urge to go back to bed) Really—would you suggest
dawn? Where’s the paper?
Walter ( Pushing the paper across the table to her as he
studies her almost clinically, as though he has never
seen her before) You a horrible-looking chick at this
hour.
BENEATHA (Drily) Good morning, everybody.
WALTER ( Senselessly) How is school coming?
BENEATHA (In the same spirit) Lovely. Lovely. And you
know, biology is the greatest. (Looking up at him) I
dissected something that looked just like you yesterday.
WALTER I just wondered if you’ve made up your mind and
everything.
beneatha (Gaining in sharpness and impatience) And
what did I answer yesterday morning—and the day
before that?

and old) Don’t be so nasty, Bennie.
BENEATHA (Still to her brother) And the day before that and
the day before that!

wrong with that? Ain’t many girls who decide—

medical school is going to cost?

RUTH Walter Lee, why don't you leave that girl alone and get
out of here to work?

Come on out of there, please!
(She comes back into the room)
WALTER ( Looking at his sister intently) You know the check
is coming tomorrow.
beneatha ( Turning on him wth a sharpness all her own)
That money belongs to Mama, Walter, and it’s for her to
decide how she wants to use it. I don’t care if she wants
to buy a house or a rocket ship or just nail it up
somewhere and look at it. It’s hers. Not ours— hers.
WALTER ( Bitterly) Now ain’t that fine! You just got your
mother’s interest at heart, ain’t you, girl? You such a nice
girl—but if Mama got that money she can always take a
few thousand and help you through school too—can’t
she?
BENEATHA I have never asked anyone around here to do
anything for me!
WALTER No! And the line between asking and just
accepting when the time comes is big and wide—ain’t it!
BENEATHA (With fury) What do you want from me, Brother—
that I quit school or just drop dead, which!
WALTER I don’t want nothing but for you to stop acting holy
’round here. Me and Ruth done made some sacrifices for
you—why can’t you do something for the family?

somebody’s kitchen for the last three years to help put
clothes on her back?

pair of shoes for two semesters—

thank everybody! And forgive me for ever wanting to be
anything at all! (Pursuing him on her knees across the
floor) FORGIVE ME, FORGIVE ME, FORGVE ME!

so crazy ’bout messing 'round with sick people—then go
be a nurse like other women—or just get married and be
quiet...

years but you finally got it said. Walter, give up; leave me
alone—it’s Mama’s money.

BENEATHA So what? He was mine, too—and Travis’
grandfather—but the insurance money belongs to Mama.
Picking on me is not going to make her give it to you to
invest in any liquor stores—( Underbreath, dropping into
a chair )—and I for one say, God bless Mama for that!
WALTER (To RUTH) See—did you hear? Did you hear!
RUTH Honey, please go to work.
WALTER Nobody in this house is ever going to understand
me.
BENEATHA Because you’re a nut.
WALTER Who’s a nut?
BENEATHA You—you are a nut. Thee is mad, boy.
WALTER (Looking at his wfe and his sister from the door,
very sadly) The world’s most backward race of people,

and that’s a fact.

all those prophets who would lead us out of the
wilderness—(WALTER slams out of the house) —into the
swamps!
RUTH Bennie, why you always gotta be pickin’ on your
brother? Can’t you be a little sweeter sometimes? (Door
opens, WALTER walks in. He fumbles with his cap, starts
to speak, clears throat, looks everywhere but at ruth.
Finally:)
WALTER (To RUTH) I need some money for carfare.
ruth (Looks at him, then warms; teasing, but tenderly)
Fifty cents? (She goes to her bag and gets money) Here
—take a taxi!
(WALTER exits, mama enters. She is a woman in
her early sixties, full-bodied and strong. She is
one of those women of a certain grace and
beauty who wear it so unobtrusively that it takes a
while to notice. Her dark-brown face is
surrounded by the total whiteness of her hair,
and, being a woman who has adjusted to many
things in life and overcome many more, her face
is full of strength. She has, we can see, wit and
faith of a kind that keep her eyes lit and full of
interest and expectancy. She is, in a word, a
beautiful woman. Her bearing is perhaps most
like the noble bearing of the women of the
Hereros of Southwest Africa—rather as if she
imagines that as she walks she still bears a
basket or a vessel upon her head. Her speech,
on the other hand, is as careless as her carriage
is precise—she is inclined to slur everything —
but her voice is perhaps not so much quiet as

simply soft)

MAMA Who that 'round here slamming doors at this hour?
(She crosses through the room, goes to the
window opens it, and brings in a feeble little
plant growing doggedly in a small pot on the
windowsill. She feels the dirt and puts it back out)

RUTH That was Walter Lee. He and Bennie was at it again.
MAMA My children and they tempers. Lord, if this little old
plant don’t get more sun than it’s been getting it ain’t
never going to see spring again. ( She turns from the
window/) What’s the matter with you this morning, Ruth?
You looks right peaked. You aiming to iron all them
things? Leave some for me. I'll get to ’em this afternoon.
Bennie honey, it’s too drafty for you to be sitting ’round
half dressed. Where’s your robe?
BENEA7HA In the cleaners.
MAMA Well, go get mi ne and put it on.
BENEATHA I’m not cold, Mama, honest.
MAMA I know—but you so thi n ...
BENEATHA ( Irritably) Mama, I’m not cold.
mama ( Seeing the make-down bed as travis has left it)
Lord have mercy, look at that poor bed. Bless his heart—
he tries, don’t he?
(She moves to the bed travis has sloppily made
up)
RUTH No—he don’t half try at all ’cause he knows you going
to come along behind him and fix everything. That’s just
how come he don’t know how to do nothing right now—
you done spoiled that boy so.

MAMA ( Folding bedding) Well—he’s a little boy. Ain’t
supposed to know ’bout housekeeping. My baby that’s
what he is. What you fix for his breakfast this morning?
RUTH ( Angrily ) I feed my son, Lena!
MAMA I ain’t meddling—( Underbreath; busy-bodyish) I just
noticed all last week he had cold cereal, and when it
starts getting this chilly in the fall a child ought to have
some hot grits or something when he goes out in the cold
RUTH ( Furious ) I gave him hot oats—is that all right!

conversationally sometimes) What was you and your
brother fussing ’bout this morning?
BENEATHA It’s not important, Mama.

bathroom, vihich is apparently free, and she
picks up her to\Aels and rushes out)
MAMA What was they fighting about?
RUTH Now you know as well as I do.
MAMA (Shaking her head) Brother still worrying hisself sick
about that money?
RUTH You know he is.
MAMA You had breakfast?

MAMA Girl, you better start eating and looking after yourself
better. You almost thin as Travis.

RUTH What are you going to do with it?
MAMA Now don’t you start, child. It's too early in the morning
to be talking about money. It ain’t Christian.

RUTH Yes—
MAMA We ain’t no business people, Ruth. We just plain
working folks.
RUTH Ain’t nobody business people till they go into
business. Walter Lee say colored people ain’t never
going to start getting ahead till they start gambling on
some different kinds of things in the world—investments
and things.
MAMA What done got into you, girl? Walter Lee done finally
sold you on investing.
RUTH No. Mama, something is happening between Walter
and me. I don’t know what it is—but he needs something
—something I can’t give him anymore. He needs this
chance, Lena.
MAMA (Froming deeply) But liquor, honey—
RUTH Well—like Walter say—I spec people going to always
be drinking themselves some liquor.
MAMA Well—whether they drinks it or not ain’t none of my
business. But whether I go into business selling it to ’em
is, and I don’t want that on my ledger this late in life.

Ruth Younger, what’s the matter with you today? You look
like you could fall over right there.
RUTH I’m tired.

RUTH I can’t stay home. She’d be calling up the agency and
screaming at them, "My girl didn’t come in today—send
me somebody! My girl didn’t come in!” Oh, she just have
a fit...

MAMA Somebody would of thought my children done all but
starved to death the way they talk about money here late.
Child, we got a great big old check coming tomorrow.
RUTH ( Sincerely ; but also self-righteously) Now that’s your
money. It ain’t got nothing to do with me. We all feel like
that—Walter and Bennie and me—even Travis.

thousand dollars—
RUTH Sure is wonderful.
MAMA Ten thousand dollars.
RUTH You know what you should do, Miss Lena? You should
take yourself a trip somewhere. To Europe or South
America or someplace—

RUTH I’m serious. Just pack up and leave! Go on away and
enjoy yourself some. Forget about the family and have
yourself a ball for once in your life—

Who’d go with me? What I look like wandering 'round

MAMA I ain’t rightly decided. (Thinking. She speaks now
with emphasis) Some of it got to be put away for
Beneatha and her schoolin’—and ain’t nothing going to
touch that part of it. Nothing. ( She waits several seconds,
trying to make up her mind about something, and looks
at ruth a little tentatively before going on) Been thinking
that we maybe could meet the notes on a little old twostory somewhere, with a yard where Travis could play in
the summertime, if we use part of the insurance for a
down payment and everybody kind of pitch in. I could
maybe take on a little day work again, few days a week

concentrating on her ironing, anxious to encourage
without seeming to) Well, Lord knows, we’ve put enough
rent into this here rat trap to pay for four houses by

around and leaning back and sighing—in a suddenly
reflective mood—) “Rat trap”—yes, that’s all it is.
(Smiling) I remember just as well the day me and Big
Walter moved in here. Hadn’t been married but two
weeks and wasn’t planning on living here no more than a
year. ( She shakes her head at the dissolved dream) We
was going to set away, little by little, don’t you know, and
buy a little place out in Morgan Park. We had even

picked out the house. ( Chuckling a little) Looks right
dumpy today. But Lord, child, you should know all the

she can see) And then, Lord, when I lost that baby—little
Claude—I almost thought I was going to lose Big Walter
too. Oh, that man grieved hisself! He was one man to
love his children.
RUTH Ain’t nothin’ can tear at you like losin’ your baby.
MAMA I guess that’s how come that man finally worked
hisself to death like he done. Like he was fighting his
own war with this here world that took his baby from him.
RUTH He sure was a fine man, all right. I always liked Mr.
Younger.
MAMA Crazy ’bout his children! God knows there was plenty
wrong with Walter Younger—hard-headed, mean, kind of
wild with women—plenty wrong with him. But he sure
loved his children. Always wanted them to have
something—be something. That’s where Brother gets all
these notions, I reckon. Big Walter used to say, he’d get
right wet in the eyes sometimes, lean his head back with
the water standing in his eyes and say, “Seem like God
didn’t see fit to give the black man nothing but dreams—

but He did give us children to make them dreams seem
worth while.” ( She smiles) He could talk like that, don’t
you know.
RUTH Yes, he sure could. He was a good man, Mr. Younger.
MAMA Yes, a fine man—just couldn’t never catch up with his
dreams, that’s all.

looking up to the ceiling, where the sound of a
vacuum cleaner has started up)

this now—like you got tired of that little playacting group
you joined last year? (Looking at RUTH) And what was it
the year before that?
RUTH The horseback-riding club for which she bought that
fifty-five-dollar riding habit that’s been hanging in the
closet ever since!
MAMA (To BENEATHA) Why you got to flit so from one thing
to another, baby?
BENEATHA (Sharply) I just want to learn to play the guitar. Is
there anything wrong with that?
MAMA Ain’t nobody trying to stop you. I just wonders
sometimes why you has to flit so from one thing to
another all the time. You ain’t never done nothing with all
that camera equipment you brought home—
BENEATHA I don’t flit! I—I experiment with different forms of
expression—

or another.

BENEATHA Mind your own business.

a suspicious sudden look at her daughter as she turns
in her chair for emphasis) What DOES it mean?
BENEATHA (Wearily) Oh, I just mean I couldn’t ever really be
serious about George. He’s—he’s so shallow.
RUTH Shallow—what do you mean he’s shallow? He’s rich!
MAMA Hush, Ruth.
BENEATHA I know he’s rich. He knows he’s rich, too.
RUTH Weil—what other qualities a man got to have to
satisfy you, little girl?
BENEATHA You wouldn’t even begin to understand. Anybody
who married Walter could not possibly understand.

brother?
BENEATHA Brother is a flip—let’s face it.

RUTH You mean you wouldn't marry George Murchison if he
asked you someday? That pretty, rich thing? Honey, I
knew you was odd—
BENEATHA No I would not marry him if all I felt for him was
what I feel now. Besides, George’s family wouldn’t really
like it.
MAMA Why not?
BENEATHA Oh, Mama—The Murchisons are honest-to-Godreal-foe-rich colored people, and the only people in the
world who are more snobbish than rich white people are
rich colored people. I thought everybody knew that. I’ve
met Mrs. Murchison. She’s a scene!
MAMA You must not dislike people ’cause they well off,
honey.
BENEATHA Why not? It makes just as much sense as
disliking people ’cause they are poor, and lots of people
do that.
ruth (A vusdom-of-the-ages manner. To mama) Well, she’ll
get over some of this—

Listen, I’m going to be a doctor. I’m not worried about

who I’m going to marry yet—if I ever get married.

doctor, and George, for one, still thinks that’s pretty funny.

MAMA Beneatha—that just wasn't necessary.
BENEATHA Well—neither is God. I get sick of hearing about
God.
MAMA Beneatha!
BENEATHA I mean it! I’m just tired of hearing about God all
the time. What has He got to do with anything? Does he
pay tuition?

BENEATHA Why? Why can't I say what I want to around here,
like everybody else?
MAMA It don’t sound nice for a young girl to say things like
that—you wasn’t brought up that way. Me and your father
went to trouble to get you and Brother to church every
Sunday.
BENEATHA Mama, you don’t understand. It's all a matter of
ideas, and God is just one idea I don’t accept. It’s not
important. I am not going out and be immoral or commit
crimes because I don’t believe in God. I don’t even think
about it. It's just that I get tired of Him getting credit for all
the things the human race achieves through its own
stubborn effort. There simply is no blasted God—there is

only man and it is he who makes miracles!

and rises slowly and crosses to beneatha and
slaps her powerfully across the face. After, there
is only silence and the daughter drops her eyes
from her mother’s face, and mama is very tall
before her)

triumphant posture. Stopping and turning back to her
daughter) There are some ideas we ain’t going to have

you did was childish—so you got treated like a child.

ironing and lean against something and put the
back of her hand to her forehead)

You ... sure ... loves that little old thing, don’t you? ...
MAMA Well, I always wanted me a garden like I used to see
sometimes at the back of the houses down home. This
plant is close as I ever got to having one. (She looks out
of the window as she replaces the plant) Lord, ain’t
nothing as dreary as the view from this window on a
dreary day, is there? Why ain’t you singing this morning,
Ruth? Sing that “No Ways Tired.” That song always lifts
me up so—( She turns at last to see that ruth has
slipped quietly to the floor, in a state of

semiconsciousness) Ruth! Ruth honey—what’s the

Curtain
SCENE TWO
It is the following morning; a Saturday morning, and
house cleaning is in progress at the YOUNGERS. Furniture
has been shoved hither and yon and mama is giving the
kitchen-area mils a mshing down, beneatha, in
dungarees, with a handkerchief tied around her face, is
spraying insecticide into the cracks in the mils. As they
work, the radio is on and a Southside disk-jockey program
is inappropriately filling the house with a rather exotic
saxophone blues, travis, the sole idle one, is leaning on
his arms, looking out of the window.

Can I go downstairs, please?

MAMA (Looking at BENEATHA) She had to go on a little
errand.

(The phone rings, beneatha runs to ansmr it
and reaches it before Walter, who has entered
from bedroom)
TRAVIS Where?
MAMA To tend to her business.
BENEATHA Haylo ... ( Disappointed ) Yes, he is. (She tosses

the phone to Walter, who barely catches it) It’s Willie
Harris again.
WALTER (As privately as possible under MAMA'S gaze)
Hello, Willie. Did you get the papers from the
lawyer? ... No, not yet. I told you the mailman doesn’t get
here till ten-thirty ... No, I’ll come there ... Yeah! Right
away. (He hangs up and goes for his coat)
BENEATHA Brother, where did Ruth go?
WALTER (As he exits) How should I know!
TRAVIS Aw come on, Grandma. Can I go outside?
MAMA Oh, I guess so. You stay right in front of the house,
though, and keep a good lookout for the postman.
TRAVIS Yes’m. (He darts into bedroom for stickbatt and
bat, reenters, and sees beneatha on her knees
spraying under sofa with behind upraised. He edges
closer to the target, takes aim, and lets her have it. She
screams) Leave them poor little cockroaches alone, they
ain’t bothering you none! (He runs as she swings the
spray gun at him viciously and playfully) Grandma!
Grandma!

that stuff on that child!

has never hurt the roaches.
MAMA Well, little boys’ hides ain’t as tough as Southside
roaches. You better get over there behind the bureau. I

MAMA How?

BENEA7HA Set fire to this building! Mama, where did Ruth
go?
mama ( Looking at her with meaning) To the doctor, I think.
BENEATHA The doctor? What’s the matter? ( They
exchange glances) You don’t think—
MAMA (With her sense of drama) Now I ain’t saying what I
think. But I ain’t never been wrong ’bout a woman neither.
(The phone rings)
BENEATHA (At the phone) Hay-lo ... (Pause, and a moment
of recognition) Well—when did you get back! ... And
how was it? ... Of course I’ve missed you—in my
way ... This morning? No ... house cleaning and all that
and Mama hates it if I let people come over when the
house is like this ... You have? Well, that’s
different ... What is it—Oh, what the hell, come on
over... Right, see you then. Arrivederci.
(She hangs up)
mama (Who has listened vigorously, as is her habit) Who
is that you inviting over here with this house looking like
this? You ain’t got the pride you was born with!
BENEATHA Asagai doesn’t care how houses look, Mama—
he’s an intellectual.

MAMA Who?
BENEATHA Asagai—Joseph Asagai. He’s an African boy I
met on campus. He’s been studying in Canada all
summer.
MAMA What’s his name?
BENEATHA Asagai, Joseph. Ah-sah-guy ... He’s from
Nigeria.
MAMA Oh, that’s the little country that was founded by slaves

way back...
BENEATHA No, Mama—that’s Liberia.
MAMA I don’t think I never met no African before.
BENEATHA Well, do me a favor and don’t ask him a whole
lot of ignorant questions about Africans. I mean, do they
wear clothes and all that—
MAMA Well, now, I guess if you think we so ignorant ’round
here maybe you shouldn’t bring your friends here—
BENEATHA It’s just that people ask such crazy things. All
anyone seems to know about when it comes to Africa is
Tarzan—
MAMA ( Indignantly ) Why should I know anything about
Africa?
BENEATHA Why do you give money at church for the
missionary work?
MAMA Well, that’s to help save people.
BENEATHA YOU mean save them from heathenism —
mama ( Innocently ) Yes.
BENEATHA I’m afraid they need more salvation from the
British and the French.

with dejection. They both turn to look at her)
RUTH ( Dispiritedly ) Well, I guess from all the happy faces—
everybody knows.
BENEATHA You pregnant?
MAMA Lord have mercy, I sure hope it’s a little old girl.
Travis ought to have a sister.

(beneatha and ruth give her a hopeless look for
this grandmotherly enthusiasm)

BENEA7HA How far along are you?
RUTH Two months.
BENEATHA Did you mean to? I mean did you plan it or was it
an accident?
MAMA What do you know about planning or not planning?
BENEATHA Oh, Mama.
RUTH ( Wearily ) She's twenty years old, Lena.
BENEATHA Did you plan it, Ruth?
RUTH Mind your own business.
BENEATHA It is my business—where is he going to live, on
the roof? (There is silence following the remark as the
three women react to the sense of it) Gee—I didn’t mean
that, Ruth, honest. Gee, I don’t feel like that at all. I—I
think it is wonderful.
RUTH (Dully) Wonderful.
beneatha Yes—really. ( There is a sudden commotion
from the street and she goes to the window to look out)
What on earth is going on out there? These kids. (There
are, as she throws open the window/ the shouts of
children rising up from the street. She sticks her head
out to see better and calls out) TRAVIS!

went to?

opens her mouth to speak as travis bursts in)
travis (Excited and full of narrative, coming directly to his
mother) Mama, you should of seen the rat ... Big as a
cat, honest! (He shows an exaggerated size with his
hands) Gaaleee, that rat was really cuttin’ and Bubber
caught him with his heel and the janitor, Mr. Barnett, got
him with a stick—and then they got him in a corner and—
BAM! BAM! BAM!—and he was still jumping around and
bleeding like everything too—there’s rat blood all over
the street—
(ruth reaches out suddenly and grabs her son
without even looking at him and clamps her
hand over his mouth and holds him to her. mama
crosses to them rapidly and takes the boy from
her)
MAMA You hush up now ... talking all that terrible stuff...

expression, beneatha comes quickly and takes him
away from his grandmother and ushers him to the door)

straining to see what is wrong with his mother)
MAMA (Worriedly hovering over RUTH) Ruth honey—what’s
the matter with you—you sick?

(ruth has her fists clenched on her thighs and is
fighting hard to suppress a scream that seems to
be rising in her)
BENEA7HA What’s the matter with her, Mama?
mama ( Working her fingers in RUTH’S shoulders to relax
her) She be all right. Women gets right depressed
sometimes when they get her way. ( Speaking softly,
expertly, rapidly) Now you just relax. That’s right ... just
lean back, don’t think ’bout nothing at all ... nothing at all
RUTH I’m all right...
(The glassy-eyed look melts and then she
collapses into a fit of heavy sobbing. The bell
rings)
BENEATHA Oh, my God—that must be Asagai.
MAMA (To RUTH) Come on now, honey. You need to lie
down and rest awhile ... then have some nice hot food.
(They exit, RUTH’S weight on her mother-in-law.
beneatha, herself profoundly disturbed, opens
the door to admit a rather dramatic-looking
young man with a large package)
ASAGAI Hello, Alaiyo—

pleasure) Hello ... ( Long pause) Well—come in. And
please excuse everything. My mother was very upset
about my letting anyone come here with the place like
this.

acute ghetto-itis. (She smiles and comes toward him,
finding a cigarette and sitting) So—sit down! No! Wait!
(She whips the spray gun off sofa where she had left it
and puts the cushions back. At last perches on arm of
sofa. He sits) So, how was Canada?
ASAGAI (A sophisticate) Canadian.
BENEA7HA (Looking at him) Asagai, I'm very glad you are
back.
ASAGAI (Looking back at her in turn) Are you really?
BENEATHA Yes—very.
ASAGAI Why?—you were quite glad when I went away.
What happened?
BENEATHA You went away.
ASAGAI Ahhhhhhhh.
BENEATHA Before—you wanted to be so serious before
there was time.
ASAGAI How much time must there be before one knows

hands pressed together, in a deliberately childish
gesture) What did you bring me?

about her for the moment and stands back to look at
her) Ah— Oh-pay-gay-day, oh-gbah-mu-shay. (A

Yoruba exclamation for admiration) You wear it
well... very well... mutilated hair and all.
BENEA7HA ( Turning suddenly) My hair—what’s wrong with
my hair?
ASAGAI ( Shrugging) Were you born with it like that?
BENEA7HA ( Reaching up to touch it) No ... of course not.
(She looks back to the mirror, disturbed)
ASAGAI (Smiling) How then?
BENEA7HA YOU know perfectly well how ... as crinkly as
yours ... that’s how.
ASAGAI And it is ugly to you that way?
BENEA7HA ( Quickly) Oh, no—not ugly ... ( More slovJy,
apologetically) But it’s so hard to manage when it’s, well
—raw.
ASAGAI And so to accommodate that—you mutilate it every
week?
BENEA7HA It’s not mutilation!
ASAGAI (Laughing aloud at her seriousness) Oh ... please!
I am only teasing you because you are so very serious
about these things. (He stands back from her and folds
his arms across his chest as he mtches her pulling at
her hair and frowiing in the mirror) Do you remember
the first time you met me at school? ... (He laughs) You
came up to me and you said—and I thought you were the
most serious little thing I had ever seen—you said: (He
imitates her) “Mr. Asagai—I want very much to talk with
you. About Africa. You see, Mr. Asagai, I am looking for
my identity'. ”

BENEA7HA (Turning to him, not laughing) Yes—

(Her face is quizzical, profoundly disturbed)

asagai ( Still teasing and reaching out and taking her face
in his hands and turning her profile to him) Well... it is
true that this is not so much a profile of a Hollywood
queen as perhaps a queen of the Nile— (A mock
dismissal of the importance of the question) But what
does it matter? Assimilationism is so popular in your
country.
BENEA7HA ( Wheeling, passionately, sharply) I am not an
assimilationist!
asagai ( The protest hangs in the room for a moment and
asagai studies her, his laughter fading) Such a serious
one. (There is a pause) So—you like the robes? You
must take excellent care of them—they are from my
sister’s personal wardrobe.
BENEATHA (With incredulity) You—you sent all the way
home—for me?
ASAGAI (With charm) For you—I would do much
more ... Well, that is what I came for. I must go.
BENEATHA Will you call me Monday?
ASAGAI Yes ... We have a great deal to talk about. I mean
about identity and time and all that.
BENEATHA Time?
ASAGAI Yes. About how much time one needs to know what
one feels.
BENEATHA You see! You never understood that there is
more than one kind of feeling which can exist between a
man and a woman—or, at least, there should be.

this moment...
BENEA7HA I know—and by itself—it won’t do. I can find that
anywhere.
ASAGAI For a woman it should be enough.
BENEA7HA I know—because that’s what it says in all the
novels that men write. But it isn’t. Go ahead and laugh—
but I’m not interested in being someone’s little episode in
America or— (With feminine vengeance) —one of them!
(ASAGAI has burst into laughter again) That’s funny as

ASAGAI It’s just that every American girl I have known has
said that to me. White—black—in this you are all the
same. And the same speech, too!
BENEA7HA ( Angrily) Yuk, yuk, yuk!

liberated women are not liberated at all. You all talk about

charm because of the presence of a guest )

Younger. Please forgive me for coming at such an
outrageous hour on a Saturday.

unrelated expression of sympathy) Yes ... yes ...

him over) How many miles is it from here to where you

ASAGAI Many thousands.

MAMA You done found it in some other house?
WALTER No—there ain’t no woman! Why do women always
think there's a woman somewhere when a man gets
restless. ( Picks up the check) Do you know what this
money means to me? Do you know what this money can
do for us? ( Puts it back) Mama—Mama—I want so many
things ...
MAMA Yes, son—
WALTER I want so many things that they are driving me kind
of crazy... Mama—look at me.
MAMA I’m looking at you. You a good-looking boy. You got a
job, a nice wife, a fine boy and—
WALTER A job. ( Looks at her) Mama, a job? I open and
close car doors all day long. I drive a man around in his
limousine and I say, “Yes, sir; no, sir; very good, sir; shall I
take the Drive, sir?” Mama, that ain't no kind of
job ... that ain’t nothing at all. (Very quietly) Mama, I don’t
know if I can make you understand.
MAMA Understand what, baby?
WALTER (Quietly) Sometimes it’s like I can see the future
stretched out in front of me—just plain as day. The future,

Mama. Hanging over there at the edge of my days. Just
waiting for me—a big, looming blank space—full of
nothing. Just waiting forme. But it don’t have to be.
(Pause. Kneeling beside het chair) Mama—sometimes
when I’m downtown and I pass them cool, quiet-looking
restaurants where them white boys are sitting back and
talking ’bout things ... sitting there turning deals worth
millions of dollars ... sometimes I see guys don’t look
much older than me—
MAMA Son—how come you talk so much ’bout money?
WALTER ( With immense passion) Because it is life, Mama!
MAMA (Quietly) Oh— (Very quietly) So now it’s life. Money
is life. Once upon a time freedom used to be life—now
it’s money. I guess the world really do change ...

WALTER No—it was always money, Mama. We just didn’t
know about it.
MAMA No ... something has changed. (She looks at him)
You something new, boy. In my time we was worried
about not being lynched and getting to the North if we
could and how to stay alive and still have a pinch of
dignity too ... Now here come you and Beneatha—
talking ’bout things we ain’t never even thought about
hardly, me and your daddy. You ain’t satisfied or proud of
nothing we done. I mean that you had a home; that we
kept you out of trouble till you was grown; that you don’t
have to ride to work on the back of nobody’s streetcar—
You my children—but how different we done become.
WALTER (A long beat. He pats her hand and gets up) You
just don’t understand, Mama, you just don’t understand.
MAMA Son—do you know your wife is expecting another
baby? (Walter stands, stunned, and absorbs vJhat his
mother has said) That’s what she wanted to talk to you
about, (WALTER sinks down into a chair) This ain’t for me
to be telling—but you ought to know. (She mits) I think

Ruth is thinking ’bout getting rid of that child.
WALTER ( SlovJy understanding) No —no—Ruth wouldn’t do
that.
MAMA When the world gets ugly enough—a woman will do
anything for her family. The part that’s already living.
WALTER You don’t know Ruth, Mama, if you think she would
do that.
(ruth opens the bedroom door and stands there
a little limp)
RUTH ( Beaten ) Yes I would too, Walter. (Pause) I gave her a
five-dollar down payment.
(There is total silence as the man stares at his
wfe and the mother stares at her son)
MAMA ( Presently) Well - ( Tightly) Well — son, I’m waiting

to hear you say something ... (She visits) I’m waiting to
hear how you be your father’s son. Be the man he
was ... (Pause. The silence shouts) Your wife say she
going to destroy your child. And I’m waiting to hear you
talk like him and say we a people who give children life,
not who destroys them— (She rises) I’m waiting to see
you stand up and look like your daddy and say we done
give up one baby to poverty and that we ain’t going to
give up nary another one ... I’m waiting.
WALTER Ruth— (He can say nothing)
MAMA If you a son of mine, tell her! (WALTER picks up his
keys and his coat and walks out. She continues, bitterly)
You ... you are a disgrace to your father’s memory.
Somebody get me my hat!

Curtain

ACT II

SCENE ONE
Time: Later the same day.
At rise: ruth is ironing again. She has the radio going.
Presently beneatha'S bedroom door opens and RUTH’S
mouth falls and she puts down the iron in fascination.
RUTH What have we got on tonight!
beneatha (Emerging grandly from the doorway so that we
can see her thoroughly robed in the costume Asagai
brought) You are looking at what a well-dressed Nigerian
woman wears— (She parades for ruth, her hair
completely hidden by the headdress ; she is
coquettishly fanning herself with an ornate oriental fan,
mistakenly more like Butterfly than any Nigerian that
ever was) Isn’t it beautiful? (She promenades to the
radio and, with an arrogant flourish, turns off the good
loud blues that is playing) Enough of this assimilationist
junk! (ruth follows her with her eyes as she goes to the
phonograph and puts on a record and turns and waits
ceremoniously for the music to come up. Then, with a
shout—) OCOMOGOSIAY!

(ruth jumps. The music comes up, a lovely
Nigerian melody, beneatha listens, enraptured,
her eyes far away—“back to the past.’’ She
begins to dance, ruth is dumbfounded)

RUTH What kind of dance is that?
BENEATHA A folk dance.
RUTH ( Pearl Bailey) What kind of folks do that, honey?
BENEA7HA It’s from Nigeria. It’s a dance of welcome.
RUTH Who you welcoming?
BENEATHA The men back to the village.
RUTH Where they been?
BENEA7HA How should I know—out hunting or something.
Anyway, they are coming back now...
RUTH Well, that’s good.
beneatha (With the record)
Alundi, alundi
Alundi alunya
Jop pu a jeepua
Ang gu soooooooooo
Ai yai yae ...
Ayehaye — alundi...
(Walter comes in during this performance; he has
obviously been drinking. He leans against the door
heavily and watches his sister, at first with distaste. Then
his eyes look off—“back to the past’’—as he lifts both his
fists to the roof, screaming)
WALTER YEAH ... AND ETHIOPIA STRETCH FORTH HER
HANDS AGAIN! ...
RUTH (Drily, looking at him) Yes—and Africa sure is
claiming her own tonight. (She gives them both up and
starts ironing again)

Walter ( All in a drunken, dramatic shout) Shut up! ... I’m
digging them drums ... them drums move me!... (He

makes his weaving way to his wife’s face and leans in
close to her) In my heart of hearts—(He thumps his
chest) —I am much warrior!
RUTH ( Without even looking up) In your heart of hearts you
are much drunkard.
WALTER ( Coming away from her and starting to wander
around the room, shouting) Me and Jomo ... ( Intently ; in
his sister’s face. She has stopped dancing to watch him
in this unknown mood) That’s my man, Kenyatta.
(Shouting and thumping his chest) FLAMING SPEAR!
HOT DAMN! (He is suddenly in possession of an
imaginary spear and actively spearing enemies all over
the room) OCOMOGOSIA Y...
BENEA7HA (To encourage WALTER, thoroughly caught up
with this side of him) OCOMOGOSIAY , FLAMING
SPEAR!
WALTER THE LION IS WAKING ... OWIMOWEH! (He pulls
his shirt open and leaps up on the table and gestures
with his spear)
BENEATHA OWIMOWEH!
WALTER (On the table, very far gone, his eyes pure glass
sheets. He sees what we cannot, that he is a leader of
his people, a great chief, a descendant of Chaka, and
that the hour to march has come) Listen, my black
brothers—
BENEATHA OCOMOGOSIAY!
WALTER —Do you hear the waters rushing against the
shores of the coastlands—
BENEATHA OCOMOGOSIAY!
WALTER —Do you hear the screeching of the cocks in
yonder hills beyond where the chiefs meet in council for
the coming of the mighty war—

BENEATHA OCOMOGOSIAY!
(And nowthe lighting shifts subtly to suggest the
world of WALTER'S imagination, and the mood
shifts from pure comedy. It is the inner Walter
speaking: the Southside chauffeur has assumed
an unexpected majesty)
WALTER—Do you hear the beating of the wings of the birds
flying low over the mountains and the low places of our
land—
BENEATHA OCOMOGOSIAY!
WALTER —Do you hear the singing of the women, singing
the war songs of our fathers to the babies in the great
houses? Singing the sweet war songs! (The doorbell
rings) OH, DO YOU HEAR, MY BLACK BROTHERS!
BENEATHA (Completely gone) We hearyou, Flaming Spear

(ruth shuts off the phonograph and opens the
door. GEORGE MURCHISON enters)
WALTER Telling us to prepare for the GREATNESS OF
THE TIME! (Lights back to normal. He turns and sees
GEORGE) Black Brother!
(He extends his hand for the fraternal clasp)
GEORGE Black Brother, hell!
ruth (Having had enough, and embarrassed for the
family) Beneatha, you got company—what’s the matter
with you? Walter Lee Younger, get down off that table
and stop acting like a fool...

(Walter comes dom off the table suddenly and
makes a quick exit to the bathroom)

RUTH He’s had a little to drink ... I don’t know what her

GEORGE (To BENEATHA) Look honey, we’re going to the
theatre—we’re not going to be in it ... so go change,
huh?

(beneatha looks at him and slovJy,
ceremoniously, lifts her hands and pulls off the
headdress. Her hair is dose-cropped and
unstraightened. GEORGE freezes mid-sentence
and RUTH’S eyes all but fan out of her head)
GEORGE What in the name of—
RUTH ( Touching BENEATHA^ hair) Girl, you done lost your
natural mind!? Look at your head!
GEORGE What have you done to your head—I mean your
hair!
BENEATHA Nothing—except cut it off.
RUTH Now that’s the truth—it’s what ain't been done to it!
You expect this boy to go out with you with your head all
nappy like that?
BENEATHA (Looking at GEORGE) That’s up to George. If he's
ashamed of his heritage—
GEORGE Oh, don’t be so proud of yourself, Bennie—just
because you look eccentric.
BENEATHA How can something that’s natural be eccentric?
GEORGE That’s what being eccentric means—being
natural. Get dressed.
BENEATHA I don’t like that, George.
RUTH Why must you and your brother make an argument out
of everything people say?
BENEATHA Because I hate assimilationist Negroes!

means!
GEORGE Oh, it’s just a college girl’s way of calling people
Uncle Toms—but that isn’t what it means at all.
RUTH Well, what does it mean?
beneatha ( Cutting GEORGE off and staring at him as she
replies to RUTH) It means someone who is willing to give
up his own culture and submerge himself completely in
the dominant, and in this case oppressive culture!
GEORGE Oh, dear, dear, dear! Here we go! A lecture on the
African past! On our Great West African Heritage! In one
second we will hear all about the great Ashanti empires;
the great Songhay civilizations; and the great sculpture of
Benin—and then some poetry in the Bantu— and the
whole monologue will end with the word heritage!
(Nastily) Let’s face it, baby, your heritage is nothing but a
bunch of raggedy-assed spirituals and some grass huts!
BENEATHA GRASS HUTS! (RUTH crosses to her and
forcibly pushes her tomrd the bedroom) See
there ... you are standing there in your splendid
ignorance talking about people who were the first to
smelt iron on the face of the earth! (RUTH is pushing her
through the door) The Ashanti were performing surgical
operations when the English—(RUTH pulls the door to,
with beneatha on the other side, and smiles graciously
at GEORGE, beneatha opens the door and shouts the
end of the sentence defiantly at GEORGE)—were still
tattooing themselves with blue dragons! (She goes back
inside)
RUTH Have a seat, George (They both sit. RUTH folds her
hands rather primly on her lap, determined to
demonstrate the civilization of the family) Warm, ain’t it?
I mean for September. (Pause) Just like they always say
about Chicago weather: If it’s too hot or cold for you, just

wait a minute and it'll change. ( She smiles happily at
this cliche of cliches) Everybody say it’s got to do with
them bombs and things they keep setting off. (Pause)
Would you like a nice cold beer?

GEORGE No, thank you. I don't care for beer. (He looks at
his v\atch) I hope she hurries up.
RLTTH What time is the show?
GEORGE It’s an eight-thirty curtain. That’s just Chicago,
though. In New York standard curtain time is eight forty.
(He is rather proud of this knowledge)
ROTH (Properly appreciating it) You get to New York a lot?
GEORGE ( Offhand) Few times a year.
RUTH Oh—that’s nice. I’ve never been to New York.
(WALTER enters. We feel he has relieved himself, but
the edge of unreality is still with him)
WALTER New York ain’t got nothing Chicago ain’t. Just a
bunch of hustling people all squeezed up together—
being “Eastern.”
(He turns his face into a screwof displeasure)
GEORGE Oh—you’ve been?
WALTER Plenty of ti mes.
ROTH (Shocked at the lie) Walter Lee Younger!
WALTER (Staring her down) Plenty! (Pause) What we got to
drink in this house? Why don’t you offer this man some
refreshment. (To GEORGE) They don’t know how to
entertain people in this house, man.
GEORGE Thank you—I don’t really care for anything.
WALTER ( Feeling his head; sobriety coming) Where’s
Mama?

RUTH She ain't come back yet.

scrutinizing his carefully casual tweed sports jacket over
cashmere V-neck sweater over soft eyelet shirt and tie,
and soft slacks, finished off with white buckskin shoes)

Why all you college boys wear them faggoty-looking
white shoes?
RUTH Walter Lee!
(GEORGE MURCHISON ignores the remark)
WALTER (To RUTH) Well, they look crazy as hell—white
shoes, cold as it is.
RUTH ( Crushed) You have to excuse him—
WALTER No he don't! Excuse me for what? What you
always excusing me for! I’ll excuse myself when I needs
to be excused! (A pause) They look as funny as them
black knee socks Beneatha wears out of here all the
time.
RUTH It's the college style, Walter.
WALTER Style, hell. She looks like she got burnt legs or
something!
RUTH Oh, Walter—
WALTER (An irritable mimic) Oh, Walter! Oh, Walter! (To
MURCHISON) How’s your old man making out? I
understand you all going to buy that big hotel on the
Drive? (He finds a beer in the refrigerator, wanders over
to MURCHISON, sipping and wiping his lips with the back
of his hand, and straddling a chair backwards to talk to
the other man) Shrewd move. Your old man is all right,
man. (Tapping his head and half winking for emphasis) I
mean he knows howto operate. I mean he thinks big, you
know what I mean, I mean for a home, you know? But I
think he’s kind of running out of ideas now. I’d like to talk

to him. Listen, man, I got some plans that could turn this
city upside down. I mean think like he does. Big. Invest
big, gamble big, hell, lose big if you have to, you know
what I mean. It’s hard to find a man on this whole
Southside who understands my kind of thinking—you
dig? (He scrutinizes MURCHISON again, drinks his beer,
squints his eyes and leans in close, confidential, man
to man) Me and you ought to sit down and talk
sometimes, man. Man, I got me some ideas ...

GEORGE (With boredom) Yeah—sometimes we'll have to
do that, Walter.
WALTER (Understanding the indifference, and offended)
Yeah—well, when you get the time, man. I know you a
busy little boy.
RUTH Walter, please—
WALTER (Bitterly, hurt) I know ain’t nothing in this world as
busy as you colored college boys with your fraternity pins
and white shoes ...
ruth (Covering her face wth humiliation) Oh, Walter Lee
WALTER I see you all all the time—with the books tucked
under your arms—going to your (British A —a mimic)
“clahsses.” And for what! What the hell you learning over
there? Filling up your heads— (Counting off on his
fingers) —with the sociology and the psychology—but
they teaching you how to be a man? How to take over
and run the world? They teaching you how to run a rubber
plantation or a steel mill? Naw—just to talk proper and
read books and wear them faggoty-looking white
shoes ...
GEORGE (Looking at him wth distaste, a little above it all)
You’re all wacked up with bitterness, man.
WALTER (Intently, almost quietly, between the teeth,

glaring at the boy ) And you—ain’t you bitter, man? Ain’t
you just about had it yet? Don’t you see no stars
gleaming that you can’t reach out and grab? You happy?
—You contented son-of-a-bitch—you happy? You got it
made? Bitter? Man, I’m a volcano. Bitter? Here I am a
giant—surrounded by ants! Ants who can’t even
understand what it is the giant is talking about.

with nobody!
WALTER ( Violently ) No! ’Cause ain’t nobody with me! Not
even my own mother!

cocktail dress and earrings, hair natural)
GEORGE Well—hey— (Crosses to beneatha; thoughtful,
with emphasis, since this is a reversal) You look great!
Walter ( Seeing his sister’s hair for the first time) What’s
the matter with your head?
beneatha (Tired of the jokes noi/0 I cut it off, Brother.

her) Well, I'll be damned. So that’s what they mean by the

sharp. I mean it really is. ( Helps her into her wap)

starts to clutch at her hair)

reopens it. To WALTER) Good night, Prometheus!

RUTH I don’t know. Don’t worry about it.

WALTER Your nagging! Where was I? Who was I with? How

RUTH (Plaintively) Walter Lee—why don’t we just try to talk
about it...
WALTER (Not listening) I been out talking with people who
understand me. People who care about the things I got
on my mind.
RUTH ( Wearily) I guess that means people like Willy Harris.
WALTER Yes, people like Willy Harris.
ruth ( With a sudden flash of impatience) Why don’t you all
just hurry up and go into the banking business and stop
talking about it!

in a race of people that don’t know how to do nothing but
moan, pray and have babies!

at her and sits down)

stops) You want some hot milk?

RLTTH ’Cause after all that liquor you come home with you

things are with us. The way something done come down

least let me tell him something. I want him to be the first
one to hear ... Come here, Travis. (The boy obeys,
gladly) Travis— (She takes him by the shoulder and
looks into his face) —you know that money we got in the
mail this morning?
TRAVIS Yes’m—
MAMA Well—what you think your grandmama gone and
done with that money?
TRAVIS I don’t know, Grandmama.
mama (Putting her finger on his nose for emphasis) She
went out and she bought you a house! (The explosion
comes from Walter at the end of the revelation and he
jumps up and turns away from all of them in a fury.
MAMA continues, to TRAVIS) You glad about the house?
It’s going to be yours when you get to be a man.
TRAVIS Yeah—I always wanted to live in a house.

MAMA All right, gimme some sugar then—(TRAVIS puts his
arms around her neck as she watches her son over the
boy’s shoulder. Then, to travis, after the embrace) Now
when you say your prayers tonight, you thank God and
your grandfather—’cause it was him who give you the
house—in his way.
ruth ( Taking the boy from mama and pushing him toward
the bedroom) Now you get out of here and get ready for
your beating.
TRAVIS Aw, Mama—
ruth Get on in there—( Closing the door behind him and
turning radiantly to her mother-in-law/) So you went and
did it!
mama ( Quietly, looking at her son with pain) Yes, I did.
ruth (Raising both arms classically) PRAISE GOD!
(Looks at Walter a moment, who says nothing. She
crosses rapidly to her husband) Please, honey—let me
be glad ... you be glad too. ( She has laid her hands on
his shoulders, but he shakes himself free of her
roughly, without turning to face her) Oh Walter ... a

home ... a home. (She comes back to mama) Well—
where is it? How big is it? How much it going to cost?
MAMA Well—
RUTH When we moving?
MAMA (Smiling at her) First of the month.
ruth (Throwing back her head with jubilance) Praise God!
mama (Tentatively, still looking at her son’s back turned
against her and ruth) It’s—it’s a nice house too ... (She
cannot help speaking directly to him. An imploring
quality in her voice, her manner, makes her almost like
a girl now/) Three bedrooms—nice big one for you and
Ruth.... Me and Beneatha still have to share our room,

but Travis have one of his own—and (With difficulty) I
figure if the—new baby—is a boy, we could get one of
them double-decker outfits ... And there’s a yard with a
little patch of dirt where I could maybe get to grow me a
few flowers ... And a nice big basement...
RUTH Walter honey, be glad—
mama ( Still to his back, fingering things on the table)
’Course I don’t want to make it sound fancier than it
is ... It’s just a plain little old house—but it’s made good
and solid—and it will be ours. Walter Lee—it makes a
difference in a man when he can walk on floors that
belong to him ...
RUTH Where is it?
mama ( Frightened at this telling) Well—well—it’s out there
in Clybourne Park—
(ruth’s radiance fades abruptly, and Walter
finally turns slovJy to face his mother wth
incredulity and hostility)
RUTH Where?
MAMA ( Matter-of-factly) Four o six Clybourne Street,
Clybourne Park.
RUTH Clybourne Park? Mama, there ain’t no colored people
living in Clybourne Park.

MAMA (Almost idiotically) Well, I guess there’s going to be
some now.
WALTER (Bitterly) So that’s the peace and comfort you went
out and bought for us today!
mama ( Raising her eyes to meet his finally) Son—I just
tried to find the nicest place for the least amount of
money for my family.
ruth ( Trying to recover from the shock) Well—well

—’course I ain’t one never been fraid of no crackers,
mind you—but—well, wasn’t there no other houses
nowhere?
MAMA Them houses they put up for colored in them areas
way out all seem to cost twice as much as other houses. I
did the best I could.
rltth ( Struck senseless with the news, in its various
degrees of goodness and trouble, she sits a moment,
her fists propping her chin in thought, and then she
starts to rise, bringing her fists down with vigor, the
radiance spreading from cheek to cheek again) Well—
well!—All I can say is—if this is my time in life— MY TIME
—to say good-bye— (And she builds with momentum as
she starts to circle the room wth an exuberant, almost
tearfully happy release) —to these goddamned cracking
walls!—( She pounds the walls) —and these marching
roaches! —(She wipes at an imaginary army of
marching roaches) —and this cramped little closet which
ain’t now or never was no kitchen! ... then I say it loud
and good, HALLELUJAH! AND GOOD-BYE
MISERY ... I DONT NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR
UGLY FACE AGAIN! (She laughs joyously, having
practically destroyed the apartment, and flings her arms
up and lets them come down happily, slowly,
reflectively, over her abdomen, aware for the first time
perhaps that the life therein pulses with happiness and
not despair) Lena?
mama (Moved, watching her happiness) Yes, honey?
RUTH (Looking off) Is there—is there a whole lot of sunlight?

TRAVIS is in) Well—I guess I better see ’bout Travis. (To
MAMA) Lord, I sure don't feel like whipping nobody today!

(She exits)
mama ( The mother and son are left alone now and the
mother waits a long time, considering deeply, before
she speaks) Son—you—you understand what I done,
don’t you? (WALTER is silent and sullen) I—I just seen my
family falling apart today... just falling to pieces in front of
my eyes ... We couldn’t of gone on like we was today.
We was going backwards ’stead of forwards—talking
’bout killing babies and wishing each other was
dead ... When it gets like that in life—you just got to do
something different, push on out and do something
bigger... ( She waits) I wish you say something, son ... I
wish you’d say how deep inside you you think I done the
right thing—
WALTER (Crossing slowly to his bedroom door and finally
turning there and speaking measuredly) What you need
me to say you done right for? You the head of this family.
You run our lives like you want to. It was your money and
you did what you wanted with it. So what you need for me
to say it was all right for? ( Bitterly ; to hurt her as deeply
as he knows is possible) So you butchered up a dream
of mine—you—who always talking 'bout your children’s
dreams ...

alone, thinking heavily)

SCENE TWO

Time: Friday night. A fewweeks later.
At rise: Packing crates mark the intention of the family
to move, beneatha and GEORGE come in, presumably
from an evening out again.
GEORGE O.K. ... O.K., whatever you say ... ( They both sit
on the couch. He tries to kiss her. She moves away)
Look, we’ve had a nice evening; let’s not spoil it, huh? ...
(He again turns her head and tries to nuzzle in
and she turns away from him, not wth distaste
but wth momentary lack of interest; in a mood to
pursue what they were talking about)
BENEATHA I’m trying to talk to you.
GEORGE We always talk.
BENEATHA Yes—and I love to talk.
GEORGE ( Exasperated; rising) I know it and I don’t mind it
sometimes ... I want you to cut it out, see—The moody
stuff, I mean. I don’t like it. You’re a nice-looking girl ... all
over. That’s all you need, honey, forget the atmosphere.
Guys aren’t going to go for the atmosphere—they’re
going to go for what they see. Be glad for that. Drop the
Garbo routine. It doesn’t go with you. As for myself, I want
a nice—( Groping) —simple (Thoughtfully) —
sophisticated girl... not a poet—O.K.?
(He starts to kiss her, she rebuffs him again and
he jumps up)
BENEATHA Why are you angry, George?
GEORGE Because this is stupid! I don’t go out with you to
discuss the nature of “quiet desperation” or to hear all
about your thoughts—because the world will go on

thinking what it thinks regardless—
BENEATHA Then why read books? Why go to school?
GEORGE (With artificial patience, counting on his fingers)
It’s simple. You read books—to learn facts—to get
grades—to pass the course—to get a degree. That’s all
—it has nothing to do with thoughts.
(.A long pause)
BENEATHAI see. (He starts to sit) Good night, George.
(GEORGE looks at her a little oddly, and starts to
exit. He meets mama coming in)
GEORGE Oh—hello, Mrs. Younger.
MAMA Hello, George, how you feeling?
GEORGE Fine—fine, how are you?
MAMA Oh, a little tired. You know them steps can get you
after a day’s work. You all have a nice time tonight?
GEORGE Yes—a fine time. A fine time.
MAMA Well, good night.
GEORGE Good night. (He exits, mama closes the door
behind her) Hello, honey. What you sitting like that for?
BENEATHA I’m just sitting.
MAMA Didn’t you have a nice time?
BENEATHA No.
MAMA No? What’s the matter?
BENEATHA Mama, George is a fool—honest. ( She rises)
mama (Hustling around unloading the packages she has
entered wth. She stops) Is he, baby?
BENEATHA Yes.

BENEATHA Yes.
MAMA Well—I guess you better not waste your time with no
fools.

(beneatha looks up at her mother, watching her
put groceries in the refrigerator. Finally she
gathers up her things and starts into the
bedroom. At the door she stops and looks back
at her mother)
BENEATHA Mama—
MAMA Yes, baby—
BENEATHA Thank you.
MAMA For what?
BENEATHA For understanding me this time.
(She exits quickly and the mother stands,
smiling a little, looking at the place where
beneatha just stood, ruth enters)
RUTH Now don’t you fool with any of this stuff, Lena—
MAMA Oh, I just thought I’d sort a few things out. Is Brother
here?
RUTH Yes.
mama (With concern) Is he—

door, mama and ruth exchange weary and

ringing cheerful greeting) Oh—hello there, Johnson.

enthusiastic about EVERYTHING in life and she is
inclined to wave her wist vigorously at the height of her
exclamatory comments) Hello there, yourself! H’you this

RLTTH (Not much of a deceptive type) Fine, Mis’ Johnson,

Johnson Fine. (Reaching out quickly, playfully, and
patting RUTH'S stomach) Ain't you starting to poke out

remark and her eyes dart around looking at the crates
and packing preparation ; MAMA’S face is a cold sheet of
endurance) Oh, ain’t we getting ready 'round here,

MAMA Ruth, give Mis’ Johnson a piece of sweet potato pie

MAMA No—didn’t get mine yet this week.
JOHNSON (Lifting her head and blinking wth the spirit of
catastrophe) You mean you ain’t read ’bout them colored
people that was bombed out their place out there?
(ruth straightens wth concern and takes the
paper and reads it. JOHNSON notices her and
feeds commentary)
JOHNSON Ain’t it something how bad these here white folks
is getting here in Chicago! Lord, getting so you think you
right down in Mississippi! (With a tremendous and
rather insincere sense of melodrama) 'Course I thinks
it’s wonderful how our folks keeps on pushing out. You
hear some of these Negroes ’round here talking ’bout
how they don’t go where they ain’t wanted and all that—
but not me, honey! (This is a lie) Wilhemenia Othella

head movement for emphasis) Yes I do! Why if we left it

think of life like it is—and these here Chicago
peckerwoods is some baaaad peckerwoods.
MAMA ( Wearily) We done thought about all that Mis’
Johnson.

and passes through to the bathroom. MRS.
Johnson turns)
JOHNSON Hello there, Bennie!
BENEATHA ( Crisply) Hello, Mrs. Johnson.
JOHNSON How is school?
BENEATHA (Crisply) Fine, thank you. ( She goes out.)
JOHNSON ( Insulted) Getting so she don’t have much to say
to nobody.
MAMA The child was on her way to the bathroom.
JOHNSON I know—but sometimes she act like ain’t got time
to pass the time of day with nobody ain’t been to college.
Oh—I ain’t criticizing her none. It’s just—you know how
some of our young people gets when they get a little
education, (mama and ruth say nothing, just look at her)
Yes—well. Well, I guess I better get on home.

proud and everything—being the only one in the family to
make something of herself. I know just being a chauffeur
ain’t never satisfied Brother none. He shouldn’t feel like

The Youngers is too much for me! (She looks around)
You sure one proud-acting bunch of colored folks. Well—I

Tense) Hello. Yes, this is his wife speaking ... He’s lying

were so sure he'd be able to come in today. Yes—yes,

drove and drove ... Way out... way past South Chicago,
and I parked the car and I sat and looked at the steel
mills all day long. I just sat in the car and looked at them
big black chimneys for hours. Then I drove back and I
went to the Green Hat. (Pause) And Thursday—Thursday
I borrowed the car again and I got in it and I pointed it the
other way and I drove the other way—for hours—way,
way up to Wisconsin, and I looked at the farms. I just
drove and looked at the farms. Then I drove back and I
went to the Green Hat. (Pause) And today—today I didn’t
get the car. Today I just walked. All over the Southside.
And I looked at the Negroes and they looked at me and
finally I just sat down on the curb at Thirty-ninth and South
Parkway and I just sat there and watched the Negroes go
by. And then I went to the Green Hat. You all sad? You all

he looks up slody at her and she meets his eyes
pleadingly) What you ain’t never understood is that I ain’t
got nothing, don’t own nothing, ain’t never really wanted
nothing that wasn’t for you. There ain’t nothing as
precious to me ... There ain’t nothing worth holding on to,
money, dreams, nothing else—if it means—if it means
it’s going to destroy my boy. ( She takes an envelope out
of her handbag and puts it in front of him and he
vetches her without speaking or moving) I paid the man
thirty-five hundred dollars down on the house. That leaves
sixty-five hundred dollars. Monday morning I want you to
take this money and take three thousand dollars and put
it in a savings account for Beneatha's medical schooling.
The rest you put in a checking account—with your name
on it. And from now on any penny that come out of it or
that go in it is for you to look after. For you to decide.
(She drops her hands a little helplessly) It ain’t much,
but it’s all I got in the world and I’m putting it in your
hands. I’m telling you to be the head of this family from
now on like you supposed to be.
WALTER (Stares at the money) You trust me like that,
Mama?

MAMA I ain’t never stop trusting you. Like I ain't never stop
loving you.

money on the table. Finally, in a decisive
gesture, he gets up, and, in mingled joy and
desperation, picks up the money. At the same
moment, travis enters for bed)

him) No, Daddy ain’t drunk. Daddy ain’t going to never
be drunk again....

Blackout
SCENE THREE
Time: Saturday, moving day, one week later.
Before the curtain rises, ruths voice, a strident,
dramatic church alto, cuts through the silence.
It is, in the darkness, a triumphant surge, a penetrating
statement of expectation: "Oh, Lord, I dont feel no ways
tired! Children, oh, glory hallelujah!”
As the curtain rises we see that ruth is alone in
the living room, finishing up the family’s packing.
It is moving day. She is nailing crates and tying
cartons, beneatha enters, carrying a guitar case,
and watches her exuberant sister-in-law.
RUTH Hey!
beneatha (Putting away the case) Hi.

RUTH (Pointing at a package) Honey—look in that package
there and see what I found on sale this morning at the
South Center, (ruth gets up and moves to the package
and draws out some curtains) Lookahere—hand-turned
hems!
BENEATHA How do you know the window size out there?
RUTH (Who hadnt thought of that) Oh—Well, they bound to
fit something in the whole house. Anyhow, they was too

good a bargain to pass up. (RUTH slaps her head,
suddenly remembering something) Oh, Bennie—I
meant to put a special note on that carton over there.
That's your mama’s good china and she wants ’em to be
very careful with it.
BENEA7HA I'll do it.
(beneatha finds a piece of paper and starts to
drawtarge letters on it)
RUTH You know what I’m going to do soon as I get in that
new house?
BENEATHA What?
RUTH Honey—I’m going to run me a tub of water up to
here ... (With her fingers practically up to her nostrils)
And I’m going to get in it—and I am going to sit ... and
sit ... and sit in that hot water and the first person who
knocks to tell me to hurry up and come out—
BENEATHA Gets shot at sunrise.
RUTH (Laughing happily) You said it, sister! ( Noticing how
large beneatha is absent-mindedly making the note)
Honey, they ain't going to read that from no airplane.
BENEATHA (Laughing herself) I guess I always think things
have more emphasis if they are big, somehow.
RUTH (Looking up at her and smiling) You and your brother
seem to have that as a philosophy of life. Lord, that man
—done changed so ’round here. You know—you know
what we did last night? Me and Walter Lee?

BENEATHA What?
ruth (Smiling to herself) We went to the movies. (Looking
at beneatha to see if she understands) We went to the
movies. You know the last time me and Walter went to
the movies together?

BENEA7HA NO.
ROTH Me neither. That’s how long it been. (Smiling again)
But we went last night. The picture wasn’t much good, but
that didn't seem to matter. We went—and we held hands.
BENEATHAOh, Lord!
RLTTH We held hands—and you know what?
BENEA7HA What?

BENEATHA You’re killing me.
(WALTER enters with a large package. His
happiness is deep in him; he cannot keep still
with his newfound exuberance. He is singing and
wiggling and snapping his fingers. He puts his
package in a corner and puts a phonograph
record, which he has brought in with him, on the
record player. As the music, soulful and
sensuous, comes up he dances over to ruth
and tries to get her to dance with him. She gives
in at last to his raunchiness and in a fit of
giggling allows herself to be drawn into his mood.
They dip and she melts into his arms in a
classic, body-melding “slow/drag')
beneatha (Regarding them a long time as they dance,
then drawing in her breath for a deeply exaggerated
comment which she does not particularly mean ) Talk
about—oldddddddddd-fashioneddddddd—Negroes!

WALTER (Stopping momentarily) What kind of Negroes?
(He says this in fun. He is not angry with her today, nor
with anyone. He starts to dance with his wife again)

BENEA7HA Old-fashioned.
WALTER (As he dances wth RUTH) You know, when these
New Negroes have their convention—( Pointing at his
sister) —that is going to be the chairman of the
Committee on Unending Agitation. (He goes on
dancing, then stops) Race, race, race! ... Girl, I do
believe you are the first person in the history of the entire
human race to successfully brainwash yourself.
(beneatha breaks up and he goes on dancing. He
stops again, enjoying his tease) Damn, even the N
double A C P takes a holiday sometimes! (BENEATHA
and ruth laugh. He dances wth ruth some more and
starts to laugh and stops and pantomimes someone
over an operating table) I can just see that chick
someday looking down at some poor cat on an operating
table and before she starts to slice him, she
says ... ( Pulling his sleeves back maliciously) “By the
way, what are your views on civil rights down there? ...”
(He laughs at her again and starts to dance
happily. The bell sounds)

but... words will never hurt me!
(beneatha goes to the door and opens it as
Walter and ruth go on wth the clowring.
beneatha is somewhat surprised to see a quiet¬
looking middle-aged white man in a business
suit holding his hat and a briefcase in his hand
and consulting a small piece of paper)

Younger? (He stops short, struck dumb at the

sight of the oblivious Walter and ruth)

(.Enunciating precisely but soundlessly: “There’s a white
man at the door!” They stop dancing, ruth cuts off the
phonograph, beneatha opens the door. The man casts
a curious quick glance at all of them) Uh—come in

BENEATHA My mother isn’t here just now. Is it business?
MAN Yes ... well, of a sort.
WALTER ( Freely ; the Man of the House) Have a seat. I’m
Mrs. Younger’s son. I look after most of her business
matters.

glances)

my wife—(RUTH nods politely) —and my sister.

leaning forward on his knees with interest and looking
expectantly into the newcomer’s face) What can we do

his knees) Well—I am a representative of the Clybourne
Park Improvement Association—

people—or at least your mother—has bought a piece of
residential property at— (He digs for the slip of paper
again) —four o six Clybourne Street...
WALTER That’s right. Care for something to drink? Ruth, get
Mr. Lindner a beer.
LINDNER (Upset for some reason) Oh—no, really. I mean
thank you very much, but no thank you.
RUTH (Innocently) Some coffee?
LINDNER Thank you, nothing at all.
(beneatha is watching the man carefully)
LINDNER Well, I don’t know how much you folks know about
our organization. (He is a gentle man ; thoughtful and
somewhat labored in his manner) It is one of these
community organizations set up to look after—oh, you
know, things like block upkeep and special projects and
we also have what we call our New Neighbors
Orientation Committee ...
BENEATHA (Drily) Yes—and what do they do?
lindner (Turning a little to her and then returning
the main force to WALTER) Well—it’s what you
might call a sort of welcoming committee, I guess.
I mean they, we—I’m the chairman of the
committee—go around and see the new people
who move into the neighborhood and sort of give
them the lowdown on the way we do things out in
Clybourne Park.

beneatha (With appreciation of the two meanings, which
escape ruth and Walter) Un-huh.
LINDNER And we also have the category of what the
association calls— (He looks elsewhere) —uh—special
community problems ...
BENEATHA Yes—and what are some of those?

LINDNER ( With understated relief) Thank you. I would sort of
like to explain this thing in my own way. I mean I want to
explain to you in a certain way.
WALTER Go ahead.
LINDNER Yes. Well. I’m going to try to get right to the point.
I’m sure we’ll all appreciate that in the long run.
BENEATHA Yes.
WALTER Be still now!
LINDNER Well—
RUTH (Still innocently) Would you like another chair—you
don’t look comfortable.
lindner (More frustrated than annoyed) No,
thank you very much. Please. Well—to get right to
the point I— (A great breath, and he is off at last) I
am sure you people must be aware of some of the
incidents which have happened in various parts of
the city when colored people have moved into
certain areas—(BENEATHA exhales heavily and
starts tossing a piece of fruit up and down in the
air) Well—because we have what I think is going
to be a unique type of organization in American
community life—not only do we deplore that kind
of thing—but we are trying to do something about
it. (beneatha stops tossing and turns with a new
and quizzical interest to the man) We feel—

(i gaining confidence in his mission because of
the interest in the faces of the people he is
talking to) —we feel that most of the trouble in this
world, when you come right down to it— (He hits
his knee for emphasis) —most of the trouble
exists because people just don’t sit down and talk
to each other.

remark) You can say that again, mister.

don't try hard enough in this world to understand the other
fellow’s problem. The other guy’s point of view.
RUTH Now that’s right.
(beneatha and Walter merely mtch and listen wth
genuine interest)
LINDNER Yes—that’s the way we feel out in Clybourne Park.
And that’s why I was elected to come here this afternoon
and talk to you people. Friendly like, you know, the way
people should talk to each other and see if we couldn’t
find some way to work this thing out. As I say, the whole
business is a matter of caring about the other fellow.
Anybody can see that you are a nice family of folks, hard
working and honest I’m sure. (BENEATHA frowis slightly,
quizzically, her head tilted regarding him) Today
everybody knows what it means to be on the outside of
something. And of course, there is always somebody
who is out to take advantage of people who don’t always
understand.
WALTER What do you mean?
LINDNER Well—you see our community is made up of
people who’ve worked hard as the dickens for years to
build up that little community. They’re not rich and fancy
people; just hard-working, honest people who don’t really

have much but those little homes and a dream of the kind
of community they want to raise their children in. Now, I
don’t say we are perfect and there is a lot wrong in some
of the things they want. But you’ve got to admit that a
man, right or wrong, has the right to want to have the
neighborhood he lives in a certain kind of way. And at the
moment the overwhelming majority of our people out
there feel that people get along better, take more of a
common interest in the life of the community, when they
share a common background. I want you to believe me
when I tell you that race prejudice simply doesn’t enter
into it. It is a matter of the people of Clybourne Park
believing, rightly or wrongly, as I say, that for the
happiness of all concerned that our Negro families are
happier when they live in their ov\n communities.

you came marching all the way over here to tell us?
LINDNER Well, now we’ve been having a fine conversation. I
hope you’ll hear me all the way through.
WALTER ( Tightly) Go ahead, man.
LINDNER You see—in the face of all the things I have said,
we are prepared to make your family a very generous
offer...
BENEATHA Thirty pieces and not a coin less!
WALTER Yeah?

the briefcase) Our association is prepared, through the
collective effort of our people, to buy the house from you
at a financial gain to your family.
RUTH Lord have mercy, ain’t this the living gall!
WALTER All right, you through?

financial arrangement—
WALTER We don’t want to hear no exact terms of no
arrangements. I want to know if you got any more to tell

’bout how people ought to sit down and talk to each

neighborhood where you just aren't wanted and where
some elements—well—people can get awful worked up
when they feel that their whole way of life and everything
they've ever worked for is threatened.

it went like this.

into the empty hallway) Where’s Willy, man?
BOBO He ain’t with me.

wife.

as though somehow she senses death, her eyes
fixed on her husband)
BOBO (His frightened eyes on the floor, his hat in his
hands) Could I please get a drink of water, before I tell
you about it, Walter Lee?

(WALTER does not take his eyes off the man.

water and brings it to BOBO)
WALTER There ain't nothing wrong, is there?
BOBO Lemme tell you—
WALTER Man—didn’t nothing go wrong?
BOBO Lemme tell you—Walter Lee. ( Looking at RUTH and
talking to her more than to Walter) You know how it
was. I got to tell you how it was. I mean first I got to tell
you how it was all the way ... I mean about the money I
put in, Walter Lee ...
WALTER ( With taut agitation now!) What about the money
you put in?
BOBO Well—it wasn’t much as we told you—me and Willy—

got a real bad feeling about it...

Willy— Me and Willy was going to go down to Springfield
and spread some money ’round so’s we wouldn't have to
wait so long for the liquor license ... That's what we were
going to do. Everybody said that was the way you had to
do, you understand, Miss Ruth?
WALTER Man—what happened down there?
bobo (A pitiful man, near tears) I’m trying to tell you,
Walter.
WALTER (Screaming at him suddenly) THEN TELL ME,
GODDAMMIT ... WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
BOBO Man ... I didn’t go to no Springfield, yesterday.

Walter ( Halted, life hanging in the moment) Why not?
BOBO ( The long way, the hard my to tell) 'Cause I didn’t
have no reasons to ...
WALTER Man, what are you talking about!
BOBO I’m talking about the fact that when I got to the train
station yesterday morning—eight o’clock like we
planned ... Man— Willy didn't never showup.
WALTER Why ... where was he ... where is he?
BOBO That’s what I’m trying to tell you ... I don’t know ... I
waited six hours ... I called his house ... and I
waited ... six hours ... I waited in that train station six
hours ...(Breaking into tears) That was all the extra
money I had in the world ... ( Looking up at WALTER with
the tears running down his face) Man, Willy is gone.
WALTER Gone, what you mean Willy is gone? Gone where?
You mean he went by himself. You mean he went off to
Springfield by himself—to take care of getting the license
—( Turns and looks anxiously at RUTH) You mean maybe
he didn’t want too many people in on the business down
there? ( Looks to RUTH again, as before) You know Willy
got his own ways. (Looks back to BOBO) Maybe you was
late yesterday and he just went on down there without
you. Maybe—maybe—he’s been callin’ you at home
tryin’ to tell you what happened or something. Maybe—

to find him. (Grabs BOBO senselessly by the collar and
starts to shake him) We got to!
BOBO (In sudden angry, frightened agony) What’s the
matter with you, Walter! When a cat take off with your
money he dont leave you no road maps!
Walter (Turning madly, as though he is looking for willy
in the very room) Willy! ... Willy ... don’t do it... Please

not with that money ... Oh, God ... Don’t let it be
true ... (He is wandering around, crying out for willy
and looking for him or perhaps for help from God)

hands ... (He starts to crumple down on the floor as
ruth just covers her face in horror, mama opens the
door and comes into the room, with beneatha behind
her) Man ... (He starts to pound the floor with his fists,
sobbing wildly) THAT MONEY IS MADE OUT OF MY

At curtain, there is a sullen light of gloom in the living
room, gray light not unlike that which began the first scene
of Act One. At left we can see Walter within his room,
alone with himself. He is stretched out on the bed, his shirt
out and open, his arms under his head. He does not
smoke, he does not cry out, he merely lies there, looking
up at the ceiling, much as if he were alone in the world.
In the living room beneatha sits at the table, still
surrounded by the now almost ominous packing crates.
She sits looking off. We feel that this is a mood struck
perhaps an hour before, and it lingers nowt full of the
empty sound of profound disappointment. We see on a
line from her brother’s bedroom the sameness of their
attitudes. Presently the bell rings and beneatha rises
without ambition or interest in answering. It is asagai,
smiling broadly, striding into the room with energy and
happy expectation and conversation.
ASAGAI I came over ... I had some free time. I thought I
might help with the packing. Ah, I like the look of packing
crates! A household in preparation for a journey! It
depresses some people ... but for me ... it is another
feeling. Something full of the flow of life, do you
understand? Movement, progress ... It makes me think
of Africa.
BENEATHA Africa!
ASAGAI What kind of a mood is this? Have I told you how

deeply you move me?
BENEA7HA He gave away the money, Asagai ...
ASAGAI Who gave away what money?
BENEA7HA The insurance money. My brother gave it away.
ASAGAI Gave it away?
BENEA7HA He made an investment! With a man even Travis
wouldn’t have trusted with his most worn-out marbles.
ASAGAI And it’s gone?

BENEATHA Gone!
ASAGAI I’m very sorry... And you, now?
BENEATHA Me? ... Me? ... Me, I’m nothing ... Me. When I
was very small ... we used to take our sleds out in the
wintertime and the only hills we had were the ice-covered
stone steps of some houses down the street. And we
used to fill them in with snow and make them smooth and
slide down them all day ... and it was very dangerous,
you know ... far too steep ... and sure enough one day a
kid named Rufus came down too fast and hit the
sidewalk and we saw his face just split open right there in
front of us ... And I remember standing there looking at
his bloody open face thinking that was the end of Rufus.
But the ambulance came and they took him to the
hospital and they fixed the broken bones and they sewed
it all up ... and the next time I saw Rufus he just had a
little line down the middle of his face ... I never got over
that...
ASAGAI What?
BENEATHA That that was what one person could do for
another, fix him up—sew up the problem, make him all
right again. That was the most marvelous thing in the
world ... I wanted to do that. I always thought it was the
one concrete thing in the world that a human being could
do. Fix up the sick, you know—and make them whole

again. This was truly being God ...
ASAGAI YOU wanted to be God?
BENEATHA No—I wanted to cure. It used to be so important
to me. I wanted to cure. It used to matter. I used to care. I
mean about people and how their bodies hurt...
ASAGAI And you’ve stopped caring?
BENEATHA Yes—I think so.
ASAGAI Why?
BENEATHA ( Bitterly ) Because it doesn’t seem deep enough,

close enough to what ails mankind! It was a child’s way
of seeing things—or an idealist’s.
ASAGAI Children see things very well sometimes—and
idealists even better.
BENEATHA I know that’s what you think. Because you are
still where I left off. You with all your talk and dreams
about Africa! You still think you can patch up the world.
Cure the Great Sore of Colonialism—( Loftily, mocking it)
with the Penicillin of Independence—!
ASAGAI Yes!
BENEATHA Independence and then what? What about all
the crooks and thieves and just plain idiots who will come
into power and steal and plunder the same as before—
only now they will be black and do it in the name of the
new Independence—WHAT ABOUT THEM?!
ASAGAI That will be the problem for another time. First we
must get there.
BENEATHA And where does it end?
ASAGAI End? Who even spoke of an end? To life? To
living?
BENEATHA An end to misery! To stupidity! Don’t you see
there isn’t any real progress, Asagai, there is only one
large circle that we march in, around and around, each of

us with our own little picture in front of us—our own little
mirage that we think is the future.
ASAGAI That is the mistake.
BENEA7HA What?
ASAGAI What you just said about the circle. It isn’t a circle—
it is simply a long line—as in geometry, you know, one
that reaches into infinity. And because we cannot see the
end—we also cannot see how it changes. And it is very
odd but those who see the changes—who dream, who
will not give up—are called idealists ... and those who
see only the circle we call them the “realists”!

BENEATHA Asagai, while I was sleeping in that bed in there,
people went out and took the future right out of my hands!
And nobody asked me, nobody consulted me—they just
went out and changed my life!
ASAGAI Was it your money?
BENEATHA What?
ASAGAI Was it your money he gave away?
BENEATHA It belonged to all of us.
ASAGAI But did you earn it? Would you have had it at all if
your father had not died?
BENEATHA No.
ASAGAI Then isn’t there something wrong in a house—in a
world—where all dreams, good or bad, must depend on
the death of a man? I never thought to see you like this,
Alaiyo. You! Your brother made a mistake and you are
grateful to him so that now you can give up the ailing
human race on account of it! You talk about what good is
struggle, what good is anything! Where are we all going
and why are we bothering!
BENEATHA AND YOU CANNOT ANSWER IT!
asagai (Shouting over her) I LIVE THE ANSWER!
(Pause) In my village at home it is the exceptional man

who can even read a newspaper... or who ever sees a
book at all. I will go home and much of what I will have to
say will seem strange to the people of my village. But I
will teach and work and things will happen, slowly and
swiftly. At times it will seem that nothing changes at
all ... and then again the sudden dramatic events which
make history leap into the future. And then quiet again.
Retrogression even. Guns, murder, revolution. And I even
will have moments when I wonder if the quiet was not
better than all that death and hatred. But I will look about
my village at the illiteracy and disease and ignorance
and I will not wonder long. And perhaps ... perhaps I will
be a great man ... I mean perhaps I will hold on to the

substance of truth and find my way always with the right
course ... and perhaps for it I will be butchered in my bed
some night by the servants of empire ...
beneatha The martyr!
ASAGAI (He smiles) ... or perhaps I shall live to be a very
old man, respected and esteemed in my new
nation ... And perhaps I shall hold office and this is what
I’m trying to tell you, Alaiyo: Perhaps the things I believe
now for my country will be wrong and outmoded, and I will
not understand and do terrible things to have things my
way or merely to keep my power. Don’t you see that
there will be young men and women—not British soldiers
then, but my own black countrymen—to step out of the
shadows some evening and slit my then useless throat?
Don’t you see they have always been there ... that they
always will be. And that such a thing as my own death will
be an advance? They who might kill me even ... actually
replenish all that I was.
BENEATHA Oh, Asagai, I know all that.
ASAGAI Good! Then stop moaning and groaning and tell me
what you plan to do.
BENEATHA Do?

ASAGAII have a bit of a suggestion.
BENEATHA What?
ASAGAI ( Rather quietly for him) That when it is all over—
that you come home with me—
beneatha (Staring at him and crossing amy wth
exasperation) Oh—Asagai—at this moment you decide
to be romantic!

dear, young creature of the New World—I do not mean
across the city—I mean across the ocean: home—to
Africa.

murmured amazement) To Africa?

completely and continues frantically and destructively
looking for something and hurling things to floor and
tearing things out of their place in his search, beneatha
ignores the eccentricity of his actions and goes on wth
the monologue of insult) Did you dream of yachts on
Lake Michigan, Brother? Did you see yourself on that
Great Day sitting down at the Conference Table,
surrounded by all the mighty bald-headed men in
America? All halted, waiting, breathless, waiting for your
pronouncements on industry? Waiting for you—

she closes the windows straightens her body with
effort and turns around to her children)
MAMA Well—ain’t it a mess in here, though? (A false
cheerfulness, a beginning of something) I guess we all
better stop moping around and get some work done. All
this unpacking and everything we got to do. (RUTH raises
her head slowiy in response to the sense of the line;
and beneatha in similar manner turns very slowiy to
look at her mother) One of you all better call the moving
people and tell 'em not to come.

way here and having to go back. They charges for that

WALTER Talking ’bout life, Mama. You all always telling me
to see life like it is. Well—I laid in there on my back
today ... and I figured it out. Life just like it is. Who gets

enough. Between the takers and the “tooken.” (He
laughs) I've figured it out finally. (He looks around at

laughs) People like Willy Harris, they don’t never get
“tooken.” And you know why the rest of us do? ’Cause we
all mixed up. Mixed up bad. We get to looking ’round for
the right and the wrong; and we worry about it and cry
about it and stay up nights trying to figure out ’bout the
wrong and the right of things all the time ... And all the

going to help him ... I’m going to put on the show, Mama.
MAMA Son—I come from five generations of people who
was slaves and sharecroppers—but ain’t nobody in my
family never let nobody pay ’em no money that was a way
of telling us we wasn't fit to walk the earth. We ain’t never
been that poor. (Raising her eyes and looking at him)
We ain’t never been that—dead inside.
BENEATHA Well—we are dead now. All the talk about
dreams and sunlight that goes on in this house. It’s all
dead now.
WALTER What’s the matter with you all! I didn't make this
world! It was give to me this way! Hell, yes, I want me

pearls ’round my wife’s neck. Ain’tshe supposed to wear
no pearls? Somebody tell me—tell me, who decides
which women is suppose to wear pearls in this world. I
tell you I am a man —and I think my wife should wear
some pearls in this world!
(This last line hangs a good while and Walter
begins to move about the room. The word “Man”
has penetrated his consciousness; he mumbles
it to himself repeatedly between strange agitated
pauses as he moves about)
MAMA Baby, how you going to feel on the inside?
WALTER Fine! ... Going to feel fine ... a man ...
MAMA You won’t have nothing left then, Walter Lee.
WALTER ( Coming to her) I’m going to feel fine, Mama. I’m
going to look that son-of-a-bitch in the eyes and say—
(He falters) —and say, “All right, Mr. Lindner—(He falters
even more) —that’s your neighborhood out there! You
got the right to keep it like you want! You got the right to
have it like you want! Just write the check and—the
house is yours.” And—and I am going to say— (His voice
almost breaks) “And you—you people just put the money
in my hand and you won’t have to live next to this bunch of
stinking niggers! ...” (He straightens up and moves
away from his mother, walking around the room) And
maybe—maybe I'll just get down on my black
knees ... (He does so; ruth and bennie and mama
watch him in frozen horror) “Captain, Mistuh, Bossman—
(Groveling and grinning and winging his hands in
profoundly anguished imitation of the slovwvtted movie
stereotype) A-hee-hee-hee! Oh, yassuh boss!
Yasssssuh! Great white— (Voice breaking, he forces
himself to go on) —Father, just gi’ ussen de money, fo’

God’s sake, and we’s—we’s ain’t gwine come out deh
and dirty up yo’ white folks neighborhood ...” (He breaks
down completely) And I'll feel fine! Fine! FINE! (He gets
up and goes into the bedroom)
BENEA7HA That is not a man. That is nothing but a toothless
rat.

MAMA Yes—death done come in this here house. ( She is
nodding, slowJy, reflectively) Done come walking in my
house on the lips of my children. You what supposed to
be my beginning again. You—what supposed to be my
harvest. (To BENEATHA) YOU—you mourning your
brother?
BENEATHA He’s no brother of mine.
MAMA What you say?
BENEATHA I said that that individual in that room is no
brother of mine.
MAMA That’s what I thought you said. You feeling like you
better than he is today? (BENEATHA does not answer)
Yes? What you tell him a minute ago? That he wasn’t a
man? Yes? You give him up for me? You done wrote his
epitaph too—like the rest of the world? Well, who give
you the privilege?
BENEATHA Be on my side for once! You saw what he just
did, Mama! You saw him—down on his knees. Wasn't it
you who taught me to despise any man who would do
that? Do what he's going to do?
MAMA Yes—I taught you that. Me and your daddy. But I
thought I taught you something else too ... I thought I
taught you to love him.
BENEATHA Love him? There is nothing left to love.
MAMA There is always something left to love. And if you
ain’t learned that, you ain’t learned nothing. (Looking at
her) Have you cried for that boy today? I don’t mean for

yourself and for the family ’cause we lost the money. I
mean for him: what he been through and what it done to
him. Child, when do you think is the time to love
somebody the most? When they done good and made
things easy for everybody? Well then, you ain’t through
learning—because that ain’t the time at all. It’s when he's
at his lowest and can’t believe in hisself ’cause the world
done whipped him so! When you starts measuring
somebody, measure him right, child, measure him right.

valleys he come through before he got to wherever he is.
(TRAVIS bursts into the room at the end of the
speech, leaving the door open)
TRAVIS Grandmama—the moving men are downstairs! The
truck just pulled up.
MAMA ( Turning and looking at him) Are they, baby? They
downstairs?
(She sighs and sits, lindner appears in the
doorway. He peers in and knocks lightly, to gain
attention, and comes in. All turn to look at him)
lindner ( Hat and briefcase in hand) Uh—hello ... (ruth
crosses mechanically to the bedroom door and opens it
and lets it swing open freely and slowiy as the lights
come up on Walter within, still in his coat, sitting at the
far comer of the room. He looks up and out through the
room to LINDNER)
RUTH He’s here.
(.A long minute passes and Walter slowiy gets
up)
lindner ( Coming to the table with efficiency, putting his

briefcase on the table and starting to unfold papers and
unscrew fountain pens) Well, I certainly was glad to hear
from you people. (Walter has begun the trek out of the
room, slowiy and awkwardly, rather like a small boy,
passing the back of his sleeve across his mouth from
time to time) Life can really be so much simpler than
people let it be most of the time. Well—with whom do I
negotiate? You, Mrs. Younger, or your son here? (MAMA
sits with her hands folded on her lap and her eyes
closed as Walter advances, travis goes closer to
lindner and looks at the papers curiously) Just some
official papers, sonny.
RUTH Travis, you go downstairs—
mama ( Opening her eyes and looking into WALTER’S) No.

Travis, you stay right here. And you make him understand
what you doing, Walter Lee. You teach him good. Like
Willy Harris taught you. You show where our five
generations done come to. (WALTER looks from her to
the boy who grins at him innocently) Go ahead, son—
(She folds her hands and closes her eyes) Go ahead.
Walter [At last crosses to lindner, who is reviewing the
contract) Well, Mr. Lindner. (BENEATHA turns away) We
called you—( There is a profound, simple groping
quality in his speech) —because, well, me and my family
(He looks around and shifts from one foot to the other)
Well—we are very plain people ...
LINDNER Yes—
WALTER I mean—I have worked as a chauffeur most of my
life—and my wife here, she does domestic work in
people’s kitchens. So does my mother. I mean—we are
plain people ...
LINDNER Yes, Mr. Younger—
WALTER (Really like a small boy, looking down at his

shoes and then up at the man) And—uh—well, my
father, well, he was a laborer most of his life....
LINDNER (Absolutely confused) Uh, yes—yes, I understand.
(He turns back to the contract)
WALTER (A beat; staring at him) And my father— (With
sudden intensity) My father almost beat a man to death
once because this man called him a bad name or
something, you know what I mean?
LINDNER ( Looking up, frozen) No, no, I’m afraid I don’t—
Walter (A beat. The tension hangs; then Walter steps
back from it) Yeah. Well—what I mean is that we come
from people who had a lot of pride. I mean—we are very
proud people. And that’s my sister over there and she's
going to be a doctor—and we are very proud—
LINDNER Well—I am sure that is very nice, but—

WALTER What I am telling you is that we called you over
here to tell you that we are very proud and that this—
(Signaling to TRAVIS) Travis, come here. (TRAVIS crosses
and Walter draws him before him facing the man) This
is my son, and he makes the sixth generation our family
in this country. And we have all thought about your offer—
LINDNER Well, good ... good—
WALTER And we have decided to move into our house
because my father—my father—he earned it for us brick
by brick, (mama has her eyes closed and is rocking
back and forth as though she were in church, with her
head nodding the Amen yes) We don’t want to make no
trouble for nobody or fight no causes, and we will try to be
good neighbors. And that’s all we got to say about that.
(He looks the man absolutely in the eyes) We don’t
want your money. (He turns and walks away)
lindner ( Looking around at all of them) I take it then—that
you have decided to occupy ...

BENEA7HA That’s what the man said.
lindner (To mama in her reverie) Then I would like to
appeal to you, Mrs. Younger. You are older and wiser
and understand things better I am sure ...
MAMA I am afraid you don’t understand. My son said we
was going to move and there ain’t nothing left for me to
say. (Briskly) You know how these young folks is
nowadays, mister. Can’t do a thing with ’em! (As he
opens his mouth, she rises) Good-bye.
LINDNER (Folding up his materials) Well—if you are that
final about it ... there is nothing left for me to say. (He
finishes, almost ignored by the family, 1 / 1/70 are
concentrating on Walter lee. At the door lindner halts
and looks around) I sure hope you people know what
you’re getting into.

sake—if the moving men are here—LET'S GET THE
HELL OUT OF HERE!

somebody's hoodlum! Lord have mercy, where is my
plant? (She flies to get it amid the general bustling of
the family, i/i/to are deliberately trying to ignore the
nobility of the past moment) You all start on
down ... Travis child, don’t go empty-handed ... Ruth,
where did I put that box with my skillets in it? I want to be
in charge of it myself... I’m going to make us the biggest
dinner we ever ate tonight ... Beneatha, what’s the
matter with them stockings? Pull them things up, girl...

appearand begin to carry out the heavier pieces
of furniture, bumping into the family as they
move about)

You ain’t old enough to marry nobody— (Seeing the
moving men lifting one of her chairs precariously)
Darling, that ain't no bale of cotton, please handle it so
we can sit in it again! I had that chair twenty-five years ...

with their work)

conversation) To go to Africa, Mama—be a doctor in
Africa ...

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

LORRAINE HANSBERRY touched the taproots of American life
as only a very few playwrights ever can in A Raisin in the
Sun, the play that made her in 1959, at 29, the youngest
American, the fifth woman, and the first black playwright to
win the Best Play of the Year Award of the New York
Drama Critics. In Raisin, wrote James Baldwin, “never
before in the entire history of the American theater had so
much of the truth of black people’s lives been seen on the
stage." Published and produced worldwide in over thirty
languages and in thousands of productions nationally, the
play “changed American theater forever” and became an
American classic, as The New York Times summarized
recently. In 1961, Hansberry’s film adaptation of the play
won a Cannes Festival Award and was nominated Best
Screenplay; in the 1970s it was adapted into a Tony Award
—winning musical; and in the 1980s a major resurgence
began with revivals at a dozen regional theaters and the
1989 American Playhouse production for television of the
complete play, unabridged for the first time.
On January 12, 1965, during the run of her second play
The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window, cancer claimed
Lorraine Hansberry. She was 34. “Her creative literary
ability and her profound grasp of the deep social issues
confronting the world today” predicted Martin Luther King,
Jr., on her death, “will remain an inspiration to generations
yet unborn.” These words have proved prophetic as more
and more of her work has become known.
To Be Young, Gifted and Black, a portrait of Hansberry
in her own words, was the longest-running off-Broadway
drama of 1969; it has been staged in every state of the

Union, recorded, filmed, televised, and expanded into the
widely read “informal autobiography” of the same title (not
to be confused with the play), while the title itself (from her

last speech) has entered the language. Les Blancs (The
Whites), her drama of revolution in Africa, presented
posthumously on Broadway, received the votes of six critics
for Best American Play of 1970 and, since its acclaimed
revival at the Arena Stage in 1988, has begun a
resurgence of its own with productions planned at many
regional theaters.
In her plays Hansberry illuminated the extraordinary lives
and aspirations of “ordinary” people—black and white,
American, African, and European—confronting the most
fundamental challenges and choices of the century. Her
published works include the above-mentioned plays, To Be
Young, Gifted and Black: An Informal Autobiography , and
Lorraine Hansberry: The Collected Last Plays and The
Movement, a photohistory of the Civil Rights struggle.
Excerpts from her speeches and interviews are recorded in
the Caedmon album Lorraine Hansberry Speaks Out: Art
and the Black Revolution.

LES BLANCS
The Collected Last Plays
“Hansberry, like the great Bernard Shaw, knew how to
make provocative characters become real people on the
stage ... representing a variety of viewpoints on a subject
of overwhelming importance.”
—NewYork Daily News
Les Blancs is a drama of Shakespearean grandeur set in
the shifting moral terrain of late-colonial Africa, where her
anguished hero must choose between two different kinds of
loyalty and two fatally opposing codes of conduct. The
Drinking Gourd traces the strangled interdependence of
slaves, slave owners, and overseers. And What Use Are
Flowers? is a whimsical yet deadly serious fantasy about
the aftermath of a nuclear conflagration.
“Somewhere, past performance, staging and written
speech, resides [the] brilliant anguished consciousness of
Lorraine Hansberry.”
—The NewYork Times
