hazeley family the johnson ae  novel
sixteenyearold flora hazeley stood by the table in the dingy little dining room looking down earnestly and thoughtfully at a shapely yellow sweet potato

it was only a potato but the sight of it brought to its owner not only a crowd of pleasant memories but a number of unpleasant anticipations hence the earnest thoughtful expression on her young face

flora was the only daughter she had two brothers one older and one younger than herself harry and alec aged respectively eighteen and thirteen the mother was of an easygoing careless disposition and seemed indifferent to the management of her household especially did she dislike responsibility of any kind she was well pleased therefore to receive one day a letter from her sister mrs graham a childless widow offering to take flora who was then just five years old promising to rear her as if she had been her own daughter

mrs graham was well off in her case this meant that she lived in a pretty home of her own with a nice income not only supporting herself in comfort but permitting her to provide a home for her elder sister for many years who had entire charge of the housekeeping this sister mrs sarah martin was also a widow and childless the resemblance went no further for they differed not only in manner but opinions thoughts and character

mrs graham after a great deal of careful thought had come to the conclusion to adopt her little niece in fact she had often thought it over ever since the child first began to walk and call her by name she was a sensible woman and it always annoyed her when she would visit her sister to see the careless way in which the children were being trained seeing this she had long wished to take and train flora according to her own idea of what constituted the education of a girl

 it will be so much worse for her than for the boys she had said one day to mrs martin i do dislike to see such a bright little child brought up to be good for nothing and that is just the way in which it will be if i do not take charge of her myself

the latter clause was intended to draw indirectly from her sister an opinion of such a proceeding for mrs martin was by no means partial to children however it was received with the indifferent observation esther never did have any interest in children anyhow she never had any idea how to take care of herself much less anybody else to which was added a remark to the effect that if her sister bertha chose to burden herself with a troublesome child she was sure she had nothing to do with the matter and did not intend to have

mrs graham was rather surprised to have her suggestion received so coolly she had expected a great deal of trouble in getting sarah to consent even provisionally she was very glad to meet no more serious opposition for although she had fully decided in her own mind regarding the matter yet her peaceloving nature dreaded unpleasant scenes she purposely and entirely overlooked the expression of stern determination in the sharpfeatured countenance of her sister and forthwith resolved to send for flora without further loss of time

thus it was that flora hazeley changed homes she was not legally adopted by her aunt but was simply taken with the understanding she would be returned to her parents in case mrs graham should in any way change her mind or weary of her charge this provision was inserted by mrs martin who determined in spite of her seeming indifference not to be ignored by her sister upon whose bounty she considered she had a primary claim

for eleven years flora lived in the pretty home of her aunt bertha her time was filled by various occupations school caring for the flowers in the garden and dreaming under the old peach tree which never bore any peaches but grew on contentedly in the farthest corner of the yard

however these were by no means the only ways in which flora spent her time for mrs martin notwithstanding her stern resolve not to have anything to do with her had suddenly taken an equally stern determination to do her share toward  bringing sister esthers child up properly

this was fortunate for flora aunt sarah instructed her thoroughly and carefully in the details of housekeeping cooking serving washing in fact everything she knew herself how fortunate it was that she learned bow to do these things flora realized some time afterward as mrs martin had intended she should while she was learning them floras progress was due rather more to the awe she felt of her stern aunt than to the desire to excel

mrs martin was ever ready to scold and find fault mrs graham never criticised but always had a bright smile and something pleasant to say as a natural consequence she was dearly loved by her niece

mrs hazeley floras mother delighted to be relieved of her troublesome little girl settled down more contentedly than ever to enjoy the quiet of her daughters absence and became daily more and more indisposed to exert herself in order to make her home attractive

it was usually pretty quiet now because neither of the boys stayed in the house a moment longer than necessity demanded mr hazeley was employed on the railroad and consequently was away from home a great deal mrs hazeley did little but turn aimlessly about making herself believe that she was a very hardworking woman and then imagining herself much fatigued found it necessary to rest often and long she was at heart a good woman when that organ could be reached but possessed a weak vacillating disposition entirely lacking the gentle firmness of her sister mrs graham or the uncompromising energy of mrs martin

mr hazeley had long ceased to complain of his home and its management for his words had no further effect than to bring upon himself a storm of tearful scolding which drove him out of the house to seek more genial quarters he was by nature a peaceable man and when he found that neither ease nor peace could be had at home remained there as little as possible in fact as mrs hazeleys sisters had often said if the whole family did not go to ruin it would not be esthers fault

floras life at her aunts pleasant home had been a very happy one and the time passed rapidly away she was nearly through school and looked eagerly forward into the future that to her was so full of brightest hopes it was her ambition to be of some use in the world just what she wanted to do she did not knowâ she had not yet determined but that it was to be something great and good she was confident for small things did not enter into her conception of usefulness

aunt bertha was her confidante for all her plans or rather dreams she could do nothing without aunt bertha for had not she the means  flora felt sure nothing great could be done without money that is nothing she would care to do

but alas  her summer sky so promising and brilliant with hopes and indefinite plans was suddenly overcast aunt bertha was taken ill one day the doctor said it was prostration and he feared she might not rally flora was told her aunt bertha whom she loved so dearly and who loved her so much i must she die i love her far more than my mother she whispered to herself this seemed very disloyal in flora but in truth she had little cause to love the mother who had been so eager to relinquish her claim and who in all these years had never expressed a wish to have her daughter at home

during her sisters illness aunt sarah spent her time in constant attendance upon her she was cold stern and unapproachable as ever giving the child little information in regard to the sick one who had been so kind to her she was not allowed to enter the sick room during the first of her aunts illness although mrs graham had often asked to see her niece

one day just before the spirit passed away the sick woman called her sister and said in a weak trembling voice  sister i suppose you know i cannot live long and that my will is made

mrs martin silently nodded

well continued mrs graham i have left everything to youâi thought it would be best

again a silent nod

 but sarah i want you to promise one thing that you will see flora has what she needs to carry out her plans the dear child has so longed to carry out some of her plans i want her to have means to make whatever she may decide upon a success and one more thing she continued pausing for breath and looking pleadingly into the face above her  i do hope sarah that you will keep flora here with you do not send her back to her home i have left all i own in your hands and i trust to you sister to do what i wish

this long expression of her wishes had so taxed the fastfailing strength of the invalid that she sank back exhausted no answer was expected and mrs martin was silent and silent too because she had not the slightest intention of doing as her sister wished it was truly heartless but mrs martin was one of those people who do not present the harsh side of their nature in all its intensity until the reins of power are placed in their hands so long as mrs graham held the pursestrings she acquiesced with as much grace as possible in her sisters plans was not the money mrs grahams to do with as she pleased it was quite a different thing however to feel that now everything would be in her hands to use as she chose no matter if the donor was still looking into her face her mind was made up that things should be ordered in the future according to her good pleasure it was not at all her wish to burden herself with esthers child and forthwith she decided that back to her home flora should go however she did not allow these unworthy thoughts to disturb the last moments of her tenderhearted sister by giving expression to them so good mrs graham passed peacefully away

flora was allowed to see her shortly before she died the kind voice whispered words of comfort telling her that aunt sarah would take care of her these words fell unnoticed at the time upon the ear of the sobbing girl who had been so accustomed to have aunt bertha think and plan for her

mrs grahams life had been a quiet unobtrusive but truly christian one she had neglected no opportunity to implant in her young niece a love and reverence for holy things and now that she was about to die she felt that she had nothing to regret that she had left no duty unfulfilled so far as floras training was concerned it was with a heart full of peace that she commended her charge to the one above all others and took her leave of earth

flora was almost inconsolable she had no one to comfort her for aunt sarah was as distant as ever being entirely too much occupied with plans for the future to care about flora her mother came to the funeral but neither was overjoyed to see the other after their long separation it could scarcely be otherwise natural affection had never been conspicuous in the hazeley home and the influence of these years apart bad not helped matters at all indeed they were little more to each other than strangers

after they returned from the cemetery however aunt sarah informed flora she was to return with her mother to her former and as she deemed it rightful home the feelings with which the girl received this intelligence were by no means pleasant ones but there was no use in crying or fretting about it for when aunt sarah said a thing she meant it and could not be induced to alter her decision even if flora had felt inclined to ask her to do so this she had no thought of doing for she was not at all anxious to make her home with her cold distant aunt

 it is too bad   she exclaimed as she thought of all the bright helpful plans she and aunt bertha had made together and which they had hoped to be able to carry out  it is too bad  she sobbed as she bent over her trunk in her pretty little bedroom the tears falling on the tasteful dresses and the many loving tokens that had been given her by the dear hands now at rest beneath the unfeeling earth in the churchyard

mrs martin was surprised that floras mother made no objection to taking her daughter home the truth was mrs hazeley had been wanting this very thing for some time it was not however because of any particularly affectionate or motherly feeling toward her child but she had been thinking that flora of whose ability she had heard much would be a very great help to her in caring for the house thus it was that flora returned to the home she had left eleven years before

just as the train was preparing to leave the station lottie piper one of floras friends and admirers came running to the car and tossed something through the open window into floras lap saying hurriedly and pantingly as she pressed the hand held out to her there flora take that dont laugh i raised it all myself and i want you to have it but dont eat it keep it to remember me by goodbye she called as the train moved off

flora waved her handkerchief out of the window to lottie until her arm was tired as she looked about the cars her attention was attracted by a titter from the opposite side at first she could not understand why the girl who sat there should look at her and smile as her neighbor gazed at her lap floras eyes followed and there she saw the cause of the merriment in lotties parting giftâa yellow sweet potato

at first she felt inclined to be provoked with lottie for bringing such a thing and causing her to be laughed at however the remembrance of her parting words  i raised it all myself but dont eat it  made her smile in spite of herself this encouraged the girl opposite to slip over to the seat beside flora as mrs hazeley was occupying the one in front and the two girls although entire strangers to each other chatted away busily until the train stopped at one of the stations where the girl and her father who sat farther back left the car soon after flora found herself at home bartonville and brinton being but a short distance apart

this brings us to the opening of our story

it was lotties potato that lay upon the table and flora had been wondering what to do with it the memories it awakened were of brinton and the many pleasant strolls and romps she had enjoyed with lottie in her fathers fields which joined mrs grahams of aunt bertha herself and much more

 but what am i to do with the potato   she questioned  i am not to eat it i dont care to either

oh i know i will plant it in a jar of water and let it grow that would please lottie i guess

she soon found a jar such as she wanted and after washing it clean and bright filled it full of clear water and carefully placed the potato end up in it and then looked about for a suitable place for it

 that window has a good broad seat she said to herself and it is sunny but the glass is so grimy  however it will do better yet i will open the window this was more easily said than done for although the weather was still warmâit being septemberâthe window did not appear to have been opened for some time

flora struggled and pushed and at length succeeded in opening it making noise enough as she did so to attract the attention of a young girl who was passing she stopped looking up inquiringly

flora was heated with her exertions and the thought of having attracted attention so that before she realized what she was doing she was smiling and saying   this old window was very hard to raise but i was determined to do it

no said the girl looking as if she was not quite sure that it was the right thing to say

what is that in the jar she asked as she came closer and looked at the potato curiously and then at flora in a friendly way that pleased her

this said flora patting the vegetable it is a potato

but what have you put it in there for persisted the girl

 to grow to be sure

 will it grow 

 of course it will replied flora with an important air  see water is in this jar and soon this potato will sprout send roots down and leaves up and thenâand thenâit will just keep on growing you know and flora felt sure that she had put quite an artistic finish to her description of potato culture

 oh yes cried her new acquaintance with an intelligent light in her eyes  i know very well what will happen then

 what  asked flora rather dubiously

 why little sweet potatoes will grow on the roots of course

 iâi dont think they will said flora hesitatingly not being well versed on the subject

yes but they mustâthey always do returned the girl positively

well but there would be no room in the jar for potatoes to grow said flora

 thats so and the girl looked puzzled then they both laughed not knowing what else to do

 what is your name   asked flora by way of changing the subject for she was a little fearful she might be asked to explain why little sweet potatoes would not grow in her jar

my name is ruth rudd was the answer what is yours  

 flora hazeley

is it well i live just back of your house on the next street goodbye i guess i will see you some other time and she hurried away

she is a real nice girl flora thought as she turned away from the window  i hope i can see her again

she stood for an instant looking about the room it was nicely furnished but it looked neglected and untidy and flora having been so long accustomed to the attractiveness and order of her aunts house felt homesick her loneliness came over her in a great wave of feeling and running through the kitchen out of the door went into the yard which was a goodsized one but so filled with rubbish and piles of boards scarcely noticed through her tears that she met with many a stumble before she reached the farther end she wanted some quiet place in which to sit and think as she used to do under the old peach tree at brinton she was sure she  could think of nothing in that house and the best she could do was to seat herself on an old block at the very back of the yard she felt she could think better out in the open air under the sky for she was a great lover of nature and loved to look at the blue sky the sun was under a cloud but the air was warm and pleasant

how different were her thoughts now from what they had been under the old peach tree then she had reveled in rosecolored dreams now she was confronted by gray realities her thoughts went rapidly over her life since aunt berthas death

she had been here not quite a week and she found it such a different place from the home she had so lately left that she was almost unwilling to call it  home but while she considered her present home not very desirable she had given no thought to the inmates whether or not they had found in her a very desirable addition to the circle

she was young and she soon wearied of her sombre thoughts which could avail her nothing and she glanced at the houses on each side of her own there was a marked difference it was not in the style of the building for hers was the most attractive it was however in the general appearance and flora felt she would like to begin at the topmost shingle and pull her home down to the ground but the thought came to her that then she would have no home she knew there was no room for her with aunt sarah who was no doubt at this very moment enjoying her absence

 no indeed i do not want to live with aunt sarah she thought and then began to wonder vaguely if she had not better go to work and try to make her present home a more congenial one the more she thought about it the better the idea pleased her just as she was endeavoring to decide upon something definite to do she was startled by seeing a board in the fence just behind her pushed aside before she could move a round fat little face was thrust through the opening and a pair of inquisitive brown eyes were fastened upon her for a moment they looked and then the owner squeezed through and stood still eyeing flora complacently

 well and who are you and what do you mean by coming in here that way   asked flora amused at the oddlooking little creature

 im jem answered the midget coolly  and i didnt mean nuffing

 jem  i thought you were a girl said flora looking at the quaint shortwaisted dress that reached almost down to the copper toed shoes and the funny little short white apron tied just under the fat arms which were squeezed into sleeves much too tight for them

so i am a girl answered jem indignantly dont you see ive gut a napron on wif pockets in and she thrust her chubby little fingers into one of them

 but you said your name was  jem and thats a boys name persisted flora enjoying her odd companion

 taint none was the sententious reply  its short for jemima thats what my really name is

 well jemima what do you want in here 

 nuffing

 nothing  well that isnt in here

there aint anythin elses i can see retorted jem turning down the corners of her mouth very far and looking about disdainfully

flora laughed outright at this but her visitors countenance lost none of its solemnity

 you do not seem to admire my yard jem

 dont see anythin to remire retorted jem  youd just ought to peep in ours and she moved over to the fence and pulling away the board with a triumphant air motioned flora to look flora looked but the first thing she saw was not the yard but the young girl with whom she had been talking not an hour since

ruth standing by a long wooden bench in the neat brickpaved yard was engaged in watering some plants that were her especial pride

hearing a noise at the fence she turned and recognizing flora smiled and asked  wont you come in  

thank you replied flora smiling in return i think i will

jem looked on wonderingly as her sister and the visitor whom she considered her especial property chatted

she could not understand how they knew each other at length as they took no notice of her she determined to assert herself so going up to flora she demanded  what do you think of my yard  

 oh said flora recollecting for what purpose they had come  i like it very much indeed jem

 its a pretty good yard i think said jem with much emphasis on the pronoun  come and look at the flowers and ill tell you the names of them and she drew flora nearer the bench

 this is a gibonia she continued pointing with her fat finger to the flower named

you mean a begonia dont you jem said flora

yes answered jem without changing countenance in the least or seeming in any way abashed  and this is a gerangum

a geranium corrected flora yes i see

and this is a chipoonia pointing to a petunia  andâoh theres pokey  and breaking away in the midst of her explanations she gave chase to a fat little gray kitten that just then scampered across the yard and into the house

 what a cute little girl jem is said flora to ruth is she your sister

yes that is she is my halfsister her mother was not my own mother you know

 oh she is your stepmother said flora

she was corrected ruth but she has been dead ever since jem was a little baby my own mother died when i was quite small she added with an elderly air

 who keeps house for you   asked flora in surprise

 i do replied ruth  i keep bouse for father and take care of jem she is all the company i have

 what a smart girl you are how old are you ruth  

im sixteen but i feel ever so much older you see it is a great responsibility to have everything at home resting upon one and ruth looked very wise

i should think so said flora thoughtfully i am sixteen too

 are you  thats nice we ought to be good friends returned ruth smiling

yes i am sure we shall be replied flora earnestly i like you ever so much ruth i am very lonely here i know nobody in this place except my home folks

 how strange said ruth in a puzzled way  tell me about it

flora was glad to tell her story

 you poor child   exclaimed matronly ruth taking her hand between both her own and pressing it  how sorry i am for you

 are you   said flora laughing nervously for she felt more like crying  i was just feeling sorry for you  sorry for me  why  

 because you have to live here all alone or almost alone and have so many responsibilities you must get very lonely

 oh but my responsibilities keep me so busy i have no time to be lonely besides i like responsibilities you do  perhaps if i had a few i wouldnt be so lonely either but then you see i have none

i think you have returned ruth soberly and added after a moments thought  i think you have a great many

 what are they  

your mother and father and brothers and your home you are responsible for your conduct toward your parents it is your duty to be a good daughter theres your home it is your duty to make it pleasant and comfortable and there are your brothers

 oh do stop ruth  cried flora you have told me enough you talk as if you were thirty years old instead of sixteen no no i will not hear any more today about responsibilities i have had enough for one day and she playfully placed her hand over ruths lips

i wasnt going to say any more about them said ruth  i was only going to ask you to come into the house for i must begin to prepare our supper

 no thank you   replied flora  i must go now but i should like to come again soon

 indeed come as often as you please the oftener you come the better i shall like it come right through the fence whenever you want to you will almost always find me here

 thank you said flora she bade ruth goodbye and returned home the same way she had come entirely unconscious of the look of disapproval with which little jem was regarding her from the window of an upper room whither she had retreated with her precious pokey

jem felt quite slighted flora and ruth had been so much occupied with each other as to forget entirely her important little self and she determined to severely punish  sister ruth  for her conduct she immediately proceeded to put her determination into execution by stowing herself and pokey away in the darkest corner under the bed and there she remained in spite of ruths coaxing calls

ruth found her there fast asleep when she went to look for her at teatime ruth was well acquainted with jems various modes of punishing her and she readily guessed the cause of her little sisters present displeasure and likewise knowing her well she decided to let her alone until she was ready to come down at last jem came down while ruth was washing the dishes she was in perfectly good spirits for she felt satisfied that her sister had been sufficiently punished in having been deprived of her company for so long a time she sat down quietly and ate her supper which had been set aside for her she did not say anything about the events of the afternoon and neither did ruth who was busy thinking about flora strangely enough influenced by some unseen power flora was at the same moment thinking of ruth when our young friend entered her home she found her father had returned in her absence her mother was hurrying about in an aimless impatient way trying to get supper and at the same time set the table these two occupations were not progressing very rapidly in her nervous hands

harry and alec were both in the dining room the former sitting by the window reading and the latter whittling a bit of wood with his pocketknife and letting the chips fly and settle where they would it was not a very inviting picture but with ruths gentle face before her and her words  it is your duty to be a good daughter  in her mind flora stoutly determined she would begin immediately and undertake her responsibilities in the very best way she could with these thoughts she quietly said to her mother she would finish setting the table it was not much to do but she felt a great deal better in making this first effort to be of use in her home

 what have i been thinking about not to have been doing this before  it is an actual treat to be busy she continued to herself as she placed the plates cups and saucers on the table she did not know it but both harry and alec were watching her whenever they were sure she was not looking

the boys had not paid any attention to their sister since her return home in fact they both thought it a bother to have a girl about the place moreover flora had made no effort to prove herself a very valuable addition to the little family but this evening as she moved back and forth the neat and tasteful way in which she arranged the table was so different from the usual careless manner that both boys were favorably impressed mrs hazeley too when she hurried in with the supper gave a sigh of relief as she noted that everything was ready and the father although preoccupied with his own thoughts glanced about with a pleased look in his eyes

although flora was not aware of all this she did not fail to notice there was a difference from the ordinary meal the boys refrained from their usual snappish behavior the mother was less peevish and her fathers face wore a look of quiet approval on the whole there was change enough to cause flora to determine she would follow out the suggestion of her friend ruth and endeavor to make her home what she desired it to be

when supper was over harry and alec took their hats and went out no one asking where they were going or when they would return

 how queer thought flora who had volunteered to clear the table and wash the dishes how queer that neither mother nor father seems to care where the boys go or what they do and realizing the indifference of her parents flora began to feel an interest in the pursuits of her brothers

when flora retired to rest that night she felt quite pleased with her experience of the afternoon and evening and she intended that this should be the beginning of a new departure in her life  and she felt glad that she had found such a friend as ruth she arose early the next morning and was downstairs before her mother was stirring it was sunday and the entire family were in the habit of rising later than usual on that day

 what a dingy old place this is to be sure said flora  ill make the fire and straighten things up a little

when she had finished she looked about and shook her head

 it doesnt look a bit comfortable or homelike no wonder the boys go out every evening i do wish i knew where to begin to improve things but i dont and i have no one to ask about it except ruth yes i will talk to her about things perhaps she can help me

when mrs hazeley came downstairs to her surprise and unbounded delight she found the fire burning the kettle boiling and the table daintily laid ready for breakfast

 why flora i did not know yon were up she said looking around wellpleased with the generally improved condition of the room

 i do believe your aunt has made quite a housekeeper of you she continued a moment later as she inwardly congratulated herself upon the circumstance which had sent her daughter home

flora flushed at this unexpected and for her mother somewhat unusual word of commendation but made no reply for the simple reason that she did not know what to say in spite of this feeling of pleasure that her effort was appreciated she could not help wishing herself back in her aunts homeânot as it now stood with aunt sarah at its head but as it had been under aunt berthas gentle control the more she thought of it the more intense became the longing to be there in the old happy carefree life at brinton but there was nothing to be gained by wishing aunt bertha was dead aunt sarah was there and there to stay and she was at home and here to stay so there was nothing to do but to make the best of things and get as much comfort out of life as she could then she thought of ruths life and her brave effort to make a home for her father and jem and inwardly flora determined to emulate her example how well she succeeded the future will show

breakfast over and the dishes cleared away flora looked about wondering what else there was for her to do her father was reading a paper and the boys had gone away she went to the window where lotties potato stood in its jar the sight of it carried her thoughts back so vividly to the old days that she half resolved to look at it no more

she felt dull and spiritless today  it was no wonder for there was little to make her feel otherwise at aunt berthas every one had been accustomed to attend church and flora remained to sundayschool she had been converted and received into the church about a year before her aunts death her sudden sorrow her hasty trip from brinton and her unfamiliar surroundings in her new home caused her to feel as if she had been removed to a heathen land

none of the hazeley household attended church and flora knew of no place to which she could go for all was so new and strange to her and being somewhat timid she would not go alone

still standing at the window and looking drearily out on the quiet street she saw ruth and little jem passing on their way to church when they saw flora they stopped and she glad to see a friendly face hastened to open the door

 would you not like to come with us to church this morning  asked ruth

 indeed i should replied flora  i was just wondering what i was going to do with myself to day wait a minute  i will be ready in a very short time

as good as her word she was soon ready  i am so glad that you stopped for me ruth said she as they walked along  i know nothing about the churches here and no one goes from our house

 that is too bad returned ruth sympathizingly

flora was indeed glad that she had come when as they ascended the church steps she heard the deep tones of the organ pealing out a welcome to all who entered as they walked up the aisle it seemed as if the sweet notes of the music twined around them as though enfolding them in a loving embrace a feeling of quiet content filled the heart of the young girl and for a time the realities were forgotten in the soothing sense of rest that stole over her nor did she attempt to arouse herself until the opening services were ended and the minister arose to announce his text

in clear distinct tones he read  whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might twice he slowly read the words until flora thought he surely must have pressed them right into her brain for she felt that they were indelibly imprinted on her memory whether the sermon was intended especially for young people or not she did not know but she felt that it was peculiarly adapted to herself i have no doubt that the older folks felt the same with regard to themselves it was one of those texts and sermons that suit everybody

 i wonder how many of my hearers can say truthfully that they have done with their might whatsoever their hands found to do said the minister looking as flora thought directly at her

she dropped her eyes uneasily to the floor and mentally admitted  i for one have not unless it was to grumble and fret with all my might i have done that but nothing else at least since i came home

 i am sure you cannot say that your hand has found nothing to do you can perhaps say that your hand has not found what you wished it to do  but that is not what the words of the text teach it says  whatsoever thy hand finds to do then too it is to be done  with thy might  not halfheartedly

 oh commented flora to herself  why should he talk so straight at me if he is not describing flora hazeley i am mistaken

 did you ever notice the minister continued  that when you did a thing heartily even though it was not the most agreeable occupation to you it became more easy and pleasant to you  

flora thought of the little help she had voluntarily given her mother the previous evening and again inwardly agreed with the speaker the minister said a great many things that morning some of which had never entered floras mind and they made her very thoughtful so thoughtful that she paid but little attention to the strains of the organ that accompanied her out of the church she remembered he had spoken of many kinds of work the hands might find to do and which were to be done faithfully and heartily perhaps it would be church work perhaps professional work perhaps mechanical work and perhaps housework and homework the last two he thought ought to go together as neither could do very well without the other although each differed in character housework he said  as all knew was sweeping dusting cooking and the other duties connected with caring for the house  but homework was the making and keeping a home helping those in it to be contented and happy  brightening and making it cheery by both word and deed shedding a healthful and inspiring influence so that those around us may be the better for our presence

 according to that we all have a  whatsoever  said flora emphatically to herself  and the sooner i decide to start on my own part the better it will be for me

with her mind busy with many things flora was very quiet on her way home the sermon to which they had listened was plain and practical it was not brilliant but it was helpful the ideas were not necessarily new but the words fell upon at least one heart already prepared and softened by circumstances to receive and profit by them to flora they were seed falling upon the prepared ground of her heart and in due time the fruit came forth most of the suggestions were new to her for never before had she viewed them in this particular light

ruth respected her friends silence for she saw that she was busy with her thoughts and guessing something of what they were she was also quiet jem was unaffected by the silence of her elders she walked along at ruths side with her hand closely holding her sisters her happy life caused her every now and then to lapse from her dignified walk and give a little jump and a skip a continual volley of questions was thrown at ruth whose replies were not always as obvious as occasion demanded

jems quick retort no it isnt ruth brought her to a realization of her abstractedness and she resolved to be more attentive

they left flora at her door ruth asking if she had enjoyed the service and added   will you not come to sundayschool with us this afternoon 

 i did enjoy the sermon very much flora replied  and i shall be pleased to go to sundayschool if you will call for me ruth i will be ready when you come

a number of things grew out of floras experience on this sunday its influence stayed with her and had no small part in shaping her future life she soon became an earnest worker to make the world better for her living in it striving patiently and faithfully to render her daily life a power for good to those around her how she succeeded our story will tell last but not least a strong affection sprang up between ruth and herself which proved a blessing to both

ruth taught a class in the sundayschool and persuaded flora to consent to take one also if the necessity arose she introduced her to the superintendent who welcomed her cordially to the little band of christian toilers

 one class is in need of a teacher he said  will you not take it  it is composed of girls from ten to twelve years of age

 oh i should not dare to undertake a class of girls so old  exclaimed flora  i am too young myself give me little girls such as ruth has

 but said mr gardiner  there is no such class in need of a teacher besides it is not the age that has to do with your success as a teacher it is the earnestness perseverance patience and true piety which you bring to the work that will bring forth the results you desire

i am so inexperienced murmured flora

 neither has that anything to do with the matter contended the gentleman smiling experience will come all in good time he added

 well said flora  i will do my best

 that is right answered mr gardiner heartily he felt sure that the young girl before him would succeed for energy conscientiousness and determination could be read plainly in her bearing and these he knew were characteristics of a successful teacher he was glad therefore he had persuaded her

ruth also was pleased for now her friend would be also a coworker

flora felt sad when she thought that her family were the only ones of those who knew her who were entirely indifferent as to what she did or where she went

 only think ruth she said to her friend  it doesnt matter to them whether i go wrong or right what encouragement is there for a girl in my place to try to do right  

it does seem hard dear the gentle friend replied  but then you will shine out all the brighter in the end for doing right in the face of discouragements and god cares you know

they were at the gate and bidding ruth goodbye flora slowly went up the path to the house her brain very active with new thoughts and purposes

 yes god will help me if i ask him said flora softly as she went to her room and after doffing her hat and jacket she knelt beside her bed and asked the dear lord to bless and strengthen her in her new surroundings and let her life tell for him

monday morning was cloudy flora felt gloomy and dispirited and notwithstanding her good resolutions not in a mood to make any extra exertion

mr hazeley had gone to his work harry and alec to school and the mother was in bed with a sick headache flora was lonely there was much to be done she realized but just where to begin she did not know there was no one to tell her what to do and everything looked very dark to her on this monday morning

the dishes were nicely washed and carefully put away the little dining room had been swept and dusted and looked somewhat more inviting the window where the sweet potato the last link binding her with the past at brinton stood had been washed until the glass fairly shone and now she stood gazing listlessly out into the street

presently she saw ruth on her way home from market when in front of the house ruth looked up and saw floras woebegone face at the window she stopped and gave her a smiling little nod floras countenance brightened immediately and she hastened to meet her

 you look lonely this morning was ruths greeting

 indeed i feel so admitted flora

 if you are not busy come home with me for a while

 i should like nothing better cried flora just wait until i tell mother

in a moment she was back and the two walked on flora insisting on helping ruth with her marketbasket

jem met them at the door of the tiny bouse and conducted them in with great dignity flora was delighted with everything

 what a dear little house she exclaimed glancing about her admiringly

 i am glad you like it said ruth looking pleased

 and what a dear little oldfashioned housekeeper you make 

 do you really think so  

of course i do said flora heartily  ruth dear she continued abruptly changing the subject  i want a talk with you

 i shall be so glad to have you said ruth seating herself with a pan of apples in her lap  sit down beside me and you can talk while i pare these apples

 i will help replied flora  run jem dear and get another knife for me like a good girl

jem obeyed and soon returning brought with her a box filled with bits of calicoes and various odds and ends seated herself also and proceeded to fashion what she was pleased to call  dolls clothes

ruth began flora after they were all settled and busy  i like you ever so much and i hope we always will be friends you seem to know so much and you have had so much experience that i am sure you can help me a great deal if you will

 of course dear was her gentle reply  i would be glad to help you all i can and i shall be as pleased as possible for us to be friends as to my knowing much you are mistaken  i know but very little of anything and experienceâwell i have had some i suppose but then it isnt the sort that would help you i am afraid however i shall be glad to do anything i can for you

 i am sure you can help me ruth you have helped me already said flora decidedly  and i mean to do as you suggested and try to make my home just what i would like to have it i dont know how to begin exactly  and then mother never seems to care how things go and that makes me feel as if i did not care either

 i dont like to hear you talk about your mother so flora dear said ruth in a troubled tone

 how are you to help me if i dont tell you just what i think and feel  

 perhaps if you were to let your mother see and know that you wanted to help her and make things bright and talk with her

talk interrupted flora i dont believe she would do it even if i were to try

 oh but have you tried yet   asked ruth looking up archly  you cannot tell until you do

 very well said flora laughing  i guess i shall try but there is another thing and the troubled look returned to her face  it is about the boys my brothers they stay at home scarcely ever i dont know where they go so often and i am sure mother does not and i dont believe she caresâyou need net look grave again ruthâi dont harry and alec seem to be good boys and it is a pity they are not restrained they may get into bad companyâif they are not in it alreadyâand do something dreadful and bring disgrace on us all what can i do about that 

 it would take a wiser head than mine to tell you that ruth answered  but you might try and see if you could not make it so pleasant at home they would not care to be away so much

it seems pretty plain to me that that is easier to say than to do retorted flora just a little impatiently

yes i know assented ruth meekly i dont pretend to be a solomon  i only said you might try

 i dont believe they would stay for me contended flora stubbornly

 that is another thing you have never tried yet said ruth smiling mischievously

 that is so laughed flora as she took two or three curly parings and put them on ruths hair to show penitence for her contrariety  i guess i had better not talk any more until i have tried to do something i dont know how to begin my reformatory measures but i suppose all will be well if i start with  whatsoever 

by this time the apples were finished and she rose to go

 you havent remired my dolls things said jem reproachfully

so i have not said flora and she sat down beside the little seamstress and began to  remire  the various articles held up for inspection she was compelled to see through jems eyes however for the shapes of the garments were not so striking or familiar as to suggest their names

when at length she reluctantlytook her leave ruth invited her to come soon again to which she laughingly replied she certainly should after this matters went on more pleasantly at floras home she busied herself with making the house look as cosy and as attractive as the shabby furniture and worn carpet would admit she succeeded beyond her own expectations she was gratified also that her brothers seemed to enjoy the improved condition of affairs and so did her father when he was at home lotties potato was now adding its mite to the general reform and was sprouting nicely sending its delicate white roots downward into the clear water and its closely folded leaflets upward to grow green in the warm sunlight it seemed to be quite at home in the bright window flora had ceased to dream when she looked at her quaint friend the days now were too full to build aircastles mrs hazeley was pleased to shift her responsibility to flora who enjoyed nothing better than to have all her time occupied often when tangles would come flora would run over to the eversympathetic ruth and receive advice from her thus in being busy flora became more content and often as she thought of aunt sarah she knew she would not be found fretting

she had not yet attempted to influence the boys by word but they soon noticed the new air of homeliness pervading the rooms and consequently did not go out so much as had been their custom alec the younger boy was very mercurial and mischievous while harry the elder was quiet and fond of reading

one evening harry seemed to be more than usually inclined to be sociable and gave his mother and sister an animated account of something that had happened down town that day when he finished he took up his book and was just preparing to read when flora eyeing the volume distrustfully asked   what are you reading harry  

harry looked up at her quizzically and answered her question by another

 why  what is it to you anyway  

 nothing said flora rather disconcerted she was unaccustomed to boys and bad but little tact in dealing with them

 i thought so replied harry coolly returning to his book

 will you not tell me what you are reading  again asked flora not willing to be so easily vanquished

 why do you want to know  demanded harry looking at her suspiciously

floras lips again framed  nothing but no sound came for like a flash she thought  if i say that he will say i thought so as he did before no i will give a reason so she said   you seemed to be so interested in it i thought it must be very entertaining

so it is replied harry throwing a mischievous glance over to the corner at alec where he sat thoroughly engrossed in his favorite pastime of whittling and in serene thoughtlessness allowing the clippings to fall according to their own sweet will

harry was confident that flora intended to  read him a lecture upon trashy literature as he afterward privately told alec he replied  it is interesting flo about murders and bears cutthroats and burglars and other horrors that would make you nervous to read about

 i am not made nervous so easily as you may think my dear boy retorted flora condescendingly and at the same time glancing cautiously at harry to see what effect this would have

she had determined to try and gain an influence over her brothers and felt that to show an interest in their occupations would be a good beginning she realized the task she thus imposed on herself but she meant to do her best for this was another  whatsoever

harry was for a moment too much surprised to speak then he said saucily   ah indeed  well let me read some to you

 i shall be glad for you to read to me if you will read a story i have just started i feel sure you will enjoy it if yours is a book for boys only i fear i could not appreciate it

 oh you couldnt   said harry  why not may i ask  

but flora was up and away ere the sentence was completed harry congratulated himself on having put her to flight and returned to his book with a selfsatisfied smile flora however had only gone to her room for a paper hurrying back she spread it before astonished harry and pointing to its columns said in a peculiarly persuasive manner now hal i would be ever so glad if you would read that story aloud to us while i crochet and alec whittles on the floor

alec looked confused and began to pick up some of the litter he had made

 never mind alec said flora laughing  i will clear it up this time could you not put a newspaper under you to catch the cuttings another time 

all right said alec looking relieved

we are all ready harry said flora sitting down and taking up her work

 humph   said harry glancing carelessly down the page  theres nothing in such a story i dont want to read it it is too flat

you are mistaken replied flora spiritedly its not a bit flat and there is something in it it is about a brave boy who saved a train

 oh yes i know said harry skeptically  and was not hurt

 yes but he did get hurt why not read it and see  suggested flora

 yes read it hal said alec   lets see what it is anyway

 all right and harry began to read with a comical nasal twang very rasping to floras feelings but she had the wisdom to say nothing she was very glad later because harry gradually dropped the false tone and she could see by his manner that he had become interested in spite of himself alec too had ceased whittling and was listening intently

forgetting to criticise harry read the entire story which in truth was a pathetic little incident very gracefully and entertainingly told he was silent as he laid the paper on the table but his thoughts were busy

 i was right was i not harry   asked flora

 yes drawled harry smilingly you were i did enjoy it and i am glad you asked me to read it but let me see he added turning to the clock  what time is it well and he laughed i was good it is nearly ten guess i will retire i was going out but it is too late

flora was secretly rejoiced to hear this but she simply said  goodnight she felt a glow of satisfaction as she realized a beginning had been made toward gaining the hold upon her brothers she so much desired

flora will you lend me that paper asked alec as she was preparing to go to her room flora willingly placed the paper in his hand remarking as she did so  i am glad you like the story i have others if you want them aunt bertha kept me well supplied

 good night returned alec and he was gone

flora was more nearly content than she had been for some time as she sank into peaceful slumber that night

i believe i am going to realize some of the dreams i used to have after all flora said to herself as she laid her head upon her pillow that night

she was right the first step had been taken by her in the path of becoming an earnest worker and to influence those about her as she had planned she would like to do although not in such a way as this nor in such surroundings her cherished dream of being instrumental in leading others into a higher and better life was now she began to realize leading her into the lines of duty in her own home and among her own people she could not wish for more

she would not be like so many others who in their desire to do great things neglect the opportunities near at hand and who in longing to lead the heathen to a higher plane of life forget those at home who possibly for want of a word or act have slipped stumbled and fallen on lifes pathway

flora was growing and with an earnest prayer to the christ for guidance strength and tact she cheerfully assumed more duties in the home and greater responsibility her bright sunny disposition her pleasant face her extreme willingness to respond to requests gradually won a place for her in the hearts of those in her home

the class in sundayschool was assumed with a feeling of great apprehension it was composed of five girls between the ages of ten and twelve at first sight of their youthful teacher these girls had been inclined to be displeased but when they grew to know the sunny sweet goodnature born of the great desire to do them good and which shone out of the earnest eyes they loved her dearly the teaching of this class was fraught with great good both to the teacher and scholars and this meeting with the eager bright girls was soon eagerly looked forward to by flora from week to week

 how things have improved at mr hazeleys  soon grew to be a common remark among the neighbors

 yes since flora came home it has become very different from what it formerly was would be the spirit if not the words of the reply

flora overheard a similar remark one day and it gave her a feeling of great joy to know the change was becoming apparent her resolution was strengthened to sustain this newly made reputation

it must not be supposed that she always had an easy time this was not so for as she often said to ruth  when mother and harry are not in a good humor things do become tangled

however to do the family justice they were beginning to see and to more fully appreciate the changes made in their home since flora who had left them a small maiden had returned with her thoughtful ways and mature manner they forgot sometimes that she was but sixteen and would fancy she was older than she really was in fact almost imperceptibly she assumed all responsibility and they deferred to her judgment in many things best of all however they began to love her

her younger brother alec seemed to have entirely surrendered to her gentle loving rule and was ever willing to listen to her advice he was always ready to help her by running errands chopping wood drawing water and performing a dozen other little tasks quite new to him for he had never aided his mother in any way in fact she had never asked her boys to assist her or to save her extra steps or work forgetting it ought to be required from them

mrs hazeley also had changed under the magic wand of floras sunny influence and determination to win the love of all she had become at least a willing agent to the general change taking place in her home and which recommended itself to her because her responsibilities were lightened and carried by other shoulders

the house itself was transformed even cynical little jem was becoming satisfied with it it still contained the same furniture but there was an air of comfort and home life about it never there before but introduced by the magic of floras presence

lotties sweet potato added its share to the general improvement which was going on the long threadlike roots looked very white in the jar of water in which they were growing and the graceful tendrils and lightgreen leaves were quite refreshing to the eyes flora had trained the vine about the window on small cords and already it had nearly covered the lower part with its delicate branches flora would have felt lonely without it to care for especially after being accustomed to have plants in profusion around her at her old home then too it carried her back to the happy days at aunt berthas bringing a feeling of joy that she had been permitted to live there so long and to be trained in such a gentle firm loving manner frequently she mentally contrasted her carefree life there and her life of responsibility now and she determined with the help that is from above she would not sink to her surroundings but would elevate them to her level bravely patiently hopefully did she go forward with this end in view

she was really surprised to find how fond she had grown of her brothers and they of her she could think of her mother very differently now and she in turn began to show signs of an awakening affection for her daughter

as to ruth she was ever the same a quiet little home body whose hands were always too full to allow her to come to flora but whose demure little face never failed to smile a welcome to her friend and whose wise brain could turn over floras tangles and straighten them

the two girls loved each other dearly and no safer truer friend and guide could flora have found than ruth rudd who although no older than she herself was very mature in thought manner and speech her face however was childlike and innocent reflecting the pure soul within flora was fortunate indeed in having her for a friend and confidante

harry hazeley was a manly fellow with fine qualities he had been allowed to do as he pleased and had not been greatly benefited by this freedom no restraining hand or guiding voice had been held out to him or to cheer him on his way not being evil minded he had taken but few wrong steps and now his attention had been attracted to higher and better things

as i have said harry had good qualities one of which was a kind disposition and although it was not always apparent to his everyday associates was brought into play whenever he met any one who seemed in need of assistance

one morning as he was walking through the market on his way to school his attention was attracted by an old man one of his feet was swathed in bandages and he was hobbling painfully hack and forth from his wagon to the stall where he was trying to arrange a quantity of vegetables and some flowering plants which formed his stock in trade

harry had a quarter of an hour to spare and he immediately offered to help the old man who was only too glad to accept the proffered assistance and who introduced himself between the journeys from stall to wagon as major joe benson a gardener on a small scale major joe was an old exsoldier who had been wounded and later imprisoned the title major was only a nominal one and not indicative of any rank his name as he informed harry was joseph major benson major being his mothers maiden name he preferred to transpose this and call himself major joseph benson shortened for convenience to  major joe

 it sounded sort of big you know he said drawing himself up and looking dignified until reminded by a sharp twinge in his foot that rheumatiz and dignity did not agree

major joe was very talkative and would not cease his persuasions until harry had promised to drive out to bis home with him some day and see his nice little farm and mrs benson and he added  she will be delighted to see you because you possess such a kind heart and because you helped me you must come

yes i will returned harry but i must be off to school now goodbye and away he went mentally pronouncing the major a jolly old chap

the visit was made and strange though it seemed a fast friendship sprang up between the two and the visits became quite frequent harry had taken alec with him several times and he too had greatly enjoyed the trip major joe could tell any number of quaint tales and reminiscences of interest to the brothers mrs benson who was more active than her husband was always desirous for harry and alec to remain to tea her heart had been reached by the kindness of harry to her major as she lovingly called him and she could not do enough for them

harry had passed his old friends stall a number of times since floras return and had of course told him about his sister the major had a strong desire to see this wonderful girl as he deemed her to be from the glowing descriptions that came to him finally he insisted and mrs benson sent in a kind invitation that the three harry flora and alec must come home with him to spend the afternoon and take tea

he chose a beautiful day in early summer for the visit and flora was anticipating it with no small degree of pleasure for it would be the first real holiday she had had since coming home the thought that the boys cared enough about her to plan a trip for her was a very pleasant one her mother seemed as much pleased with the idea as the rest and had insisted upon her going so flora felt warranted in thoroughly enjoying her new experience mrs hazeley was daily becoming more energetic and seemed really arousing to the fact that she had a place to fill in her home

major joe was to call for his three young friends on his way home from market he had promised to be on hand by noon and as punctuality was an economizer of time in the old gentlemans opinion it was barely twelve oclock when be drew up with a great attempt at flourishing before the hazeleys door

quite an effort was necessary in order to arrange the board for an extra seat for flora and alec at length it was made ready and flora was helped in and alec followed while harry took his place beside the major who commented as follows  so this is your sister harry well well shes a sister to be proud of and i havent a doubt but you are proud of her here you jacob git up will you   and he shook the reins vigorously over his horses back  you never do come to a standstill but what you think its meant for you to go to sleep

jacob roused from his intended doze lazily shook his fat sides and slowly moved along it was a lovely june day and the little party had a very pleasant ride of about an hour and a half jacob not being inclined to hurry

major joe was conversationally inclined and nothing pleased him more than to hear the sound of his own voice he chatted continually now about the orchards they passed and their probable yield of fruit now about the styles of the houses as they came into view and interspersed these remarks with reminiscences of the time when he was in the army

the ride seemed quite a short one to flora who had enjoyed it thoroughly

mrs benson stood at the gate watching for them  and in her white kerchief and neat cap looked goodnatured and comfortable a saucy little spaniel sat in the middle of the road watching too  and he was the first to catch sight of the wagon he gave notice of the same by a sharp bark and springing to his feet doubled himself together and bounded away raising a cloud of dust in his haste to reach and greet his master how happy he was when he reached the carriage he sprang up at old jacob who paid no attention to such a small animal but merely turned away his head with an air of supreme indifference

 jump dolby jump   said major joe after several ineffectual trials and two or three hard falls into the dusty road dolby landed beside his owner who had made room for him and gave himself a vigorous shake which sent the dust he had gathered in his long hair over floras clothes and into her face causing her to choke and a moment later to laugh dolby concluded this was in recognition of himself and turning around eyed flora quizzically and gave a satisfied little friendly bark

the garden and nursery belonging to major joe were not large but they were very fruitful enabling him to realize considerable from the sale of his flowers and vegetables he did not carry on his trade in a scientific manner but merely for his love of the beautiful and useful things of the vegetable kingdom and because to be inactive was for him to be unhappy his receipts from the sale of the products of his land together with his pension enabled himself and mrs benson to live very comfortably in their own snug little cottage and in addition to lay aside something for a rainy day

 well mother here we are said major joe throwing the reins over jacobs back

 so i see answered mrs benson nodding smilingly to the entire party  just come right in she added as alec sprang out on one side of the wagon and harry helped flora from the other

the young people followed their hostess through the gate and up the boxbordered walk into the cosy little cottage flora was soon seated in a low rockingchair by the window whose broad sill was filled with potted plants

there harry and alec left her in good mrs bensons care while they went for a walk over the place

flora soon discovered that her hostess was as sociable as the major and but a short time passed before they were chatting like old friends

byandby alec thrust his merry face in at the door and said  come out here flora the major wants you to see his garden

yes dear go if you are perfectly rested said mrs benson i will stay here and see about preparing our early tea

flora joined her brother out of doors and found major joe and harry waiting  come and see my little greenhouse said the old man waving his hand and looking at them from over his spectacles with an important air flora complied quite willingly for she was very fond of flowers and immediately won the majors good opinion with her enthusiasm over his pet plants and the interest with which she listened while he enlarged upon his management of them the care of his garden was a tax upon his time and reallyconstituted quite a little labor then outside it was so pleasant to walk up and down among the neat flowerbeds in the small but nicely kept orchard  and in the kitchen garden for the major prided himself on his choice vegetables some of which frequently took prizes at the county fair

the major himself was in his glory for he had some one to whom he could talk talking was an occupation of which he never wearied and now he chatted about the various departments of his labors and how pleasant it was to watch the growth and development of the plants

his tongue was still going very fast when mrs benson appeared in the doorway and called to them that tea was ready reluctantly the old gardener relinquished his young listeners who were however quite willing to vary the program for they were hungry the sight of the pleasant room neat teatable and their genial motherly hostess was a very inviting one in a lull of the conversation during the progress of the meal mrs benson remarked with a sad little smile that flora reminded her of her ruth

 so she does exclaimed her husband  i knew she made me think of somebody but couldnt make it clear who it was

is ruth your daughter asked flora

 she is or leastways she was said mrs benson heaving a sigh and adding in a low voice  shes dead now

 i am very sorry said flora with ready sympathy

 yes our ruth was a fine girl but a little headstrong we did all we could to make her happy and contented at home but it seemed as if we did not succeed and so one day she ran off to marry a man we couldnt care for because we were sure he wouldnt treat our girl kindâ not that there was anything against him but he was so cold and unfeeling but she wouldnt listen to us and went off and we never saw her again

 how sad  said flora  but couldnt you go to see her

mrs benson shook her head no he said we were not to have anything to do with ruthie after he married her and they moved away somewhere we never knew where until we heard in a roundabout way that she was dead here mrs benson paused to wipe away a tear  i had hoped she would at least have stayed near home and been a comfort to us in our old age but i suppose its all right and for the best but excuse me for telling you so soon of our great sorrow i should not have done it have you ever heard she continuedâand soon all were laughing heartily at her quaint sayings

flora however could not send from her thoughts this sad story when the pleasant visit was drawing to an end and they all were bidding mrs benson goodbye promising to come again it still lingered with her as old jacob was soberly and deliberately trotting homeward she revolved it over and over in her mind somehow it fastened itself upon her in a way she did not understand and not until she was home and had retired to her room for the night did she arrive at even a partial solution of the perplexing problem then it dawned upon her with surprising clearness that it certainly was because of the similarity of names in mrs bensons daughter and her friend and adviser ruth rudd

this was very slight ground on which even to build an aircastle but flora did not stop to consider that but in the midst of her dreaming resolved to go the next day and rehearse to ruth the story she had heard from mrs benson

accordingly next morning after the work was done and her mother was seated with her sewing flora donned her hat and went to see her friend expecting to find her busy as usual she was therefore very much surprised to be met at the door even before she had knocked by ruth herself whose gentle face wore a troubled anxious look and she spoke in a low tone as she responded to floras query  what is it ruthie 

father is very sick

 oh i am so sorry what is the matter when was he taken ill  was it suddenly  

yes and no said ruth answering simply the last question put by flora  he was compelled to stop work yesterday and come home he has been in poor health for a long time i have been afraid for quite a while that he would break down

 the doctor does not think he will die does he whispered flora in an awed tone

 yes he does said ruth as she wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron

the two girls with their arms entwined and a deep tenderness in their voices then went into the little kitchen where jem sat holding her beloved kitten close to her for comfort

yes the doctor says that he cannot last long but what bothers me is there seems to be something on his mind and i can see he is worried

 what about do you know asked flora sympathizingly

well i can guess ruth answered taking from a workbasket a stocking of jems and beginning to darn it in an abstracted mechanical way

 you see she continued  father married my mother âmy own mother i meanâagainst her parents wishes âshe was youngâand he never would be reconciled to them because they had objected to him neither would he allow them to have anything to do with each other afterward he was very stern and it all made mother so unhappy it just broke her heart i am sure she died when i was very small he has told me since jems mamma died he wished he had tried to pacify my grandparents but he had moved far away from them and now if he should die he has nobody with whom to leave jem and me but he was always so proud and now we shall be all alone and she gave a sorrowful little sigh

 see here ruth exclaimed flora a sudden thought flashing across her mind what was your mothers name  

 ruth it was the same as mine was the reply

 yes but what was her last name  

 benson i think

 well then i think i know your grandparents cried flora

you do how where returned ruth in a puzzled disjointed way

 wasnt or isnt your grandfather named joseph benson   asked flora

yes joseph major benson  but how did you know

 ob i found out was the answer  and they live just a little way out in the country

but how do you know all that persisted ruth incredulously

 because i was there yesterday

 oh flora are you sure  dont raise my hopes and then disappoint me

 my dear you will not be disappointed  i should not like to do that said flora gravely  but let me tell you and you can see for yourself and then she told the story mrs benson had told her ending with  so you see there can be no mistake

ruth was delighted and thanked her friend again and again

just see how god works she said who can tell what he will bring about how glad i am  i must not tell father anything about it just yet we must manage to send word to grandfather and have him here before we tell it would not do to excite father unnecessarily he is so very weak

 that is so ruthie said flora  you are wise as usual in thinking of that i should have done quite differently i should have rushed right in at once and told him

not if you had been in my place was the gentle answer  you see i have been accustomed to think about such things ever since jems mother died as father never took much interest in the management of our household affairs

after some more talk it was arranged that flora should go and bring major joe to see his soninlaw in the morning and then the friends parted flora to hurry home and enlist her brothers aid in her new project and ruth to return to the bedside of her father with the pleasant hope of not only easing his mind but the feeling that should he die she would not be left entirely alone in the world  a possibility which she had dreaded more because of her little sister than on her own account

when flora entered the house she found her brothers there before her and both very quiet it had grown to be such a pleasant thing to find their cheery sister at home when they came in that they had almost unconsciously commenced to look forward to seeing her and hearing her merry voice they hastened home from school and felt but never expressed disappointment when she was not there

flora while not yet so wise and thoughtful as her friend ruth was daily learning lessons of usefulness and continually using and developing new powers heretofore latent and with her natural tact refrained from commenting upon many changes easily observed going on in the habits of her brothers and now she simply smiled at harry and pinched alecs ear playfully as she passed him

then she went to her room to remove her hat and hastened back to help her mother with the dinner

while putting the dishes on the table she imparted her news to harry and alec between her trips from table to pantry they were both well pleased to have the prospect of being able to brighten the lives of major joe and mrs benson they considered flora very bright to come to the conclusion she did

 i forgot all about that story soon after i heard it said alec conscious stricken  didnt you hal  

i am afraid i did laughed his brother but what else was there for me to do  i knew no way in which i might help as flora did

thats so rejoined alec in a relieved tone willing to share in his brothers selfabsolution  of course neither of you could have done anything for you did not know ruth but tell me what will be best to do   asked flora pausing with a dish she was carrying to the table

 i know said harry  tomorrow is saturday and market day also and we all can go and see major joe in his stall and tell him what we have heard and what we think if he is interested one of us can stay at his stall while he goes and sees ruth

how glad he will be and how glad i am said flora  it would be dreadful for ruth and poor little jem to be left with no one to take care of them

thus the question was decided

the next morning major joe was surprised by a visit from all three of his young friends and none the less delighted to see them however because they came unexpectedly and he gave them a hearty welcome it was understood beforehand that flora was to be the one to open the subject and explain matters she did not tell everything at once as alec thought she ought to do but approached the object of their visit in a delicate way

major joe guess what brought us here today

 im sure i cant say answered the old man rubbing his rough hands together with a beaming smile maybe to see your old friend  

to be sure were always glad to do that replied flora as she placed the little bunches of parsley and thyme in more perfect order  we have come for something else something very important she added seeing that major joe had no curiosity as to the nature of their errand with him

what would you say if i told you we had found somebody who belongs to you  

 to me   queried the puzzled man  i dont see how you could do that

yes but i have said flora i am sure of it

the old major shook his head doubtingly

 and i want you to come with me and see if what i said is not true persisted flora coaxingly

 but how can i   questioned major joe in reply  i cannot leave my stallâwho would wait on my customers  

 why not let me take charge until you return asked harry speaking for the first time

 and i can help added alec

now you see its all fixed said flora surely youre not afraid to trust us are you asked harry as he saw his old friend still undecided

 no no its not that my boy only

 only nothing interruped flora laughingly you must come so say no more about it and she caught his arm and led him away an unwilling and unbelieving captive

ruth opened the door in answer to floras gentle tap the latter could no longer restrain her impatience

 now major joe she exclaimed softly for fear of disturbing the sick man  whom does this little sobersides remind you of 

at first the old man looked from one to the other in a bewildered manner then his eyes rested on ruths face long and attentively the tears gathered and he involuntarily held out his hand and said softly  ruthie

scarcely realizing what she was doing ruth probably drawn by the tender loving tone that touched her heart put her own in it

who is she what does it all mean asked the major looking helplessly at flora

 it means answered flora softly  that this is truly ruthie not your own ruth but her daughter and namesakeâyour granddaughter ruth

is that so are you sure dont say so if you aint pleaded the old man and then the thought flashed across floras mind that perhaps after all she was mistaken and had only brought her old friend there to be disappointed

 ruth dear she said dropping into a chair weakened by the very thought tell himâtell him all about yourself your mothers name and everything do please quick 

ruth told the history of her dead mothers life as she had heard it from her own lips

eagerly major joe listened and when she was through he held out his arms to her saying you are my poor ruths daughter and the tears prevented him from adding more ruth and flora wiped their eyes in sympathy ruth rejoicing in the possession of a grandfather flora that provision was thus made for ruth

this tearful trio was interrupted a moment later by the entrance of jem carrying her doll under one arm and her beloved pokey under the other

 why ruth rudd im extonished at you hugging a old market man  and jem looked at her sister with unbounded disapproval

hush jem you must not talk so said ruth this is our grandfather

not mine returned matteroffact jem standing still in the middle of the room and looking suspiciously at the visitor not mine i never had any and dont want one

 who is this   asked major joe looking at the defiant little figure dubiously

 she is my halfsister answered ruth

well well said her grandfather she aint ruths child so ive no call to take her when i take you ruth her father can send her to his own people

 then grandfather i cannot go with you said ruth sadly but firmly  i will never leave jem

 ruth youre not going to leave me are you   cried the little girl

 no indeed dear i shall not leave you it was not very nice for you to speak of grandpa as you did just now you should always be polite to an old person remember this jem

i dont care said jem defiantly hes horrid he wants to take you away and youre all ive got cept father andâand hes going to die she sobbed biding her face in ruths arms

dont cry jem i will not leave my little sister what could i do without you  

 no no little one ruths grandfather wont part you if youre so fond of each other and the major came over and patted the sobbing childs head soothingly his was too tender a heart to withstand the sight of a child in distress so it was soon settled that he was to be jems grandfather also which arrangement was accepted by the little girl as readily as she had rejected the idea a moment before

then the major his heart made very tender by memories of the past was ready to visit the invalid

john rudd had always been a quiet man but willful and determined to succeed in whatever he undertook he was not bad at heart and when a wrong act was committed it was invariably caused by obstinacy he usually quickly repented of his course and made all reparation in his power

knowing that mr and mrs benson did not like him as well as he had hoped he determined to marry ruth and to prohibit all intercourse with her family in everything else he was thoroughly honorable but he tenaciously held to this point ruth benson loving him devotedly and believing all he said or did was infallible implicitly obeyed this strange request without a question and neither did she hear of or from her parents

that the unnecessary sacrifice did not add to her happiness was proven by the fact that she lost her free lighthearted ways and became quiet and melancholy after a year or two of married life her husband was proudâtoo proud to admit that he had made a mistake until it was too late for such an admission to do any good and so after a few years she died leaving behind her little namesake ruth she seemed to have transmitted to the child in a large measure her own disposition for ruth was always a grave silent little thing entirely unlike other children and quite old for her years

it was nice too she possessed such a sweet disposition and even temper for when her father brought home a new mother for the little ruth many changes were made in the home and great would have been the discord but for ruths peaceful characteristics shortly after his second marriage john rudd moved to bartonville whether for business openings or to be near the early home of ruths mother no one ever knew

ruth knew the story of her mothers married life of the home of her girlhood and of the kind parents but she did not know where the home was

whatever the reason for his coming it was well for ruth and jem for as i have said provision was now made for them both at major joes farm

ruths life thus far since the cares of the home were put upon her at the death of jems mother had been an uneventful one she had no companion but her little sister who so filled her brain and heart and time that she had no opportunity to grow lonesome personally ruth would have felt happier if her father had allowed the love she doubted not he held for her to find expression in a word of praise a tender kiss or appreciation of her efforts rut her father never thought of this longing of his daughter he was so selfcontained himself and unemotionally inclined that he could not have understood this craving even had he known of its existence which it is needless to say he did not

it was rather hard for so young a girl to persevere in her homemaking with such a singleness of purpose as ruth displayed to give up her beloved studies without a sigh of regret and to strive to train her younger sister knowing she would receive no word of approbation from her father

flora was very glad to know that at last her tenderhearted patient ruth had found some one to love her as well as to require of her duties love is a lightener of labor and flora felt that in this respect at least she was more fortunate than her friend she felt sure moreover she was fast gaining the affection of her brothers and of her mother who was gradually awaking to love for flora and the desire to make the home attractive she had something to work for but ruthâshe had no one to whom to look for love except jem as it was impossible to think of their quiet undemonstrative father ever expressing any of his love for his daughters one could only judge from his manner for he never said much and that was the same as when she first knew them

john rudd apparently took it as a matter of course that major benson came to see him as he lay ill and expressed neither pleasure nor displeasure when he stated that should he not recover ruth and jem would be well cared for he accepted without feeling the heartily expressed forgiveness from the major thinking that perhaps it was due in some degree to the presence of two faces standing near by with earnest pleading looks at the newly found grandfather who deprived of his daughter would fill the vacancy in his heart with ruth and jem

it was very difficult for major joe with his tender heart to leave his grandchildren at last however he did promising to return in the afternoon with mrs benson who would be overjoyed to see them especially ruth who was so like her mother at her age

as they returned to the market major joe was prolific in his expressions of gratitude to flora for her part in bringing about this delightful reunion for bad this not been done ruth and jem would have suffered and would have been left without parents or home

harry and alec were well pleased with their new position and because trade had been very flourishing during their period of power major joe heartily thanked them all for their kind help to him this morning flora then returned borne but harry and alec remained to do anything else possible for major joe as he wished to go home at once and must pack his wares

it is neither necessary to recount in detail all that pertained to the last hours of john rudd nor how attentive grandfather joe was to his newly found grandchildren  nor how overjoyed mrs benson was when she first saw them it will be enough to say that all that could be done toward rendering the dying mans last moments peaceful was done toward the last he roused and in a simple but earnest way expressed himself content to die he said that although he had not spoken of the matter for fear of distressing the children he had known for some time that it was to be so and that long ago he had made his peace with god he regretted his past careless life both as to his duty to his maker and to the children intrusted to him  but he continued  god is good and ever willing to forgive and to accept a truly contrite spirit and my trust is stayed on him he expressed himself as very grateful to him for his goodness in providing for his children he blessed them all with his last breath and passed peacefully away

when the last sad rites had been performed ruths grandparents immediately began preparations to take her and jem home

the modest furniture of her home was entirely removed although it somewhat crowded the cottage but ruth could not now part with these mementos of her former life which had been her mothers

at last everything was ready the little house was given up and ruth was spending a few moments with flora who although instrumental in finding a new home for ruth and jem was full of sorrow at the prospect of her loss in the parting with her friend

 dont look so sad flora dear said ruth  think what a blessing it is that poor little jem and i have not been left altogether alone in the world had god not led you to find our dear grandparents how very wretched we should be now besides you know we are not to be so far away we can see each other often

that is true returned flora brightening up i am glad of that but it will be so lonely not to have you near me besides i dont know any other girl as intimately as i do you

 oh you will said ruth  i am sure you will meet and become acquainted with some one as you did me

i hope if you do you may be permitted to do them as much good as you have done me

and me too ruthsaid an unexpected voice behind them

both turned and saw mrs hazeley standing in the doorway with a smile upon her lips and tears in her eyes

 i used to be very unhappy as you both know and it was because i expected life to form itself for meâeither for pleasure or unhappiness then flora came and she went over to her daughter and placed an arm about her and looked lovingly in her eyes  i watched her closely and i soon discovered that she had determined to make this house a home and a delightful one no untoward circumstances seemed to discourage but she was ever cheery and sprightly we have gained by her homecomingâhow much i cannot tell she seems to have the mere power of will to mold circumstances as she chooses

not my will mother softly interrupted flora her face suffused with happy smiles it is gods will

yes yes my dear said mrs hazeley i believe it

i want his will to mold my life too a godless life is a wretched life my children

harry and alec had entered during the conversation and were standing listening in amazement to what they heard from their mother

and the boys too continued mrs hazeley i am sure they have been helped by their sisters example

i know i have  exclaimed alec harrys only reply was to remark that the major was at the door waiting for ruth then he turned and went out

flora felt a strange mixture of feelings at that moment she was glad to know she had helped ruth unutterably grateful for her mothers words and hurt at the seeming indifference of her brother it was not her way however to dwell on what she could not prevent so she only determined to strive harder than before to penetrate the armor of cold indifference worn by harry of late

as harry left they all went to the gate to wave a goodbye to ruth in the wagon was jem perched on a seat beside her grandfather to whom she had clung with all the strength of her loving little heart immediately after the funeral she had gone home with him taking pokey and leaving ruth in peace to pack this was really a comfort to ruth as jems presence would not have been of any great assistance

soon everything was settled and with many injunctions to come soon the party drove off little jem holding the reins with a steady hand and a determination to drive all the way home

a new life thus opened for the orphans ruth and jemâa life of freedom from care of joyous liberty to run at will in the garden of their grandfather who delighted in the company of jem and who returned his affection in full measure the life at the cottage was blessed by the loving guardianship of the grandmother who saw in ruth her own daughter of long ago

under this beneficent influence ruth lost some of her seriousness becoming more like other girls and grew rosy and stout

the life at the farm had so absorbed jems mind and time that for the time being  pokey  was forgotten much to the latters satisfaction for now she could lie in the sun and sleep in peace without fear of being unceremoniously awakened by her erratic little mistress

flora watched the wagon containing ruth and jem until it was out of sight and then went into the house

alec and harry had gone away mrs hazeley was sewing and flora having no especial duty and caring for none went over and stood at the window listlessly gazing into space her eyes soon dropped and her attention was attracted by the yellow leaves on the sweetpotato vine flora felt as if all to which she had clung was leaving her in her loneliness she looked closer the potato was still firm and hard and the jar was quite packed with roots but the leaves on the vine were dying

flora had stood for some little time mechanically caressing the vine when she was surprised to hear near at hand in a voice strangely familiar the words  well i declare 

looking up quickly but scarcely crediting her own eyes she exclaimed  lottie piper 

 flora hazeley  returned the voice and in a moment the friends were locked in each others arms

 where did you come from  what are you doing here   asked flora eagerly in her desire to account for lotties presence in the village

 only one question at a time if you please laughingly returned lottie  can you not guess   she added glancing at her gown and for the first time flora noticed it was black

the quick tears sprang to floras eyes

oh lottie who is it not your mother  she said sympathetically her arm tightening in its grasp and her thoughts running back to her sorrow when aunt bertha passed away

 yes returned lottie sadly  mother is dead father felt that he could not be happy at home and so he went away out west and left me with my aunt mrs emmeline durand and flora if you want to know what misery is just you come and take my place for a while and she looked at flora with such a mingled expression of regret at her lot and assumed resignation that flora was tempted to laugh in spite of her sorrow in learning of the death of mrs piper

 if you want to laugh you may said lottie seeing her difficulty and appreciating it as was shown by the merry twinkle in her bright black eyes

no no i must not laugh said flora squeezing her friends arm affectionately  im so sorry that your mother is dead where does your aunt live i will come and see you

 no youâi mean youâcantâthat is she wont let you stammered lottie blushing hotly

yes i understand it is all right it is not your fault said flora hastily appreciating the situation  and wishing to relieve the embarrassment of the other she added you can come and see me

 i dont know answered lottie glad to find that flora understood  i hardly think she would let me come i have not asked her to go anywhere as yet i have been with her about five weeks and this is the first time i have been out except on an errand she says she doesnt approve of girls  gadding the streets i must go now i have stayed longer than i ought to already for i had a long walk before i saw you flora she added an instant later as she glanced at the window  isnt that a potato in that jar  

yes answered flora it is the same one you gave me when i was leaving brinton

 really  the very same  

 yes you know you told me not to eat it and i didnt know what to do with it at first then i thought it would look very nice if i put it in the window i did and it has grown splendidly and has kept green all winter

 i am so glad you thought of that flora because that was what i first noticed as i passed and i thought it looked like a sweetpotato vine and then you know lottie continued if you hadnt i should not have stopped or seen you ever because i did not know where you were going when you came away but what will my aunt say i guess ill not get anything for supper but a bit of tongue and i dont fancy that i can tell you goodbye and with a hurried kiss and a warm embrace lottie hurried down the street

she was sorry to go as it was so good to meet somebody she knewâsomebody connected with the old happy homelife for while lotties mother lived she had been very happy but now she was so lonely

she hurried along the streets until she came to one near the suburbs of the town this street had trees on either side and was very quiet the houses were small and nearly all set back from the street

lottie walked along briskly turning deftly in and out and at length arrived safe and sound at the little gate leading into her aunts yard this gate opened upon a small space which doubtless had been intended by the builder of the house to be beautified with flowers but mrs durands front yard was closely paved with red brick not a flower or a vine or a bush broke the monotony which however was not wearisome as the yard was small

a high board fence enclosed the little yard on each side

close to the gate stood a large old poplar strangely drawn toward the quiet narrow street as if weary of the unattractiveness of the house

lottie was nervous she dreaded the reception she felt sure awaited her the only thing that occurred to her to do was to knock and she did so

receiving no response she knocked again and waited there was still no response and thinking she had not been heard she knocked again and again

at length just as she had decided that her aunt must be out a calm voice from behind the door aid in deliberate tones if you will take the trouble to turn the knob the door might open

this idea had not occurred to lottie and the knowledge that the door was not locked somewhat confused her however she opened the door and went in

 there is a mat in front of the door suggested the voice in the same slow measured tones

after wiping off the infinitesimal amount of dust from her shoes lottie timidly ventured into the room

go to your room if you will and lay aside your wraps came the voice in an authoritative way

without speaking lottie obeyed she felt as she slowly climbed the stairs that she had become a veritable automaton without volition or energy and compelled to do certain things this grated on the sensitive nature of the girl to whom in the happy days that had passed freedom to live in and enjoy the open air was everything and nowâand lottie inwardly groaned at the thought âher actions were directed by one who seemed to forget her own girlhood or that she had ever enjoyed the bright blue sky the green fields the merry twittering birds or the companionship of those who were of her own age

lottie had often wondered in her own mind if her aunt had ever been young and if she had enjoyed her youth there was no one to whom she could go for an answer had there been lottie would have been surprised to learn that she had been full of bright merry fun and had enjoyed life as she had at home

 at home lottie thought and paused thinking of her mother of the comforts and freedom of home and then she looked in the glass to see if she was not old for those happy days did seem so far away

mrs durand had met with many disappointments and a great deal of trouble in her life of which lottie knew nothing and which had embittered her disposition making her crabbed and disagreeable as she now was lottie supposed she had ever been

for some moments lottie had looked in the glass musingly now as her thoughts returned to herself and her surroundings she saw a dreary woebegone face looking at her from the quaint cracked oldfashioned mirror on her bureau it was so doleful and forlorn that lottie nearly cried in sympathy with the miseries of the face before her in a moment realizing that it was her own reflection she saw and enjoying her mistake she laughed heartily whereat the face in the mirror smiled pleasantly in return

 humph   said the voice downstairs

 oh dear  exclaimed lottie softly  i have made her think that i dont care about staying out so long and she slowly turned from the bureau and her mirthprovoking vis a vis and leaving her room slowly descended the stairs to her aunt

the room in which her aunt sat was furnished very plainly some canebottomed chairs a black horsehair sofa a small wooden stand adorned with a red cloth on which was the family bible two or three pictures upon the dingy walls a pair of tall lamps with a bit of red flannel in the bottom graced the mantelpiece a dull ingrain carpet and some homemade mats covered the floor these with a clothcovered brick used to keep the door open completed the furnishing of mrs durands parlor

mrs durand herself was a small thin wiry woman her features could hardly be called attractive her lips were thin and tightly shut her eyes were colorless and she wore three stiff little curls on each side of her face she wore a dark gown over which was a black apron and on her head was a black lace cap she was busily engaged in making another mat to adorn the floor from long brightcolored strips of cloth

for some time she continued her work in silence lottie would have spoken had she had anything to say

presently to lotties great surprise and relief her aunt remarked  you may as well set the table as you are here

lottie was glad to have something to do as she was so much happier when employed

she hasnt scolded me yet but it will come thats certain she said to herself as she placed the dishes on the little round table in the back room which answered for both kitchen and dining room

while at supper mrs durand questioned her niece about her walk and lottie told her not forgetting the chance meeting with her friend flora hazeley

after supper as was her duty lottie washed and put away the dishes without further conversation with her aunt that done she took up a book and began to read

time passed on and with it as usual came changes the summer was gone and it was november and the weather was cold and dreary

lotties life was much the same from day to day there was little variety to make the life of the young girl pleasant true she did not have a hard time nor was she overworked nor did she ever go hungry but the atmosphere of the house was always chill and drear and mrs durand was as unsociable and unsympathetic as ever

it was perhaps true that lottie was somewhat prone to slightly exaggerate her unhappiness and to dwell upon it until it seemed almost unendurable

one morning as she was dressing she heard her aunt call and upon going to her room discovered that she was suffering from an attack of acute rheumatism then indeed lottie was sure her misery was at such a height that it could go no further

as may be supposed the sharp pain she endured did not render mrs durand a more pleasant companion and lottie found that while it had been difficult to please her before it seemed utterly impossible to do so now lottie did her best with a determination pleasant to witness and with the knowledge that it was her duty to care for her aunt under such painful conditions

lottie was lonely she seemed to be entirely cut off from everybody she knew and cared for she seldom heard from her father and never from her brother who bad left his home when she was quite a little girl she sometimes wondered if he was dead she was industrious and soon learned to keep house for her aunt very acceptably she was not hard to please and was of a loving sociable disposition if her aunt had only made an effort to be agreeable and interested in her lottie would have been perfectly content

if the months had brought but little change to lottie they had wrought a number of very important ones in the life of our friend flora

first the news had reached them one day that the husband and father was killed in a railroad accident

this of itself completely revolutionized affairs at the hazeleys and then just as they were trying to become a little accustomed to the sad change in the household harry disappointed them

this was indeed a great blow for harry was in a large measure their main dependence he was now about twenty years old and had been steadily at work for some time and seemed on a good road to a successful business career at first he gave his earnings to his mother only reserving enough to clothe himself neatly and comfortably for he felt anxious to supply as far as he could her loss in the death of his father this money added to what mrs hazeley and flora made by doing plain sewing and what alec could earn out of school hours by keeping his eyes open and bis willingness to be of assistance to any one was a great help toward keeping things going for although the little home was their own of course there were the extra incidental expenses

mrs hazeley and flora soon grew to depend on harry far more than they realized until taught by his increasing fondness for remaining from home in the evening and not unfrequently all night great indeed was their sorrow when they learned how these evenings were spentâin the gambling house and the saloon had it not been for their hope in the christ and his saving power they would not have seen the faintest brightness in this cloud which was a great burden to each a sorrow about which they hardly dared speak

flora spoke earnestly and lovingly to her brother several times about the way he was conducting himself but as we have seen he was not one to take this kindly and knowing this flora felt she could do nothing but pray for her erring brother who was so young and yet so willful

she never lost hope nor did her firm belief that his better nobler nature would prevail weaken through those long dark hard days

mrs hazeley and flora were compelled to devote all their attention to their work as harry could no longer be trusted to aid them financially and despite their brave uncomplaining efforts it was ofttimes difficult to make both ends meet

aunt sarah had not visited them for some time in fact not since flora came home nor did they hear from her and though knowing she might help them in their need they could not bring themselves to inform her of their condition

at length one night they watched and waited for harry to come home

he did not come that night nor the next nor the one following nor could they hear anything of him except that he had not been around for days

where had he gone and what would he do these were questions that flora asked herself with a sick heart

mrs hazeley with her naturally weak disposition would have given way to despair under this new trouble and drifted back into the same condition in which we first found her had it not been for her newly found trust and hope in her heavenly father and the inspiring example of her courageous selfreliant daughter flora seemed to grow stronger and more dignified under the added trials and her mother now a true christian was to her a great help and comfort in fact the two were all in all to each other and the home that had at one time appeared to flora most miserable was now a haven of rest and the mother from whom she had once turned away coldly was now warmly loved and loving truly there was sweetness mixed with her cup of bitterness

major joe benson who had kept up his acquaintance with his young friends whom he greatly admired and who by this time was considered quite a friend of the family offered to take alec to live with him there was a very good school he said at no great distance from his home and he would be glad to have the boys help on his little place especially now that zeke was getting on in years and had gotten above doing the many odd jobs he had performed when a boy which state while it was not many years distant sufficed to make zeke act as major joe said very mannish

no sooner was the proposition mentioned in alecs hearing than he was all enthusiasm for nothing did he desire more than to live in the country his mind was fully made up to become a farmer and no recital of the hardships connected therewith could divest such a life of its charms for him

so it was settled and it was really a great comfort o have at least one of the family well provided for with the prospects of seeing him an upright and indusrious man

now that provision was thus made for alec and he was but little expense to them flora and mrs hazeley could manage very well by practising strict economy

life progressed very evenly and uneventfully we might almost add happily except for the sorrow caused by their ignorance of harrys whereabouts

one day into their quiet and peaceful lives very unexpectedly came mrs sarah martin who was surprised at their comfortable surroundings

she was greeted pleasantly by flora and mrs hazeley who were determined to forgive and forget her treatment of them but the warmth which affection gives was lacking this did not fail to make itself manifest to mrs martin and strange to say instead of displeasing her it seemed to have quite a softening effect upon her callous heart the memory of this visit and the picture of her nieces heroic efforts to keep her mother and herself from want proved a veritable everpresent and sharp thorn in the side

 here i am alone in the world with plenty to supply all my wishes and some to spare she thought one evening we must do her justice  she was not miserly but she was selfishâshe wished to insure for her lifetime comfort for herself and the gratification of her desires  here am i with plenty and to spare while those of my own flesh and blood are struggling to keep the wolf from the door she mused

having commenced to reproach herself she did not hesitate for at every step seeing herself as others saw her she discovered more cause to regret her attitude toward her sister

have i been false to my trust she soliloquized questioningly noânot exactlyâbecause i gave no promise and yetâbertha supposed i would follow her request however i am not bound to do as she wished

 bertha would not have left me in charge had she supposed i would not carry out her wishes she continued  probably she would not have given her property to esther she is so careless and extravagant that such a course would have been equal to her throwing the money away suppose the money had been left in trust to flora would esther have done more than i have done  no she would have wasted it what is the difference nothing i am doing as esther would have done anyway i will leave all to flora who will enjoy it after i am dead and that will make it all right

another thing mrs martin tried to argue in support of the idea that she had done all for the best was that flora had developed such astonishing qualities of selfgovernment and ability  she has almost made another woman of that mother of hers she said to herself  one can easily see that the material for a real sound sensible practical woman is not in esther and if flora were not there with her she would be the same as before only worse

there was a good deal of truth in what mrs martin said some people cannot do or be anything without a definite motive or an active example but what did all this arguing amount to  nothing at all save to keep her mind in a constant state of turmoil by her efforts to ease her conscience

at last with the constant strain she became mentally exhausted and in spite of her efforts to the contrary for a long time lay upon the bed a sufferer from nervous prostration her brain was unnaturally active and she gained but little benefit from her enforced quiet a neighboring physician was called but found it impossible to benefit her in her present condition he might prescribe medicines to meet certain symptoms in her case but he could not reach the seat of the trouble she did not consider that it was her business to add a description of her mental condition to that of her physical one she grew no better and finally she decided to take a course of heroic treatment

first she proceeded to pay her physician and to inform him that she had no further need of his services much to that gentlemans disgust who left muttering that it was queer that the patient should be the one to decide whether or not the doctor had been of service to her

next she wrote in a feeble trembling and unintelligible way the following short blunt note  niece flora âi am sick i want to see you

 s martin

flora and her mother were sitting sewing very busily that afternoon when the postman rapped on the door

the sun was streaming in at the window no longer adorned by the sweet potato which was long since dead but touching brightly the green leaves and scarlet blossoms of some geraniumsâsome of ruths  gerangums according to jem that held the place of honor

from aunt sarah mother said flora carelessly handing it to mrs hazeley who in turn read the short note

 well flora dear what will you do about it she questioned resuming her work

 oh i guess i had better go and see her hadnt i   asked flora as she cut her thread

you may do as you please about the matter returned mrs hazeley and there the matter dropped

they continued their work in silence their thoughts as busy as their fingers

and what had become of harry hazeley in all this time  let us go back a little

probably all would have gone well with the lad who was beginning to see a new life stretching out before him under the sunny influence of his sister had his father lived

while mr hazeley exercised but little restraining power over his son during his life the fact that he had a father had considerable influence over harry when mr hazeley was killed harry realized that he was thrown on his own resources and the fact that he was subject to no higher authority took a firm hold upon him at first the idea aroused in him an innate but undeveloped manliness and he determined to stand by his mother and sister and be a comfort to them as well as a support

but the inherent weakness in his character soon gained the supremacy and for the time overruled all his resolutions which had been made in his own strength

it was inevitable that he should mingle with his companions in work and soon they gained an influence over him that was not for his highest good being somewhat older than he himself was they instilled into him a false idea of their superiority and it was by this means they retained him in their setâa set of wild dissipated young men

where was his judgment alas he had inherited sufficient of his mothers weak disposition to overrule it and consequently he was one of the kind most easily deceived and led

one of the youths whose name was edward hopkins gained considerable influence over harry he it was who persuaded him to leave his mother and sister and seek employment in another town where he said work could easily be secured with shorter hours and greater pay this seemed very inviting to harry who at that time never thought of deserting his home but was anxious to earn more money and thus become better able to care for the family and have more for what he called pleasureâcards and gaming and wine for he had now become addicted to the use of the latter through whose insidious influence he was fast losing his manly bearing

poor boy how many noble men has satan conquered and then cast off how many homes has he ruined and hearts broken and hopes destroyed 

but i am glad to say that i shall not be obliged to trace harry hazeley to the bottom of the pit into which he had fallen for god had most graciously heard the prayers of his loving trusting sister who had first set the example of prayer to the mother who now frequently joined her and he was not permitted to reach its utmost depths

true he went down pretty far and his rescue was effected by rather severe means but what mattered that so he was saved 

after leaving home harry plunged into his new reckless life with a strength that not only surprised but very soon disgusted hopkins who wished to preserve the appearance at least of a gentleman

harry had been able to secure a firstclass remunerative position very readily but so much went to satisfy his craving for excitement that none was left to send home to make life a little easier for mrs hazeley and flora

after a while however his increasing unsteadiness secured for him dismissal from the shop where he had been employed he was fortunate in securing placeafter place but unfortunate in being unable to retain them until at length he did but little work and a good deal of gambling the work he then did was around and about the saloons where he bad chances to game and drink

one bitter cold night in december a group of men stopped in front of one of these places and after some discussion entered it proved to be harrys stopping place and he was sitting by the fire for the time being idle

to look at the sunken cheeks restless eyes and uncaredfor appearance one would never suppose this was the once straight tall active harry hazeley so greatly was he changed

the leader of the group of young men who entered the barroom appeared to be attracted by the forlorn figure near the stove as soon as he came in he seemed to know him for presently he walked over to him and tapping him familiarly on the shoulder cried   why hello old chap how are you  

harry immediately recognized his old acquaintance edward hopkins he did not appear particularly glad to see him however

 say old fellow you dont seem ready to shed tears of joy at seeing your old chum remarked ed in a jovial tone sitting down beside him

harry said nothing but sat looking into the fire

 look here now hal you do look a little hard up havent been getting along so well lately i guess 

 no i havent said harry without turning around  well listen to me resumed ed  the old proverb a friend in need is a friend indeed is true isnt it  

 what of it questioned harry still apathetic

just this replied ed bringing his hand heavily down on his knee that im going to be a friend to you now harry smiled incredulously his confidence in the friendship of such a flashilydressed fellow as ed was had been shaken

 come dont be so glum hal ive something to say to you ed continued glancing around the room

his comrades were all occupied in another part of the room

now went on hopkins lowering his voice we fellows nodding toward the group  are planning a little business and if you want to you can help us

 what is it   asked harry indifferently

edward took no notice of his manner but went on   well were going toâerâahâwalk into a small establishment you know and he winked slyly at harry  steal   asked harry in a cold tone

 if you like to put it that way yes

 look here ed hopkins and harry turned in scorn upon this hypocritical friend who seemed so desirous of ruining him entirely  look here he repeated  let me tell you i dont want to share any of your  little plans ive fallen low i know but im not a thief yet and harry straightened himself up and looked with a flashing eye into the crafty face beside him

hopkins was angry as much because he had partially let harry into his secret as because he had refused to join him however he congratulated himself that he had not gone very far and he left him abruptly in a high temper going over to the group at the other end of the room

a heated discussion was progressing there about something in connection with the game of cards they were playing they appealed to hopkins as he joined the group this did not seem to add peace to the scene for the quarrel waxed hotter and the voices grew louder

presently there was the sound of a scuffle during which was heard the report of a pistol immediately there was a stampede and when the officer who had been attracted to the spot by the noise rushed in followed by a small crowd of men and boys no one was to be seen but harry hazeley he was lying on the floor by the stove and gave no sign of life as the officer rolled him over whether the pistol had been fired accidentally or intentionally nobody knew the shot however was certainly not intended for the one who received it it was found on examination that harry was wounded in the side he had also in falling struck his head against the edge of the stove and cut it

 well said the officer  i guess well have to take this young fellow to the hospital from his looks hell not be likely to have a better place to go to even if he could tell where he belonged

when harry hazeley returned to consciousness he found himself in bed in one of the wards of a hospital with his head bound up and a dull aching in his side he was in too much pain to wonder how he came there so he closed his eyes and tried to go to sleep but he could not it seemed as if his mind had never been so active as it was now that he longed to forget everything in the hope that this might ease his throbbing head but that troublesome thing memory would assert itself and his thoughts would travel back to the home he had left and the sorrowing ones in it andâperhaps it was owing to the weak state of his systemâthe tears forced themselves from underneath his eyelids and rolled down his cheeks but what is the good of thinking about these things  he mentally asked and so he impatiently brushed the tears away

poor harry had a hard time of it he did not improve very rapidly although he had the best of attention and nursing his system was so poisoned by the use of alcohol and he was so weak from having been so long without nourishing food that while his wound was not a very serious one it nearly cost him his life

the pain from his wound together with a low fever racked his system until it was almost unbearable his brain however was unusually active and over and over again did he recall his life since he left home and each time his repuguance grew and when he began to convalesce and he realized there was hope for him he determined to lead a different life as soon as he was able to be around again he sincerely and deeply repented of the past and he felt the need of a saviour as he had never done before he longed for some one to come and tell him of the christ and of his saving power he fully realized that he must have a helper stronger than his will or his resolutions

one morning when harry was getting a little more strength there hobbled over to his bedside a crippled young man who supported himself upon crutches his body was distorted and his legs were drawn up and twisted in a sad manner but his face was bright and cheerful and intelligent and his shoulders arms and hands had a look of manliness and strength about them that was greatly at variance with the feebleness of the rest of his frame

 well friend said this odd mixture of strength and weakness as he seated himself slowly and cautiously by the bed well friend how goes the world with you  

 im sure i dont know replied harry drearily  i havent been caring much about the world lately i aint in much of a hurry to care either therell be time enough when i get out in it again

time enough  time enough  yes thats the cry said the young man  thats what has caused more misery in the world than anything else its a rope that has lost many a soul forever

harry turned away impatiently he did not want to hear

 of course you dont want to hear me talk that way said the lame man bluntly divining his thought  i didnt suppose you did but let me tell you young fellow theres enough of that rotten rope left for you to lose your soul with will you turn your head away when you feel it snap and find yourself dying with nothing to hold on to i wonder   without more ado he grasped his crutches and painfully hobbled away

harry tried to be glad he was gone he did not succeed as easily however in dismissing from his mind the words he had heard perhaps it was the odd abrupt way in which they were spoken that made them fasten themselves so tenaciously on his memory certainly he would have been angry had any one else spoken so plainly and unceremoniously to him the sight of his body telling such an eloquent tale of suffering made it almost impossible for any one to be angry with joel piper harry presently found himself wondering about him and wishing he would come back and talk to him again

he did not come and one day harry found courage to ask the nurse who was busied near him to tell him the name of the lame young man who talked to him one day

 oh do you mean joel piper she asked in return

i didnt know that was his name replied harry looking amused

yes it is replied the nurse its an odd name i know but he is just as nice as he can be hes had a world of trouble and pain but hes come out pure gold

wasnt be always that  asked harry curiously

no indeed he wasnt he was one of the wildest young men and it was that which brought on the sicknessârheumatic feverâwhich twisted him up so it was this illness too that brought about his conversion  and now he likes to visit the hospitals and talk to all the young men he can find and try to get them to turn about he says hes trying to make up for lost time some think hes crazy but he isntâonly eccentric

 does he come here often   asked harry

 well sometimes he does was the answer  would you like to see him again

 i wouldnt mind having a little talk with him admitted harry

 ill tell him said the kind woman

joel came but harry could not tell from his manner whether he was pleased or not at his having expressed a desire to see him

now that he was there what should he say  harry asked this question but no answer came

but joel seemed to understand all about the matter and began right away youve had a rough time eh didnt expect it now did you when you started out  going to have a good time enjoy yourself and all that well its all right youve had about enough of that sort of thing i guess youd like to turn right about face now and go back to your mother perhaps  

 who told you i had a mother   asked harry sharply

nobody was the calm rejoinder

 how did you know  

 i didnt know i only guessed somehow or other you look as if you had have you  

yes i have groaned harry and a sister too but i came away and left them and now im ashamed to go back

well if youre made of the right kind of stuff youll go to work as soon as youre out of this and fix things so youll not be ashamed to go back said joel  between us he went on bending over and looking at harry with one eye shut up tightly  ive got a mother and sister too i did pretty much as you did only worse i guess ive been working hard to make a man of myself before i go back to them im going soon too

 to work  exclaimed harry looking at the crooked figure pityingly  what can you do  

do repeated joel raising his brows and opening wide his eyes look and he held up his long slim fingers  i can write beautifully he continued with the simplicity of a child and im a clerk in a large clock and jewelry establishment a good kind friend who came to see me at the hospital when i was so ill secured the situation for me and if you mean to turn about sure enough and no going back about it i will try and get you taken on as a salesman

harry was completely won by joels plain straightforward manner and hearty kindness and gave his promise to turn over a new leaf what is of more importance he kept the promise faithfully

when harry was discharged from the hospital he looked quite different from what he did when he first entered it or rather when he was carried there he was worn almost to a shadow it is true  but his sickness had taken from him the look of the outcast and his intercourse with his new friend and the hopes he had for the future restored to him once more the ability to look the  whole world in the face

he was clad in a suit that had been worn by joel ere his body was so distorted by rheumatism it was not a perfect fit but it was clean and neat and gave to harry a very presentable air

true to his promise joel tried and succeeded in getting the situation he spoke of for his young friend toward whom he had been strongly attracted

harry was also naturally smart and intelligent and now that he had put off the shackles of the false friends with whom satan had provided him promised to do well in his new position joel was determined that through no fault of his should harry fail he never lost sight of him for any length of time the two boarded at the same place and joel insisted on his accompanying him to church they read talked and walked together and as a natural consequence became much attached to each other

it was a dull gray rainy morning when our friend flora found herself standing in front of the house that had been her home for so many years

what a flood of memories the sight of the familiar scene brought to her she paused a moment or two to revel in the pleasure she thus felt she did not feel at all excited or even curious as to the cause for or the probable result of her trip turning to the house she stepped to the door and lifted the knocker

the door was opened by the neat but uncommunicative maid who was in charge of affairs during mrs martins illness and who silently and apparently acting on previous arrangement let the way direct to the sick room

although the day was dark and cloudy the window shades were dowd and heavy curtains lent their aid to darken the room still more

mrs martins greeting was somewhat of a surprise to flora as she stood on the threshold scarcely knowing whether to enter the darkened chamber or not

why dont you come in and shut the door came in fretful tones from the bed

i should like to do it indeed aunt sarah if i could only see my way returned flora mischievously she wondered at her own temerity at one time she would not have dared use such liberty of speech with this punctilious aunt but she had grown to be very independent since she had been thrown so entirely upon her own resources and had become accustomed to think and act both for herself and others she felt that she had grown in that she no longer stood in awe of aunt sarahs cold tones why should she she had come to ask no favor

 well came in questioning tones from the invalid

may i draw up the shades aunt sarah asked flora advancing slowly into the room and closing the door softly

i suppose so you can draw up anything you like it makes no difference to me was the somewhat ungracious reply

flora paid no attention to the tone but drew up the shades making it possible to see what was in the room

 aunt sarah how thin you are  she cried incautiously why you have been sick

of course i have you didnt suppose i was pretending did you   retorted mrs martin

no said flora i did not nor did i know you were so ill and now tell me can i do anything to render you more comfortable  

no i think not she replied yes you might bring me some toast and a cup of tea she added a moment later

as she turned at once to leave the room flora wondered in her own mind whether mrs martin really wished for something to eat the truth was mrs martin now that flora was here in the house even in her very room wished to decide how she could broach the subject which had lain on her heart so long she was thinking deeply and did not notice floras entrance until she heard  here they are aunt sarah nice and hot

what the invalid returned in a surprised way

 the toast and tea replied flora

 oh yes put them on the table

flora did so daintily arranging them so as to be inviting to the eye as well as the palate and inwardly wondering what new caprice her aunt would develop next however she had decided to yield to all her peculiarities and to bear with her whims and so with unruffled face she turned to arrange the room as only a womans hand can the grace and care were not lost upon her aunt whose eyes closely followed every motion as she moved silently about the room

sit down said mrs martin after a few moments silence

flora did so and after a slight hesitation mrs martin began having concluded to open the subject at once for nothing was to be gained by delay

 niece flora she said looking in the young girls face  i sent for you to tell you i feel that i have done what i had no business to do

what have you done aunt sarah asked flora half suspecting what she wished to say to her

i mean in sending you away from here as i did was the blunt reply

you had a right to do whatever you wanted to

stammered flora she could stand unmoved before the cold hard aunt sarah aunt sarah repentant she did not know how to meet

 no i had no right to do it continued mrs martin it was plain she did not intend to spare herself in the least  i had no right to do it sister bertha wanted you to stay and i know she did i had no right to take her money and live in her home and use her things when i knew she only left them to me because she trusted me to do what she wanted

 never mind aunt sarah  i knew nothing about it so do not worry it is all right and flora moved nearer the bed and took her hand in her own and tenderly held it

instead of complying mrs martin seemed to gain strength and she went on  no you knew nothing about her wishes but i did and flora i have not been happy in this house in fact i did not deserve to be

 you can talk about that when you get well

 i will never be well unless i make right what i have made wrong returned mrs martin i want to know flora if you can forgive your selfish old aunt for drivingâyes driving is the word as flora started to speakâyou from the home which was intended for you  will you not come back to it   and the tears began to gather in the eyes that had long been strangers to such an expression of emotion

flora felt very helpless now in the face of all these different moods she could think of nothing else to do but stroke the sick womans forehead gently and soothingly after a moment or two of silence she said i forgive you aunt sarah if you think theres anything to forgive everything has turned out for the best at least so far as i am concerned as to coming back i think i dont care toâthat is i couldnt leave mother you know

i dont want you to leave your mother child why cant she come too  

 do you mean to come here to live  

yes here to live

she would like that i know said flora adding mentally  providing you were different

she soon discovered that her unspoken thought had been realized before it had been expressed

now said the sick woman drawing a breath of relief  i can be at peace it is not too late for me to make amends and carry out sister berthas wishes ah child you do not know what i have suffered of late but its all right now

try to go to sleep now wont you asked flora coaxingly fearing the effect of the conversation upon the invalid

 no i dont want to go to sleep said mrs martin with a shade of her old firmness i just want to lie here and think

she did go to sleep however very soon and awoke greatly refreshed for her mind was at ease and she was surprised to find how much more pleasant the prospect of recovery was since she had something to look forward to

and flora she was delighted for to her the old home had never lost its charm

faithfully she nursed the sick woman who in spite of her efforts to the contrary now and then yielded to her oldtime habit of faultfinding when nothing pleased her mrs martin was very regretful for these outbursts and after each more carefully watched her own tongue and the movements and manner of her young nurse and daily became more attached to her and the more necessary it seemed to her to retain her sunshiny presence

flora was as happy in her present position and at her future prospects as it was possible for her to be with the everpresent feeling of uncertainty and sorrow at the absence of her dearly loved brother from whom she had expected such great things she was a very sensible girl and had learned long before this that to waste her time in worriment over what she could not help in any way would not enable her to discharge her present duties as she would wish knowing this as i say so well she put harry into the charge of the one  who never slumbers nor sleeps and went about her daily duties with a light step and merry smile for days she planned her mothers coming and how she would enjoy the life here her own pleasant little room was hers again and many were the happy hours she passed there every few moments throughout the day she would be in her aunts room reading to her or perhaps giving her a daintily arranged meal or placing the pillows more comfortably

one of her greatest pleasures was in arranging her aunt berthas old room preparatory to the coming of her mother to whom she had assigned it very lovingly and carefully did she do this for her heart was filled with tender memories of the past

mrs martin had told her to fix everything to suit herself and refused to have a word to say further than to heartily approve of all her arrangements

 i have been at the head of affairs a long time she had said   it is time now for us to change places

 i think you are trying to spoil me aunt sarah remarked flora one day when she had been told a number of times to do just as she liked

 i think there is no danger of that my deal said mrs martin

she was right for the experience flora had gained in the years since she had been home had so strengthened and developed her that it would have been wellnigh impossible to  spoil her as she had termed it

as soon as her aunt was able to sit up flora was to return home to get her mother and in fact the whole family if she could find them and bring them to aunt sarahs to live there

mrs martin insisted that she wanted a house full adding smilingly  the more the merrier my dear

flora wished this could be possibleâshe longed to be able to bring harry back with them and safe in that peaceful home win him from bis evil ways she sighed even as she thought  that is quite impossible she had forgotten for the moment that  with god all things are possible

during all these weary months harry hazeley had not once written home and neither his mother nor sister knew where he was

his friend joel piper had written to his mother but to his regret had as yet received no reply this saddened him as in his letter he had told of the changes in him not only in his body but in his heart and life for he wished his mother who had done so much for him to know

harry as yet had no news to write home joel was working slowly it is true to induce harry to attend some meetings which were being held successively in different churches harry became interested and later he had the happiness of knowing that he had accepted christ and been received by him

in the meantime he had applied himself steadily and faithfully to his business and not only earned the respect of his employers but saved a good share of his money

and now he thought triumphantly  there is nothing to prevent me from going home

this thought took complete possession of him and in his leisure moments be did little else than picture to himself his homecoming and the sight of mother sister and brother they would rejoice he was sure in his new life he wondered if flora had changed much and in what way alec passed away the days

these thoughts of home and homefolks together with the great desire to see them again gradually wore away the feeling of shame with which he had been assailed whenever his thoughts had turned that way before

joel  he exclaimed as they were sitting together one pleasant evening  i see no other way but to do it 

what is it you mean my boy asked joel as he looked at harry for a moment and then returned to his book

 to go home and see them all returned harry

 believe i will too said joel slapping his book by way of emphasis  by the way harry he continued  my home isnt so very far from yours only a couple of hours ride you live at bartonville and i live at brinton or rather i did

is that so well then let us go together

 what do you intend to do  give up your situation here for good or just ask for leave of absence  asked joel

 oh i shall give it up entirely was the answer  i prefer to get something to do nearer home what will you do  

 i shall come back said joel decidedly  my people are farmers i could be of no service now on a farm you know even if i cared for it which i dont

thus the matter was decided and arrangements were made accordingly

one evening as mrs hazeley sat in her home all alone stitching away busily she was startled to hear a loud rap on the door

 who can it be  she thought rising to answer the knock she found herself confronted by a tall rather slight young man with a grave face which however was now illuminated by a smile of expectancy

 harry harry i my boy harry   she cried holding open her arms the mothers quick instinct and penetrating love could not be deceived by appearances no matter how altered the form might be changed and the features matured but there was something that brought to her the memory of her child the baby of long ago

after the first greetings were over harry settled down and prepared to unburden his mind his mother noticed that he glanced about him wistfully and inquiringly

 no said mrs hazeley answering the query in his eyes  flora is not here she went to stay with your aunt sarah who is very ill i am expecting to go myself whenever i hear from her to that effect alec too is away he is living with that good old man  major benson you used to call him you remember alec enjoys a country life he intends to be a farmer he says it was very kind of him to give the boy such an opening the poor child was so afraid of being a burden to us i have every reason to be grateful for my children

 except me mother said harry

 no my boy returned his mother looking keenly at him  i am sure i have reason to be grateful for you too but tell me harry where have you been and why did you not write to us and keep us posted  

the entire absence of reproach or fault finding and the warm affection with which he was received by his mother touched the young man very deeply and with his heart made tender with these thoughts he determined to confide fully all his past to his mother from whom he felt sure he would receive ready sympathy

when the story was told mrs hazeley could but exclaim  bless the lord oh my soul

 and forget not all his benefits added harry reverently

they were interrupted at that moment by a knock upon the doorâa quick businesslike energetic knock

 i know who that is said mrs hazeley smilingly as she arose to admit the newcomer it was flora

 did ever returned prodigal receive a more hearty welcome than i   exclaimed harry laughingly but gratefully

his old habit of reserve was being gradually overcome and he was becoming accustomed to express his feelings quite freely much to the present and subsequent delight of his family

this evening a memorable one in the history of the little family was by no means over just as the happy trio were seated with heads bowed reverently in thankfulness to the giver of all good the knocker was raised another time

as the heads were lifted and flora arose to open the door she remarked merrily   that must be alec i suppose the magnetism of our presence is drawing him to us

it was not alec it was our good friend joel piper

 i was told mrs hazeley lived here said he

 so she does answered flora trying to recall where she had seen the familiar face before her joel was doing the same he was the first to ask however  havent i met you before  

i was just thinking i had seen you somewhere said flora looking puzzled

in brinton perhaps suggested joel

that is just itâyou knowâlottie piper exclaimed flora disconnectedly

 yes yes said joel eagerly  im her brother i remember now you are flora hazeley well well he cried accepting floras invitation to enter the room where he saw his friend harry for whom he was hunting i was just looking for you hal said he having first been presented to mrs hazeley who was delighted to welcome the young man who had done so much for her harry i was looking for you hal but i had no idea i should meet an old acquaintance in the shape of your sister but that reminds me he added sadly  i have been to the old home no wonder i didnt hear from them sickness death and desolation i found the home but no one in it

 how could that be   asked harry

 i know said flora gently  i saw lottie for a few moments the other day and she told me all about it i am so sorry

 is my sister here   joel asked eagerly

yes she is hereâin bartonville she is living with her aunt

i know said joel  my fathers sister i shall be glad to see lottie but mother is gone and now it is too late

no no joel dont talk that way said harrysoothingly  you have no need to say that you havent come home as you left it and suppose your mother is not here dont you think she knows all about it and then there is your sister you know

 that is all true harry it would have been hard to have come back as i went away and found her gone i could not have helped the little girl then but one thing more he said turning to flora who was wiping her eyes in sympathy  where is my father 

 lottie says he went away somewhere to work

 then i shall hope to see him some day and that will be one consolation joel was comforted by his friends and his own kind helpful deeds were bearing fruit for him

it was arranged that joel should boardâhe would hear of no other arrangementâwith mrs hazeley until he should find his sister and see how she was situated before returning to his employment

floras news was almost forgotten in the general rejoicing over harrys unexpected return and the equally unexpected addition to the little household in joel but when things were somewhat quieted down she had something wonderful to relate also

well well well said mrs hazeley to think of sister sarah softening at her age when will wonders cease 

harry did not approve of this proposed breaking up of their own little home he feared it might be but a passing whim of aunt sarahs

 oh no maintained flora stoutly  whatever else aunt sarah is she is not fickle when she says she means to do a thing that thing is as good as done

 thats very true said her mother so it was settled that after due preparation the family should move to brinton

the only regret that flora felt at leaving her home in bartonville was that she would be obliged to part with her class of girls whom she loved and who loved her she comforted herself with the thought that she would have another if possible in brinton the girls she left behind always cherished the memory of their young teacher and strove to imitate her gentle earnest ways and noble traits surely the seed she had sown in their hearts would spring up blossom and bear fruit for the masters kingdom

well  things have come to a pretty pass  here ive been running up and down here and there and everywhere like a chicken with its head cut off trying to please aunt emmeline and im just about as near doing it now as i was when i commenced its grumble grumble grumble every minute in the day and i will not stand itânot a day longer now  and lottie gave the fire a vigorous shake that sent the sparks darting hither and thither in every direction

it was hard for her lottie conscientiously did all she could for the fretful invalid upstairs but her efforts were not appreciated instead mrs durand seemed to grow more irritable daily nothing lottie did pleased her the tea was either too weak or too strong the toast either too hot or too cold  the beeftea was too highly seasoned or not enough thus the faultfinding continued day in and day out

heretofore lottie had succeeded in bearing with her captious patient fairly well her natural patience and sweetness of disposition being a great help to her but this day her task seemed a little harder to bear than usual and a short time before the outburst at the opening of the chapter the climax was reached when her aunt struck her with the cane sire used to aid her in getting about the room for she was able to go about a very little during the day

lottie had been sent for some water and in her zeal to please her aunt by being quick about it had spilled a few drops in that good womans lap and she without stopping to think had given her niece a rap with her stick

no i shall not stand it another minute muttered lottie as she angrily paced the floor of the little room whither she had rushed from her aunts presence

apparently she had determined to do something for she went to work energetically to put everything to rights she put more coal on the fire and in fact did everything she deemed necessary then she stole quietly up to her room packed some things in a bundle and noiselessly left the house

where was she going  she did not know what was she going to do  she only knew that she was going far away from her aunt emmelines where she had been insulted the old poplar solemnly waved its long bare arms over her head as if wishing her  goodbye she had a vague idea she would go and find her friend flora she would at least advise her what to do for after once fairly in the street the fact that she had no home but the one she was leaving behind made itself felt very plainly

she had not seen flora since that first day when they had met accidentally and she had almost forgotten the way she had come for she had been in such a hurry she gave little heed to anything she would go as best she could remember it seemed to her that she was walking a great distance and when at length she came to a small public square she sat down upon one of the cold damp seats almost discouraged and utterly unhappy no mother no homeânothing but misery the tears were very near the surface when she heard her name called at no great distance

that was strange though the voice sounded familiar stranger still however was the sight of a young man making his way rapidly toward her with a shuffling gait and leaning upon two canes although the face seemed familiar lottie was frightened and was preparing to run away when her steps were arrested by the strange young man saying in halflaughing halfvexed tones   why lottie girl dont you know your brother joel  

 what not my brother joel   exclaimed lottie joyously yet distrustfully

the very same and yet not the same replied joel sadly as he remembered how great was the physical change in him and which was so apparent

 i was straight and strong when you last saw me lottie he said looking down at his twisted limbs  i was straight and strong when i left the old home and now you see what i am and he seated himself beside lottie who had remained on the bench

 oh joel what made you so  she cried in a distressed voice

 never mind about that now little sister i will tell you all about it some time but mother

didnt you know she is dead and lottie burst into tears while the halfrepressed sobs of the utterly miserable girl shook her slender frame

yes i know answered her brother softly

how did you know  asked lottie as she raised her tearstained face in surprise at his knowledge when she knew he had been away so long

nevermind that either returned joel but tell me everything

lottie told about the death of their mother then added  oh joel she so wanted to see you before she died and now its too late

 yes too late the words found an echo in the young mans own breast he had put it off too long this homecoming hoping and wanting to come back to his home and parents well able to take care of himself and to help them too he had waited and worked and saved and now she for whom he so longed was not here to bid him welcome the thought also came to him that it was well this  too late  came only in the disappointment of earthly hopes suppose it meant the loss of his soul as well then another thought came this time full of comfort and peace  she will know i am changed and i shall meet her in heaven

then he turned to his sister feeling that here was a work for himâa legacy left him by his mother

where is father lottie  he asked a moment later inwardly wondering at her presence here

father oh after mothers death he couldnt stay there any more he said and so he went away to work out west i believe she added rather glad than otherwise to break the silence that had followed her last words i havent seen him since he brought me to live here

 live here with whom   inquired her brother

 with aunt emmeline and then she poured forth into sympathetic ears a recital of her woes inflicted largely by her aunt

what are you going to do asked joel when she finished  are you going back  

no i am not that settles it 

 never  

 no never 

joel was amused he well knew that the angry girl would be obliged sooner or later to modify her emphatic and hasty assertions however he thought it best to make no criticism at least until she should see her folly and mistake herself so he only said  well i guess you had better come with me fust now both of us will catch cold if we stay here much longer

unquestioningly lottie arose she did not care where she went so long as she was with joel who now was all she had to cling to

the sight of poor deformed joel hobbling painfully along touched lotties heart as nothing else could have done as she contrasted his shrunken body with her own strong robust self she felt almost glad her mother could not see him nowâshe had been so proud of joels strength

at length they halted before a small house that appeared strangely familiar to lottie and joel rapped on the door what was her surprise and delight to see the door opened by flora hazeley

 lottie  the latter exclaimed

flora

joel stood by smilingly while lottie was introduced to the rest of the family

 it seems so strange that both your brother and mine should be returned runaways doesnt it flora remarked lottie when all were seated

 how about lottie   slyly whispered joel as he sat by her side

lottie deigned no reply but tossed her head willfully while she thought no i will never go back to aunt emmelines

it was a very pleasant little home party that sat and chatted in the old dining room that evening but it was not until lottie and flora were alone in the room which they were to share for the night that lottie opened her heart and poured out her woes into floras sympathetic ear

 oh lottie how could you   asked flora when the recital was over

 oh flora of course i could do it and so would you have done in my place returned lottie in an injured tone

is it possible that you have left your poor sick aunt all alone  

 she isnt very sick she only thinks she is said lottie sulkily  she can get about her room well enough it wont hurt her to go a bit farther and go downstairs

flora after a few more ineffectual words saw lottie was feeling too bitter and hurt to be ashamed of her desertion of her poor sick aunt and with her customary tact dropped the subject entirely for a few moments there was silence each busy with her own thoughts

as flora was brushing her hair of which she was justly proud she said  lottie let us sit here in front of the fire i often do and watch the sparks as they flit here and there i feel like talking tonight i have listened to your story now you come here with me  i want to tell you mine

nothing loth lottie seated herself and listened attentively while her friend told of her own life with all of its disappointments hardships and trials

 what has all this to do with me  asked lottie suspiciously for she had a vague idea that flora had an object in view

it has this to do with you lottie dear answered flora as she put her own shapely hand gently but firmly over the rebellious one in lotties lap  it will show you that none of us can have things exactly as we want them and we are cowards if we run away from our duties had i been left to choose what i wished i should not have chosen a single thing that came to me and yet i am sure everything turned out for the very best in the first place aunt sarahs sending me home made me think and act for myself and others and in doing so i became far stronger than i would have been had i stayed with and depended on aunt bertha if she had lived in doing the second i found pleasure and now that after all our worrying harry has come back so changed i am just as happy as i can be but suppose i had run away when things were dark and discouraging would i now have anything to be happy over 

but nobody ever struck you flora that is different said lottie looking less stubborn

no replied flora that is very true dear nobody ever struck me but i have had other things quite as hard indeed things that i thought i could not possibly endure but you know who helped me bear them dont you lottie dear

 yes was the subdued reply you mean god helped you

yes and he will help you too lottie if you will let him but you must take up your duties again you know

 what  go back to aunt emmeline  

yes i mean just that i am sure she did not intend to treat you badly she will tell you so i have no doubt some day

 i dont know about that said lottie  but i guess i ought to go but suppose she will not have me back again  what then  

 oh dont borrow trouble it will be time enough to think about that when it happens replied flora  but come its time we were asleep

sleep however did not come to lottie as soon as it did to her friend her mind was too busy turning over the events of the day and anticipating the possible ones of the morrow nevertheless lottie was not really a coward and when she had decided on a certain course she kept to it as we have already seen

next day lottie informed her brother of her decision to return to her aunt and apologize for her unceremonious departure

joel was very glad that she had come to this conclusion of her own free will for he had feared he might have trouble in bringing her to it he more than halfsuspected that flora had a good deal to do with his sisters present submissive state and was accordingly grateful

lottie bade her friends goodbye and with joel to keep her courage up turned her face determinedly toward her aunts home only making a comical grimace as flora whispered to her some words of encouragement adding the assurance that all would come out right

the brother and sister walked on together in silence for some time and then it was joel who talked for lottie was too busy thinking to care for conversation she acted as guide until they stood under the old poplar in front of the quiet little house and then she took refuge behind her brother who marched undauntedly up to the door and gave a knock which said plainly  here are some people who mean business

the knock evidently surprised mrs durand for she opened the door herself instead of telling them to  come in as was her usual custom

at first she saw no one but joel and seemed strongly inclined to close the door upon him but when she caught sight of lottie standing demurely behind him she steadied herself firmly upon her canes and inquired  what do you want  

 in the first place aunt emmeline said joel calmly i suppose you know me

no i cant say i do was the reply

 i am not much surprised it has been some time since we met i am joel piper your nephew and lotties brother

mrs durand said nothing but only stood and looked

 lottie come here aunt emmeline lottie has something to say to you

lottie came from behind her brother and speaking rapidly as if she were afraid she would lose courage if she did not talk fast said   ive come to say that i am sorry i acted so badly aunt emmeline and if you will let me ill come back again

 come in was the brusque command joel and lottie entered and mrs durand closed the door then she turned to them and said simply  

 if you want to come back i guess you may

lottie shrugged her shoulders she wanted so much to say that she did not come back because she wanted to but because she thought she ought and she bit her tongue by way of admonishing that unruly member to keep still

joel guessed something of what was passing in his sisters mind and hastened to engage mrs durand in conversation

she seemed really touched as the young man recounted the history of his sickness and sufferings in a strange city  and lottie sitting silently listening was more than half convinced that she had judged her aunt too severely by the time joel was ready to go she was quite satisfied that she did want to come back then the old house really looked homelike especially after the feeling of loneliness and homesickness she had experienced the day before as she walked the streets not knowing which way to look for shelter

that evening after everything was done as mrs darand was seated by the fire in her easy chair and lottie was hemming a tablecloth mrs durand asked abruptly   why did you come back  

lottie looked up in astonishment scarcely knowing what to say but deeming it best to tell her exact reason she said   because i thought it was my duty to do it

for a while there was silence during which lottie glanced up timidly to see the effect of her words upon her aunt but she could discover nothing

 i suppose you were pretty angry with me when you went was the next remark

awful  said lottie catching her breath at her own temerity

again there was silence

well returned mrs durand if you hadnt been in such a hurry i should have told you i didnt mean to strike you  but i suppose i can tell you so now cant i 

 oh dear aunt emmeline you neednt say anything at all about it said lottie eagerly  i acted just horrid i know i did

i cant blame you much child old people like me with the rheumatism are apt to be snappish but i guess we both have had a lesson we will not be likely to forget come now i think it is time you were in bed so put away your sewing and go

can i get you anything aunt   asked lottie as she prepared to obey

nothing at all my dear was the soft reply that sent lottie upstairs in a state of pleasurable surprise at the turn things had taken never had she felt more glad of anything than she was to find herself in the little chamber again because it was home

joel in the meantime after he had seen his sister fairly reinstated in her old place returned to mrs hazeleys where he duly reported the success of his visit

flora was very glad things were straightening out for her young friend lottie for she was really fond of her because of her open truthful nature

a few days more joel spent with his friends and then after arranging with his aunt for his sisters future insisting on supplying her needs outside of her board for which mrs durand would accept nothing he left to return to his work feeling at least contented if not carrying back with him the memory of a happy home welcome and reunion it was good to have somebody to work for and care for and joel was accustomed to placing full value upon present blessings or privileges and his example had not been lost upon lottie whose lot while greatly changed and improved was by no means entirely freed from thorns for aunt emmeline was still aunt emmeline and was likely to continue to be so however since lotties return she had treated the girl with a fair amount of consideration much to her satisfaction and enjoyment lottie was beginning to feel at home in fact as the months rolled by and she grew in age and experience lottie gradually became the household manager and her aunt was content to oversee

after a time mr piper grew tired of  rolling around as he informed his sister and daughter and determined to marry a second time he moreover informed lottie that it would be more agreeable to all concerned if she would conclude to remain with her aunt

 humph  said that good woman  its well that it is agreeable to all but suppose it wasnt  as it is child she added you know you are welcome to a home with me just as long as you want it i have no wish to part with you but i must say your father is pretty cool

at one time lotties heart would have beaten tumultuously at the prospect of a permanent home with aunt emmeline but it was not so now and she felt very grateful when she lay down that night that god had so cared for her when she could not care for herself

to return to our friends the hazeleys they had all removed to brinton all but alec who seemed so wellcontented with his quarters at major joes that he did not wish to change there was really no necessity for him to do so he â was doing well at school although he was by no means what might be considered a brilliant pupil in fact his own prediction that he would be no scholar but a practical farmer seemed likely to come true

major joe had other help now and alec gave his time out of school and during holidays to the owner of a large farm in the immediate neighborhood where he was learning many things that were needful to know in his chosen calling he always came home at night and was known all around as a fine lad major joe had grown too feeble to attend market any longer and so he had turned that part of his business over to the young man who now had charge of his garden and who it seemed more than likely would have charge of ruth sometime in the future when he had grown able to do so the major remained at home alternately nursing his rheumatic limbs and helping  mother  and ruth with the poultry of which they raised a quantity and as jem said were  getting awful rich off the eggs and things ruth was a thrifty thoroughgoing little housekeeper one after her grandmothers own heart while jem was just a lively little girl who insisted on bestowing her help which however usually proved more of a hindrance she was however the pet of the old people and made things merry in the little cottage

alec hazeley had gone to see his brother as soon as he had heard of his return and had spent some days at home prior to the removal of the family and he was the last object they saw as they steamed out of the station mrs martin was no longer the active stirring woman she had been before her illness but was now a confirmed invalid she was much altered in every way and was very glad to have her sister and family with her and they were altogether a peaceful happy little household

it was not harrys intention to remain at home long after he had seen his mother and sister settled but somehowâperhaps it was because every one seemed glad to have him thereâhe stayed longer than he had intended and surprising to himself and altogether delightful to flora and his mother he one day informed them that he felt he had received a decided call to the ministry

 oh harry i  cried his sister  how sudden i wasnt dreaming of such a thing but i am so glad yes answered harry seriously  i feel as if i must prepare myself to preach something tells me and i feel sure it is the voice of god that i shall prosper at nothing else but winning souls for christ as i was snatched from the toils of the evil one so must i help save others i believe that god rescued me for that very purpose aunt sarah was delighted and would hear of nothing but that he should immediately begin to fit himself for his new work the family circle was again broken but this time how different the circumstances and how hopeful the future appeared with all united in the bond of love for christ and a hope for his reappearing

years have passed and long since the grass was green over mrs martins grave side by side she lay with her gentle sister and over the two graves the graceful branches of the willow drooped and in summer the sod was starred with daisies

it was december the trees were bare of leaves and the grass was withered the weather was cold the folks in brinton predicted a hard winter in the cosy home where mrs hazeley now presided with a calm demeanor and flora flitted about happy and contented there seemed no need to fear the searching winds of winter flora was no longer a girl but a wellgrown young womanâchanged and yet not changed she had matured with years but it was easy to discern the same merry thoughtful flora of the old days

shortly after his conversion harry had heard and followed the voice of his master to  preach the gospel and now he was the pastor of the church where aunt bertha had sat and listened to the gospel eagerly taking in the blessed words of lifeâthe same church where aunt sarah had listened stern and cold with her hard features turned upward to the minister and the same church where two happy facesâone of a quiet and attractivelooking matron the other of a fair brighteyed younger womanâwere seen every lords day

very proud was flora of her manly earnest brother who had won so completely the hearts of the people  and equally proud was harry of his sister who was loved and respected by all they saw but little of alec who had never outgrown his love for the country and who still lived in brinton he was industrious and economical and his friends were sure he would some day be a wealthy man

it wanted but a few days to christmas when one afternoon during a few idle moments flora stood by the window lightly drumming against the pane and smiling as if her thoughts were very pleasant

she had not been standing there long when the front gate opened and harry came toward the house

flora hurried to open the door for him and pausing to remove his overcoat he said   here is a letter for you flo

 a letter for me   she repeated  i wonder from whom it can be she returned to the room with the letter in her hand

a letter flora inquired her mother who is writing to you dear  

 it is from alec mother was the answer a moment later

what does the dear boy sayâanything of importance asked mrs hazeley

 it is a very short letter shall i read it 

never mind flora just tell us what be wants

 it is simply a very short but very urgent invitation for us all to spend christmas with him you especially harry

 me  i wonder why  

 shall we go mother  

 of course i would not disappoint the boy for anything  besides we have not seen him for so long

all were satisfied with this arrangement

christmas morning dawned bright and clear but very cold

harry held service in the morning in his church and of course mrs hazeley and flora were present everything was in readiness to start away immediately at its close

 it will not really matter  and we cannot miss seeing our harry conduct his first christmas service said flora positively

the exercises were simple but impressive  the singing sweet and solemnâthe sermon earnest and tender it seemed to flora as if she were shut in from everything and that she really moved among the circumstances connected with the saviours birth it seemed to her that she was with the wise men who brought gifts and came to worship the infant jesus  and the words of the anthem glory to god in the highest peace on earth good will to men echoed and reechoed through her whole being  truly she thought  that peace has entered my soul and how can i have aught but good will to men   

mrs hazeleys feelings found expression by the tears rolling down her cheeks under her veil flora saw them but knew they were for joy

never had harry spoken as he spoke that morning he scarcely recognized himself in the preacher whose impassioned words were holding spellbound the people who filled the church drawing from them alternately tears of sympathy and smiles of joy

when the service was at an end and the usual interchange of christmas wishes over the young minister joined his mother and sister who were waiting for him and with one upon each arm directed his steps to the depot where they boarded the cars for alecs home

flora felt too peaceful and happy to talk and in fact they were all disinclined for conversation and so the short journey was made in silence true to his word alec was at the station to welcome them and delighted that they had all come

he conducted them to a carriage he had in waiting and helped them in

 what do you want to ride to major joes for   asked harry  it is such a short distance

 oh i want youto ride today so ask no more questions was the saucy reply

alec has some new project in his head whispered flora to her mother who nodded and smiled as if anything and everything were in order so far as she was concerned

harry asked no more questions but was busy looking about him and trying to decide where they were going if to major joes why take such a roundabout course ail to no avail however and he abandoned the matter to the driver

there was no snow to cover with its white glittering blanket the rough spots but the brightness of the sun made amends for this lack by gilding the bare places it was a green christmas but there was a lurking promise of snows and storms yet to come in the brisk sharp wind that drove the withered leavesâreminders of the summers beautyâalong as flora remarked  like little old women dressed in brown and caught in a windstorm alec noticed as they drove along that his brother still glanced about inquiringly evidently not yet satisfied as to the road to major joes from the station alec was amused it was so long since harry had been there he felt sure he could not remember it was with a view to drawing his attention from this and thus prevent his asking more questions that alec began to talk diligently he pointed out the different objects of interest along the way and then would branch off into a series of remarks or conjectures concerning them

this now he said pointing to a pretty house they were passing  is mrs browns new residence isnt it tasteful  contains all the latest modern improvementsâ at least so they say and here is the homestead of a welltodo widow very benevolent quite a good thing for widows he was interrupted by floras inquiry  why widows especially  

 oh because you see all they need is do have just enough to keep them comfortably while they live they dont care about making improvements and buying or speculating as a general thing like

 like what   asked harry drily as his brother paused

well like me for instance returned alec

so i suppose you think there is no necessity for you to be benevolent

 its not but that i should so much as i cannot afford to be you see i am a young man and i need to be very prudent about the way i invest what money i have in order to accumulate a little more

 oh alec laughed flora  you certainly have accumulated a pretty good stock of selfcomplacency and have cultivated a fine opinion of yourself

 yes returned alec goodhumoredly touching up his horse with the end of his whip  one must blow his own trumpet if no one else will for him

 bad policy my boy interposed harry who seemed for the time being to feel himself a boy again  bad policy it is better not to have a trumpet blown at all than to do it yourself true worth will always receive its proper recognition

 not always you are wrong there said alec his eyes twinkling mischievously at the success of his plan for diverting his brothers attention

yes always persisted harry probably not from the direction you desire or are looking toward but if one looks in the right direction he will find that if he is worthy of esteem honor and respect he will get it from those upon whom his course has made an impression the trouble is that people often look too far away either they do not think to look among those immediately about them and among whom they live or they do not place the proper value upon their opinions and respect

well well said alec coolly as he drew up before the gate of a new and very pretty cottage  i am very much obliged to you for your valuable homily i hope i shall profit by it but my dear brother all is well that ends well  and as my chief object in engaging you in conversation was to give you something to think about besides which way we were going i am delighted that i was successful and with a polite bow the saucy fellow jumped down and proceeded to help his passengers to alight

no sooner had the little party alighted than the cottage door flew open and a crowd of familiar faces met their astonished gaze

there was the old major wrinkled and lame leaning on bis cane but smiling as if he had forgotten that there was any  rheumatiz  in the world

there was the brightfaced little jem of long ago now grown into a stout maiden and looking as sober and matteroffact as ever

and motherly little ruth was there with her face wreathed in smiles

there was good mrs benson busy and bustling with the weight of some unusual responsibility

such a royal welcome as our friends received tongues were kept busy with stories of the generosity of the dear old saint nicholas and wishes for the new year

 what a pretty house  exclaimed flora as the hum of voices was lessening

 i am glad you like it sister mine returned alec who was at her side  because you know it belongs to me  to you  then you have been industrious in all these years are you going to live here all alone  

yes you are right there flora alec answered totally ignoring her question  i have worked hard and saved too but there i am blowing my own trumpet again in spite of hals lecture  and he glanced roguishly at his brother

but harry only smiled  what on earth do you want with a whole house  asked flora curiously  are the major and mrs benson going to live with you   she added wishing to understand it all

 no said alec  they are going back home

flora and harry were thoroughly puzzled and from time to time glanced at their brother questioningly as if they feared he was joking them flora noticed however what the others were all too busy to see that alec was constantly glancing out of the front window as if expecting some one

at last her curiosity and his evident uneasiness were both satisfied  for a buggy drove up to the door and from it alighted a young girl and an elderly woman andâ joel piper who after dismissing the conveyance came toward the house where they were met by alec who presented them triumphantly to the rest

 lottie piper is this you   cried flora

the young girl was really lottie and the elderly woman was mrs emmeline durand her aunt

yes its me answered lottie serenely and ungrammatically

 this is a delightful surprise what next   exclaimed flora

shall i tell you asked alec coming forward and offering lottie his arm who evidently understood the whole situation  it is simply thisâand the two finelooking young people walked toward the window where harry was standing and paused before himâ i love lottie and i think she loves me lotties bright eyes dropped to the floor her face suffused with blushes with a bright little smile trembling around her mouth  i love lottie  and harry i want you to pronounce us husband and wife

mrs hazeley and flora looked somewhat dazed and then turning to each other locked arms and walked toward the bridal pair each face showing surprise but also betraying real joy at the event

the others were happy all knew what the day would bring forth and each had united with the others in mystifying mrs hazeley flora and harry

the last named while much surprised as was but natural understood the situation and the part he was expected to take as alec and lottie stepped toward him

 very well alec i am glad you have made such a happy choice are you both ready  please stand here that is it so

then amid the hush that fell upon the little company harrys voice was clearly heard saying   what god hath joined together let no man put asunder 

at the close of the short but very impressive service harry offered a short prayer that the  great allfather would watch over guard and guide these two lives that had linked themselves together for all time

then came congratulations and everybody tried to talk at once then came dinner this was in charge of mrs benson and it is only necessary to say that it was one long to be remembered  for she was an excellent cook

in the course of the dinner alec was pressed by flora to tell how he had become acquainted with lottie he quite willingly complied

 i first met her on the day i came down to see you off on the cars when you all left for brinton and just as the train was disappearing around a curve and i was turning about to go home a girl came running up all out of breath

  oh said she  has the train gone  i said  yes  did you want to get on     no said she  but my friend is on it and i wanted to say goodbye  im sorry said i  but who is your friend   not that it was any of my business to know but somehow or other i felt interested and she didnt seem to mind but said   flora hazeley  thats my sister said i do you know her   i guess i do was the answer  it is too bad  but it cant be helped i suppose im always late when i should be early and early when i should be late  this sounded so odd that we both laughed and then she turned and was out of sight in a very few seconds i didnt see her again until one day several years afterward when i was doing business for myselfâtaking my vegetables and things to town to sell you know it happened on this morning i had some fine fresh vegetables left over from market and i wanted to sell them before going home i went through several streets knocking at the doors and asking if the folks would like to buy what i had at one of the houses i met lottie again she did not recognize me at first but amused me very much by the close bargains she drove well said i you are a case she looked up at me suddenly as if she would like to give me a bit of her mind and she saw who i was then of course she began to ask after you all and that is the way we became acquainted i always went there afterward when i had anything left over and when i saw what a close bargain she could drive and what a good housekeeper she made for her aunt i thought   lottie is the girl to help a fellow get on in the world so after a while with the consent of the good aunt and no objections from our brother joel here to whom we wrote about the matter and who came on to see us and give us his blessing we made the arrangements that you see have been carried out today

 how about lotties father   said flora slyly

we wrote to him too and he didnt object eitherâ that is he didnt answerâand silence is consent you know

 alec said harry gravely  i am glad of course to see you doing well but it hurts me to hear you talk so much about getting rich and saying nothing about higher and better things what is to become of you when you are called to lay aside the possessions you are striving so hard to get  

now never you mind alec my good preacher brother interposed lottie looking at him with a complacent smile  alec is fond of mystifying people he is just as good a christian as ever a young man was he and i bothâto set your mind at restâwere converted over a year ago at a revival in bartonville we mean to try and live rightâdont we alec and she beamed on everybody in no way abashed by her frank confession it was plain that lottie would be matteroffact and practical to the end of her days

 my dear alec give me your hand   cried harry and the two brothers clasped hands warmly while joel nodded approvingly flora who sat next to lottie slipped her arm around her waist and gave her a sisterly embrace and mrs hazeley exclaimed wiping the tears away  if ever a woman was blessed in her children i am that one truly god is good

 that he is rejoined mrs benson  my husband and i can testify to that and her eyes rested lovingly upon ruth and little jem

 well put in mrs durand lotties aunt  you are all rejoicing but i am not so sure that i can join you i lose my housekeeper and the only companion i have when i lose lottie one doesnt mind living alone so much when one is used to it but when you have had company for so long it comes awkward to go back to the old habits

 remember the old proverb aunt emmeline  never cross the bridge until you come to it  laughed lottie then turning to alec who sat quietly smiling she said  tell her alec do

aunt emmeline come with me a moment i have something to show you and offering her his arm they left the room crossing the wide hall they ascended the stairs and stopping at a closed door alec said as he pushed it open  this room is for aunt emmeline as long as she will occupy it we could not do without her

mrs durands fears were thrown to the wind when she heard this and saw the dainty room turning to alec with her eyes bright with tears she said as she threw her arms around his neck   oh alec i do not deserve this but it makes me very happy to know you think enough of me to do this for me

as they entered the room where all was gayety her face wreathed in smiles mrs durand said   now i can join in the general rejoicing i have a new homeâthis oneâwith lottie and alec

everybody was pleased and lottie looked her happiness  for her face was ever very expressive of her feelings

for a long time jem who was as quiet and quaint in her ways as ever had been occupied in the effort to make peace between dolby and pokey who were now old and feeble but very dear to the heart of their mistress who had insisted that they must come to the wedding

during alecs story flora bad caught a look of decided disapproval on jems face and determining to ascertain the cause she asked   jem dear does anything trouble you  what do you think of this  

 do you mean the wedding   jem questioned

yes

well thenâand the words came slowly distinctly and decisivelyâ i think it was a very disinteresting one

how would you have had things if you could have had your way asked flora much amused at jems positive tone

 oh id have had white satin and orange blossoms and lots of presents and a great big wedding cake with a beautiful ornament on top and all such you know in her earnestness she had forgotten that pokey was on her lap hidden under the tablecloth for fear her indulgent grandma would see her and be disgusted and banish her from the room pokey feeling that the little hands were no longer pressing her down and reminding her that she must lie still quietly dropped to the floor and began cautiously to explore

now jem went on flora argumentatively suppose we did have all the fine things you named how much happier would that make us all  

 oh i dont know anything about that i only know it would have been prettier and more to my taste as a guest you see returned jem with dignity much to the amusement of her listeners

ah jem said harry shaking his head at her and pretending to be very serious  ah jem you little know how much unhappiness often follows the orange blossoms and satin

 i dont know anything about that either was the cool rejoinder  i only know they are prettier to look at

 everybody to his taste say i jem remarked alec solemnly which bit of philosophy was promptly put into practice by dolby who evidently found it to his taste just then to spring upon pokey while her young mistress was busy talking and who received a sharp box on the ear for his pains of course such behavior necessitated the removal of poor pokey in disgrace by jem

before anybody was ready for it the hour of separation had come after a great deal of talking and a good many  goodbyes the hazeleys were on the cars being carried back to brinton and the unique reunion was over

what a queer christmas party wo have been to laughed flora when they were again at home  but i enjoyed it

yes answered harry so did i

and i added his mother  more than all just to think what wonderful things god does bring about 

 yes said harry reverently how well the words of isaiah apply to us  i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight
