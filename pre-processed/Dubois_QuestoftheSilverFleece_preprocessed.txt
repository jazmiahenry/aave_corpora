quest of the silver fleece dubois web  novel
night fell the red waters of the swamp grew sinister and sullen the tall pines lost their slimness and stood in wide blurred blotches all across the way and a great shadowy bird arose wheeled and melted murmuring into the blackgreen sky

the boy wearily dropped his heavy bundle and stood still listening as the voice of crickets split the shadows and made the silence audible a tear wandered down his brown cheek they were at supper now he whispered â the father and old mother away back yonder beyond the night they were far away they would never be as near as once they had been for he had stepped into the world and the cat and old billy â ah but the world was a lonely thing so wide and tall and empty and so bare so bitter bare somehow he had never dreamed of the world as lonely before he had fared forth to beckoning hands and luring and to the eager hum of human voices as of some great swelling music

yet now he was alone the empty night was closing all about him here in a strange land and he was afraid the bundle with his earthly treasure had hung heavy and heavier on his shoulder his little horde of money was tightly wadded in his sock and the school lay hidden somewhere far away in the shadows he wondered how far it was he looked and harkened starting at his own heartbeats and fearing more and more the long dark fingers of the night

then of a sudden up from the darkness came music it was human music but of a wildness and a weirdness that startled the boy as it fluttered and danced across the dull red waters of the swamp he hesitated then impelled by some strange power left the highway and slipped into the forest of the swamp shrinking yet following the song hungrily and half forgetting his fear a harsher shriller note struck in as of many and ruder voices but above it flew the first sweet music birdlike abandoned and the boy crept closer

the cabin crouched ragged and black at the edge of black waters an old chimney leaned drunkenly against it raging with fire and smoke while through the chinks winked red gleams of warmth and wild cheer with a revel of shouting and noise the music suddenly ceased hoarse staccato cries and peals of laughter shook the old hut and as the boy stood there peering through the black trees abruptly the door flew open and a flood of light illumined the wood

amid this mighty halo as on clouds of flame a girl was dancing she was black and lithe and tall and willowy her garments twined and flew around the delicate moulding of her dark young halfnaked limbs a heavy mass of hair clung motionless to her wide forehead her arms twirled and flickered and body and soul seemed quivering and whirring in the poetry of her motion

as she danced she sang he heard her voice as before fluttering like a birds in the full sweetness of her utter music it was no tune nor melody it was just formless boundless music the boy forgot himself and all the world besides all his darkness was sudden light dazzled he crept forward bewildered fascinated until with one last wild whirl the elfgirl paused the crimson light fell full upon the warm and velvet bronze of her face â her midnight eyes were aglow her full purple lips apart her half hid bosom panting and all the music dead involuntarily the boy gave a gasping cry and awoke to swamp and night and fire while a white face drawn redeyed peering outward from some hidden throng within the cabin

 whos that  a harsh voice cried

where who is it and pale crowding faces blurred the light

the boy wheeled blindly and fled in terror stumbling through the swamp hearing strange sounds and feeling stealthy creeping hands and arms and whispering voices on he toiled in mad haste struggling toward the road and losing it until finally beneath the shadows of a mighty oak he sank exhausted there he lay a while trembling and at last drifted into dreamless sleep

it was morning when he awoke and threw a startled glance upward to the twisted branches of the oak that bent above sifting down sunshine on his brown face and close curled hair slowly he remembered the loneliness the fear and wild running through the dark he laughed in the bold courage of day and stretched himself

then suddenly he bethought him again of that vision of the night â the waving arms and flying limbs of the girl and her great black eyes looking into the night and calling him he could hear her now and hear that wondrous savage music had it been real had he dreamed or had it been some witchvision of the night come to tempt and lure him to his undoing where was that black and flaming cabin where was the girl â the soul that had called him she must have been real she had to live and dance and sing he must again look into the mystery of her great eyes and he sat up in sudden determination and lo gazed straight into the very eyes of his dreaming

she sat not four feet from him leaning against the great tree her eyes now languorously abstracted now alert and quizzical with mischief she seemed but halfclothed and her warm dark flesh peeped furtively through the rent gown her thick crisp hair was frowsy and rumpled and the long curves of her bare young arms gleamed in the morning sunshine glowing with vigor and life a little mocking smile came and sat upon her lips

what you run for she asked with dancing mischief in her eyes

 because â  he hesitated and his cheeks grew hot

 i knows she said with impish glee laughing low music

 why   he challenged sturdily

 you was afeared

he bridled  well i reckon youd be afeared if you was caught out in the black dark all alone

 pooh  she scoffed and hugged her knees  pooh ise stayed out all alone heaps o nights

he looked at her with a curious awe

 i dont believe you he asserted but she tossed her head and her eyes grew scornful

whos afeared of the dark i love night her eyes grew soft

he watched her silently till waking from her daydream she abruptly asked where you from

 georgia

wheres that

he looked at her in surprise but she seemed matteroffact

 its away over yonder he answered

 behind where the sun comes up  

 oh no 

 then it aint so far she declared  i knows where the sun rises and i knows where it sets she looked up at its gleaming splendor glinting through the leaves and noting its height announced abruptly  ise hungry

 so m i answered the boy fumbling at his bundle and then timidly will you eat with me

 yes she said and watched him with eager eyes

untying the strips of cloth he opened his box and disclosed chicken and biscuits ham and cornbread she clapped her hands in glee

 is there any water near   he asked

without a word she bounded up and flitted off like a brown bird gleaming dullgolden in the sun glancing in and out among the trees till she paused above a tiny black pool and then came tripping and swaying back with hands held cupwise and dripping with cool water

 drink she cried obediently he bent over the little hands that seemed so soft and thin he took a deep draught and then to drain the last drop his hands touched hers and the shock of flesh first meeting flesh startled them both while the water rained through a moment their eyes looked deep into each others â a timid startled gleam in hers a wonder in his then she said dreamily  wese known us all our lives and â before aint we 

he hesitated

ye â es â i reckon he slowly returned and then brightening he asked gayly  and we ll be friends always wont we 

 yes she said at last slowly and solemnly and another brief moment they stood still

then the mischief danced in her eyes and a song bubbled on her lips she hopped to the tree

 come â eat  she cried and they nestled together amid the big black roots of the oak laughing and talking while they ate

 whats over there   he asked pointing northward

 cresswells big house

 and yonder to the west  

 the school

he started joyfully

 the school what school  

 old miss school

 miss smiths school 

 yes the tone was disdainful

 why thats where im going i was afeared it was a long way off i must have passed it in the night

 i hate it  cried the girl her lips tense

 but i ll be so near he explained  and why do you hate it 

yesâ youll be near she admitted thatll be nice but â  she glanced westward and the fierce look faded soft joy crept to her face again and she sat once more dreaming

 yon ways nicest she said

 why whats there  

 the swamp she said mysteriously

 and whats beyond the swamp  

she crouched beside him and whispered in eager tense tones  dreams 

he looked at her puzzled

 dreams  vaguely â  dreams why dreams aint â nothing

 oh yes they is  she insisted her eyes flaming in misty radiance as she sat staring beyond the shadows of the swamp  yes they is there aint nothing but dreams â that is nothing much

 and over yonder behind the swamps is great fields full of dreams piled high and burning and right amongst them the sun when hes tired o night whispers and drops red things cept when devils make em black

the boy stared at her he knew not whether to jeer or wonder

how you know he asked at last skeptically

promise you wont tell

 yes he answered

she cuddled into a little heap nursing her knees and answered slowly

 i goes there sometimes i creeps in mongst the dreams they hangs there like big flowers dripping dew and sugar and blood â red red blood and theres little fairies there that hop about and sing and devils â great ugly devils that grabs at you and roasts and eats you if they gits you but they do nt git me some devils is big and white like hants some is long and shiny like creepy slippery snakes and some is little and broad and black and they yells â 

the boy was listening in incredulous curiosity half minded to laugh half minded to edge away from the blackred radiance of yonder dusky swamp he glanced furtively backward and his heart gave a great bound

 some is little and broad and black and they yells â  chanted the girl and as she chanted deep harsh tones came booming through the forest  zora zora o â o â oh zora 

he saw far behind him toward the shadows of the swamp an old woman â short broad black and wrinkled with fangs and pendulous lips and red wicked eyes his heart bounded in sudden fear he wheeled toward the girl and caught only the uncertain flash of her garments â the wood was silent and he was alone

he arose startled quickly gathered his bundle and looked around him the sun was strong and high the morning fresh and vigorous stamping one foot angrily he strode jauntily out of the wood toward the big road

but ever and anon he glanced curiously back had he seen a haunt or was the elfgirl real and then he thought of her words  wese known us all our lives

day was breaking above the white buildings of the negro school and throwing long low lines of gold in at miss sarah smiths front window she lay in the stupor of her last morning nap after a night of harrowing worry then even as she partially awoke she lay still with closed eyes feeling the shadow of some great burden yet daring not to rouse herself and recall its exact form slowly again she drifted toward unconsciousness

 bang bang bang  hard knuckles were beating upon the door below

she heard drowsily and dreamed that it was the nailing up of all her doors but she did not care much and but feebly warded the blows away for she was very tired  bang bang bang  persisted the hard knuckles she started up and her eye fell upon a letter lying on her bureau back she sank with a sigh and lay staring at the ceiling â a gaunt flat sadeyed creature with wisps of gray hair halfcovering her baldness and a face furrowed with care and gathering years

it was thirty years ago this day she recalled since she first came to this broad land of shade and shine in alabama to teach black folks

it had been a hard beginning with suspicion and squalor around with poverty within and without the first white walls of the new school home yet somehow the struggle then with all its helplessness and disappointment had not seemed so bitter as today then failure meant but little now it seemed to mean everything then it meant disappointment to a score of ragged urchins now it meant two hundred boys and girls the spirits of a thousand gone before and the hopes of thousands to come in her imagination the significance of these half dozen gleaming buildings perched aloft seemed portentous â big with the destiny not simply of a county and a state but of a race â a nation â a world it was gods own cause and yet â bang bang bang  again went the hard knuckles down there at the front

miss smith slowly arose shivering a bit and wondering who could possibly be rapping at that time in the morning she sniffed the chilling air and was sure she caught some lingering perfume from mrs vanderpools gown she had brought this rich and rareapparelled lady up here yesterday because it was more private and here she had poured forth her needs she had talked long and in deadly earnest she had not spoken of the endowment for which she had hoped so desperately during a quarter of a century â no only for the five thousand dollars to buy the long needed new land it was so little â so little beside what this woman squandered â the insistent knocking was repeated louder than before  sakes alive cried miss smith throwing a shawl about her and leaning out the window who is it and what do you want

 please maam ive come to school answered a tall black boy with a bundle

well why dont you go to the office then she saw his face and hesitated she felt again the old motherly instinct to be the first to welcome the new pupil a luxury which in later years the endless push of details had denied her

wait she cried shortly and began to dress

a new boy she mused yes every day they straggled in every day came the call for more more â this great growing thirst to know â to do â to be and yet that woman had sat right here aloof imperturbable listening only courteously when miss smith finished she had paused and flicking her gloveâ  my dear miss smith she had said softly with a tone that just escaped a drawl â  my dear miss smith your work is interesting and your faith â marvellous but frankly i cannot make myself believe in it you are trying to treat these funny little monkeys just as you would your own children â or even mine its quite heroic of course but its sheer madness and i do not feel that i ought to encourage it i would not mind a thousand or so to train a good cook for the cresswells or a clean faithful maid for myself â for helene has faults â or indeed deft and tractable laboringfolk for any one but im quite through trying to turn natural servants into masters of me and mine i â hope im not too blunt i hope i make myself clear you know statistics show â 

 drat statistics  miss smith had flashed impatiently  these are folks

mrs vanderpool smiled indulgently  to be sure she murmured but what sort of folks

 gods sort

 oh well â 

but miss smith had the bit in her teeth and could not have stopped she was paying high for the privilege of talking but it had to be said

 gods sort mrs vanderpool â not the sort that think of the world as arranged for their exclusive benefit and comfort

 well i do want to count â 

miss smith bent forward â not a beautiful pose but earnest

 i want you to count and i want to count too but i dont want us to be the only ones that count i want to live in a world where every soul counts â white black and yellow â all that s what im teaching these children here â to count and not to be like dumb driven cattle if you dont believe in this of course you cannot help us

 your spirit is admirable miss smith she had said very softly  i only wish i could feel as you do goodafternoon and she had rustled gently down the narrow stairs leaving an all but imperceptible suggestion of perfume miss smith could smell it yet as she went down this morning

the breakfast bell jangled  five thousand dollars she kept repeating to herself greeting the teachers absently â  five thousand dollars and then on the porch she was suddenly aware of the awaiting boy she eyed him critically black fifteen countrybred strong cleareyed

well she asked in that brusque manner wherewith her natural timidity was wont to mask her kindness  well sir 

ive come to school

 humph â we cant teach boys for nothing

the boy straightened  i can pay my way he returned

 you mean you can pay what we ask 

 why yes aint that all  

 no the rest is gathered from the crumbs of dives table

then he saw the twinkle in her eyes she laid her hand gently upon his shoulder

 if you dont hurry you ll be late to breakfast she said with an air of confidence  see those boys over there follow them and at noon come to the office â wait whats your name

 blessed alwyn he answered and the passing teachers smiled

miss mary taylor did not take a college course for the purpose of teaching negroes not that she objected to negroes as human beings â quite the contrary in the debate between the senior societies her defence of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm nevertheless when the end of the summer came and the only opening facing her was the teaching of children at miss smiths experiment in the alabama swamps it must be frankly confessed that miss taylor was disappointed

her dream had been a postgraduate course at bryn mawr but that was out of the question until money was earned she had pictured herself earning this by teaching one or two of her  specialties  in some private school near new york or boston or even in a western college the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans but from the offer that came to teach negroes â country negroes and little ones at that â she shrank and indeed probably would have refused it out of hand had it not been for her queer brother john john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton having certain schemes in mind he had been struck by the fact that the smith school was in the midst of the alabama cottonbelt

 better go he had counselled sententiously  might learn something useful down there

she had been not a little dismayed by the outlook and had protested against his blunt insistence

but john theres no society â just elementary work â 

john had met this objection with humph as he left for his office next day he had returned to the subject

 been looking up tooms county find some cresswells there â big plantations â rated at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars some others too big cotton county

you ought to know john if i teach negroes ill scarcely see much of people in my own class

 nonsense butt in show off give em your greek â and study cotton at any rate i say go

and so howsoever reluctantly she had gone

the trial was all she had anticipated and possibly a bit more she was a pretty young woman of twentythree fair and rather daintily moulded in favorable surroundings she would have been an aristocrat and an epicure here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable

then there was the fact of their color it was a fact so insistent so fatal she almost said at times that she could not escape it theoretically she had always treated it with disdainful ease

i â i dont know he faltered

dont know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor â  literally born in cotton and â oh well as much as to ask whats the use she turned again to go

 what is planted over there  she asked although she really did nt care

 goobers answered the smaller boy

 goobers   uncomprehendingly

 peanuts bles specified

 oh  murmured miss taylor  i see there are none on the vines yet i suppose though its too early for them

then came the explosion the smaller boy just snorted with irrepressible laughter and bolted across the fields and bles â was miss taylor deceived â or was he chuckling she reddened drew herself up and then dropping her primness rippled with laughter

what is the matter bles she asked

he looked at her with twinkling eyes

 well you see miss taylor its like this farming dont seem to be your specialty

the word was often on miss taylors lips and she recognized it despite herself she smiled again

of course it isnt â i dont know anything about farming but what did i say so funny

bles was now laughing outright

why miss taylor i declare goobers dont grow on the tops of vines but underground on the roots â like yams

 is that so  

 yes and we â we dont pick cotton stalks except for kindling

 i must have been thinking of hemp but tell me more about cotton

his eyes lighted for cotton was to him a very real and beautiful thing and a lifelong companion yet not one whose friendship had been coarsened and killed by heavy toil he leaned against his hoe and talked half dreamily â where had he learned so well that dreamtalk

 we turn up the earth and sow it soon after christmas then pretty soon there comes a sort of greenness on the black land and it swells and grows and and â shivers then stalks shoot up with three or four leaves thats the way it is now see after that we chop out the weak stalks and the strong ones grow tall and dark till i think it must be like the ocean â all green and billowy then come little flecks here and there and the sea is all filled with flowers â flowers like little bells blue and purple and white

 ah that must be beautiful sighed miss taylor wistfully sinking to the ground and clasping her hands about her knees

yes maam but its prettiest when the bolls come and swell and burst and the cotton covers the field like foam all misty â 

she bent wondering over the pale plants the poetry of the thing began to sing within her awakening her unpoetic imagination and she murmured  the golden fleece â its the silver fleece 

he harkened

 what s that   he asked

 have you never heard of the golden fleece bles  

 no maam he said eagerly then glancing up toward the cresswell fields he saw two white men watching them he grasped his hoe and started briskly to work

 some time you ll tell me please wont you  

she glanced at her watch in surprise and arose hastily

 yes with pleasure she said moving away â at first very fast and then more and more slowly up the lane with a puzzled look on her face

she began to realize that in this pleasant little chat the fact of the boys color had quite escaped her and what especially puzzled her was that this had not happened before she had been here four months and yet every moment up to now she seemed to have been vividly almost painfully conscious that she was a white woman talking to black folk now for one little halfhour she had been a woman talking to a boy â no not even that she had been talking â just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things â one thing cotton

she started thinking of cotton â but at once she pulled herself back to the other aspect always before she had been veiled from these folk who had put the veil there had she herself hung it before her soul or had they hidden timidly behind its other side or was it simply a brute fact regardless of both of them

the longer she thought the more bewildered she grew there seemed no analogy that she knew here was a unique thing and she climbed to her bedroom and stared at the stars

john taylor had written to his sister he wanted information very definite information about tooms county cotton about its stores its people â especially its people he propounded a dozen questions sharp searching questions and he wanted the answers tomorrow impossible thought miss taylor he had calculated on her getting this letter yesterday forgetting that their mail was fetched once a day from the town four miles away then too she did not know all these matters and knew no one who did did john think she had nothing else to do and sighing at the thought of tomorrows drudgery she determined to consult miss smith in the morning

miss smith suggested a drive to town â bles could take her in the topbuggy after school â and she could consult some of the merchants and business men she could then write her letter and mail it there it would be but a day or so late getting to new york

 of course said miss smith drily slowly folding her napkin  of course the only people here are the cresswells

 oh yes said miss taylor invitingly there was an allurement about this allpervasive name it held her by a growing fascination and she was anxious for the older woman to amplify miss smith however remained provokingly silent so miss taylor essayed further

 what sort of people are the cresswells  she asked

 the old mans a fool the young one a rascal the girl a ninny was miss smiths succinct and acid classification of the countys first family adding as she rose  but they own us body and soul she hurried out of the diningroom without further remark miss smith was more patient with black folk than with white

the sun was hanging just above the tallest trees of the swamp when miss taylor weary with the days work climbed into the buggy beside bles they wheeled comfortably down the road leaving the sombre swamp with its blackgreen to the right and heading toward the goldengreen of waving cotton fields miss taylor lay back listlessly and drank the soft warm air of the languorous spring she thought of the golden sheen of the cotton and the cold march winds of new england of her brother who apparently noted nothing of leaves and winds and seasons and of the mighty cresswells whom miss smith so evidently disliked suddenly she became aware of her long silence and the silence of the boy

 bles she began didactically  where are you from 

he glanced across at her and answered shortly  georgia maam and was silent

the girl tried again

 georgia is a large state â tentatively

 yes maam

 are you going back there when you finish  

 i dont know

 i think you ought to â and work for your people

 yes maam

she stopped puzzled and looked about the old horse jogged lazily on and bles switched him unavailingly somehow she had missed the way today the veil hung thick sombre impenetrable well she had done her duty and slowly she nestled back and watched the faroff green and golden radiance of the cotton

 bles she said impulsively  shall i tell you of the golden fleece 

he glanced at her again

 yesm please he said

she settled herself almost luxuriously and began the story of jason and the argonauts

the boy remained silent and when she had finished he still sat silent elbow on knee absently flicking the jogging horse and staring ahead at the horizon she looked at him doubtfully with some disappointment that his hearing had apparently shared so little of the joy of her telling and too there was mingled a vague sense of having lowered herself to too familiar fellowship with this â this boy she straightened herself instinctively and thought of some remark that would restore proper relations she had not found it before he said slowly  all yon is jasons

 what   she asked puzzled

he pointed with one sweep of his long arm to the quivering mass of greengold foliage that swept from swamp to horizon

 all yon golden fleece is jasons now he repeated

 i thought it was â cresswells she said

 thats what i mean

she suddenly understood that the story had sunk deeply

 i am glad to hear you say that she said methodically  for jason was a brave adventurer â 

 i thought he was a thief

 oh well â those were other times

 the cresswells are thieves now

miss taylor answered sharply

 bles i am ashamed to hear you talk so of your neighbors simply because they are white

but bles continued

 this is the black sea he said pointing to the dull cabins that crouched here and there upon the earth with the dark twinkling of their black folk darting out to see the strangers ride by

despite herself miss taylor caught the allegory and half whispered  lo the king himself  as a black man almost rose from the tangled earth at their side he was tall and thin and sombrehued with a carven face and thick gray hair

 your servant mistress he said with a sweeping bow as he strode toward the swamp miss taylor stopped him for he looked interesting and might answer some of her brothers questions he turned back and stood regarding her with sorrowful eyes and ugly mouth

 do you live about here  she asked

 ise lived here a hundred years he answered she did not believe it he might be seventy eighty or even ninety â indeed there was about him that indefinable sense of age â some shadow of endless living but a hundred seemed absurd

 you know the people pretty well then 

 i knows dem all i knows most of em better dan dey knows demselves i knows a heap of tings in dis world and in de next

 this is a great cotton country  

 dey dont raise no cotton now to what dey used to when old genrel cresswell fust come from carolina den it was a bale and a half to the acre on stalks dat looked like young brushwood dat was cotton

 are they honest and kind 

 oh yaas maam â deyse good white folks

 good white folk  

 oh yaas maam â course you knows white folks will be white folks â white folks will be white folks your servant maam and the swamp swallowed him

the boys eyes followed him as he whipped up the horse  he s going to elspeths he said

 who is he  

 we just call him old pappy â he s a preacher and some folks say a conjure man too

 and who is elspeth  

 she lives in the swamp â shes a kind of witch i reckon like â like â 

 like medea 

yes â only â i do nt know â  and he grew thoughtful

the road turned now and far away to the eastward rose the first straggling cabins of the town creeping toward them down the road rolled a dark squat figure it grew and spread slowly on the horizon until it became a fat old black woman hooded and aproned with great round hips and massive bosom her face was heavy and homely until she looked up and lifted the drooping cheeks and then kindly old eyes beamed on the young teacher as she curtsied and cried goodevening honey goodevening you sure is pretty dis evening

 why aunt rachel how are you  there was genuine pleasure in the girls tone

 just tolerable honey bless de lord rumatiz is kind o bad and aunt rachel aint so young as she use ter be

 and what brings you to town afoot this time of day  

the face fell again to dull care and the old eyes crept away she fumbled with her cane

 its de boys again honey she returned solemnly  deyse good boys dey is good to dere old mammy but deyse high strung and dey gits fighting and drinking and â and â last saturday night dey got took up again ise been to jedge grey â i use to tote him on my knee honey â ise been to him to plead him not to let em go on de gang cause you see honey and she stroked the girls sleeve as if pleading with her too you see it done ruins boys to put em on de gang

miss taylor tried hard to think of something comforting to say but words seemed inadequate to cheer the old soul but after a few moments they rode on leaving the kind face again beaming and dimpling

and now the country town of toomsville lifted itself above the cotton and corn fringed with dirty straggling cabins of black folk the road swung past the iron watering trough turned sharply and after passing two or three pert cottages and a stately house old and faded opened into the wide square here pulsed the very life and being of the land yonder great bales of cotton yellowwhite in its soiled sacking piled in lofty dusty mountains lay listening for the train that twice a day ran out to the greater world round about tied to the wellgnawed hitching rails were rows of mules â mules with back cloths mules with saddles mules hitched to long wagons buggies and rickety gigs mules munching golden ears of corn and mules drooping their heads in sorrowful memory of better days

beyond the cotton warehouse smoked the chimneys of the seedmill and the cottongin a red liverystable faced them and all about three sides of the square ran stores big stores and small widewindowed narrow stores some had old steps above the worn clay sidewalks and some were flush with the ground all had a general sense of dilapidation â save one the largest and most imposing a threestory brick this was caldwells  emporium   and here bles stopped and miss taylor entered

mr caldwell himself hurried forward and the whole store clerks and customers stood at attention for miss taylor was yet new to the county

she bought a few trifles and then approached her main business

 my brother wants some information about the county mr caldwell and i am only a teacher and do not know much about conditions here

 ah where do you teach   asked mr caldwell he was certain he knew the teachers of all the white schools in the county miss taylor told him he stiffened slightly but perceptibly like a man clicking the buckles of his ready armor and two townswomen who listened gradually turned their backs but remained near

yes â yes he said with uncomfortable haste  any â er â information â of course â  miss taylor got out her notes

 the leading landowners she began sorting the notes searchingly  i should like to know something about them

 well colonel cresswell is of course our greatest landlord â a highbred gentleman of the old school he and his son â a worthy successor to the name â hold some fifty thousand acres they may be considered representative types then mr maxwell has ten thousand acres and mr tolliver a thousand

miss taylor wrote rapidly  and cotton   she asked

 we raise considerable cotton but not nearly what we ought to nigger labor is too worthless

oh the negroes are not then very efficient

efficient snorted mr caldwell at last she had broached a phase of the problem upon which he could dilate with fervor  they re the lowestdown ornriest â begging your pardon â goodfornothing loafers you ever heard of why we just have to carry them and care for them like children look yonder he pointed across the square to the courthouse it was an old square brickandstucco building sombre and stilted and very dirty out of it filed a stream of men â some black and shackled some white and swaggering and liberal with tobaccojuice some white and shaven and stiff  court s just out pursued mr caldwell  and them niggers have just been sent to the gang â young ones too educated but good for nothing they re all that way

miss taylor looked up a little puzzled and became aware of a battery of eyes and ears everybody seemed craning and listening and she felt a sudden embarrassment and a sense of halfveiled hostility in the air with one or two further perfunctory questions and a hasty expression of thanks she escaped into the air

the whole square seemed loafing and lolling â the white world perched on stoops and chairs in doorways and windows the black world filtering down from doorways to sidewalk and curb the hot dusty quadrangle stretched in dreary deadness toward the temple of the town as if doing obeisance to the courthouse down the courthouse steps the sheriff with winchester on shoulder was bringing the last prisoner â a curlyheaded boy with golden face and big brown frightened eyes

 its one of dunns boys said bles  hes drunk again and they say hes been stealing i expect he was hungry and they wheeled out of the square

miss taylor was tired and the hastily scribbled letter which she dropped into the post in passing was not as clearly expressed as she could wish

a greatvoiced giant brown and bearded drove past them roaring a hymn he greeted bles with a comprehensive wave of the hand

 i guess tylor has been paid off said bles but miss taylor was too disgusted to answer further on they overtook a tall young yellow boy walking awkwardly beside a handsome boldfaced girl two white men came riding by one leered at the girl and she laughed back while the yellow boy strode sullenly ahead as the two white riders approached the buggy one said to the other  whos that nigger with 

 one of them nigger teachers

 well they ll stop this damn riding around or they ll hear something and they rode slowly by

miss taylor felt rather than heard their words and she was uncomfortable the sun fell fast the long shadows of the swamp swept soft coolness on the red road then afar in front a curled cloud of white dust arose and out of it came the sound of galloping horses

 whos this   asked miss taylor

 the cresswells i think they usually ride to town about this time but already miss taylor had descried the brown and tawny sides of the speeding horses

 good gracious  she thought  the cresswells  and with it came a sudden desire not to meet them â just then she glanced toward the swamp the sun was sifting bloodred lances through the trees a little wagonroad entered the wood and disappeared miss taylor saw it

 lets see the sunset in the swamp she said suddenly on came the galloping horses bles looked up in surprise then silently turned into the swamp the horses flew by their hoofbeats dying in the distance a dark green silence lay about them lit by mighty crimson glories beyond miss taylor leaned back and watched it dreamily till a sense of oppression grew on her the sun was sinking fast

 where does this road come out  she asked at last

 it does nt come out

where does it go

 it goes to elspeths

 why we must turn back immediately i thought â  but bles was already turning they were approaching the main road again when there came a fluttering as of a great bird beating its wings amid the forest then a girl lithe dark brown and tall leaped lightly into the path with greetings on her lips for bles at the sight of the lady she drew suddenly back and stood motionless regarding miss taylor searching her with wide black liquid eyes miss taylor was a little startled

 good â goodevening she said straightening herself

the girl was still silent and the horse stopped one tense moment pulsed through all the swamp then the girl still motionless â still looking miss taylor through and through â said with slow deliberateness  i hates you

the teacher in miss taylor strove to rebuke this unconventional greeting but the woman in her spoke first and asked almost before she knew it â  why

zora child of the swamp was a heathen hoyden of twelve wayward untrained years slight straight strong fullblooded she had dreamed her life away in wilful wandering through her dark and sombre kingdom until she was one with it in all its moods mischievous secretive brooding full of great and awful visions steeped body and soul in woodlore her home was out of doors the cabin of elspeth her port of call for talking and eating she had not known she had scarcely seen a child of her own age until bles alwyn had fled from her dancing in the night and she had searched and found him sleeping in the misty morning light it was to her a strange new thing to see a fellow of like years with herself and she gripped him to her soul in wild interest and new curiosity yet this childish friendship was so new and incomprehensible a thing to her that she did not know how to express it at first she pounced upon him in mirthful almost impish glee teasing and mocking and half scaring him despite his fifteen years of young manhood

 yes they is devils down yonder behind the swamp she would whisper warningly when after the first meeting he had crept back again and again half fascinated half amused to greet her ise seen em ise heard em cause my mammy is a witch

the boy would sit and watch her wonderingly as she lay curled along the low branch of the mighty oak clinging with little curved limbs and flying angers possessed by the spirit of her vision she would chant lowvoiced tremulous mischievous  one night a devil come to me on blue fire out of a big red flower that grows in the south swamp he was tall and big and strong as anything and when he spoke the trees shook and the stars fell even mammy was afeared and it takes a lot to make mammy afeared cause shes a witch and can conjure he said ill come when you die â ill come when you die and take the conjure off you and then he went away on a big fire

 shucks  the boy would say trying to express scornful disbelief when in truth he was awed and doubtful always he would glance involuntarily back along the path behind him then her low birdlike laughter would rise and ring through the trees

so passed a year and there came the time when her wayward teasing and the almost painful thrill of her taletelling nettled him and drove him away for long months he did not meet her until one day he saw her deep eyes fixed longingly upon him from a thicket in the swamp he went and greeted her but she said no word sitting nested among the greenwood with passionate proud silence until he had sued long for peace then in sudden new friendship she had taken his hand and led him through the swamp showing him all the beauty of her swampworld â great shadowy oaks and limpid pools lone naked trees and sweet flowers the whispering and flitting of wild things and the winging of furtive birds she had dropped the impish mischief of her way and up from beneath it rose a wistful visionary tenderness a mighty halfconfessed halfconcealed striving for unknown things he seemed to have found a new friend

and today after he had taken miss taylor home and supped he came out in the twilight under the new moon and whistled the tremulous note that always brought her

why did youspeak so to miss taylor he asked reproachfully she considered the matter a moment

 you dont understand she said  you cant never understand i can see right through people you cant you never had a witch for a mammy â did you 

 no

 well then you see i have to take care of you and see things for you

 zora he said thoughtfully  you must learn to read

 what for 

 so that you can read books and know lots of things

dont white folks make books

yes â most of the books

 pooh i knows more than they do now â a heap more

 in some ways you do but they know things that give them power and wealth and make them rule

no no they dont really rule they just thinks they rule they just got things â heavy dead things we black folks is got the spirit wese lighter and cunninger we fly right through them we go and come again just as we wants to black folks is wonderful

he did not understand what she meant but he knew what he wanted and he tried again

 even if white folks dont know everything they know different things from us and we ought to know what they know

this appealed to her somewhat

 i dont believe they know much she concluded  but i ll learn to read and just see

 it will be hard work he warned but he had come prepared for acquiescence he took a primer from his pocket and lighting a match showed her the alphabet

 learn those he said

 what for  she asked looking at the letters disdainfully

 because thats the way he said as the light flared and went out

i dont believe it she disputed disappearing in the wood and returning with a pineknot they lighted it and its smoky flame threw wavering shadows about she turned the leaves till she came to a picture which she studied intently

is this about this she asked pointing alternately to reading and picture

 yes and if you learn â 

 read it she commanded he read the page

 again she said making him point out each word then she read it after him accurately with more perfect expression he stared at her she took the book and with a nod was gone

it was saturday and dark she never asked bles to her home â to that mysterious black cabin in midswamp he thought her ashamed of it and delicately refrained from going so tonight she slipped away stopped and listened till she heard his footsteps on the pike and then flew homeward presently the old black cabin loomed before her with its wide flapping door the old woman was bending over the fire stirring some savory mess and a yellow girl with a white baby on one arm was placing dishes on a rickety wooden table when zora suddenly and noiselessly entered the door

come is you i lowed victuals would fetch you grumbled the hag

but zora deigned no answer she walked placidly to the table where she took up a handful of cold cornbread and meat and then went over and curled up by the fire

elspeth and the girl talked and laughed coarsely and the night wore on

by and by loud laughter and tramping came from the road â a sound of numerous footsteps zora listened leapt to her feet and started to the door the old crone threw an epithet after her but she flashed through the lighted doorway and was gone followed by the oath and shouts from the approaching men in the hut night fled with wild song and revel and day dawned again out from some fastness of the wood crept zora she stopped and bathed in a pool and combed her closeclung hair then entered silently to breakfast

thus began in the dark swamp that primal battle with the word she hated it and despised it but her pride was in arms and her one great life friendship in the balance she fought her way with a dogged persistence that brought word after word of praise and interest from bles then once well begun her busy eager mind flew with a rapidity that startled the stories especially she devoured â tales of strange things and countries and men gripped her imagination and clung to her memory

 did nt i tell you there was lots to learn  he asked once

 i knew it all she retorted  every bit ise thought it all before only the little things is differentâand i like the little strange things

spring ripened to summer she was reading well and writing some

 zora he announced one morning under their forest oak  you must go to school

she eyed him surprised

 why

 you ve found some things worth knowing in this world have nt you zora  

 yes she admitted

 but there are more â many many more â worlds on worlds of things â you have not dreamed of

she stared at him openeyed and a wonder crept upon her face battling with the old assurance then she looked down at her bare brown feet and torn gown

 ive got a little money zora he said quickly

but she lifted her head

 i ll earn mine she said   how   he asked doubtfully

 i ll pick cotton

 can you  

 course i can

 its hard work

she hesitated

i dont like to work she mused you see mammys pappy was a kings son and kings dont work i dont work mostly i dreams but i can work and i will â for the wonder things â and for you

so the summer yellowed and silvered into fall all the vacation days bles worked on the farm and zora read and dreamed and studied in the wood until the land lay white with harvest then without warning she appeared in the cottonfield beside bles and picked

it was hot sore work the sun blazed her bent and untrained back pained and the soft little hands bled but no complaint passed her lips her hands never wavered and her eyes met his steadily and gravely she bade him goodnight cheerily and then stole away to the wood crouching beneath the great oak and biting back the groans that trembled on her lips often she fell supperless to sleep with two great tears creeping down her tired cheeks

when schooltime came there was not yet money enough for cottonpicking was not far advanced yet zora would take no money from bles and worked earnestly away

meantime there occurred to the boy the momentous question of clothes had zora thought of them he feared not she knew little of clothes and cared less so one day in town he dropped into caldwells emporium  and glanced hesitantly at certain readymade dresses one caught his eye it came from the great easterly mills in new england and was red â a vivid red the glowing warmth of this cloth of cotton caught the eye of bles and he bought the gown for a dollar and a half

he carried it to zora in the wood and unrolled it before her eyes that danced with glad tears of course it was long and wide but he fetched needle and thread and scissors too it was a full month after school had begun when they together back in the swamp shadowed by the foliage began to fashion the wonderful garment at the same time she laid ten dollars of her first hardearned money in his hands

 you can finish the first year with this money bles assured her delighted  and then next year you must come in to board because you see when you re educated you wont want to live in the swamp

 i wants to live here always

 but not at elspeths

 noo â not there not there and a troubled questioning trembled in her eyes but brought no answering thought in his for he was busy with his plans

 then you see zora if you stay here you ll need a new house and you ll want to learn how to make it beautiful

 yes a beautiful great castle here in the swamp she dreamed  but and her face fell  i cant get money enough to board in and i dont want to board in â i wants to be free

he looked at her curled down so earnestly at her puzzling task and a pity for the more than motherless child swept over him he bent over her nervously eagerly and she laid down her sewing and sat silent and passive with dark burning eyes

 zora he said  i want you to do all this â for me

 i will if you wants me to she said quietly but with something in her voice that made him look half startled into her beautiful eyes and feel a queer flushing in his face he stretched his hand out and taking hers held it lightly till she quivered and drew away bending again over her sewing

then a nameless exaltation rose within his heart

 zora he whispered  ive got a plan

 what is it  she asked still with bowed head

 listen till i tell you of the golden fleece

then she too heard the story of jason breathless she listened dropping her sewing and leaning forward eagereyed then her face clouded

do you spose mammys the witch she asked dubiously

 no she would nt give her own flesh and blood to help the thieving jason

she looked at him searchingly

 yes she would too affirmed the girl and then she paused still intently watching him she was troubled and again a question eagerly hovered on her lips but he continued  then we must escape her he said gayly u see yonder lies the silver fleece spread across the brown back of the world lets get a bit of it and hide it here in the swamp and comb it and tend it and make it the beautifullest bit of all then we can sell it and send you to school

she sat silently bent forward turning the picture in her mind suddenly forgetting her trouble she bubbled with laughter and leaping up clapped her hands

 and i knows just the place  she cried eagerly looking at him with a flash of the old teasing mischief â  down in the heart of the swamp â where dreams and devils lives

up at the schoolhouse miss taylor was musing she had been invited to spend the summer with mrs grey at lake george and such a summer â silken clothes and dainty food motoring and golf wellgroomed men and elegant women she would not have put it in just that way but the vision came very close to spelling heaven to her mind not that she would come to it vacantminded but rather as a trained woman starved for companionship and wanting something of the beauty and ease of life she sat dreaming of it here with rows of dark faces before her and the singsong wail of a little black reader with his head aslant and his patched kneepants

the day was warm and languorous and the last pale mist of the silver fleece peeped in at the windows she tried to follow the thirdreader lesson with her finger but persistently off she went dreaming to some exquisite little parlor with its green and gold the clink of dainty china and hum of low voices and the blue lake in the window she would glance up the door would open softly and â just here she did glance up and all the school glanced with her the drone of the reader hushed the door opened softly and upon the threshold stood zora her small feet and slender ankles were black and bare her dark round and broadbrowed head and strangely beautiful face were poised almost defiantly crowned with a misty mass of waveless hair and lit by the velvet radiance of two wonderful eyes and hanging from shoulder to ankle in formless clinging folds blazed the scarlet gown

the cry of the naked was sweeping the world from the peasant toiling in russia the lady lolling in london the chieftain burning in africa and the esquimaux freezing in alaska from long lines of hungry men from patient sadeyed women from old folk and creeping children went up the cry clothes clothes  far away the wide black land that belts the south where miss smith worked and miss taylor drudged and bles and zora dreamed the dense black land sensed the cry and heard the bound of answering life within the vast dark breast all that dark earth heaved in mighty travail with the bursting bolls of the cotton while black attendant earth spirits swarmed above sweating and crooning to its birth pains

after the miracle of the bursting bolls when the land was brightest with the piled mist of the fleece and when the cry of the naked was loudest in the mouths of men a sudden cloud of workers swarmed between the cotton and the naked spinning and weaving and sewing and carrying the fleece and mining and minting and bringing the silver till the song of service filled the world and the poetry of toil was in the souls of the laborers yet ever and alway there were tense silent whitefaced men moving in that swarm who felt no poetry and heard no song and one of these was john taylor

he was tall thin cold and tireless and he moved among the watchers of this world of trade in the rich wall street officers of grey and easterly brokers mr taylor as chief and confidential clerk surveyed the worlds nakedness and the supply of cotton to clothe it the object of his watching was frankly stated to himself and to his world he purposed going into business neither for his own health nor for the healing or clothing of the peoples but to apply his knowledge of the worlds nakedness and of black mens toil in such a way as to bring himself wealth in this he was but following the teaching of his highest ideal lately deceased mr job grey mr grey had so successfully manipulated the cotton market that while black men who made the cotton starved in alabama and white men who bought it froze in siberia he himself sat â high on a throne of royal state that far outshone the wealth of ormuz or of ind

notwithstanding this he died eventually leaving the burden of his wealth to his bewildered wife and his business to the astute mr easterly not simply to mr easterly but in a sense to his spiritual heir john taylor

to be sure mr taylor had but a modest salary and no financial interest in the business but he had knowledge and business daring â effrontery even â and the determination was fixed in his mind to be a millionaire at no distant date some cautious fliers on the market gave him enough surplus to send his sister mary through the high school of his country home in new hampshire and afterward through wellesley college although just why a woman should want to go through college was inexplicable to john taylor and he was still uncertain as to the wisdom of his charity

when she had an offer to teach in the south john taylor hurried her off for two reasons he was profoundly interested in the cottonbelt and there she might be of service to him and secondly he had spent all the money on her that he intended to at present and he wanted her to go to work as an investment he did not consider mary a success her letters intimated very strongly her intention not to return to miss smiths school but they also brought information â disjointed and incomplete to be sure â which mightily interested mr taylor and sent him to atlases encyclopaedias and censusreports when he went to that little lunch with old mrs grey he was not sure that he wanted his sister to leave the cottonbelt just yet after lunch he was ure that he did not want her to leave

the rich mrs grey was at the crisis of her fortunes she was an elderly lady in those uncertain years beyond fifty and had been left suddenly with more millions than she could easily count personally she was inclined to spend her money in bettering the world right off in such ways as might from time to time seem attractive this course to her husbands former partner and present executor mr edward easterly was not only foolish but wicked and incidentally distinctly unprofitable to him he had expressed himself strongly to mrs grey last night at dinner and had reinforced his argument by a pointed letter written this morning

to john taylor mrs greys disposal of the income was unbelievable blasphemy against the memory of a mighty man he did not put this in words to mrs grey â he was only head clerk in her late husbands office â but he became watchful and thoughtful he ate his soup in silence when she descanted on various benevolent schemes

 now what do you know she asked finally  about negroes â about educating them  mr taylor over his fish was about to deny all knowledge of any sort on the subject but all at once he recollected his sister and a sudden gleam of light radiated his mental gloom

 have a sister who is â er â devoting herself to teaching them he said

 is that so  cried mrs grey joyfully  where is she  

 in tooms county alabama â in â  mr taylor consulted a remote mental pocket â in miss sarah smiths school

 why how fortunate im so glad i mentioned the matter you see miss smith is a sister of a friend of ours congressman smith of new jersey and she has just written to me for help a very touching letter too about the poor blacks my father set great store by blacks and was a leading abolitionist before he died

mr taylor was thinking fast yes the name of congressman peter smith was quite familiar mr easterly as chairman of the republican state committee of new jersey had been compelled to discipline mr smith pretty severely for certain socialistic votes in the house and consequently his future career was uncertain it was important that such a man should not have too much to do with mrs greys philanthropies â at least in his present position

 should like to have you meet and talk with my sister mrs grey shes a wellesley graduate said taylor finally

mrs grey was delighted it was a combination which she felt she needed here was a collegegirl who could direct her philanthropies and her etiquette during the summer forthwith mary taylor received an intimation from her brother that vast interests depended on her summer vacation

thus it had happened that miss taylor came to lake george for her vacation after the first year at the smith school and she and miss smith had silently agreed as she left that it would be better for her not to return but the gods of lower broadway thought otherwise not that mary taylor did not believe in miss smiths work she was too honest not to believe in education but she was sure that this was not her work and she had not as yet perfected in her own mind any theory of the world into which black folk fitted she was rather taken back therefore to be regarded as an expert on the problem first her brother attacked her not simply on cotton but to her great surprise on negro education and after listening to her halting uncertain remarks he suggested to her certain matters which it would be better for her to believe when mrs grey talked to her

 interested in darkies you see he concluded  and looks to you to tell things better go easy and suggest a waitinggame before she goes in heavy

 but miss smith needs money â  the new england conscience prompted john taylor cut in sharply we all need money and i know people who need mrs greys more than miss smith does at present

miss taylor found the lake george colony charming it was not ultrafashionable but it had wealth and leisure and some breeding especially was this true of a circumscribed rather exclusive set which centred around the vanderpools of new york and boston they or rather mr vanderpools connections were of old dutch new york stock his father it was who had built the lake george cottage

mrs vanderpool was a wells of boston and endured lake george now and then during the summer for her husbands sake although she regarded it all as rather a joke this summer promised to be unusually lonesome for her and she was meditating a retreat to the massachusetts north shore when she chanced to meet mary taylor at a miscellaneous dinner and found her interesting she discovered that this young woman knew things that she could talk books and that she was rather pretty to be sure she knew no people but mrs vanderpool knew enough to even things

 by the bye i met some charming alabama people last winter in montgomery â the cresswells do you know them  she asked one day as they were lounging in wicker chairs on the vanderpool porch then she answered the query herself  no of course you could not it is too bad that your work deprives you of the society of people of your class now my ideal is a set of negro schools where the white teachers could know the cresswells

 why yes â  faltered miss taylor  but â would nt that be difficult  

 why should it be 

 i mean would the cresswells approve of educating negroes 

 oh  educating  the word conceals so much now i take it the cresswells would object to instructing them in french and in dinner etiquette and teagowns and so in fact would i but teach them how to handle a hoe and to sew and cook i have reason to know that people like the cresswells would be delighted

 and with the teachers of it 

why not â provided of course they were â well gentlefolk and associated accordingly

 but one must associate with ones pupils

oh certainly certainly just as one must associate with ones maids and chauffeurs and dressmakers â cordially and kindly but with a difference

but â but dear mrs vanderpool you wouldnt want your children trained that way would you  

 certainly not my dear but these are not my children they are the children of negroes we cant quite forget that can we 

no i suppose not miss taylor admitted a little helplessly  but â it seems to me â thats the modern idea of taking culture to the masses

 frankly then the modem idea is not my idea it is too socialistic and as for culture applied to the masses you utter a paradox the masses and work is the truth one must face

 and culture and work  

 quite incompatible i assure you my dear she stretched her silken limbs lazily while miss taylor sat silently staring at the waters

just then mrs grey drove up in her new red motor

up to the time of mary taylors arrival the acquaintance of the vanderpools and mrs grey had been a matter chiefly of smiling bows after miss taylor came there had been calls and casual intercourse to mrs greys great gratification and mrs vanderpools mingled amusement and annoyance mrs grey announced the arrival of the easterlys and john taylor for the weekend as mrs

vanderpool could think of nothing less boring she consented to dine

the atmosphere of mrs greys ornate cottage was different from that of the vanderpools the display of wealth and splendor had a touch of the barbaric mary taylor liked it although she found the vanderpool atmosphere more subtly satisfying there was a certain grim power beneath the greys mahogany and velvets that thrilled while it appalled precisely that side of the thing appealed to her brother he would have seen little or nothing in the plain elegance yonder while here he saw a japanese vase that cost no cent less than a thousand dollars he meant to be able to duplicate it some day he knew that grey was poor and less knowing than he sixty years ago

the dead millionaire had begun his fortune by buying and selling cotton â travelling in the south in reconstruction times and sending his agents in this way he made his thousands then he took a step forward and instead of following the prices induced the prices to follow him two or three small cotton corners brought him his tens of thousands about this time easterly joined him and pointed out a new road â the buying and selling of stock in various cottonmills and other industrial enterprises grey hesitated but easterly pushed him on and he made his hundreds of thousands then easterly proposed buying controlling interests in certain large mills and gradually consolidating them the plan grew and succeeded and grey made his millions

then grey stopped he had money enough and he would venture no farther he  was going to retire and eat peanuts he said with a chuckle

easterly was disgusted he too had made millions â not as many as grey but a few it was not however simply money that he wanted but power the lust of financial dominion had gripped his soul and he had a vision of a vast trust of cotton manufacturing covering the land he talked this incessantly into grey but grey continued to shake his head the thing was too big for his imagination he was bent on retiring and just as he had set the date a year hence he inadvertently died on the whole mr easterly was glad of his partners definite withdrawal since he left his capital behind him until he found his vast plans about to be circumvented by mrs grey withdrawing this capital from his control  to give it to niggers and chinamen he snorted to john taylor and strode up and down the veranda john taylor removed his coat lighted a black cigar and elevated his heels the ladies were in the parlor where the female easterlys were prostrating themselves before mrs vanderpool

 just what is your plan   asked taylor quite as if he did not know

 why man the transfer of a hundred millions of stock would give me control of the cottonmills of america think of it â the biggest trust next to steel

 why not bigger  asked taylor imperturbably puffing away mr easterly eyed him he had regarded taylor hitherto as a very valuable asset to the business â had relied on his knowledge of routine his judgment and his honesty but he detected tonight a new tone in his clerk something almost authoritative and selfreliant he paused and smiled at him

 bigger 

but john taylor was dead in earnest he did not smile

 first there s england â and all europe why not bring them into the trust 

 possibly later but first america of course i ve got my eyes on the european situation and feelers out but such matters are more difficult and slower of adjustment over there â so damned much law and gospel

 but there s another side

 whats that  

 you are planning to combine and control the manufacture of cotton â 

 yes

 but how about your raw material  the steel trust owns its iron mines

of course â mines could be monopolized and hold the trust up but our raw material is perfectly safe â farms growing smaller farms isolated and we fixing the price it s a cinch

are you sure taylor surveyed him with a narrowed look

 certain

 im not ive been looking up things and there are three points youd better study first cotton farms are not getting smaller theyre getting bigger almighty fast and theres a big cottonland monopoly in sight second the banks and wholesale houses in the south can control the cotton output if they work together third watch the southern  farmers league  of big landlords

mr easterly threw away his cigar and sat down taylor straightened up switched on the porch light and took a bundle of papers from his coat pocket

here are census figures he said commercial reports and letters they pored over them a half hour then easterly arose

 theres something in it he admitted  but what can we do  what do you propose  

 monopolize the growth as well as the manufacture of cotton and use the first to club european manufacturers into submission

easterly stared at him

good lord he ejaculated youre crazy

but taylor smiled a slow thin smile and put away his papers easterly continued to stare at his subordinate with a sort of fascination with the awe that one feels when genius unexpectedly reveals itself from a source hitherto regarded as entirely ordinary at last he drew a long breath remarking indefinitely  i ll think it over

a stir in the parlor indicated departure

 well you watch the farmers league and note its success and methods counselled john taylor his tone and manner unchanged  then figure what it might do in the hands of â let us say friends

 whos running it 

 a colonel cresswell is its head and happens also to be the force behind it aristocratic family â big planter â near where my sister teaches

 hm â well we ll watch him

 and say as easterly was turning away  you know congressman smith

 i should say i did

 well mrs grey seems to be depending on him for advice in distributing some of her charity funds easterly appeared startled

 she is is she  he exclaimed  but here come the ladies he went forward at once but john taylor drew back he noted mrs vanderpool and thought her too thin and pale the dashing young miss easterly was more to his taste he intended to have a wife like that one of these days

 mary said he to his sister as he finally rose to go  tell me about the cresswells

mary explained to him at length the impossibility of her knowing much about the local white aristocracy of tooms county and then told him all she had heard mrs grey talked to you much

 yes

 about darky schools  

 yes

 what does she intend to do  

 i think she will aid miss smith first

 did you suggest anything 

 well i told her what i thought about cooperating with the local white people

 the cresswells 

yes â you see mrs vanderpool knows the cresswells

does eh good say thats a good point you just bear heavy on it â cooperate with the cresswells why yes but â you see john i dont just know whether one could cooperate with the cresswells or not â one hears such contradictory stories of them but there must be some other white people â 

 stuff its the cresswells we want

well mary was very dubious they are â the most important

when she went south late in september mary taylor had two definite but allied objects she was to get all possible business information concerning the cress wells and she was to induce miss smith to prepare for mrs greys benevolence by interesting the local whites in her work the programme attracted miss taylor she felt in touch even if dimly and slightly with great industrial movements and she felt too like a discerning pioneer in philanthropy both roles she liked besides they held each certain promises of social prestige and society miss taylor argued one must have even in alabama

bles alwyn met her at the train he was growing to be a big fine bronze giant and mary was glad to see him she especially tried in the first few weeks of opening school to glean as much information as possible concerning the community and particularly the cresswells she found the negro youth quicker surer and more intelligent in his answers than those she questioned elsewhere and she gained real enjoyment from her long talks with him

isnt bles developing splendidly she said to miss smith one afternoon there was an unmistakable note of enthusiasm in her voice miss smith slowly closed her letterfile but did not look up

 yes she said crisply  hes eighteen now â quite a man

 and most interesting to talk with

 hm â very  â drily mary was busy with her own thoughts and she did not notice the other womans manner

 do you know she pursued  im a little afraid of one thing

 so am i

oh youve noted it too â his friendship for that impossible girl zora 

miss smith gave her a searching look

what of it she demanded

 she is so far beneath him

 how so  

she is a bold godless thing i dont understand her  the two are not quite the same

of course not but she is unnaturally forward

 too bright miss smith amplified

yes she knows quite too much you surely remember that awful scarlet dress well all her clothes have arrived or remained at a simplicity and vividness that is â well â immodest

does she think them immodest

 what she thinks is a problem

 the problem you mean  

 well yes

they paused a moment then miss smith said slowly  what i dont understand i dont judge

 no but you cant always help seeing and meeting it laughed miss taylor

certainly not i dont try i court the meeting and seeing it is the only way

 well perhaps for us â but not for a boy like bles and a girl like zora

true men and women must exercise judgment in their intercourse and  â she glanced sharply at miss taylor â  my dear you yourself must not forget that bles alwyn is a man

far up the road came a low long musical shouting then with creaking and straining of wagons four great black mules dashed into sight with twelve bursting bales of yellowish cotton looming and swaying behind the drivers and helpers were lolling and laughing and singing but miss taylor did not hear nor see she had sat suddenly upright her face had flamed crimson and then went dead white

 miss â miss smith  she gasped overwhelmed with dismay a picture of wounded pride and consternation

miss smith turned around very methodically and took her hand but while she spoke the girl merely stared at her in stony silence

 now dear dont mean more than i do im an old woman and ive seen many things this is but a little corner of the world and yet many people pass here in thirty years the trouble with new teachers who come is that like you they cannot see black folk as human all to them are either impossible zoras or else lovable blessings they forget that zora is not to be annihilated but studied and understood and that bles is a young man of eighteen and not a clod

 but that he should dare â  mary began breathlessly

 he has nt dared miss smith went gently on  no thought of you but as a teacher has yet entered his dear simple head but my point is simply this hes a man and a human one and if you keep on making much over him and talking to him and petting him he ll have the right to interpret your manner in his own wayâ the same that any young man would

 but â but hes a â a â 

a negro to be sure he is and a man in addition now dear dont take this too much to heart this is not a rebuke but a clumsy warning i am simply trying to make clear to you why you should be careful treat poor zora a little more lovingly and bles a little less warmly they are just human â but oh so human

mary taylor rose up stiffly and mumbled a brief goodnight she went to her room and sat down in the dark the mere mention of the thing was to her so preposterous â no loathsome she kept repeating

she slowly undressed in the dark and heard the rumbling of the cotton wagons as they swayed toward town the cry of the naked was sweeping the world and yonder in the night black men were answering the call they knew not what or why they answered but obeyed the irresistible call with hearts light and song upon their lips â the song of service they lashed their mules and drank their whiskey and all night the piled fleece swept by mary taylors window flying â flying to that far cry miss taylor turned uneasily in her bed and jerked the bedclothes about her ears

 mrs vanderpool is right she confided to the night with something of the awe with which one suddenly comprehends a hidden oracle there must be a difference always always  that impudent negro 

all night she dreamed and all day â especially when trim and immaculate she sat in her chair and looked down upon fifty dark faces â and upon zora

zora sat thinking she saw neither miss taylor nor the long straight rows of desks and faces she heard neither the drone of the spellers nor did she hear miss taylor say  zora  she heard and saw none of this she only heard the prattle of the birds in the wood far down where the silver fleece would be planted

for the time of cottonplanting was coming the gray and drizzle of december was past and the hesitation of january already a certain warmth and glow had stolen into the air and the swamp was calling its child with low seductive voice she knew where the first leaves were bursting where tiny flowers nestled and where young living things looked upward to the light and cried and crawled a wistful longing was stealing into her heart she wanted to be free she wanted to run and dance and sing but bles wanted â zora

this time she heard the call but did not heed it miss taylor was very tiresome and was forever doing and saying silly things so zora paid no attention but sat still and thought yes she would show bles the place that very night she had kept it secret from him until now out of perverseness out of her love of mystery and secrets but tonight after school when he met her on the big road with the clothes she would take him and show him the chosen spot

soon she was aware that school had been dismissed and she leisurely gathered up her books and rose mary taylor regarded her in perplexed despair oh these people mrs vanderpool was right culture and â some masses at least â were not to be linked and too culture and work â were they incompatible at any rate culture and this work were

now there was mrs vanderpool â she toiled not neither did she spin and yet if all these folk were like poor stupid docile jennie it would be simpler but what earthly sense was there in trying to do anything with a girl like zora so stupid in some matters so startlingly bright in others and so stubborn in everything here she was doing some work twice as well and twice as fast as the class and other work she would not touch because she  did nt like it her classification in school was nearly as difficult as her classification in the world and miss taylor reached up impatiently and removed the gold pin from her stock to adjust it more comfortably when zora sauntered past unseeing unheeding with that curious gliding walk which miss taylor called stealthy she laid the pin on the desk and on sudden impulse spoke again to the girl as she arranged her neck trimmings

 zora she said evenly  why did nt you come to class when i called 

i didnt hear you said zora looking at her fulleyed and telling the halftruth easily

miss taylor was sure zora was lying and she knew that she had lied to her on other occasions indeed she had found lying customary in this community and she had a new england horror of it she looked at zora disapprovingly while zora looked at her quite impersonally but steadily then miss taylor braced herself mentally and took the war into africa

 do you ever tell lies zora 

 yes

 dont you know that is a wicked bad habit 

 why 

 because god hates them

how does you know he does zoras tone was still impersonal

 he hates all evil

but why is lies evil

 because they make us deceive each other

 is that wrong 

 yes

zora bent forward and looked squarely into miss taylors blue eyes miss taylor looked into the velvet blackness of hers and wondered what they veiled

 is it wrong asked zora  to make believe you likes people when you dont when youse afeared of them and thinks they may rub off and dirty you 

 why â why â yes if you â if you deceive then you lies sometimes dont you

miss taylor stared helplessly at the solemn eyes that seemed to look so deeply into her

perhaps â i do zora im sure i dont mean to and â i hope god will forgive me

zora softened

 oh i reckon he will if he s a good god because hed know that lies like that are heaps better than blabbing the truth right out only she added severely  you mus nt keep saying its wicked to lie cause it aint sometimes i lies she reflected pensively  and sometimes i dont â it depends

miss taylor forgot her collar and fingered the pin on the desk she felt at once a desperate desire to know this girl better and to establish her own authority yet how should she do it she kept toying with the pin and zora watched her then miss taylor said absently  zora what do you propose to do when you grow up 

zora considered

 think and walk â and rest she concluded

i mean what work

work oh i shant work i dont like work â do you  

miss taylor winced wondering if the girl were lying again she said quickly  why yes â that is i like some kinds of work what kinds

but miss taylor refused to have the matter made personal as zora had a disconcerting way of pointing all their discussions

 everybody likes some kinds of work she insisted

 if you likes it it aint work declared zora but mary taylor proceeded around her circumscribed circle  you might make a good cook or a maid

i hate cooking whats a maid

 why a woman who helps others

helps folks that they love id like that

 it is not a question of affection said miss taylor firmly  one is paid for it

 i would nt work for pay

 but you ll have to child you ll have to earn a living

 do you work for pay 

 i work to earn a living

 same thing i reckon and it aint true living just comes free like â like sunshine

 stuff zora your people must learn to work and work steadily and work hard â  she stopped for she was sure zora was not listening the far away look was in her eyes and they were shining she was beautiful as she stood there â strangely almost uncannily but startlingly beautiful with her rich dark skin softly moulded features and wonderful eyes

my people â my people she murmured half to herself do you know my people they dont never work they plays they is all little funny dark people they flies and creeps and crawls slipperylike and they cries and calls ah my people my poor little people they misses me these days because they is shadowy things that sing and smell and bloom in dark and terrible nights â 

miss taylor started up  zora i believe you re crazy  she cried but zora was looking at her calmly again

 wese both crazy aint we  she returned with a simplicity that left the teacher helpless

miss taylor hurried out forgetting her pin zora looked it over leisurely and tried it on she decided that she liked it and putting it in her pocket went out too

school was out but the sun was still high as bles hurried from the barn up the big road beside the soft shadows of the swamp his head was busy with new thoughts and his lips were whistling merrily for today zora was to show him the long dreamed of spot for the planting of the silver fleece he hastened toward the cresswell mansion and glanced anxiously up the road at last he saw her coming swinging down the road lithe and dark with the big white basket of clothes poised on her head

 zora he yodled and she waved her apron

he eased her burden to the ground and they sat down together he nervous and eager she silent passive but her eyes restless bles was full of his plans

 zora he said  we  make it the finest bale ever raised in tooms well just work it to the inch â just love it into life

she considered the matter intently

 but â presently â  how can we sell it without the cresswells knowing 

we wont try well just take it to them and give them half like the other tenants

 but the swamp is mortal thick and hard to clear

 we can do it

zora had sat still listening but now suddenly she leapt to her feet

 come she said  i ll take the clothes home then we ll go  â she glanced at him â  down where the dreams are and laughing they hurried on

elspeth stood in the path that wound down to the cottage and without a word zora dropped the basket at her feet she turned back but bles struck by a thought paused the old woman was short broad black and wrinkled with yellow fangs red hanging lips and wicked eyes she leered at them the boy shrank before it but stood his ground

 aunt elspeth he began  zora and i are going to plant and tend some cotton to pay for her schooling â just the very best cotton we can find â and i heard 

â he hesitated â i heard you had some wonderful seed

 yes she mumbled  ise got the seed â ise got it â wonder seed sowed wid the three spells of obi in the old land ten tousand moons ago but you could nt plant it with a sudden shrillness  it would kill you

but â  bles tried to object but she waved him away

 git the ground â git the ground dig it â pet it and we ll see what we  see and she disappeared

zora was not sure that it had been wise to tell their secret

 i was going to steal the seed she said  i knows where it is and i dont fear conjure

 you must nt steal zora said bles gravely

why zora quickly asked

but before he answered they both forgot for their faces were turned toward the wonder of the swamp the golden sun was pouring floods of glory through the slim black trees and the mystic sombre pools caught and tossed back the glow in darker duller crimson long echoing cries leapt to and fro silent footsteps crept hither and yonder and the girls eyes gleamed with a wild new joy

 the dreams   she cried  the dreams  and leaping ahead she danced along the shadowed path he hastened after her but she flew fast and faster he followed laughing calling pleading he saw her twinkling limbs adancing as once he saw them dance in a halo of firelight but now the fire was the fire of the world her garments twined and flew in shadowy drapings about the perfect moulding of her young and dark halfnaked figure her heavy hair had burst its fastenings and lay in stiffened straggling masses bending reluctantly to the breeze like curled smoke while all about the mad wild singing rose and fell and trembled till his head whirled he paused uncertainly at a parting of the paths crying  zora zora  as for some lost soul  zora zora  echoed the cry faintly

abruptly the music fell there came a long slowgrowing silence and then with a flutter she was beside him again laughing in his ears and crying with mocking voice is you afeared honey

he saw in her eyes sweet yearnings but could speak nothing he could only clasp her hand tightly and again down they raced through the wood

all at once the swamp changed and chilled to a dull grayness tall dull trees started down upon the murky waters and long pendent streamings of mosslike tears dripped from tree to earth slowly and warily they threaded their way

are you sure of the path zora he once inquired anxiously

 i could find it asleep she answered skipping surefooted onward he continued to hold her hand tightly and his own pace never slackened around them the gray and deathlike wilderness darkened they felt and saw the cold white mist rising slowly from the ground and waters growing blacker and broader

at last they came to what seemed the end silently and dismally the halfdead forest with its ghostly moss lowered and darkened and the black waters spread into a great silent lake of slimy ooze the dead trunk of a fallen tree lay straight in front torn and twisted its top hidden yonder and mingled with impenetrable undergrowth

 where now zora  he cried

in a moment she had slipped her hand away and was scrambling upon the tree trunk the waters yawned murkily below

 careful careful  he warned struggling after her until she disappeared amid the leaves he followed eagerly but cautiously and all at once found himself confronting a paradise

before them lay a long island opening to the south on the black lake but sheltered north and east by the dense undergrowth of the black swamp and the rampart of dead and living trees the soil was virgin and black thickly covered over with a tangle of bushes vines and smaller growth all brilliant with early leaves and wild flowers

 a pretty tough proposition for clearing and ploughingsaid bles with practised eye but zora eagerly surveyed the prospect

 its where the dreams lives she whispered

meantime miss taylor had missed her brooch and searched for it in vain in the midst of this pursuit the truth occurred to her â zora had stolen it negroes would steal everybody said well she must and would have the pin and she started for elspeths cabin

on the way she met the old woman in the path but got little satisfaction elspeth merely grunted ungraciously while eying the white woman with suspicion

mary taylor again alone sat down at a turn in the path just out of sight of the house and waited soon she saw with a certain grim satisfaction zora and bles emerging from the swamp engaged in earnest conversation here was an opportunity to overwhelm both with an unforgettable reprimand she rose before them like a spectral vengeance

 zora i want my pin

bles started and stared but zora eyed her calmly with something like disdain

 what pin   she returned unmoved

 zora dont deny that you took my pin from the desk this afternoon the teacher commanded severely

 i did nt say i did nt take no pin

 persons who will lie and steal will do anything

 why should nt people do anything they wants to    and you knew the pin was mine

 i saw you awearing of it admitted zora easily

 then you have stolen it and you are a thief still zora appeared to be unimpressed with the heinousness of her fault

 did you make that pin   she asked

 no but it is mine

 why is it yours  

 because it was given to me

 but you dont need it youve got four other prettier ones â i counted

 that makes no difference

 yes it does â folks aint got no right to things they dont need

 that makes no difference zora and you know it the pin is mine you stole it if you had wanted a pin and asked me i might have given you â 

the girl blazed

 i dont want your old gifts she almost hissed  you dont own what you dont need and cant use god owns it and im going to send it back to him

with a swift motion she whipped the pin from her pocket and raised her arm to hurl it into the swamp bles caught her hand he caught it lightly and smiled sorrowfully into her eyes she wavered a moment then the answering light sprang to her face dropping the brooch into his hand she wheeled and fled toward the cabin

bles handed it silently to miss taylor mary taylor was beside herself with impatient anger â and anger intensified by a conviction of utter helplessness to cope with any strained or unusual situations between herself and these two

 alwyn she said sharply  i shall report zora for stealing and you may report yourself to miss smith tonight for disrespect toward a teacher

the cresswells father and son were at breakfast the daughter was taking her coffee and rolls up stairs in bed

 psh i dont like it  declared harry cresswell tossing the letter back to his father  i tell you it is a damned yankee trick

he was a man of thirtyfive smooth and white slight wellbred and masterful his father st john cresswell was sixty whitehaired mustached and goateed a stately kindly old man with a temper and much family pride

 well well he said his air half preoccupied half unconcerned  i suppose so â and yet  â he read the letter again aloud   approaching you as one of the most influential landowners of alabama on a confidential matter  â hm â hm â  a combination of capital and power such as this nation has never seen  â  cotton manufacturers and cotton growers    well well

of course i suppose theres nothing in it and yet harry my boy this cottongrowing business is getting in a pretty tight pinch unless relief comes somehow â well we ll just have to quit we simply cant keep the cost of cotton down to a remunerative figure with niggers getting scarcer and dearer every year i have to pinch em closer and closer i had to pay maxwell two hundred and fifty to get that old darky and his boys turned over to me and one of the young ones has run away already

harry lighted a cigarette

 we must drive them more you re too easy father they understand that by the way what did that letter say about a  sister  

 says he s got a sister over at the nigger school whom perhaps we know i suppose he thinks we dine there occasionally the old man chuckled  that reminds me elspeth is sending her girl there

 whats that  an angry gleam shot into the younger mans eye

 yes she announced this morning pert as you please that she could nt tote clothes any more â she had to study

damn it this thing is going too far we cant keep a maid or a ploughboy on the place because of this devilish school it s going to ruin the whole labor system we ve been too mild and decent im going to put my foot down right here i ll make elspeth take that girl out of school if i have to horsewhip her and i ll warn the school against further interference with our tenants here in less than a week go two ploughhands â and now this girl

the old man smiled

 you ll hardly miss any work zora does he said

 i ll make her work shes giving herself too many damned airs i know whos back of this â its that nigger we saw talking to the white woman in the field the other day

 well dont work yourself up the wench dont amount to much anyhow by the way though if you do go to the school it wont hurt to see this taylors sister and size the family up

 pshaw im going to give the smith woman such a scare that she ll keep her hands off our niggers and harry cresswell rode away

mary taylor had charge of the office that morning while miss smith shut up in her bedroom went laboriously over her accounts miss mary suddenly sat up threw a hasty glance into the glass and felt the back of her belt it was â it could nt be â surely it was mr harry cresswell riding through the gateway on his beautiful white mare he kicked the gate open rather viciously did not stop to close it and rode straight across the lawn miss taylor noticed his riding breeches and leggings his white linen and white cleancut highbred face such apparitions were few about the country lands she felt inclined to flutter but gripped herself

 goodmorning she said a little stiffly

mr cresswell halted and stared then lifting the hat which he had neglected to remove in crossing the hall he bowed in stately grace miss taylor was no ordinary picture her brown hair was almost golden her dark eyes shone blue her skin was clear and healthy and her white dress â happy coincidence â had been laundered that very morning her halfsuppressed excitement at the sudden duty of welcoming the great aristocrat of the county gave a piquancy to her prettiness

the â devil commented mr harry cresswell to himself but to miss taylor  i beg pardon â er â miss smith  

 no â im sorry miss smith is engaged this morning i am miss taylor

 i cannot share miss taylors sorrow returned mr

cresswell gravely  for i believe i have the honor of some correspondence with miss taylors brother mr cresswell searched for the letter but did not find it

oh has john written you  she beamed suddenly  i m so glad its more than hes done for me this threemonth i beg your pardon â do sit down â i think you ll find this one easier our stock of chairs is limited

it was delightful to have a casual meeting receive this social stamp the girl was all at once transfigured â animated glowing lovely all of which did not escape the callers appraising inspection

 there  said mr cresswell  ive left your gate gaping

 oh dont mind  i hope johns well 

 the truth is confessed cresswell  it was a business matter â cotton you know

john is nothing but cotton i tell him his soul is fibrous

 he mentioned your being here and i thought id drop over and welcome you to the south

 thank you returned miss taylor reddening with pleasure despite herself there was a real sincerity in the tone all this confirmed so many convictions of hers

 of course you know how it is in the south cresswell pursued the opening having been so easily accomplished

 i understand perfectly

 my sister would be delighted to meet you but â 

 oh i realize the â difficulties

 perhaps you would nt mind riding by some day â its embarrassing to suggest this but you know â 

mary taylor was perfectly selfpossessed

 mr cresswell she said seriously  i know very well that it would nt do for your sister to call here and i shant mind a bit coming by to see her first i dont believe in standing on stupid ceremony

cresswell thanked her with quiet cordiality and suggested that when he was driving by he might pick her up in his gig some morning miss taylor expressed her pleasure at the prospect then the talk wandered to general matters â the rain the trees the people round about and inevitably â the negro

 oh by the bye said mr cresswell frowning and hesitating over the recollection of his errands purpose there was one matter â he paused miss taylor leant forward all interest  i hardly know that i ought to mention it but your school â 

this charming young lady disarmed his truculent spirit and the usually collected and determined young man was at a loss how to proceed the girl however was obviously impressed and pleased by his evidence of interest whatever its nature so in a manner vastly different from the one he had intended to assume he continued  there is a way in which we may be of service to you and that is by enlightening you upon points concerning which the nature of your position â both as teacher and socially â must keep you in the dark

 for instance all these negroes are as you know of wretchedly low morals but there are a few so depraved that it would be suicidal to take them into this school we recognize the good you are doing but we do not want it more than offset by utter lack of discrimination in choosing your material

 certainly not â have we â  miss mary faltered this beginning was a bit ominous wholly unexpected

 there is a girl zora who has just entered who â i must speak candidly â who ought not to be here i thought it but right to let you know

 thank you so much i ll tell miss smith mary taylor suddenly felt herself a judge of character  i suspected that she was â not what she ought to be believe me we appreciate your interest

a few more words and mr cresswell after bending courteously over her hand with a deference no new englander had ever shown was riding away on his white mare

for a while mary taylor sat very quietly it was like a breath of air from the real world this hours chat with a wellbred gentleman she wondered how she had done her part â had she been too eager and schoolgirlish had she met this stately ceremony with enough breeding to show that she too was somebody she pounced upon miss smith the minute that lady entered the office

 miss smith who do you think has been here  she burst out enthusiastically

 i saw him on the lawn there was a suspicious lack of warmth in this brief affirmation

 he was so gracious and kindly and he knows my brother and oh miss smith weve got to send that zora right away

 indeed  â the observation was not even interrogatory the preceptress of the struggling school for negro children merely evinced patience for the younger womans fervency

yes he says shes utterly depraved

 said that did he  miss smith watched her with tranquil regard miss taylor paused

 of course we cannot think of keeping her

miss smith pursed her lips offering her first expression of opinion

 i guess we ll worry along with her a little while anyhow she said

the girl stared at miss smith in honest if unpardonable amazement

 do you mean to say that you are going to keep in this school a girl who not only lies and steals but is positively â immoral

miss smith smiled wholly unmoved

 no but i mean that i am here to learn from those whose ideas of right do not agree with mine to discover why they differ and to let them learn of me â so far as i am worthy

mary taylor was not unappreciative of miss smiths stern highmindedness but her heart hardened at this to her misdirected zeal echo of the spirit of an older day miss smith seemed to her to be cramped and paralyzed in an armor of prejudice and sectionalisms plainspeaking was the only course and mary if a little complacent perhaps in her frankness was sincere in her purpose

 i think miss smith you are making a very grave mistake i regard zora as a very undesirable person from every point of view i look upon mr cresswells visit today as almost providential he came offering an olive branch from the white aristocracy to this work to bespeak his appreciation and safeguard the future moreover and miss taylors voice gathered firmness despite miss smiths inscrutable eye  moreover i have reason to know that the disposition â indeed the plan â in certain quarters to help this work materially depends very largely on your willingness to meet the advances of the southern whites half way

she paused for a reply or a question receiving neither she walked with dignity up the stairs from her window she could see cresswells straight shoulders as he rode toward town and beyond him a black speck in the road but she could not see the smile on mr cresswells lips nor did she hear him remark twice with seeming irrelevance the devil 

the rider being closer to it recognized in mary taylors  black speck  bles alwyn walking toward him rapidly with axe and hoe on shoulder whistling merrily they saw each other almost at the same moment and whistle and smile faded mr cress well knew the negro by sight and disliked him he belonged in his mind to that younger class of halfeducated blacks who were impudent and disrespectful toward their superiors not even touching his hat when he met a white man moreover he was sure that it was miss taylor with whom this boy had been talking so long and familiarly in the cottonfield last spring â an offence doubly heinous now that he had seen miss taylor

his first impulse was to halt the negro then and there and tell him a few plain truths but he did not feel quarrelsome at the moment and there was after all nothing very tangible to justify a berating the fellows impudence was sure to increase and then so he merely reined his horse to the better part of the footpath and rode on

bles too was thinking he knew the welldressed man with his milkwhite face and overbearing way he would expect to be greeted with raised hat but bles bit his lips and pulled down his cap firmly the axe too in some indistinct way felt good in his hand he saw the horse coming in his pathway and stepping aside in the dust continued on his way neither looking nor speaking

so they passed each other by mr cresswell to town bles to the swamp apparently ignorant of each others very existence yet as the space widened between them each felt a more vindictive anger for the other

how dares the black puppy to ignore a cresswell on the highway if this went on the day would surely come when negroes felt no respect or fear whatever for whites and then â my god mr cresswell struck his mare a vicious blow and dashed toward town

the black boy too went his way in silent burning rage why should he be elbowed into the roadside dust by an insolent bully why had he not stood his ground pshaw all this fine frenzy was useless and he knew it the sweat oozed on his forehead it was nt man against man or he would have dragged the pale puppy from his horse and rubbed his face in the earth it was nt even one against many else how willingly swinging his axe he would have stood his ground before a mob

no it was one against a world a world of power opinion wealth opportunity and he the one must cringe and bear in silence lest the world crash about the ears of his people he slowly plodded on in bitter silence toward the swamp but the day was balmy the way was beautiful contempt slowly succeeded anger and hope soon triumphed over all for yonder was zora poised waiting and behind her lay the field of dreams

zora looked down upon bles where he stood to his knees in mud the toil was beyond exhilaration â it was sickening weariness and panting despair the great roots twined in one unbroken snarl clung frantically to the black soil the vines and bushes fought back with thorn and bramble zora stood wiping the blood from her hands and staring at bles she saw the long gnarled fingers of the tough little trees and they looked like the fingers of elspeth down there beneath the earth pulling against the boy slowly zora forgot her blood and pain who would win â the witch or jason

bles looked up and saw the bleeding hands with a bound he was beside her

zora the cry seemed wrung from his heart by contrition why had he not known â not seen before  zora come right out of this sit down here and rest she looked at him unwaveringly there was no flinching of her spirit

 i shant do it she said  you se working and ise going to work

 but â zora â you re not used to such work and i am you re tired out

 so is you was her reply

he looked himself over ruefully and dropping his axe sat down beside her on a great log silently they contemplated the land it seemed indeed a hopeless task then they looked at each other in sudden unspoken fear of failure

 if we only had a mule  he sighed immediately her face lighted and her lips parted but she said nothing he presently bounded to his feet

 never mind zora tomorrow is saturday and i ll work all day we just will get it done â sometime his mouth closed with determination

 we wont work any more today then  cried zora her eagerness betraying itself despite her efforts to hide it

 you wont affirmed bles  but i ve got to do just a little â 

but zora was adamant he was tired she was tired they would rest tomorrow with the rising sun they would begin again

 there ll be a bright moon tonight ventured bles

 then i ll come too zora announced positively and he had to promise for her sake to rest

they went up the path together and parted diffidently he watching her flit away with sorrowful eyes a little disturbed and puzzled at the burden he had voluntarily assumed but never dreaming of drawing back

zora did not go far no sooner did she know herself well out of his sight than she dropped lightly down beside the path listening intently until the last echo of his footsteps had died away then leaving the cabin on her right and the scene of their toil on her left she cut straight through the swamp skirted the big road and in a halfhour was in the lower meadows of the cresswell plantations where the tired stock was being turned out to graze for the night here in the shadow of the wood she lingered slowly but with infinite patience she broke one strand after another of the barbedwire fencing watching the while the sun grow great and crimson and die at last in mighty splendor behind the dimmer westward forests

the voices of the hands and hostlers grew fainter and thinner in the distance of purple twilight until the last of them disappeared silence fell deep and soft the silence of a day sinking to sleep not until then did zora steal forth from her hidingplace

she had chosen her mule long before â a big black beast snorting over his pile of cornâ and gliding up to him she gathered his supper into her skirt found a stout halter and fed him sparingy as he followed her quickly she unfastened the pieces of the fence led the animal through and spliced them again and then with foxlike caution she guided her prize through the labyrinthine windings of the swamp it was dark and haunting and ever and again rose lonely night cries the girl trembled a little but plodded resolutely on until the dim silver disk of the halfmoon began to glimmer through the trees then she pressed on more swiftly and fed more scantily until finally with the moonlight pouring over them at the black lagoon zora attempted to drive the animal into the still waters but he gave a loud protesting snort and balked by subtle temptings she gave him to understand that plenty lay beyond the dark waters and quickly swinging herself to his back she started to ride him up and down along the edge of the lagoon petting and whispering to him of good things beyond slowly her eyes grew wide she seemed to be riding out of dreamland on some hobgoblin beast

deeper and deeper they penetrated into the dark waters now they entered the slime now they stumbled on hidden roots but deeper and deeper they waded until at last turning the animals head with a jerk and giving him a sharp stroke of the whip she headed straight for the island a moment the beast snorted and plunged higher and higher the black still waters rose round the girl they crept up her little limbs swirled round her breasts and gleamed green and slimy along her shoulders a wild terror gripped her maybe she was riding the devils horse and these were the yawning gates of hell black and sombre beneath the cold dead radiance of the moon she saw again the gnarled and black and clawlike fingers of elspeth gripping and dragging her down

a scream struggled in her breast her fingers relaxed and the big beast stretching his cramped neck rose in one mighty plunge and planted his feet on the sand of the island

bles hurrying down in the morning with new tools and new determination stopped and stared in blank amazement zora was perched in a tree singing softly and beneath a fat black mule was finishing his breakfast

 zora â  he gasped  how â how did you do it 

she only smiled and sang a happier measure pausing only to whisper  dreams â dreams â its all dreams here i tells you

bles frowned and stood irresolute the song proceeded with less assurance slower and lower till it stopped and the singer dropped to the ground watching him with wide eyes he looked down at her slight tired scratched but undaunted striving blindly toward the light with stanch unfaltering faith a pity surged in his heart he put his arm about her shoulders and murmured  you poor brave child

and she shivered with joy

all day saturday and part of sunday they worked feverishly the trees crashed and the stumps groaned and crept up into the air the brambles blazed and smoked little frightened animals fled for shelter and a wide black patch of rich loam broadened and broadened till it kissed on every side but the sheltered east the black waters of the lagoon late sunday night the mule again swam the slimy lagoon and disappeared toward the cresswell fields then bles sat down beside zora facing the fields and gravely took her hand she looked at him in quick breathless fear

 zora he said  sometimes you tell lies dont you 

yes she said slowly sometimes

 and zora sometimes you steal â you stole the pin from miss taylor and we stole mr cresswells mule for two days

 yes she said faintly with a perplexed wrinkle in her brows  i stole it

 well zora i dont want you ever to tell another lie or ever to take anything that does nt belong to you

she looked at him silently with the shadow of something like terror far back in the depths of her deep eyes

 always â tell â the truth   she repeated slowly

 yes

her fingers worked nervously

all the truth she asked

he thought a while

 no said he finally  it is not necessary always to tell all the truth but never tell anything that is nt the truth

 never 

 never

even if it hurts me

 even if it hurts god is good he will not let it hurt much

 hes a fair god aint he  she mused scanning the evening sky

yes â hes fair he would nt take advantage of a little girl that did wrong when she didnt know it was wrong

her face lightened and she held his hands in both hers and said solemnly as though saying a prayer  i wont lie any more and i wont steal â and â  she looked at him in startled wistfulness â he remembered it in after years but he felt he had preached enough

and now for the seed he interrupted joyously  and then â the silver fleece 

that night for the first time bles entered zoras home it was a single low black room smokeshadowed and dirty with two dingy beds and a gaping fireplace on one side of the fireplace sat the yellow woman young with traces of beauty holding the white child in her arms on the other hugging the blaze huddled a formless heap wreathed in coils of tobacco smoke â elspeth zoras mother

zora said nothing but glided in and stood in the shadows

 goodevening said bles cheerily the woman with the baby alone responded

 i came for the seed you promised us â the cottonseed

the hag wheeled and approached him swiftly grasping his shoulders and twisting her face into his she was a horrible thing â filthy of breath dirty with dribbling mouth and red eyes her few long black teeth hung loosely like tusks and the folds of fat on her chin curled down on her great neck bles shuddered and stepped back

is you afeared honey she whispered

 no he said sturdily

she chuckled drily yes you is â everybodys feared of old elspeth but she wont hurt you â yous got the spell  and wheeling again she was back at the fire

 but the seed   he ventured

she pointed impressively roofward  the dark of the moon boy the dark of the moon â the first dark â at midnight bles could not wring another word from her nor did the ancient witch by word or look again give the slightest indication that she was aware of his presence

with reluctant farewell bles turned home for a space zora watched him and once she started after him but came slowly back and sat by the fireplace

out of the night came voices and laughter and the sound of wheels and galloping horses it was not the soft rollicking laughter of black men but the keener more metallic sound of white mens cries and bles alwyn paused at the edge of the wood looked back and hesitated but decided after a moment to go home and to bed

zora however leapt to her feet and fled into the night while the hag screamed after her and cursed there was tramping of feet on the cabin floor and loud voices and singing and cursing

wheres zora some one yelled with an oath  damn it where is she i have nt seen her for a year you old devil

the hag whimpered and snarled far down in the field of the fleece zora lay curled beneath a tall dark tree asleep all night there was coming and going in the cabin the talk and laughter grew loud and boisterous and the red fire glared in the night

the days flew by and the moon darkened in the swamp the hidden island lay spaded and bedded and bles was throwing up a dyke around the edge zora helped him until he came to the black oak at the western edge it was a large twisted thing with one low flying limb that curled out across another tree and made a mighty seat above the waters

 dont throw the dirt too high there she begged  it ll bring my seat too near the earth

he looked up

 why it s a throne he laughed

 it needs a roof he whimsically told her when his days work was done deftly twisting and intertwining the branches of tree and bush he wove a canopy of living green that shadowed the curious nest and warded it snugly from wind and water

early next morning bles slipped down and improved the nest adding footrests to make the climbing easy peepholes east and west a bit of carpet over the bark and on the rough main trunk a little picture in blue and gold of bougereaus madonna zora sat hidden and alone in silent ecstasy bles peeped in â there was not room to enter the girl was staring silently at the madonna she seemed to feel rather than hear his presence and she inquired softly whos it bles  

 the mother of god he answered reverently

 and why does she hold a lily  

 it stands for purity â she was a good woman

 with a baby zora added slowly

yes â  said bles and then more quickly â it is the christ child â gods baby

 god is the father of all the little babies aint he bles 

 why yes â yes of course only this little baby did nt have any other father

 yes i know one like that she said â and then she added softly  poor little christbaby

bles hesitated and before he found words zora was saying  how white she is shes as white as the lily bles but â im sorry shes white â bles whats purity â just whiteness

bles glanced at her awkwardly but she was still staring wideeyed at the picture and her voice was earnest she was now so old and again so much a child an eager questioning child that there seemed about her innocence something holy

 it means he stammered groping for meanings â it means being good â just as good as a woman knows how

she wheeled quickly toward him and asked him eagerly not better â not better than she knows but just as good in â lying and stealing and â and everything

bles smiled

 no â not better than she knows but just as good

she trembled happily

im â pure she said with a strange little breaking voice and gesture a sob struggled in his throat

 of course you are he whispered tenderly hiding her little hands in his

i â i was so afraid â sometimes â that i was nt she whispered lifting up to him her eyes streaming with tears silently he kissed her lips

from that day on they walked together in a new world no revealing word was spoken no vows were given none asked for but a new bond held them she grew older quieter taller he humbler more tender and reverent as they toiled together

so the days passed the sun burned in the heavens but the silvered glory of the moon grew fainter and fainter and each night it rose later than the night before then one day zora whispered  tonight 

bles came to the cabin and he and zora and elspeth sat silently around the fireplace with its meagre embers the night was balmy and still only occasionally a wandering breeze searching the hidden places of the swamp or the call and song of night birds jarred the stillness long they sat until the silence crept into bless flesh and stretching out his hand he touched zoras clasping it

after a time the old woman rose and hobbled to a big black chest out of it she brought an old bag of cotton seed â not the whitegreen seed which bles had always known but small smooth black seeds which she handled carefully dipping her hands deep down and letting them drop through her gnarled fingers and so again they sat and waited and waited saying no word

not until the stars of midnight had swung to the zenith did they start down through the swamp bles sought to guide the old woman but he found she knew the way better than he did her shadowy figure darting in and out among the trunks till they crossed the tree bridge moved ever noiselessly ahead

she motioned the boy and girl away to the thicket at the edge and stood still and black in the midst of the cleared island bles slipped his arm protectingly around zora glancing fearfully about in the darkness slowly a great cry rose and swept the island it struck madly and sharply and then died away to uneasy murmuring from afar there seemed to come the echo or the answer to the call the form of elspeth blurred the night dimly far off almost disappearing and then growing blacker and larger they heard the whispering  swishswish  of falling seed they felt the heavy tread of a great coming body the form of the old woman suddenly loomed black above them hovering a moment formless and vast then fading again away and the  swishswish  of the falling seed alone rose in the silence of the night

at last all was still a long silence then again the air seemed suddenly filled with that great and awful cry its echoing answer screamed afar and they heard the raucous voice of elspeth beating in their ears  de seed done sowed de seed done sowed 

thinking the matter over said harry cresswell to his father  im inclined to advise drawing this taylor out a little further

the colonel puffed his cigar and one eye twinkled the lid of the other being at the moment suggestively lowered

 was she pretty  he asked but his son ignored the remark and the father continued  i had a telegram from taylor this morning after you left he ll be passing through montgomery the first of next month and proposes calling

 i ll wire him to come said harry promptly

at this juncture the door opened and a young lady entered helen cresswell was twenty small and pretty with a slightly languid air outside herself there was little in which she took very great interest and her interest in herself was not absorbing yet she had a curiously sweet way her servants liked her and the tenants could count on her spasmodic attentions in time of sickness and trouble

 goodmorning she said with a soft drawl she sauntered over to her father kissed him and hung over the back of his chair

did you get that novel for me harry â expectantly regarding her brother

 i forgot it sis but i ll be going to town again soon

the young lady showed that she was annoyed

 by the bye sis there s a young lady over at the negro school whom i think you d like

 black or white   a young lady i said dont be sarcastic

 i heard you i did not know whether you were using our language or others

 shes really unusual and seems to understand things shes planning to call some day â shall you be at home 

 certainly not harry you re crazy and she strolled out to the porch exchanged some remarks with a passing servant and then nestled comfortably into a hammock she helped herself to a chocolate and called out musically  pa are you going to town today 

 yes honey

can i go

 im going in an hour or so and business at the bank will keep me until after lunch

 i dont care i just must go i m clean out of anything to read and i want to shop and call on dollys friend â shes going soon

 all right can you be ready by eleven  

she considered

yes â i reckon she drawled prettily swinging her foot and watching the treetops above the distant swamp harry cresswell left alone rang the bell for the butler  still thinking of going are you sam  asked cresswell carelessly when the servant appeared he was a young lightbrown boy his manner obsequious

 why yes sir â if you can spare me

 spare you you black rascal you re going anyhow well you ll repent it the north is no place for niggers see here i want lunch for two at one oclock the directions that followed were explicit and given with a particularity that made sam wonder  order my trap he finally directed

cresswell went out on the highpillared porch until the trap appeared

 oh harry i wanted to go in the trap â take me  coaxed his sister

 sorry sis but im going the other way

 i dont believe it said miss cresswell easily as she settled down to another chocolate cresswell did not take the trouble to reply

miss taylor was on her morning walk when she saw him spinning down the road and both expressed surprise and pleasure at the meeting

 what a delightful morning  said the schoolteacher and the glow on her face said even more

 im driving round through the old plantation he explained wont you join me

 the invitation is tempting she hesitated  but ive got just oodles of work

what on saturday

 saturday is my really busy day dont you know i guess i could get off really though i suspect i ought to tell miss smith

he looked a little perplexed but the direction in which her inclinations lay was quite clear to him

 it â it would be decidedly the proper thing he murmured  and we could of course invite miss

she saw the difficulty and interrupted him  it s quite unnecessary she ll think i have simply gone for a long walk and soon they were speeding down the silent road breathing the perfume of the pines

now a ride of an early spring morning in alabama over a leisurely old plantation road and behind a spirited horse is an event to be enjoyed add to this a man bred to be agreeable and outdoing his training and a pretty girl gay with newfound companionship â all this is apt to make a morning worth remembering

they turned off the highway and passed through long stretches of ploughed and tumbled fields and other fields brown with the dead ghosts of past years cotton standing straggling and weatherworn long straight or curling rows of ploughers passed by with steaming struggling mules with whips snapping and the yodle of workers or the sharp guttural growl of overseers as a constant accompaniment

 they re beginning to plough up the land for the cottoncrop he explained

 what a wonderful crop it is  mary had fallen pensive

 yes indeed â if only we could get decent returns for it

 why i thought it was a most valuable crop she turned to him inquiringly

 it is â to negroes and manufacturers but not to planters

 but why dont the planters do something 

what can be done with negroes his tone was bitter  we tried to combine against manufacturers in the farmers league of last winter my father was president the pastime cost him fifty thousand dollars

miss taylor was perplexed but eager  you must correspond with my brother mr cresswell she gravely observed  im sure he â  before she could finish an overseer rode up he began talking abruptly with a quick sideglance at mary in which she might have caught a gleam of surprised curiosity

 that old nigger jim sykes over on the lower place sir aint showed up again this morning

cresswell nodded  i ll drive by and see he said carelessly

the old man was discovered sitting before his cabin with his head in his hands he was tall black and gaunt partly bald with tufted hair one leg was swathed in rags and his eyes as he raised them wore a cowed and furtive look

well uncle jim why arent you at work called cresswell from the roadside the old man rose painfully to his feet swayed against the cabin and clutched off his cap

 its my leg again master harry â the leg what i hurt in the gin last fall he answered uneasily

cresswell frowned  its probably whiskey he assured his companion in an undertone then to the man you must get to the field tomorrowâhis habitually calm unfeeling positiveness left no ground for objection i cannot support you in idleness you know

 yes master harry the other returned with conciliatory eagerness  i knows that â i knows it and i aint shirking but master harry they aint doing me right bout my cabin â i just wants to show you he got out some dirty papers and started to hobble forward wincing with pain mary taylor stirred in her seat under an involuntary impulse to help but cresswell touched the horse

all right uncle jim he said well look it over tomorrow

they turned presently to where they could see the cresswell oaks waving lazily in the sunlight and the white gleam of the pillared  big house

a pause at the cresswell store where mr cresswell entered afforded mary taylor an opportunity further to extend her fund of information

 do you go to school  she inquired of the black boy who held the horse her mien sympathetic and interested

 no maam he mumbled

 whats your name 

 buddy â ise one of aunt rachels chilluns

 and where do you live buddy  

 i lives with granny on de upper place

 well i ll see aunt rachel and ask her to send you to school

 wont do no good â she done ast and mr cresswell he say he aint going to have no more of his niggers â

but mr cresswell came out just then and with him a big fat and greasy black man with little eyes and soft wheedling voice he was following cresswell at the side but just a little behind hat in hand head aslant and talking deferentially cresswell strode carelessly on answering him with goodnatured tolerance

the black man stopped with humility before the trap and swept a profound obeisance cresswell glanced up quizzically at miss taylor

 this he announced  is jones the baptist preacher â begging

 ah lady â in mellow unctuous tones â i dont know what we poor black folks would do without mr

cresswell â the lord bless him said the minister shoving his hand far down into his pocket

shortly afterward they were approaching the cresswell mansion when the young man reined in the horse

 if you would nt mind he suggested  i could introduce my sister to you

 i should be delighted answered miss taylor readily

when they rolled up to the homestead under its famous oaks the hour was past one the house was a white oblong building of two stories in front was the high pillared porch semicircular extending to the roof with a balcony in the second story on the right was a broad verandah looking toward a wide lawn with the main road and the red swamp in the distance

the butler met them all obeisance

 ask miss helen to come down said mr cresswell

sam glanced at him

 miss helen will be dreadful sorry but she and the colonel have just gone to town â i believe her aunty aint well

mr cresswell looked annoyed

 well well thats too bad he said  but at any rate have a seat a moment out here on the verandah miss taylor and sam cant you find us a sandwich and something cool i could not be so inhospitable as to send you away hungry at this time of day

miss taylor sat down in a comfortable low chair facing the refreshing breeze and feasted her eyes on the scene oh this was life a smooth green lawn and beds of flowers a vista of brown fields and the dark line of wood beyond the deft quiet butler brought out a little table spread with the whitest of cloths and laid with the brightest of silver and  found  a dainty lunch there was a bit of fried chicken breast some crisp bacon browned potatoes little round beaten biscuit and rosecolored sherbet with a whiff of wine in it miss taylor wondered a little at the bounty of southern hospitality but she was hungry and she ate heartily then leaned back dreamily and listened to mr cresswells smooth southern rs adding a word here and there that kept the conversation going and brought a grave smile to his pale lips at last with a sigh she arose to her feet

 i must go what shall i tell miss smith no no â no carriage i must walk of course however she could not refuse to let him go at least halfway ostensibly to tell her of the coming of her brother he expressed again his disappointment at his sisters absence

somewhat to miss taylors surprise miss smith said nothing until they were parting for the night then she asked was miss cresswell at home

mary reddened

 she had been called suddenly to town

 well my dear i would nt do it again

the girl was angry

 im not a schoolgirl but a grown woman and capable of caring for myself moreover in matter of propriety i do not think you have usually found my ideas too lax â rather the opposite

 there there dear dont be angry only i think if your brother knew â 

 he will know in a very few weeks he is coming to visit the cresswells and miss taylor sailed triumphantly up the stairs

but john taylor was not the man to wait weeks when a purpose could be accomplished in days or hours no sooner was harry cresswells telegram at hand than he hastened back from savannah struck across country and the week after his sisters ride found him striding up the carriageway of the cresswell home

john taylor had prospered since summer the cotton manufacturers combine was all but a fact mr easterly had discovered that his chief clerks sense and executive ability were invaluable and john taylor was slated for a salary in five figures when things should be finally settled not to mention a generous slice of stock â watery at present but warranted to ripen early

while mr easterly still regarded taylors larger trust as chimerical some occurrences of the fall made him take a respectful attitude toward it just as the final clauses of the combine agreement were to be signed there appeared a shortage in the cottoncrop and prices began to soar the cause was obviously the unexpected success of the new farmers league among the cottongrowers mr easterly found it comparatively easy to overthrow the corner but the flurry made some of the manufacturers timid and the trust agreement was postponed until a year later this experience and the persistence of mr taylor induced mr easterly to take a step toward the larger project he let in some eager outside capital to the safer manufacturing scheme and withdrew a corresponding amount of mrs greys money this he put into john taylors hands to invest in the south in bank stock and industries with the idea of playing a part in the financial situation there

 its a risk taylor of course and we ll let the old lady take the risk at the worst its safer than the damned foolishness she has in mind

so it happened that john taylor went south to look after large investments and as mr easterly expressed it  to bring back facts not dreams his investment matters went quickly and well and now he turned to his wider and bigger scheme he wrote the cresswells tentatively expecting no reply or an evasive one planning to circle around them drawing his nets closer and trying them again later to his surprise they responded quickly

 humph hard pressed he decided and hurried to them

so it was the week after mary taylors ride that found him at cresswells front door thin eagleeyed fairly well dressed and radiating confidence

 john taylor he announced to sam jerkily thrusting out a card want to see mr cresswell soon as possible

sam made him wait a halfhour for the sake of discipline and then brought father and son

 goodmorning mr cresswell and mr cresswell again said mr taylor helping himself to a straightbacked chair  hope you ll pardon this unexpected visit found myself called through montgomery just after i got your wire thought id better drop over

at harrys suggestion they moved to the verandah and sat down over whiskey and soda which taylor refused and plunged into the subject without preliminaries

 im assuming that you gentlemen are in the cotton business for making money so am i i see a way in which you and your friends can help me and mine and clear up more millions than all of us can spend for this reason ive hunted you up this is my scheme

 see here there are a thousand cottonmills in this country half of them in the south onefourth in new england and onefourth in the middle states they are capitalized at six hundred million dollars now let me tell you we control three hundred and fifty millions of that capitalization the trust is going through capitalization at a billion the only thing that threatens it is childlabor legislation in the south the tariff and the control of the supply of cotton pretty big hindrances you say thats so but look here weve got the stock so placed that nothing short of a popular upheaval can send any child labor bill through congress in six years see after that we dont care same thing applies to the tariff the last bill ran ten years the present bill will last longer or i lose my guess â specially if smith is in the senate

 well then there remains raw cotton the connection of cottonraising and its raw material is too close to risk a manufacturing trust that does not include practical control of the raw material for that reason we re planning a trust to include the raising and manufacturing of cotton in america then too cornering the cotton market here means the whiphand of the industrial world gentlemen its the biggest idea of the century it beats steel

colonel cresswell chuckled

 how do you spell that  he asked

but john taylor was not to be diverted his thin face was pale but his gray eyes burned with the fire of a zealot harry cresswell only smiled dimly and looked interested

 now again continued john taylor  there are a million cotton farms in the south half run by colored people and half by whites leave the colored out of account as long as they are disfranchised the half million white farms are owned or controlled by five thousand wholesale merchants and three thousand big landowners of whom you colonel cresswell are among the biggest with your fifty thousand acres ten banks control these eight thousand people â one of these is the jefferson national of montgomery of which you are a silent director

colonel cresswell started this man evidently had inside information did he know of the mortgage too

 dont be alarmed im safe taylor assured him  now then if we can get the banks wholesale merchants and biggest planters into line we can control the cotton crop

 but objected harry cresswell  while the banks and the large merchants may be possibilities do you know what it means to try to get planters into line 

 yes i do and what i dont know you and your father do colonel cresswell is president of the farmers league thats the reason im here your success last year made you indispensable to our plans

our success laughed colonel cresswell ruefully thinking of the fifty thousand dollars lost and the mortgage to cover it

yes sir â success you didnt know it we were too careful to allow that and i say frankly you would nt know it now if we were nt convinced you were too far involved and the league too discouraged to repeat the dose

 now look here sir began colonel cresswell flushing and drawing himself erect

 there there colonel cresswell dont misunderstand me im a plain man im playing a big game â a tremendous one i need you and i know you need me i find otft about you and my sources of knowledge are wide and unerring but the knowledge is safe sir its buried last year when you people curtailed cotton acreage and warehoused a big chunk of the crop you gave the mill men the scare of their lives we had a hasty conference and the result was that the bottom fell out of your credit

colonel cresswell grew pale there was a disquieting relentless element in this unimpassioned mans tone

 you failed pursued john taylor  because you could nt get the banks and the big merchants behind you we ve got em behind us â with big chunks of stock and a signed ironclad agreement you can wheel the planters into line â will you do it  john taylor bent forward tense but cool and steellike harry cresswell laid his hand on his fathers arm and said quietly  and where do we come in 

thats business affirmed john taylor you and two hundred and fifty of the biggest planters come in on the groundfloor of the twobilliondollar allcotton combine it can easily mean two million to you in five years

 and the other planters  

 they come in for highpriced cotton until we get our grip

 and then  

the quiet question seemed to invoke a vision for john taylor the gray eyes took on the faraway look of a seer the thin bloodless lips formed a smile in which there was nothing pleasant

 they keep their mouths shut or we squeeze em and buy the land we propose to own the cotton belt of the south

colonel cresswell started indignantly from his seat

 do you think â by god sir â that i d betray southern gentlemen to â 

but harrys hand and impassive manner restrained him he cooled as suddenly as he had flared up

 thank you very much mr taylor he concluded  we ll consider this matter carefully you ll spend the night of course

 cant possibly â must catch that next train back

 but we must talk further the colonel insisted  and then theres your sister

by jove forgot all about mary john taylor after a little desultory talk followed his host upstairs

the next afternoon john taylor was sitting beside helen cresswell on the porch which overlooked the terrace and was on the whole thinking less of cotton than he had for several years to be sure he was talking cotton but he was doing it mechanically and from long habit and was really thinking how charming a girl helen cresswell was she fascinated him for his sister taylor had a feeling of superiority that was almost contempt the idea of a woman trying to understand and argue about things men knew he admired the dashing and handsome miss easterly but she scared him and made him angrily awkward this girl on the other hand just lounged and listened with an amused smile or asked the most childlike questions she required him to wait on her quite as a matter of course â to adjust her pillows hand her the bonbons and hunt for her lost fan mr taylor who had not waited on anybody since his mother died and not much before found a quite inexplicable pleasure in these little domesticities several times he took out his watch and frowned yet he managed to stay with her quite happily

on her part miss cresswell was vastly amused her acquaintance with men was not wide but it was thorough so far as her own class was concerned they were all welldressed and leisurely fairly good looking and they said the same words and did the same things in the same way they paid her compliments which she did not believe and they did not expect her to believe they were charmingly deferential in the matter of dropped handkerchiefs but tyrannical of opinion they were thoughtful about candy and flowers but thoughtless about feelings and income altogether they were delightful but cloying this man was startlingly different ungainly and always in a desperate unaccountable hurry he knew no pretty speeches he certainly did not measure up to her standard of breeding and yet somehow he was a gentleman all this was new to helen cresswell and she liked it

meantime the men abovestairs lingered in the colonels office â the older one perturbed and sputtering the younger insistent and imperturbable

 the fact is father he was saying  as you yourself have said one bad crop of cotton would almost ruin us

 but the prospects are good

what are prospects in march no father this is the situation â three good crops in succession will wipe off our indebtedness and leave us facing only low prices and a scarcity of niggers on the other hand â  the father interrupted impatiently

 yes on the other hand if we plunge deeper in debt and betray our friends we may come out millionaires or â paupers

 precisely said harry cresswell calmly  now our plan is to take no chances i propose going north and looking into this matter thoroughly if he represents money and has money and if the trust has really got the grip he says it has why it s a case of crush or get crushed and we ll have to join them on their own terms if hes bluffing or the thing looks weak we ll wait

it all ended as matters usually did end in harrys having his way he came downstairs expecting indeed rather hoping to find taylor impatiently striding to and fro watch in hand but here he was ungainly it might be but quite docile drawing the picture of a powerloom for miss cresswell who seemed really interested harry silently surveyed them from the door and his face lighted with a new thought

taylor espying him leapt to his feet and hauled out his watch

well â i â  he began lamely

 no you were nt either interrupted harry with a laugh that was unmistakably cordial and friendly  you had quite forgotten what you were waiting for â is nt that so sis 

helen regarded her brother through her veiling lashes what meant this sudden assumption of warmth and amiability 

no indeed he was raging with impatience she returned

why miss cresswell i â i â  john taylor forsook social amenities and pulled himself together well shortly now for that talkâready and quite forgetting miss cresswell he bolted into the parlor

 the decision we have come to is this said harry cresswell  we are in debt as you know

 fortynine thousand seven hundred and fortytwo dollars and twelve cents responded taylor  in three notes due in twelve twentyfour and thirtysix months interest at eight per cent held by â 

the colonel snorted his amazement and harry cresswell cut in  yes he calmly admitted  and with good crops for three years wed be all right good crops even for two years would leave us fairly well off

 you mean it would relieve you of the present stringency and put you face to face with the falling price of cotton and rising wages was john taylors dry addendum

 rising price of cotton you mean harry corrected  oh temporarily john taylor admitted

 precisely and thus postpone the decision

 no mr cresswell im offering to let you in on the ground floor â now â not next year or year after

 mr taylor have you any money in this  

 everything ive got

 well the thing is this way if you can prove to us that conditions are as you say we re in for it

 good meet me in new york say â lets see this is march tenth â well may third

young cresswell was thinking rapidly this man without doubt represented money he was anxious for an alliance why was it all straight or did the whole move conceal a trick

his eyes strayed to the porch where his pretty sister sat languidly and then toward the school where the other sister lived john taylor looked out on the porch too they glanced quickly at each other and each wondered if the other had shared his thought harry cresswell did not voice his mind for he was not wholly disposed to welcome what was there but he could not refrain from saying in tones almost confidential you could recommend this deal then could you â to your own friends 

 to my own family asserted john taylor looking at harry cresswell with sudden interest but mr cresswell was staring at the end of his cigar

zora observed miss smith  its a great blessing not to need spectacles is nt it 

zora thought that it was but she was wondering just what spectacles had to do with the complaint she had brought to the office from miss taylor

 im always losing my glasses and they get dirty and â oh dear now where is that paper

zora pointed silently to the complaint

 no not that â another paper it must be in my room dont you want to come up and help me look   they went up to the clean bare room with its white iron bed its cool spotless shades and shining windows zora walked about softly and looked while miss smith quietly searched on desk and bureau paying no attention to the girl for the time being she was silent

 i sometimes wish she began at length  i had a brighteyed girl like you to help me find and place things

zora made no comment

sometimes bles helps me added miss smith guilefully

zora looked sharply at her  could i help   she asked almost timidly

 why i dont know â the answer was deliberate  there are one or two little things perhaps â 

placing a hand gently upon zoras shoulder she pointed out a few odd tasks and left the girl busily doing them then she returned to the office and threw miss taylors complaint into the wastebasket

for a week or more zora slipped in every day and performed the little tasks that miss smith laid out she sorted papers dusted the bureau hung a curtain she did not do the things very well and she broke some china but she worked earnestly and quickly and there was no thought of pay then too did not bles praise her with a happy smile as together day after day they stood and watched the black dirt where the silver fleece lay planted she dreamed and sang over that dark field and again and again appealed to him  spose it should nt come up after all  and he would laugh and say that of course it would come up

one day when zora was helping miss smith in the bedroom she paused with her arms full of clothes fresh from the laundry

 where shall i put these 

miss smith looked around  they might go in there she said pointing to a door zora opened it a tiny bedroom was disclosed with one broad window looking toward the swamp white curtains adorned it and white hangings draped the plain bureau and washstand and the little bed there was a study table and a small bookshelf holding a few books all simple and clean zora paused uncertainly and surveyed the room

 sometimes when you re tired and want to be alone you can come up here zora said miss smith carelessly  no one uses this room

zora caught her breath sharply but said nothing the next day miss smith said to her when she came in  i m busy now dear but you go up to your little room and read and i ll call

zora quietly obeyed an hour later miss smith looked in then she closed the door lightly and left another hour flew by before zora hurried down

 i was reading and i forgot she said

 its all right returned miss smith  i did nt need you and any day after you get all your lessons i think miss taylor will excuse you and let you go to your room and read miss taylor it transpired was more than glad

day after day bles and zora visited the field but ever the ground lay an unrelieved black beneath the bright sun and they would go reluctantly home again today there was much work to be done and zora labored steadily and eagerly never pausing and gaining in deftness and care

in the afternoon bles went to town with the school wagon a light shower flew up from the south lingered a while and fled leaving a fragrance in the air for a moment zora paused and her nostrils quivered then without a word she slipped downstairs glided into the swamp and sped away to the island she swung across the tree and a low delighted cry bubbled on her lips all the rich black ground was sprinkled with tender green she bent above the verdant tenderness and kissed it then she rushed back bursting into the room

 it s come its come â the silver fleece 

miss smith was startled

 the silver fleece  she echoed in bewilderment

zora hesitated it came over her all at once that this one great allabsorbing thing meant nothing to the gaunt tiredlooking woman before her

 would bles care if i told  she asked doubtfully

 no miss smith ventured

and then the girl crouched at her feet and told the dream and the story many factors were involved that were quite foreign to the older womans nature and training the recital brought to her new england mind many questions of policy and propriety and yet as she looked down upon the dark face hot with enthusiasm it all seemed somehow more than right slowly and lightly miss smith slipped her arm about zora and nodded and smiled a perfect understanding they looked out together into the darkening twilight

 it is so late and wet and you re tired tonight â dont you think youd better sleep in your little room  

zora sat still she thought of the noisy flaming cabin and the dark swamp but a contrasting thought of the white bed made her timid and slowly she shook her head nevertheless miss smith led her to the room

 here are things for you to wear she pointed out opening the bureau  and here is the bathroom she left the girl standing in the middle of the floor

in time zora came to stay often at miss smiths cottage and to learn new and unknown ways of living and dressing she still refused to board for that would cost more than she could pay yet and she would accept no charity gradually an undemonstrative friendship sprang up between the pale old grayhaired teacher and the dark young blackhaired girl delicately too but gradually the companionship of bles and zora was guided and regulated of mornings zora would hurry through her lessons and get excused to fly to the swamp to work and dream alone at noon bles would run down and they would linger until he must hurry back to dinner after school he would go again working while she was busy in miss smiths office and returning later would linger awhile to tell zora of his day while she busied herself with her little tasks saturday mornings they would go to the swamp and work together and sometimes miss smith stealing away from curious eyes would come and sit and talk with them as they toiled

in those days for these two souls earth came very near to heaven both were in the midst of that mighty change from youth to womanhood and manhood their manner toward each other by degrees grew shyer and more thoughtful there was less of comradeship but the little meant more the rough good fellowship was silently put aside they no longer lightly clasped hands and each at times wondered in painful selfconsciousness if the other cared

then began too that long and subtle change wherein a soul until now unmindful of its wrappings comes suddenly to consciousness of body and clothes when it gropes and tries to adjust one with the other and through them to give to the inner deeper self finer and fuller expression one saw it easily almost suddenly in alwyns sunday suit vivid neckties and awkward fads

slower subtler but more striking was the change in zora as she began to earn bits of pin money in the office and to learn to sew dresses hung straighter belts served a better purpose stockings were smoother underwear was daintier then her hair â that great dark mass of immovable infinitely curled hair â began to be subdued and twisted and combed until with steady pains and study it lay in thick twisted braids about her velvet forehead like some shadowed halo all this came much more slowly and spasmodically than one tells it few noticed the change much none noticed all and yet there came a night â a students social â when with a certain suddenness the whole school teachers and pupils realized the newness of the girl and even bles was startled

he had bought her in town at christmas time a pair of white satin slippers partly to test the smallness of her feet on which in younger days he had rallied her and partly because she had mentioned a possible white dress they were a cheap plain pair but dainty and they fitted well

when the evening came and the students were marching and the teachers save miss smith were sitting rather primly apart and commenting she entered the room she was a little late and a hush greeted her one boy with the inimitable drawl of the race pushed back his icecream and addressed it with a mournful headshake  go way honey yo los yo tase 

the dress was plain and fitted every curving of a healthy girlish form she paused a moment whitebodied and whitelimbed but dark and velvetarmed her full neck and oval head rising rich and almost black above with its deeplighted eyes and crown of silent darkling hair

to some such a revelation of grace and womanliness in this hoyden the gentle swelling of lankness to beauty of lowliness to shy selfpoise was a sudden joy to others a mere blindness mary taylor was perplexed and in some indefinite way amazed and many of the other teachers saw no beauty only a strangeness that brought a smile they were such as know beauty by convention only and find it lipringed hoopskirted tattooed or corsetted as time and place decree

the change in zorn however had been neither cataclysmic nor revolutionary and it was yet far â very far â from complete she still ran and romped in the woods and dreamed her dreams she still was passionately independent and  queer tendencies merely had become manifest some dominant she would unhindered develop to a brilliant sumptuous womanhood proud conquering fullblooded and deep bosomed â a passionate mother of men herein lay all her early wildness and strangeness herein lay as yet half hidden dimly sensed and all unspoken the power of a mighty allcompelling love for one human soul and through it for all the souls of men all this lay growing and developing but as yet she was still a girl with a new shyness and comeliness and a bold searching heart

in the field of the silver fleece all her possibilities were beginning to find expression these newborn green things hidden far down in the swamp begotten in want and mystery were to her a living wonderful fairy tale come true all the latent mother in her brooded over them all her brilliant fancy w tove itself about them they were her dreamchildren and she tended them jealously  they were her hope and she worshipped them when the rabbits tried the tender plants she watched hours to drive them off and catching now and then a pulsing pinkeyed invader she talked to it earnestly  brer rabbit â poor little brer rabbit dont you know you must nt eat zoras cotton naughty naughty brer rabbit and then she would show it where she had gathered piles of fragrant weeds for it and its fellows

the golden green of the first leaves darkened and the plants sprang forward steadily never before was such a magnificent beginning a full month ahead of other cotton the rain swept down in laughing bubbling showers and laved their thirsty souls and zora held her beating breast day by day lest it rain too long or too heavily the sun burned fiercely upon the young cotton plants as the spring hastened and they lifted their heads in darker wilder luxuriance for the time of hoeing was at hand

these days were days of alternate hope and doubt with bles alwyn strength and ambition and inarticulate love were fighting within him he felt in the dark thousands of his kind about him a mighty calling to deeds he was becoming conscious of the narrowness and straightness of his black world and red anger flashed in him ever and again as he felt his bonds his mental horizon was broadening as he prepared for the college of next year he was faintly grasping the wider fuller world and its thoughts and aspirations

but beside and around and above all this like subtle permeating ether was â zora his feelings for her were not as yet definite expressed or grasped they were rather the atmosphere in which all things occurred and were felt and judged from an amusing pastime she had come to be a companion and thoughtmate and now beyond this insensibly they were drifting to a silenter mightier mingling of souls but drifting merely â not arrived going gently irresistibly but not yet at the realized goal

he felt all this as the stirring of a mighty force but knew not what he felt the teasing of his fellows the common lovegossip of the school yard seemed far different fromhis plight he laughed at it and indignantly denied it yet he was uncomfortable restless unhappy he fancied zora cared less for his company and he gave her less and then was puzzled to find time hanging so empty so wretchedly empty on his hands when they were together in these days they found less to talk about and had it not been for the silver fleece which in magic wilfulness opened both their mouths they would have found their companionship little more than a series of awkward silences yet in their silences their walks and their sittings there was a companionship a glow a satisfaction as came to them nowhere else on earth and they wondered at it

they were both wondering at it this morning as they watched their cotton it had seemingly bounded forward in a night and it must be hoed forthwith yet hoeing was murder â the ruthless cutting away of tenderer plants that the sturdier might thrive the more and grow

 i hate it bles dont you  

 hate what 

 killing any of it its all so pretty

 but it must be so that whats left will be prettier or at least more useful

 but it should nt be so everything ought to have a chance to be beautiful and useful

 perhaps it ought to be so admitted bles  but it is nt

 is nt it so â anywhere 

 i reckon not death and pain pay for all good things

she hoed away silently hesitating over the choice of the plants pondering this worldold truth saddened by its ruthless cruelty

 death and pain she murmured u what a price 

bles leaned on his hoe and considered it had not occurred to him till now that zora was speaking better and better english the idioms and errors were dropping away they had not utterly departed however but came crowding back in moments of excitement at other times she clothed miss smiths clearcut correct speech in softer southern accents she was drifting away from him in some intangible way to an upper world of dress and language and deportment and the new thought was pain to him

so it was that the fleece rose and spread and grew to its wonderful flowering and so these two children grew with it into theirs zora never forgot how they found the first white flower in that green and billowing sea nor her low cry of pleasure and his gay shout of joy slowly wonderfully the flowers spread â white blue and purple bells hiding timidly blazing luxuriantly amid the velvet leaves until one day â it was after a southern rain and the sunlight was twinkling through the morning â all the fleece was in flower â a mighty swaying sea darkling rich and waving and upon it flecks and stars of white and purple foam the joy of the two so madly craved expression that they burst into singing not the wild light song of dancing feet but a low sweet melody of her fathers fathers whereunto alwyns own deep voice fell fitly in minor cadence

miss smith and miss taylor who were sorting the mail heard them singing as they came up out of the swamp miss taylor looked at them then at miss smith

but miss smith sat white and rigid with the first opened letter in her hand

miss smith sat with her face buried in her hands while the tears trickled silently through her thin fingers before her lay the letter read a dozen times  old mrs gray has been to see me and she has announced her intention of endowing five colored schools yours being one she asked if  would do it she has plenty of money so i told her  would be better â  apiece shes arranging for a board of trust etc you ll probably hear from her soon you ve been so worried about expenses that i thought id send this word on i knew youd be glad

glad dear god how flat the word fell for thirty years she had sown the seed planting her lifeblood in this work that had become the marrow of her soul

successful no it had not been successful but it had been human through yonder doorway had trooped an army of hundreds upon hundreds of bright and dull light and dark eager and sullen faces there had been good and bad honest and deceptive frank and furtive some had caught kindled and flashed to ambition and achievement  some glowing dimly had plodded on in slow dumb faithful work worth while and yet others had suddenly exploded hurtling human fragments to heaven and to hell around this school home as around the centre of some little universe had whirled the sorrowful sordid laughing pulsing drama of a world birth pains and the stupor of death hunger and pale murder the riot of thirst and the orgies of such red and black cabins as elspeths crouching in the swamp

she groaned as she read of the extravagances of the world and saw her own vanishing revenues but the funds continued to dwindle until sarah smith asked herself what will become of this school when i die with trembling fingers she had sat down to figure how many teachers must be dropped next year when her brothers letter came and she slipped to her knees and prayed

mrs greys decision was due in no little way to mary taylors reports slowly but surely the girl had begun to think that she had found herself in this new world she would never be attuned to it thoroughly for she was set for different music the veil of color and race still hung thickly between her and her pupils and yet she seemed to see some points of penetration no one could meet daily a hundred or more of these lighthearted goodnatured children without feeling drawn to them no one could cross the thresholds of the cabins and not see the old and wellknown problems of life and striving more and more therefore the work met miss taylors approval and she told mrs grey so

at the same time mary taylor had come to some other definite conclusions she believed it wrong to encourage the ambitions of these children to any great extent she believed they should be servants and farmers content to work undr present conditions until those conditions could be changed and she believed that the local white aristocracy helped by northern philanthropy should take charge of such gradual changes

these conclusions she did not pretend to have originated but she adopted them from reading and conversation after hesitating for a year before such puzzling contradictions as bles alwyn and harry cresswell for her to conclude to treat bles alwyn as a man despite his color was as impossible as to think mr cresswell a criminal some compromise was imperative which would save her the pleasure of mr cresswells company and at the same time leave open a way of fulfilling the worlds duty to this black boy she thought she had found this compromise and she wrote mrs grey suggesting a chain of endowed negro schools under the management of trustees composed of northern business men and local southern whites mrs grey acquiesced gladly and announced her plan eventually writing miss smith of her decision  to second her noble efforts in helping the poor colored people and she hoped to have the plan under way before next fall

the sharpness of miss smiths joy did not let her dwell on the proposed  board of trust  of course it would be a board of friends of the school

she sat in her office looking out across the land school had closed for the year and bles with the carryall was just taking miss taylor to the train with her trunk and bags far up the road she could see dotted here and there the little dirty cabins of cresswells tenants â the cresswell domain that lay like a mighty hand around the school ready at a word to squeeze its life out only yonder to the eastward lay the way out the five hundred acres of the tolliver plantation which the school needed so sadly for its farm and community but the owner was a hard and ignorant white man hating  niggers  only a shade more than he hated white aristocrats of the cresswell type he had sold the school its first land to pique the cresswells but he would not sell any more she was sure even now when the promise of wealth faced the school

she lay back and closed her eyes and fell lightly asleep as she slept an old woman came toiling up the hill northward from the school and out of the eastward spur of the cresswell barony she was fat and black hooded and aproned with great round head and massive bosom her face was dull and heavy and homely her old eyes sorrowful she moved swiftly carrying a basket on her arm opposite her to the southward but too far for sight an old man came out of the lower cresswell place skirting the swamp he was tall black and gaunt part bald with tufted hair and a cowed and furtive look was in his eyes one leg was crippled and he hobbled painfully

up the road to the eastward that ran past the school with the morning sun at his back strode a young man yellow crisphaired strongfaced with darkly knit brows he greeted bles and the teacher coldly and moved on in nervous haste a woman hurrying out of the westward swamp up the path that led from elspeths saw him and shrank back hastily she turned quickly into the swamp and waited looking toward the school the old woman hurried into the back gate just as the old man appeared to the southward on the road the young man greeted him cordially and they stopped a moment to talk while the hiding woman watched

 howdy uncle jim

howdy son hits hot aint it how is you

tolerable how are you

 poorly son poorly â and worser in mind ise goin up to talk to old miss

 so am i but i just see aunt rachel going in wed better wait

miss smith started up at the timid knocking and rubbed her eyes it was long since she had slept in the daytime and she was annoyed at such laziness she opened the back door and led the old woman to the office

now what have you got there she demanded eying the basket

 just a little chicken fo you and a few aigs

 oh you are so thoughtful  sarah smiths was a grateful heart

 go long now â hit aint a thing

then came a pause the old woman sliding into the proffered seat while over her genial dimpled smile there dropped a dull veil of care her eyes shifted uneasily miss smith tried not to notice the change

 well are you all moved aunt rachel  she inquired cheerfully

 nom and we aint gwine to move

 but i thought it was all arranged

 it was gloomily  but de ole cunnel he wont let us go

the listener was instantly sympathetic why not she asked

 he says we owes him

but didnt you settle at christmas

yasm but when he found we was goin away he looked up some more debts

 i dont know zactly â more n a hundred dollars

den de boys done got in dat trouble and he paid their fines

 what was the trouble  

 well one was agambling and the other struck the overseer what was awhippin him

 whipping him  â in horrified exclamation quite as much at aunt rachels matteroffact way of regarding the matter as at the deed itself

 yasm he did nt do his work right and he whipped him i speck he needed it

 but hes a grown man miss smith urged earnestly

yasm hes twenty now and big

 nom he say he ll sell us out and put us in de chaingang if we go the boys is plumb mad but ise apleadin with em not to do nothin rash

 but â but i thought they had already started to work a crop on the tolliver place 

yasm dey had but you see dey were arrested and then cunnel cresswell took em and lowed they could nt leave his place  man tolliver was powerful mad

 why aunt rachel its slavery  cried the lady in dismay aunt rachel did not offer to dispute her declaration

 yasm hits slavery she agreed i hates it mighty bad too cause i wanted de little chillens in school but â  the old woman broke down and sobbed

a knocking came at the door hastily wiping her eyes aunt rachel rose

 i ll â i ll see what i can do aunt rachel â i must do something murmured miss smith hastily as the woman departed and an old black man came limping in miss smith looked up in surprise

 i begs pardon mistress â i begs pardon goodmorning

 goodmorning â  she hesitated

sykes â jim sykes â thats me

yes ive heard of you mr sykes you live over south of the swamp

 yes maam thats me and ise got a little shack dar and a bit of land what ise trying to buy

of colonel cresswell

 yasm of de cunnel

and how long have you been buying it

 going on ten year now and dats what i comes to ask you about

 goodness me and how much have you paid a year 

 i genrally pays bout three bales of cotton a year docs he furnish you rations

 only sugar and coffee and a little meat now and then

what does it amount to a year

 i does nt rightly know â but i se got some papers here

miss smith looked them over and sighed it was the same old tale of blind receipts for money  on account  â no items no balancing by his help she made out that last year his total bill at cresswells store was perhaps forty dollars

 an last years bill was bigger n common cause i hurt my leg working at the gin and had to have some medicine

 why as far as i can see mr sykes youve paid cresswell about a thousand dollars in the last ten years how large is your place 

 about twenty acres

 and what were you to pay for it 

 four hundred

have you got the deed

 yesm but i aint finished paying yet de cunnel say as how i owes him two hundred dollars still and i cant see it dats why i come over here to talk wid you

 where is the deed 

he handed it to her and her heart sank it was no deed but a complicated contract binding the tenant hand and foot to the landlord she sighed he watching her eagerly

 ise getting old he explained  and i aint got nobody to take care of me i cant work as i once could and de overseers dey drives me too hard i wants a little home to die in

miss smiths throat swelled she could nt tell him that he would never get one at the present rate she only said ill â look this up you come again next saturday

then sadly she watched the ragged old slave hobble away with his cherished  papers he greeted the young man at the gate and passed out while the latter walked briskly up to the door and knocked

 why how do you do robert  

how do you do miss smith

 well are you getting things in shape so as to enter school early next year 

robert looked embarrassed

 thats what i came to tell you miss smith mr cresswell has offered me forty acres of good land

miss smith looked disheartened

 robert here you are almost finished and my heart is set on your going to atlanta university and finishing college with your fine voice and talent for drawing â  a dogged looked settled on roberts young bright face and the speaker paused

 whats the use miss smith â what opening is there for a â a nigger with an education  

miss smith was shocked

 why â why every chance she protested  and where theres none make a chance 

 miss taylor says  â miss smiths heart sank how often had she heard that deadening phrase in the last year â  that theres no use that farming is the only thing we ought to try to do and i reckon she thinks there aint much chance even there

 robert farming is a noble calling whether you re suited to it or not i dont yet know but id like nothing better than to see you settled here in a decent home with a family running a farm but robert farming does nt call for less intelligence than other things it calls for more it is because the world thinks any training good enough for a farmer that the southern farmer is today practically at the mercy of his keener and more intelligent fellows and of all people robert your people need trained intelligence to cope with this problem of farming here without intelligence and training and some capital it is the wildest nonsense to think you can lead your people out of slavery look round you she told him of the visitors  are they not hard working honest people  

 yes maam

 yet they are slaves â dumb driven cattle

 but they have no education

 and you have a smattering therefore are ready to pit yourself against the organized plantation system without capital or experience robert you may succeed you may find your landlord honest and the way clear but my advice to you is â finish your education develop your talents and then come to your life work a fullfledged man and not a halfignorant boy

 i ll think of it returned the boy soberly  i reckon you re right i know miss taylor do nt think much of us but im tired of waiting i want to get to work

miss smith laid a kindly hand upon his shoulder

 ive been waiting thirty years robert she said with feeling and he hung his head

 i wanted to talk about it he awkwardly responded turning slowly away but miss smith stopped him

robert where is the land cresswell offers you

 it s on the tolliver place

 the tolliver place  

 yes he is going to buy it

miss smith dismissed the boy absently and sat down the crisis seemed drawing near she had not dreamed the tolliver place was for sale the old man must be hard pressed to sell to the cresswells

she started up why not go see him perhaps a mortgage on the strength of the endowment it was dangerous â but â she threw a veil over her hair and opened the door a woman stood there who shrank and cowered as if used to blows miss smith eyed her grimly then slowly stepped back

 come in she commanded briefly motioning the woman to a chair

but she stood a pathetic figure faded worn yet with unmistakable traces of beauty in her golden face and soft brown hair miss smith contemplated her sadly here was her most haunting failure this girl whom she first had seen twelve years ago in her wonderful girlish comeliness she had struggled and fought for her but the forces of the devil had triumphed she caught glimpses of her now and then but today was the first time she had spoken to her for ten years she saw the tears that gathered but did not fall then her hands quivered

 bertie she began brokenly the girl shivered but stood aloof

 miss smith she said no â dont talk â im bad â but ive got a little girl miss smith ten years old and â and â im afraid for her i want you to take her

 i have no place for one so young and why are you afraid for her 

 the men there are beginning to notice her

 where 

 at elspeths

 do you stay there now

 yes

why

 he wants me to

 must you do as he wants  

 yes but i want the child â different

 dont you want to be different  the woman quivered again but she answered steadily  no

miss smith sank into a chair and moistened her dry lips

 elspeths is an awful place she affirmed solemnly

 yes

 and zora 

 she is not there much now she stays away

 but if she escapes why not you 

 she wants to escape

 and you  

 i dont want to

this stubborn depravity was so distressing that sarah smith was at an utter loss what to say or do

 i can do nothing â  she began

 for me the woman quickly replied  i dont ask anything but for the child â she is nt to blame

the older woman wavered

wont you try pleaded the younger

yes â ill try ill try i am trying all the time but there are more things than my weak strength can do goodbye

miss smith stood a long time in the doorway watching the fading figure and vaguely trying to remember what it was that she had started to do when the sharp staccato step of a mule drew her attention to a rider who stopped at the gate it was her neighbor tolliver â a gaunt yellowfaced white man ragged rough and unkempt one of the poor whites who had struggled up and failed he spent no courtesy on the  nigger  teacher but sat in his saddle and called her to the gate and she went

 say he roughly opened up  ive got to sell some land and them damn cresswells are after it you can have it for five thousand dollars if you git the cash in a week with a muttered oath he rode abruptly off but not before she had seen the tears in his eyes

all night sarah smith lay thinking and all day she thought and dreamed toward dark she walked slowly out the gate and up the highway toward the cresswell oaks she had never been within the gates before and she looked about thoughtfully the great trees in their regular curving rows must have been planted more than half a century ago the lawn was well tended and the flowers yes there were signs of taste and wealth  but it was built on a moan cried miss smith to herself passionately and she would not look round any more but stared straight ahead where she saw old colonel cresswell smoking and reading on the verandah

the colonel saw her too and was uneasy for he knew that miss smith had a sharp tongue and a most disconcerting method of argument which he as a southern gentleman courteous to all white females even if they did eat with  niggers could not properly answer he received her with courtesy offered a chair laid aside his cigar and essayed some general remarks on cotton weather but miss smith plunged into her subject  colonel cresswell im thinking of raising some money from a mortgage on our school property

the colonels face involuntarily lighted up he thought he saw the beginning of the end of an institution which had been a thorn in his flesh ever since tolliver in a fit of rage had sold land for a negro school

 hm he reflected deprecatingly wiping his brow

 i need some ready money she continued  to keep from curtailing our work

 indeed 

 i have good prospects in a year or so  â the colonel looked up sharply but said nothing â  and so i thought of a mortgage

 money is pretty tight was the colonels first objection

 the land is worth you know at least fifty dollars an acre

u not more than twentyfive dollars i fear

 why you wanted seventyfive dollars for poorer land last year we have two hundred acres it was not for nothing that this lady had been bom in new england

 i would nt reckon it as worth more than five thousand dollars insisted the colonel

 and ten thousand dollars for improvements

but the colonel arose  you had better talk to the directors of the jefferson bank he said politely  they may accommodate you â how much would you want

 five thousand dollars miss smith replied then she hesitated that would buy the land to be sure but money was needed to develop and run it to install tenants and then too for new teachers but she said nothing more and nodding to his polite bow departed colonel cresswell had noticed her hesitation and thought of it as he settled to his cigar again

bles alwyn arose next morning and examined the sky critically he feared rain the season had been quite wet enough particularly down on the swamp land and but yesterday bles had viewed his dykes with apprehension for the black pool scowled about them he dared not think what a long heavy rain might do to the wonderful island of cotton which now stood fully five feet high with flowers and squares and budding bolls it might not rain but the safest thing would be to work at those dykes so he started for spade and hoe he heard miss smith calling however

 bles â hitch up 

he was vexed  are you â in a hurry miss smith   he asked

 yes i am she replied with unmistakable positiveness

he started off and hesitated  miss smith would jim do to drive 

 no sharply  i want you particularly at another time she might have observed his anxiety but today she was agitated she knew she was taking a critical step

slowly bles hitched up after all it might not rain he argued as they jogged toward town in silence they rode on bles kept looking at the skies the south was getting darker and darker it might rain it might rain only an hour or so but suppose it should rain a day â two days â a week

miss smith was looking at her own skies and despite the promised sunrise they loomed darkly five thousand was needed for the land and at least another thousand for repairs two thousand would  buy  a half dozen desirable tenants by paying their debts to their present landlords then two thousand would be wanted for new teachers and a carpenter shop â ten thousand dollars

it was a great temptation and yet once in the hands of these pastmasters of debtmanipulation would her school be safe suppose after all this grey gift â but she caught her breath sharply just as a wet splash of rain struck upon her forehead no god could not be so cruel she pushed her bonnet back how good and cool the water felt but on bles as he raised the buggy top it felt hot and fiery

he felt the coming of some great calamity the end of a dream this rain might stay for days it looked like such a downpour and that would mean the end of the silver fleece the end of zoras hopes the end of everything he gulped in despairing anger and hit the staid old horse the smartest tap she had known all summer

why bles whats the matter called miss smith as the horse started forward he murmured something about getting wet and drew up at the toombsville bank

miss smith was invited politely into the private parlor she explained her business the president was there and colonel cresswell and one other local director

 i have come for a mortgage our land is as you know gentlemen worth at least ten thousand dollars the buildings cost fifteen thousand dollars our property is therefore conservatively valued at twentyfive thousand dollars now i want to mortgage it for  â she hesitated â  five thousand dollars

colonel cresswell was silent but the president said money is rather scarce just now miss smith but it happens that i have ten thousand dollars on hand which we prefer however to loan in one lump sum now if the security were ample i think perhaps you might get this ten thousand dollars

miss smith grew white it was the sum she wanted she tried to escape the temptation yet the larger amount was more than twice as desirable to her as the smaller and she knew that they knew it they were trying to tempt her they wanted as firm a hold on the school property as possible and yet why should she hesitate it was a risk but the returns would be enormous â she must do it besides there was the endowment it was certain yes â she felt forced to close the bargain

 very well she declared her decision and they handed her the preliminary papers she took the pen and glanced at mr cresswell he was smiling slightly but nevertheless she signed her name grimly in a large round hand  sarah smith

the hon charles smith miss sarahs brother was walking swiftly uptown from mr easterlys wall street office and his face was pale at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate the price he had paid was high he was to represent the interests of the new trust and sundry favorable measures were already drafted and reposing in the safe of the combines legal department among others was one relating to child labor another that would effect certain changes in the tariff and a proposed law providing for a cotton bale of a shape and dimensions different from the customary â the last constituting a particularly clever artifice which under the guise of convenience in handling would necessitate the installation of entirely new gin and compress machinery to be supplied of course by the trust

as mr smith drew near mrs greys murray hill residence his face had melted to a cynical smile after all why should he care he had tried independence and philanthropy and failed why should he not be as other men he had seen many others that very day swallow the golden bait and promise everything they were gentlemen why should he pose as better than his fellows there was young cresswell did his aristocratic air prevent his succumbing to the lure of millions and promising the influence of his father and the whole farmers league to the new project mr smith snapped his fingers and rang the bell the door opened softly the dark woodwork of the old english wainscoting glowed with the crimson flaming of logs in the wide fireplace there was just the touch of early autumn chill in the air without that made both the fire and the table with its soft linen gold and silver plate and twinkling glasses a warming satisfying si ght

mrs grey was a portly woman inclined to think much of her dinner and her clothes both of which were always rich and costly she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others her money too was to her an ever worrying mystery and surprise which she found herself always scheming to husband shrewdly and spend philanthropically â a difficult combination

as she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude for her social functions were few tonight there were â she checked them off on her fingers â sir james creighton the rich english manufacturer and lady creighton mr and mrs vanderpool mr harry cresswell and his sister john taylor and his sister and mr charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey â a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day

mrs greys chef was highpriced and efficient and her butler was the envy of many consequently she knew the dinner would be good to her intense satisfaction it was far more than this it was a most agreeable couple of hours all save perhaps mr smith unbent the englishman especially and the vanderpools were most gracious but if the general pleasure was owing to any one person particularly it was to mr harry cresswell mrs grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to  poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mr cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education

 why i thought said mrs grey  that you southerners rather disapproved â or at least â 

mr cresswell inclined his head courteously

 we southerners my dear mrs grey are responsible for a variety of reputations and he told an anecdote that set the table laughing  seriously though he continued  we are not as black as the blacks paint us although on the whole i prefer that helen should marry â a white man

they all glanced at miss cresswell who lay softly back in her chair like a white lily gleaming and bejewelled her pale face flushing under the scrutiny mrs grey was horrified

 why â why the idea  she sputtered  why mr cresswell how can you conceive of anything else â no northerner dreams â 

mr cresswell sipped his wine slowly

 no â no â i do not think you do mean that â  he paused and the englishman bent forward

 really now you do not mean to say that there is danger of â of amalgamation do you he sang

mr cresswell explained no of course there was no immediate danger but when people were suddenly thrust beyond their natural station filled with wild ideas and impossible ambitions it meant terrible danger to southern white women

but you believe in some education asked mary taylor

 i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him

 but cresswell added significantly  capacity differs enormously between races

the vanderpools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent mrs grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the  lower races  it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them

 why i had a colored servantgirl once laughed mrs vanderpool by way of climax  who spent half her wages in piano lessons

then mary taylor whose conscience was uncomfortable said  but mr cresswell you surely believe in schools like miss smiths  

 decidedly returned mr cresswell with enthusiasm  it has done great good

mrs grey was gratified and murmured something of miss smiths  sacrifice

 positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sisters eyes

 of course mary taylor hastened to encourage this turn of the conversation  there are many points on which miss smith and i disagree but i think everybody admires her work

mrs grey wanted particulars  what did you disagree about she asked bluntly

 i may be responsible for some of the disagreement interrupted mr cresswell hesitatingly im afraid miss smith does not approve of us white southerners

 but you mean to say you cant even advise her 

 oh no we can but â we re not â er â exactly welcomed in fact said cresswell gravely  the chief criticism i have against your northerners schools for negroes is that they not only fail to enlist the sympathy and aid of the best southerners but even repel it

 that is very wrong â very wrong commented the englishman warmly a sentiment in which mrs grey hastened to agree

 of course continued cresswell  i am free to confess that i have no personal desire to dabble in philanthropy or conduct schools of any kind my hands are full of other matters

 but its precisely the advice of such disinterested men that philanthropic work needs mr vanderpool urged

 well i volunteered advice once in this case and i shant repeat the experiment soon said cresswell laughing mrs grey wanted to hear the incident but the young man was politely reluctant mary taylor however related the tale of zora to mrs greys private ear later

 fortunately said mr vanderpool  northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters

 yes indeed cresswell agreed  after all they never were far apart even in slavery days both sides were honest and sincere

all through the dinner mr smith had been preoccupied and taciturn now he abruptly shot a glance at cresswell

 i suppose that one was right and one was wrong

 no said cresswell  both were right

 i thought the only excuse for fighting was a great right if right is on neither side or simultaneously on both then war is not only hell but damnation

mrs grey looked shocked and mrs vanderpool smiled

how about fighting for exercise she suggested

 at any rate said cresswell  we can all agree on helping these poor victims of our quarrel as far as their limited capacity will allow â and no farther for that is impossible

very soon after dinner charles smith excused himself he was not yet inured to the ways of high finance and the programme of the cotton barons as unfolded that day lay heavy on his mind despite all his philosophy

 i have had aâ full day he explained to mrs grey

the rain was sweeping down in great thick winding sheets the wind screamed in the ancient cresswell oaks and swirled across the swamp in loud wild gusts the waters roared and gurgled in the streams and along the roadside then when the wind fell murmuring away the clouds grew blacker and blacker and rain in long slim columns fell straight from heaven to earth digging itself into the land and throwing back the red mud in angry flashes

so it rained for one long week and so for seven endless days bles watched it with leaden heart he knew the silver fleece â his and zoras â must be ruined it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself â but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built around it if it failed would not they fail was not this angry beating rain this dull spiritless drizzle this wild war of air and earth but foretaste and prophecy of ruin and discouragement of the utter futility of striving but if his own despair was great his pain at the plight of zora made it almost unbearable he did not see her in these seven days he pictured her huddled there in the swamp in the cheerless leaky cabin with worse than no companions ah

the swamp the cruel swamp it was a fearful place in the rain its oozing mud and fetid vapors its clinging slimy draperies â how they twined about the bones of its victims and chilled their hearts yet here his zora â his poor disappointed child â was imprisoned

child he had always called her child â but now in the inward illumination of these dark days he knew her as neither child nor sister nor friend but as the one woman the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder he panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not she was so strange and human a creature to her all things meant something â nothing was aimless nothing merely happened was this rain beating down and back her love for him or had she never loved he walked his room gripping his hands peering through the misty windows toward the swamp â rain rain rain nothing but rain the world was water veiled in mists

then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steamed bles rushed to the edge of the swamp and stood there irresolute perhaps â if the water had but drained from the cotton â it was so strong and tall but pshaw where was the use of imagining the lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago and now he could almost see the beautiful silver fleece bedraggled drowned and rolling beneath the black lake of slime he went back to his work but early in the morning the thought of it lured him again he must at least see the grave of his hope and zoras and out of it resurrect new love and strength

perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping

he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly the raindrops were still dripping and gleaming from the trees flashing back the heavy yellow sunlight he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the treebridge then he looked down the lagoon was dry he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy the squares of cotton sharpedged heavy were just about to burst to bolls and underneath the land lay carefully drained and black for one long moment he paused stupid agape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree

the swamp the eternal swamp had been drained in its deepest fastness but how â how he gazed about perplexed astonished what a field of cotton what a marvellous field but how had it been saved

he skirted the island slowly stopping near zoras oak here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly the canal went straight a hundred yards through stubborn soil and it was oozing now with slimy waters

he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost â zora and with the thought came a low moan of pain he wheeled and leapt toward the dripping shelter in the tree there she lay â wet bedraggled motionless graypallid beneath her darkdrawn skin her burning eyes searching restlessly for some lost thing her lips amoaning

in dumb despair he dropped beside her and gathered her in his arms the earth staggered beneath him as he stumbled on the mud splashed and sunlight glistened he saw long snakes slithering across his path and fearstruck beasts fleeing before his coming he paused for neither path nor way but went straight for the school running in mighty strides yet gently listening to the moans that struck death upon his heart once he fell headlong but with a great wrench held her from harm and minded not the pain that shot through his ribs the yellow sunshine beat fiercely around and upon him as he stumbled into the highway lurched across the mudstrewn road and panted up the porch

 miss smith â  he gasped and then â darkness

the years of the days of her dying were ten the boy that entered the darkness and the shadow of death emerged a man a silent man and grave working furiously and haunting day and night the little window above the door at last of one gray morning when the earth was stillest they came and told him  she will live  and he went out under the stars lifted his long arms and sobbed  curse me o god if i let me lose her again  and god remembered this in after years

the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land the cotton crop was short and poor because of the great rain but the sun had saved the best and the price had soared so the world was happy and the face of the blackbelt green and luxuriant with thickening flecks of the coming foam of the cotton

up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned

bles where was he the silver fleece how was it the sun the swamp then finding all well she closed her eyes and slept after some days they let her sit by the window and she saw bles pass but drew back timidly when he looked and he saw only the flutter of her gown and waved

at last there came a day when they let her walk down to the porch and she felt the flickering of her strength again yet she looked different her buxom comeliness was spiritualized her face looked smaller and her masses of hair brought low about her ears heightened her ghostly beauty her skin was darkly transparent and her eyes looked out from velvet veils of gloom for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree bles did not know yet that she was down but soon he would come searching for he came each hour and she pressed her little hands against her breast to still the beating of her heart and the bursting wonder of her love

then suddenly a panic seized her he must not find her here â not here there was but one place in all the earth for them to meet and that was yonder in the silver fleece she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl round her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp the dark mystery of the swamp swept over her the place was hers she had been bom within its borders within its borders she had lived and grown and within its borders she had met her love on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island lo the cotton lay before her a great white foam was spread upon its brown and green the whole field was waving and shivering in the sunlight a low cry of pleasure burst from her lips she forgot her weakness and picking her way across the bridge stood still amid the cotton that nestled about her shoulders clasping it lovingly in her hands

he heard that she was downstairs and ran to meet her with beating heart the chair was empty but he knew there was but one place then for these two souls to meet yet it was far and he feared and ran with startled eyes

she stood on the island ethereal splendid like some tall dark and gorgeous flower of the storied east the green and white of the cotton billowed and foamed about her breasts the red scarf burned upon her neck the dark brown velvet of her skin pulsed warm and tremulous with the uprushing blood and in the midnight depths of her great eyes flamed the mighty fires of longconcealed and newborn love

he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimly made he threw up his hands in the old way and hallooed happily she crooned back a low mothermelody and waited he came down to her slowly with fixed hungry eyes threading his way amid the fleece she did not move but lifted both her dark hands white with cotton and then as he came casting it suddenly to the winds in tears and laughter she swayed and dropped quivering in his arms and all the world was sunshine and peace

harry cresswell was scowling over his breakfast it was not because his apartment in the new york hotel was not satisfactory or his breakfast unpalatable possibly a rather bewildering night in broadway was expressing its influence but he was satisfied that his illtemper was due to a paragraph in the morning paper  it is stated on good authority that the widow of the late multimillionaire job grey will announce a large and carefully planned scheme of negro education in the south and will richly endow schools in south carolina georgia alabama louisiana and texas

cresswell finally thrust his food away he knew that mrs grey helped miss smiths school and supposed she would continue to do so with that in mind he had striven to impress her hoping that she might trust his judgment in later years he had no idea however that she meant to endow the school or entertained wholesale plans for negro education the knowledge made him suspicious why had neither mary nor john taylor mentioned this was there after all some  niggerloving  conspiracy back of the cotton combine he took his hat and started downtown

once in john taylors broadway office he opened the subject abruptly â the more so perhaps because he felt a resentment against taylor for certain unnamed or partially voiced assumptions here was a place however for speech and he spoke almost roughly

 taylor what does this mean   he thrust the clipping at him

mean that mrs grey is going to get rid of some of her surplus cash â is going to endow some nigger schools taylor drily retorted

 it must be stopped declared cresswell

the others brows drew up

 why   in a surprised tone

 why  why  do you think the plantation system can be maintained without laborers do you think theres the slightest chance of cornering cotton and buying the black belt if the niggers are unwilling to work under present conditions do you know the man that stands ready to gobble up every inch of cotton land in this country at a price which no trust can hope to rival 

john taylors interest quickened

why no he returned sharply who

 the black man whose woolly head is filled with ideas of rising we re striving by main force to prevent this and here come your damned northern philanthropists to plant schools why taylor it ll knock the cotton trust to hell

 dont get excited said taylor judicially  we ve got things in our hands its the grey money you know that is back of us

 thats just what confounds me declared the perplexed young man are you men fools or rascals

dont you see the two schemes cant mix theyre dead opposite mutually contradictory absolutely â  taylor checked him it was odd to behold harry cresswell so disturbed

 well wait a moment let s see sit down wish i had a cigar for you but i dont smoke

 do you happen to have any whiskey handy  

 no i dont drink

 well what the devil â oh well fire away

u now see here we control the grey millions of course weve got to let her play with her income and thats considerable her favorite game just now is negro education and shes planning to go in heavy her adviser in this line however is smith and he belongs to us

 what smith 

 why the man who s going to be senator from new jersey he has a sister teaching in the south â you know of course its at your home where my sister mary taught

 great scott is that womans brother going to spend this money why are you daft see here american cottonspinning supremacy is built on cheap cotton cheap cotton is built on cheap niggers educating or rather trying to educate niggers will make them restless and discontented â that is scarce and dear as workers dont you see youre planning to cut off your noses this smith school particularly has nearly ruined our plantation its stuck almost in our front yard you are planning to put our ploughhands all to studying greek and at the same time to corner the cotton crop â rot 

john taylor caressed his lean jaw

 new point of view to me i sort of thought education would improve things in the south he commented unmoved

 it would if we ran it

we

yes â we southerners

 um â i see â there s light see here lets talk to easterly about this they went into the next office and after a while got audience with the trust magnate mr easterly heard the matter carefully and waved it aside

oh that doesnt concern us taylor let cresswell take care of the whole thing we ll see that smith does what cresswell wants

but taylor shook his head

 smith would kick mrs grey would get suspicious and the devil be to pay this is better form a big committee of northern business men like yourself â philanthropists like vanderpool and southerners like cresswell let them be a sort of negro education steeringcommittee we ll see that on such committee you southerners get what you want â control of negro education

 that sounds fair but how about the smith school my father writes me that they are showing signs of expecting money right off â is that true if it is i want it stopped it will ruin our campaign for the farmers league

john taylor looked at cresswell he thought he saw something more than general policy or even racial prejudice â something personal â in his vehemence the smith school was evidently a severe thorn in the flesh of this man all the more reason for mollifying him then too there was something in his argument it was not wise to start educating these negroes and getting them discontented just now ignorant labor was not ideal but it was worth too much to employers to lose it now educated negro labor might be worth more to negroes but not to the cotton combine  hm â well then â  and john taylor went into a brown study while cresswell puffed impatiently at a cigarette

 i have it said taylor cresswell sat up  first let mr easterly get smith easterly turned to the telephone

is that you smith

 well this is easterly    yes â how about mrs greys education schemes    yes    hm â well â see here smith we must go a little easy there    oh no no â but to advertise just now a big scheme of negro education would drive the cresswells the farmers league and the whole business south dead against us    yes yes indeed they believe in education all right but they aint in for training lawyers and professors just yet    no i dont suppose her school is    well then see here she ll be reasonable wont she and placate the cresswells     no i mean run the school to suit their ideas    no no but in general along the lines which they could approve    yes i thought so  of course    goodbye

inclined to be a little nasty asked taylor

 a little sharp â but tractable now mr cresswell the thing is in your hands we ll get this committee which taylor suggests appointed and send it on a junket to alabama you do the rest â see

 who ll be the committee  asked cresswell

 name it

mr cresswell smiled and left

the winter started in severely and it was easy to fill two private cars with members of the new negro education board right after thanksgiving cresswell had worked carefully and with caution there was mrs grey comfortable and beaming mr easterly who thought this a good business opportunity and his family mrs vanderpool liked the south and was amused at the trip and had induced mr vanderpool to come by stories of shooting

 ah  said mr vanderpool

mr charles smith and john taylor were both too busy to go but bronchial trouble induced the rev dr boldish of st faiths rich parish to be one of the party and at the last moment temple bocombe the sociologist consented to join

 awfully busy he said  but i ve been reading up on the negro problem since you mentioned the matter to me last week mr cresswell and i think i understand it thoroughly i may be able to help out

the necessary spice of young womanhood was added to the party by miss taylor and miss cresswell together with the silent miss boldish they were a comfortable and sometimes merry party dr boldish pointed out the loafers at the stations especially the black ones mr bocombe counted them and estimated the number of hours of work lost at ten cents an hour

 do they get that â ten cents an hour  asked miss taylor

oh i dont know replied mr bocombe but suppose they do for instance that is an average wage today

 they look lazy said mrs grey

 they are lazy said mr cresswell

 so am i added mrs vanderpool suppressing a yawn

 it is uninteresting murmured her husband preparing for a nap

on the whole the members of the party enjoyed themselves from the moment they drew out of jersey city to the afternoon when in four carriages they rolled beneath the curious eyes of all toomsville and swept under the shadowed rampart of the swamp

 the christmas  was coming and all the southern world was busy few people were busier than bles and zora slowly wonderfully for them heaven bent in these dying days of the year and kissed the earth and the tremor thrilled all lands and seas everything was good all things were happy and these two were happiest of all out of the shadows and hesitations of childhood they had stepped suddenly into manhood and womanhood with firm feet and uplifted heads all the day that was theirs they worked picking the silver fleece â picking it tenderly and lovingly from off the brown and spent bodies which had so utterly yielded life and beauty to the full fruition of this long and silken tendril this white beauty of the cotton november came and flew and still the unexhausted field yielded its frothing fruit

today seemed doubly glorious for bles had spoken of their marriage with twined hands and arms and lips ever and again seeking their mates they walked the leafy way

unconscious rapt they stepped out into the big road skirting the edge of the swamp why not was it not the kings highway and love was king so they talked on unknowing that far up the road the cresswell coaches were wheeling along with precious burdens

in the first carriage were mrs grey and mrs vanderpool mr cresswell and miss taylor mrs vanderpool was lolling luxuriously but mrs grey was a little stiff from long travel and sat upright mr cresswell looked cleancut and handsome and miss taylor seemed complacent and responsible the dying of the day soothed them all insensibly groups of dark little children passed them as they neared the school staring with wide eyes and greeting timidly

 there seems to be marrying and giving in marriage laughed mrs vanderpool

 not very much said mr cresswell drily

 well at least plenty of children

 plenty

but where are the houses asked mrs grey

 perhaps in the swamp said mrs vanderpool lightly looking up at the sombre trees that lined the left

 they live where they please and do as they please cresswell explained to which mrs vanderpool added  like other animals

mary taylor opened her lips to rebuke this levity when suddenly the coachman called out and the horses swerved and the carriages four occupants faced a young man and a young woman embracing heartily

out through the wood bles and zora had come to the broad red road playfully he celebrated all her beauty unconscious of time and place

 you are tall and bend like grasses on the swamp he said

 and yet look up to you she murmured

 your eyes are darkness dressed in night

 to see you brighter dear she said

 your little hands are much too frail for work

 they must grow larger then and soon

 your feet are far too small to travel on

 they ll travel on to you â thats far enough your lips â your full and purple lips â were made alone for kissing not for words

 they ll do for both

he laughed in utter joy and touched her hair with light caressing hands

 it does not fly with sunlight she said quickly with an upward glance

 no he answered  it sits and listens to the night but even as she nestled to him happily there came the harsh thunder of horses hoofs beating on their ears he drew her quickly to him in fear and the coach lurched and turned and left them facing four pairs of eyes miss taylor reddened mrs grey looked surprised mrs vanderpool smiled but mr cresswell darkened with anger the couple unclasped shamefacedly and the young man lifting his hat started to stammer an apology but cresswell interrupted him  keep your â your philandering to the woods or i shall have you arrested he said slowly his face colorless his lips twitching with anger  drive on john

miss taylor felt that her worst suspicions had been confirmed but mrs vanderpool was curious as to the cause of cresswells anger it was so genuine that it needed explanation

are kisses illegal here she asked before the horses started turning the battery of her eyes full upon him but cresswell had himself well in hand

 no he said  but the girl is â notorious

on the lovers the words fell like a blow zora shivered and a grayish horror mottled the dark burning of her face bles started in anger then paused in shivering doubt what had happened they knew not yet involuntarily their hands fell apart they avoided each others eyes

i â i must go now gasped zora as the carriage swept away

he did not hold her he did not offer the farewell kiss but stood staring at the road as she walked into the swamp a moment she paused and looked back then slowly almost painfully she took the path back to the field of the fleece and reaching it after long long minutes began mechanically to pick the cotton but the cotton glowed crimson in the failing sun

bles walked toward the school what had happened he kept asking and yet he dared not question the awful shape that sat somewhere cold and still behind his soul he heard the hoofs of horses again it was miss taylor being brought back to the school to greet miss smith and break the news of the coming of the party he raised his hat she did not return the greeting but he found her pausing at the gate it seemed to her too awful for this foolish fellow thus to throw himself away she faced him and he flinched as from some descending blow

 bles she said primly  have you absolutely no shame 

he braced himself and raised his head proudly

 i am going to marry her it is no crime then he noted the expression on her face and paused

she stepped back scandalized

 can it be bles alwyn she said  that you dont know the sort of girl she is

he raised his hands and warded off her words dumbly as she turned to go almost frightened at the havoc she saw the heavens flamed scarlet in his eyes and he screamed

 its a lie it s a damned lie  he wheeled about and tore into the swamp

 its a damned lie  he shouted to the trees  is it â is it chirped the birds its a cruel falsehood he moaned  is it â is it  whispered the devils within

it seemed to him as though suddenly the world was staggering and faltering about him the trees bent curiously and strange breathings were upon the breezes he unbuttoned his collar that he might get more air a thousand things he had forgotten surged suddenly to life slower and slower he ran more and more the thoughts crowded his head he thought of that first red night and the yelling and singing and wild dancing he thought of cresswells bitter words he thought of zora telling how she stayed out nights he thought of the little bower that he had built her in the cotton field a wild fear struggled with his anger but he kept repeating  no no and then  at any rate she will tell me the truth she had never lied to him she would not dare he clenched his hands murder in his heart

slowly and more slowly he ran he knew where she was â where she must be waiting and yet as he drew near huge hands held him back and heavy weights clogged his feet his heart said  on quick she will tell the truth and all will be well his mind said  slow slow this is the end he hurled the thought aside and crashed through the barrier

she was standing still and listening with a huge basket of the piled froth of the field upon her head one long brown arm tender with curvings balanced the cotton the other poised balanced the slim swaying body bending she listened her eyes shining her lips apart her bosom fluttering at the wellknown step

he burst into her view with the fury of a beast rending the wood away and trampling the underbrush reeling and muttering until he saw her she looked at him her hands dropped she stood very still with drawn face grayishbrown both hands unconsciously outstretched and the cotton swaying while deep down in her eyes dimly slowly a horror lit and grew he paused a moment then came slowly onward doggedly drunkenly with torn clothes flying collar and red eyes then he paused again still beyond armslength looking at her with fearstruck eyes the cotton on her head shivered and dropped in a pure mass of white and silvery snow about her limbs her hands fell limply and the horror flamed in her wet eyes he struggled with his voice but it grated and came hoarse and hard from his quivering throat

 zora 

yes bles

you â you told me â you were â pure

she was silent but her body went all atremble he stepped forward until she could almost touch him there standing straight and tall he glared down upon her

 answer me he whispered in a voice hard with its tight held sobs a misery darkened her face and the light died from her eyes yet she looked at him bravely and her voice came low and full as from afar

 i asked you what it meant to be pure bles and â and you told â and i told you the truth

 what it meant â what it meant  he repeated in the low tense anguish

 but â but bles â  she faltered there came an awful pleading in her eyes her hand groped toward him but he stepped slowly back â  but bles â you said â willingly â you said â if â if she knew â 

he thundered back in livid anger knew all women know you should have died sobs were rising and shaking her from head to foot but she drove them back and gripped her breasts with her hands

 no bles â no â all girls do not know i was a child not since i knew you bles â never never since i saw you

 since â since he groaned â  christ but before

 yes before

my god

she knew the end had come yet she babbled on tremblingly  he was our master and all the other girls that gathered there did his will i â i â  she choked and faltered and he drew farther away â i began running away and they hunted me through the swamps and then  then i reckon id have gone back and been â as they all are â but you came bles â you came and you â you were a new great thing in my life and â and â yet i was afraid i was not worthy until you â you said the words i thought you knew and i thought that â that purity was just wanting to be pure

he ground his teeth in fury oh he was an innocent â a blind baby â the joke and laughingstock of the country around with yokels grinning at him and palefaced devils laughing aloud the teachers knew the girls knew god knew everybody but he knew â poor blind deaf mole stupid jackass that he was he must run â run away from this world and far off in some free land beat back this pain

then in sheer weariness the anger died within his soul  leaving but ashes and despair slowly he turned away but with a quick motion she stood in his path

 bles she cried  how can i grow pure 

he looked at her listlessly

 never â never again he slowly answered her

dark fear swept her drawn face

 never  she gasped

pity surged and fought in his breast but one thought held and burned him he bent to her fiercely  who  he demanded

she pointed toward the cresswell oaks and he turned away she did not attempt to stop him again but dropped her hands and stared drearily up into the clear sky with its shining worlds

 goodbye bles she said slowly  i thank god he gave you to me â just a little time she hesitated and waited there came no word as the man moved slowly away she stood motionless then slowly he turned and came back he laid his hand a moment lightly upon her head

 goodbye â zora he sobbed and was gone

she did not look up but knelt there silent dryeyed till the last rustle of his going died in the night and then like a waiting storm the torrent of her grief swept down upon her she stretched herself upon the black and fleecestrewn earth and writhed

all night miss smith lay holding the quivering form of zora close to her breast staring wideeyed into the darkness â thinking thinking in the morning the party would come there would be mrs grey and mary taylor mrs vanderpool who had left her so coldly in the lurch before and some of the cresswells they would come well fed and impressed with the charming hospitality of their hosts and rather more than willing to see through those hosts eyes they would be in a hurry to return to some social function and would give her work but casual attention

it seemed so dark an ending to so bright a dream never for her had a fall opened as gloriously the love of this boy and girl blossoming as it had beneath her tender care had been a sacred wonderful history that revived within her memories of longforgotten days but above lay the vision of her school redeemed and enlarged its future safe its usefulness broadened â small wonder that to sarah smith the future had seemed in november almost golden

then things began to go wrong the transfer of the tolliver land had not yet been effected the money was ready but mr tolliver seemed busy or hesitating next came this news of mrs greys probable conditions so here it was christmas time and sarah smiths castles lay almost in ruins about her

the girl moaned in her fitful sleep and miss smith soothed her poor child here too was work â a strange strong soul cruelly stricken in her youth could she be brought back to a useful life how she needed such a strong cleareyed helper in this crisis of her work would zora make one or would this blow send her to perdition not if sarah smith could save her she resolved and stared out the window where the pale red dawn was sending its first rays on the whitepillared mansion of the cresswells

mrs grey saw the light on the columns too as she lay lazily in her soft white bed there was a certain delicious languor in the late lingering fall of alabama that suited her perfectly then too she liked the house and its appointments there was not to be sure all the luxury that she was used to in her new york mansion but there was a certain finish about it an elegance and staid oldfashioned hospitality that appealed to her tremendously mrs greys heart warmed to the sight of helen in her moments of spasmodic caring for the sick and afflicted on the estate no better guardian of her philanthropies could be found than these same cresswells she must of course go over and see dear sarah smith but really there was not much to say or to look at

the prospects seemed most alluring later mr easterly talked a while on routine business saying as he turned away  i am more and more impressed mrs grey with your wisdom in placing large investments in the south with peaceful social conditions the returns will be large

mrs grey heard this delicate flattery complacently she had her streak of thrift and wanted her business capacity recognized she listened attentively

 for this reason i trust you will handle your negro philanthropies judicially as i know you will theres dynamite in this race problem for amateur reformers but fortunately you have at hand wise and sympathetic advisers in the cresswells

mrs grey agreed entirely

mary taylor alone of the committee took her commission so seriously as to be anxious to begin work we are to visit the school this morning you know she reminded the others looking at her watch im afraid we re late already

the remark created mild consternation it seemed that mr vanderpool had gone hunting and his wife had not yet arisen dr boldish was very hoarse mr easterly was going to look over some plantations with colonel cresswell and mr bocombe was engrossed in a novel

 clever but not true to life he said

finally the clergyman and mr bocombe mrs grey and mrs vanderpool and miss taylor started for the school with harry cresswell about an hour after lunch the delay and suppressed excitement among the little folks had upset things considerably there but at the sight of the visitors at the gate miss smith rang the bell

the party came in laughing and chatting they greeted miss smith cordially dr boldish was beginning to tell a good story when a silence fell

the children had gathered quietly almost timidly and before the distinguished company realized it they turned to meet that battery of four hundred eyes a human eye is a wonderful thing when it simply waits and watches

not one of these little things alone would have been worth more than a glance but together they became mighty portentous mr bocombe got out his notebook and wrote furiously therein dr boldish naturally the appointed spokesman looked helplessly about and whispered to mrs vanderpool  what on earth shall i talk about  

 the brotherhood of man   suggested the lady

 hardly advisable returned dr boldish seriously  in our friends presence â with a glance toward cresswell then he arose

 my friends he said touching his fingertips and using blank verse in a minor  this is an auspicious day you should be thankful for the gifts of the lord his bounty surrounds you â the trees the fields the glorious sun he gives cotton to clothe you corn to eat devoted friends to teach you be joyful be good above all be thrifty and save your money and do not complain and whine at your apparent disadvantages remember that god did not create men equal but unequal and set metes and bounds it is not for us to question the wisdom of the almighty but to bow humbly to his will

 remember that the slavery of your people was not necessarily a crime it was a school of work and love it gave you noble friends like mr cresswell here a restless stirring and the battery of eyes was turned upon that imperturbable gentleman as if he were some strange animal  love and serve them remember that we get after all little education from books rather in the fields at the plough and in the kitchen let your ambition be to serve rather than rule to be humble followers of the lowly jesus

with an upward glance the rev mr boldish sat down amid a silence a shade more intense than that which had greeted him then slowly from the far corner rose a thin voice tremulously it wavered on the air and almost broke then swelled in sweet low music other and stronger voices gathered themselves to it until two hundred were singing a soft minor wail that gripped the hearts and tingled in the ears of the hearers mr bocombe groped with a puzzled expression to find the pocket for his notebook harry cresswell dropped his eyes and on mrs vanderpools lips the smile died mary taylor flushed and mrs grey cried frankly  poor things  she whispered

 now said mrs grey turning about  we have nt but just a moment and we want to take a little look at your work she smiled graciously upon miss smith

mrs grey thought the cookingschool very nice

 i suppose she said  that you furnish cooks for the county

 largely said miss smith mrs vanderpool looked surprised but miss smith added  this county you know is mostly black mrs grey did not catch the point

the dormitories were neat and the ladies expressed great pleasure in them

 it is certainly nice for them to know what a clean place is commented mrs grey mr cresswell however looked at a bathroom and smiled

 how practical  he said

 can you not stop and see some of the classes   sarah smith knew in her heart that the visit was a failure still she would do her part to the end i doubt if we shall have time mrs grey returned as they walked on  mr cresswell expects friends to dinner

 what a magnificent intelligence office remarked mr bocombe  for furnishing servants to the nation i saw splendid material for cooks and maids

 and ploughboys added cresswell

 and singers said mary taylor

well now thats just my idea said mrs grey  that these schools should furnish trained servants and laborers for the south is nt that your idea miss smith 

 not exactly that lady replied  or at least i shouldnt put it just that way my idea is that this school should furnish men and women who can work and earn an honest living train up families aright and perform their duties as fathers mothers and citizens

 yes â yes precisely said mrs grey  thats what i meant

 i think the whites can attend to the duties of citizenship without help observed mr cresswell

 dont let the blacks meddle in politics said dr boldish

 i want to make these children fullfledged men and women strong selfreliant honest without any  ifs and ands to their development insisted miss smith

 of course and that is just what mr cresswell wants isnt it mr cresswell  asked mrs grey

 i think i may say yes mr cresswell agreed  i certainly want these people to develop as far as they can although miss smith and i would differ as to their possibilities but it is not so much in the general theory of negro education as in its particular applications where our chief differences would lie i may agree that a boy should learn higher arithmetic yet object to his loafing in ploughtime i might want to educate some girls but not girls like zora

mrs vanderpool glanced at mr cresswell smiling to herself

mrs grey broke in beaming thats just it dear miss smith â just it your heart is good but you need strong practical advice you know we weak women are so impractical as my poor job so often said now im going to arrange to endow this school with at least â at least a hundred and fifty thousand dollars one condition is that my friend mr cresswell here and these other gentlemen including sound northern business men like mr easterly shall hold this money in trust and expend it for your school as they think best

 mr cresswell would be their local representative  asked miss smith slowly with white face

 why yes â yes of course

there was a long tense silence then the firm reply  mrs grey i thank you but i cannot accept your offer

sarah smiths voice was strong the tremor had left her hands she had expected something like this of course yet when it came â somehow it failed to stun she would not turn over the direction of the school or the direction of the education of these people to those who were most opposed to their education therefore there was no need to hesitate there was no need to think the thing over â she had thought it over â and she looked into mrs greys eyes and with gathering tears in her own said  again i thank you very much mrs grey

mrs grey was a picture of the most emphatic surprise and mr cresswell moved to the window mrs grey looked helplessly at her companions

 but â i dont understand miss smith â why cant you accept my offer 

 because you ask me to put my school in control of those who do not wish for the best interests of black folk and in particular i object to mr cresswell said miss smith slowly but very distinctly  because his relation to the forces of evil in this community has been such that he can direct no school of mine mrs vanderpool moved toward the door and mr cresswell bowing slightly followed dr boldish looked indignant and mr bocombe dove after his notebook mary taylor her head in a whirl came forward she felt that in some way she was responsible for this dreadful situation and she wanted desperately to save matters from final disaster

 come she said  mrs grey we ll talk this matter over again later i am sure miss smith does not mean quite all she says â she is tired and nervous you join the others and dont wait for me and i will be along directly

mrs grey was only too glad to escape and mr bocombe got a chance to talk he drew out his notebook

 awfully interesting he said  awfully now â er â lets see â oh yes did you notice how unhealthy the children looked race is undoubtedly dying out fact no hope weak no spontaneity either â rather languid did you notice yes and their heads â small and narrow â no brain capacity they cant concentrate notice how some slept when dr boldish was speaking mr cresswell says they own almost no land here think of it this land was worth only ten dollars an acre a decade ago he says negroes might have bought all and been rich very shiftless â and that singing now i wonder where they got the music imitation of course and so he rattled on noting not the silence of the others as the carriage drove off mary turned to miss smith

 now miss smith she began â but miss smith looked at her and said sternly  sit down

mary taylor sat down she had been so used to lecturing the older woman that the sudden summoning of her well known sternness against herself took her breath and she sat awkwardly like the school girl that she was waiting for miss smith to speak she felt suddenly very young and very helpless â she who had so jauntily set out to solve this mighty problem by a waving of her wand she saw with a swelling of pity the drawn and stricken face of her old friend and she started up

 sit down repeated miss smith harshly  mary taylor you are a fool you are not foolish for the foolish learn you are simply a fool you will never learn you have blundered into this life work of mine and well nigh ruined it whether i can yet save it god alone knows you have blundered into the lives of two loving children and sent one wandering aimless on the face of the earth and the other moaning in yonder chamber with death in her heart you are going to marry the man that sought zoras ruin when she was yet a child because you think of his aristocratic pose and pretensions built on the poverty crime and exploitation of six generations of serfs youll marry him and â 

but miss taylor leapt to her feet with blazing cheeks  how dare you  she screamed beside herself

 but god in heaven help you if you do finished miss smith calmly

when slowly from the torpor of ether one wakens to the misty sense of eternal loss and there comes the exquisite prick of pain then one feels in part the horror of the ache when zora wakened to the world again the awakening was the work of days and weeks at first in sheer exhaustion physical and mental she lay and moaned the sense of loss â of utter loss â lay heavy upon her something of herself something dearer than self was gone from her forever and an infinite loneliness and silence as of endless years settled on her soul she wished neither food nor words only to be alone then gradually the pain of injury stung her when the blood flowed fuller as miss smith knelt beside her one night to make her simple prayer zora sat suddenly upright whiteswathed dishevelled with fury in her midnight eyes

 i want no prayers  she cried  i will not pray he is no god of mine he is nt fair he knows and wont tell he takes advantage of us â he works and fools us all night miss smith heard mutterings of this bitterness and the next day the girl walked her room like a tigressâ to and fro to and fro all the long day toward night a dumb despair settled upon her miss smith found her sitting by the window gazing blankly toward the swamp she came to miss smith slowly and put her hands upon her shoulders with almost a caress

 you must forgive me she pleaded plaintively  i reckon ive been mighty bad with you and you always so good to me but â but you see â it hurts so

 i know it hurts dear i know it does but men and women must learn to bear hurts in this world

 not hurts like this they could nt

yes even hurts like this bear and stand straight be brave after all zora no man is quite worth a womans soul no love is worth a whole life

zora turned away with a gesture of impatience

 you were born in ice she retorted adding a bit more tenderly  in clear strong ice but i was born in fire i live â i love thats all and she sat down again despairingly and stared at the dull swamp miss smith stood for a moment and closed her eyes upon a vision

 ice  she whispered  my god 

then at length she said to zora  zora theres only one way do something if you sit thus brooding you ll go crazy

 do crazy folks forget 

 nonsense zora  miss smith ridiculed the girls fantastic vagaries her sound common sense rallied to her aid  they are the people who remember sane folk forget work is the only cure for such pain

 but theres nothing to do â nothing i want to do â nothing worth doing â now

 the silver fleece 

the girl sat upright

 the silver fleece she murmured without further word slowly she arose and walked down the stairs and out into the swamp miss smith watched her go she knew that every step must be the keen prickle of awakening flesh yet the girl walked steadily on

it was the christmas â not christmastide of the north and west but christmas of the southern south it was not the festival of the christ child but a time of noise and frolic and license the great payday of the year when black men lifted their heads from a years toiling in the earth and hat in hand asked anxiously  master what have i earned have i paid my old debts to you have i made my clothes and food have i got a little of the years wage coming to me  or more carelessly and cringingly  master gimme a christmas gift

the lords of the soil stood round gauging their cotton measuring their men their stores were crowded their scales groaned their gins sang in the long run public opinion determines all wage but in more primitive times and places private opinion personal judgment of some man in power determines the black belt is primitive and the landlord wields the power

 what about johnson  calls the head clerk

 well hes a faithful nigger and needs encouragement cancel his debt and give him ten dollars for christmas colonel cresswell glowed as if he were full of the seasons spirit

 and sanders  

 hows his cotton  

 good and a lot of it

 hes trying to get away keep him in debt but let him draw what he wants

 aunt rachel  

 h m they re way behind arent they give her a couple of dollars â not a cent more

 jim sykes 

say harry how about that darky sykes called out the colonel

excusing himself from his guests harry cresswell came into the office

to them this peculiar spectacle of the market place was of unusual interest they saw its humor and its crowding its bizarre effects and unwonted pageantry black giants and pigmies were there kerchiefed aunties giggling black girls saffron beauties and loafing white men there were mules and horses and oxen wagons and buggies and carts but above all and in all rushing through piled and flying bound and baled â was cotton cotton was currency cotton was merchandise cotton was conversation

all this was  beautiful  to mrs grey and  unusually interesting  to mrs vanderpool to mary taylor it had the fascination of a puzzle whose other side she had already been partially studying she was particularly impressed with the joy and abandon of the scene â light laughter huge guffaws handshakes and gossipings

 at all events she concluded  this is no oppressed people and sauntering away from the rest she noted the smiles of an undersized smirking yellow man who hurried by with a handful of dollar bills at a side entrance liquor was evidently on sale â men were drinking and women too some were staggering others cursing and yet others singing then suddenly a man swung around the comer swearing in bitter rage  the damned thieves they se stole a years work â the white â  but some one called  hush up sanders theres a white woman and he threw a startled look at mary and hurried by she was perplexed and upset and stood hesitating a moment when she heard a wellknown voice why miss taylor i was alarmed for you you really must be careful about trusting yourself with these half drunken negroes

 would nt it be better not to give them drink mr cresswell 

 and let your neighbor sell them poison at all hours  no miss taylor they joined the others and all were turning toward the carriage when a figure coming down the road attracted them

 quite picturesque observed mrs vanderpool looking at the tall slim girl swaying toward them with a piled basket of white cotton poised lightly on her head  why in abrupt recognition  it is our venus of the roadside is it not 

mary saw it was zora just then too zora caught sight of them and for a moment hesitated then came on the carriage was in front of the store and she was bound for the store a moment mary hesitated too and then turned resolutely to greet her but zoras eyes did not see her after one look at that sorrowstricken face mary turned away

colonel cresswell stood by the door his hat on his hands in his pockets

well zora what have you there he asked

 cotton sir

harry cresswell bent over it

 great heavens look at this cotton  he ejaculated

his father approached the cotton lay in silken handfuls clean and shimmering with threads full two inches long the idlers black and white clustered round gazing at it and fingering it with repeated exclamations of astonishment

where did this come from asked the colonel sharply he and harry were both eying the girl intently

 i raised it in the swamp zora replied quietly in a dead voice there was no pride of achievement in her manner no gladness all that had flown

 is that all 

 no sir i think there s two bales

 two bales where is it  how the devil â  the colonel was forgetting his guests but harry intervened

 you ll need to get it picked right off he suggested

 its all picked sir

 but where is it 

 if you ll send a wagon sir â 

but the colonel hardly waited

 here you jim take the big mules and drive like â wheres that wench  

but zora was already striding on ahead and was far up the red road when the great mules galloped into sight and the long whip snapped above their backs the colonel was still excited

 that cotton must be ours harry â all of it and see that none is stolen weve got no contract with the wench so dont dally with her but harry said firmly quietly  its fine cotton and she raised it she must be paid well for it colonel cresswell glanced at him with something between contempt and astonishment on his face

you go along with the ladies harry added ill see to this cotton mary taylors smile had rewarded him now he must get rid of his company â before zora returned

it was dark when the cotton came such a load as cresswells store had never seen before zora watched it weighed received the cotton checks and entered the store only the clerk was there and he was closing he pointed her carelessly to the office in the back part she went into the small dim room and laying the cottoncheck on the desk stood waiting slowly the hopelessness and bitterness of it all came back in a great whelming flood what was the use of trying for anything she was lost forever the world was against her and again she saw the fingers of elspeth â the long black clawlike talons that clutched and dragged her down â down she did not struggle â she dropped her hands listlessly wearily and stood but half conscious as the door opened and mr harry cresswell entered the dimly lighted room she opened her eyes she had expected his father somewhere way down in the depths of her nature the primal tiger awoke and snarled she was suddenly alive from hair to finger tip harry cresswell paused a second and swept her full length with his eye â her profile the long supple line of bosom and hip the little foot then he closed the door softly and walked slowly toward her she stood like stone without a quiver only her eye followed the crooked line of the cresswell blue blood on his marble forehead as she looked down from her greater height her hand closed almost caressingly on a rusty poker lying on the stove nearby and as she sensed the hot breath of him she felt herself purring in a half heard whisper

 i should not like â to kill you

he looked at her long and steadily as he passed to his desk slowly he lighted a cigarette opened the great ledger and compared the cottoncheck with it

 three thousand pounds he announced in a careless tone  yes that will make about two bales of lint its extra cotton â say fifteen cents a pound â one hundred fifty dollars â seventyfive dollars to you â hm he took a notebook out of his pocket pushed his hat back on his head and paused to relight his cigarette

 lets see â your rent and rations â 

 elspeth pays no rent she said slowly but he did not seem to hear

 your rent and rations with the five years back debt â he made a hasty calculation â  will be one hundred dollars that leaves you twentyfive in our debt heres your receipt

the blow had fallen she did not wince nor cry out she took the receipt calmly and walked out into the darkness

they had stolen the silver fleece

what should she do she never thought of appeal to courts for colonel cresswell was justice of the peace and his son was bailiff why had they stolen from her she knew she was now penniless and in a sense helpless she was now a peon bound to a masters bidding if elspeth chose to sign a contract of work for her tomorrow it would mean slavery jail or hounded running away what would elspeth do one never knew zora walked on an hour ago it seemed that this last blow must have killed her but now it was different into her first despair had crept in one fierce moment grim determination somewhere in the world sat a great dim injustice which had veiled the light before her young eyes just as she raised them to the morning with the veiling death had come into her heart

and yet they should not kill her they should not enslave her a desperate resolve to find some way up toward the light if not to it formed itself within her she would not fall into the pit opening before her somehow somewhere lay the way she must never fall lower never be utterly despicable in the eyes of the man she had loved there was no dream of forgiveness of purification of rekindled love all these she placed sadly and gently into the dead past but in awful earnestness she turned toward the future struggling blindly groping in half formed plans for a way

she came thus into the room where sat miss smith strangely pallid beneath her dusky skin but there lay a light in her eyes

all over the land the cotton had foamed in great white flakes under the winter sun the silver fleece lay like a mighty mantle across the earth black men and mules had staggered beneath its burden while deep songs welled in the hearts of men for the fleece was goodly and gleaming and soft and men dreamed of the gold that it would buy all the roads in the country had been lined with wagons â a million wagons speeding to and fro with straining mules and laughing black men bearing bubbling masses of piled white fleece the gins were still roaring and spitting flames and smoke â fifty thousand of them in town and vale then hoarse iron throats were filled with fifteen billion pounds of whitefleeced blackspecked cotton for the whirling saws to tear out the seed and fling five thousand million pounds of the silken fibre to the press

and there again the black men sang like dark earthspirits flitting in twilight the presses creaked and groaned closer and closer they pressed the silken fleece it quivered trembled and then lay cramped dead and still in massive hard square bundles tied with iron strings out fell the heavy bales thousand upon thousand million upon million until they settled over the south like some vast dullwhite swarm of birds colonel cresswell and his son in these days had a long and earnest conversation perforated here and there by explosions of the colonels wrath the colonel could not understand some things

they want us to revive the farmers league he fiercely demanded

 yes harry calmly replied

 and throw the rest of our capital after the fifty thousand dollars weve already lost 

 yes

 and you were fool enough to consent â 

 wait father â and dont get excited listen cotton is going up â 

 of course its going up short crop and big demand â 

 cotton is going up and then its going to fall

 i dont believe it

 i know it the trust has got money and credit enough to force it down

 well what then   the colonel glared

 then somebody will corner it

 the farmers league wont stand â 

 precisely the farmers league can do the cornering and hold it for higher prices

 lord son if we only could  groaned the colonel

 we can we ll have unlimited credit

 but â but â  stuttered the bewildered colonel  i dont understand why should the trust â 

nonsense father â whats the use of understanding our advantage is plain and john taylor guarantees the thing

whos john taylor snorted the colonel why should we trust him  

 well said harry slowly  he wants to marry helen â 

his father grew apopletic

 im not saying he will father im only saying that he wants to harry made haste to placate the rising tide of wrath

 no southern gentleman â  began the colonel but harry shrugged his shoulders

 which is better to be crushed by the trust or to escape at their expense even if that escape involves unwarranted assumptions on the part of one of them i tell you father the code of the southern gentleman wont work in wall street

 and i ll tell you why â there are no southern gentlemen growled his father

the silver fleece was golden for its prices were flying aloft mr caldwell told colonel cresswell that he confidently expected twelvecent cotton

 the crop is excellent and small scarcely ten million bales he declared  the price is bound to go up

colonel cresswell was hesitant even doubtful the demand for cotton at high prices usually fell off rapidly and he had heard rumors of curtailed mill production while then he hoped for high prices he advised the farmers league to be on guard

mr caldwell seemed to be right for cotton rose to ten cents a pound â ten and a half â eleven â and then the south began to see visions and to dream dreams

 yes my dear said mr maxwell whose lands lay next the cresswells on the northwest  yes if cotton goes to twelve or thirteen cents as seems probable i think we can begin the new house  â for mrs maxwells cherished dream was a pillared mansion like the cresswclls

mr tolliver looked at his house and barns  well daughter if this crop sells at twelve cents i ll be on my feet again and i wont have to sell that land to the nigger school after all once out of the clutch of the cresswells â well i think we can have a coat of paint and he laughed as he had not laughed in ten years

down in the bottoms west of the swamp a man and woman were figuring painfully on an old slate he was light brown and she was yellow

 honey he said tremblingly  i blieve we can do it â if cotton goes to twelve cents we can pay the mortgage

two miles north of the school an old black woman was shouting and waving her arms  if cotton goes to twelve cents we can pay out and be free  and she threw her apron over her head and wept gathering her children in her arms

but even as she cried a flash and tremor shook the south far away to the north a great spider sat weaving his web the office looked down from the clouds on lower broadway and was soft with velvet and leather swift silent messengers hurried in and out and mr easterly deciding the time was ripe called his henchman to him

 taylor we re ready â go south

and john taylor rose shook hands silently and went

as he entered cresswells plantation store three days later a colored woman with a little boy turned sadly away from the counter

 no aunty the clerk was telling her  calico is too high cant let you have any till we see how your cotton comes out

i just wanted a bit i promised the boy â 

 go on go on â why mr taylor  and the little boy burst into tears while he was hurried out

tightening up on the tenants asked taylor

 yes these niggers are mighty extravagant besides cotton fell a little today â eleven to ten and threefourths just a flurry i reckon had you heard

mr taylor said he had heard and he hurried on next morning the long shining wires of that great broadway web trembled and flashed again and cotton went to ten cents

 no house this year i fear quoth mr maxwell bitterly

the next day nine and a half was the quotation and men began to look at each other and asked questions

 paper says the crop is larger than the government estimate said tolliver and added  there ll be no painting this year he looked toward the smith school and thought of the five thousand dollars waiting but he hesitated john taylor had carefully mentioned seven thousand dollars as a price he was willing to pay and  perhaps more was cresswell back of taylor tolliver was suspicious and moved to delay matters

 its manipulation and speculation in new york said colonel cresswell  and the farmers league must begin operations

the local paper soon had an editorial on  our distinguished fellow citizen colonel cresswell and his efforts to revive the farmers league it was understood that colonel cresswell was risking his whole private fortune to hold the price of cotton and some effort seemed to be needed for cotton dropped to nine cents within a week swift negotiations ensued and a meeting of the executive committee of the farmers league was held in montgomery a system of warehouses and warehouse certificates was proposed

 but that will cost money responded each of the dozen big landlords who composed the committee whereupon harry cresswell introduced john taylor who represented thirty millions of southern bank stock

 i promise you credit to any reasonable amount said mr taylor  i believe in cotton â the present price is abnormal and mr taylor knew whereof he spoke for when he sent a cipher despatch north cotton dropped to eight and a half the farmers league leased three warehouses at savannah montgomery and new orleans

then silently the south gripped itself and prepared for battle men stopped spending business grew dull and millions of eyes were glued to the blackboards of the cottonexchange tighter and tighter the reins grew on the backs of the black tenants

 miss smith is yo got just a drap of coffee to lend me mr cresswell wont give me none at the store and ise just starving for some said aunt rachel from over the hill  we wont git free this year miss smith not this year she concluded plaintively

cotton fell to seven and a half cents and the muttered protest became angry denunciation why was it who was doing it

harry cresswell went to montgomery he was getting nervous the thing was too vast he could not grasp it it set his head in a whirl harry cresswell was not a bad man â are there any bad men  he was a man who from the day he first wheedled his black mammy into submission down to his thirtysixth year had seldom known what it was voluntarily to deny himself or curb a desire to rise when he would eat what he craved and do what the passing fancy suggested had long been his days programme such emptiness of life and aim had to be filled and it was filled he helped his father sometimes with the plantations but he helped spasmodically and played at work

the unregulated fire of energy and delicacy of nervous poise within him continually hounded him to the verge of excess and sometimes beyond cool quiet and gentlemanly as he was by rule of his clan the ice was thin and underneath raged unappeased fires he craved the madness of alcohol in his veins till his delicate hands trembled of mornings the women whom he bent above in languid veiledeyed homage feared lest they love him and what work was to others gambling was to him

the cotton combine then appealed to him overpoweringly â to his passion for wealth to his passion for gambling but once entered upon the game it drove him to fear and frenzy first it was a long game and harry cresswell was not trained to waiting and secondly it was a game whose intricacies he did not know in vain did he try to study the matter through he ordered books from the north he subscribed for financial journals he received special telegraphic reports only to toss them away curse his valet and call for another brandy after all he kept saying to himself what guarantee what knowledge had he that this was not a  damned yankee trick  

now that the web was weaving its last mesh in early january he haunted montgomery and on this day when it seemed that things must culminate or he would go mad he hastened again down to the planters hotel and was quickly ushered to john taylors room the place was filled with tobacco smoke an electric ticker was drumming away in one corner a telephone ringing on the desk and messenger boys hovered outside the door and raced to and fro

 well asked cresswell maintaining his composure by an effort how are things

 great  returned taylor  league holds three million bales and controls five it s the biggest corner in years

 but how s cotton  

 ticker says six and threefourths

cresswell sat down abruptly opposite taylor looking at him fixedly

 that last drop means liabilities of a hundred thousand to us he said slowly

 exactly taylor blandly admitted

beads of sweat gathered on cresswells forehead he looked at the scrawny iron man opposite who had already forgotten his presence he ordered whiskey and taking paper and pencil began to figure drinking as he figured slowly the blood crept out of his white face leaving it whiter and went surging and pounding in his heart poverty â that was what those figures spelled poverty â unclothed wineless poverty to dig and toil like a  nigger  from morning until night and to give up horses and carriages and women that was what they spelled

 how much â farther will it drop  he asked harshly

taylor did not look up

 cant tell he said   fraid not much though he glanced through a telegram no â damn it â outside mills are low they ll stampede soon meantime we ll buy

 but taylor â 

 here are one hundred thousand offered at six and threefourths

i tell you taylor â  cress well half arose

 done  cried taylor  six and onehalf clicked the machine

cresswell arose from his chair by the window and came slowly to the wide flat desk where taylor was working feverishly he sat down heavily in the chair opposite and tried quietly to regain his selfcontrol the liabilities of the cresswells already amounted to half the value of their property at a fair market valuation the cotton for which they had made debts was still falling in value every fourth of a cent fall meant â he figured it again tremblingly â meant one hundred thousand more of liabilities if cotton fell to six he had nt a cent on earth if it stayed there â  my god  he felt a faintness stealing over him but he beat it back and gulped down another glass of fiery liquor

then the one protecting instinct of his clan gripped him slowly quietly his hand moved back until it grasped the hilt of the big colts revolver that was ever with him â his thin white hand became suddenly steady as it slipped the weapon beneath the shadow of the desk

 if it goes to six he kept murmuring  we re ruined â if it goes to six â if â 

 tick sounded the wheel and the sound reverberated like sudden thunder in his ears his hand was iron and he raised it slightly  six said the wheel â his finger quivered â  and a half

 hell  yelled taylor  she s turned â there ll be the devil to pay now a messenger burst in and taylor scowled

shes loose in new york â a regular mob in new orleans â and â hark â by god theres something doing here damn it â i wish wed got another million bales lets see we ve got â  he figured while the wheel whirred â  â   â  â  

cresswell listened staggered to his feet his face crimson and his hair wild

 my god taylor he gasped  im â im a half a million ahead â great heavens 

the ticker whirred    â  â  â  then it stopped dead

exchange closed said taylor weve cornered the market all right â cornered it â dye hear cresswell we got over half the crop and we can send prices to the north star â you â why i figure it you cresswells are worth at least seven hundred and fifty thousand above liabilities this minute and john taylor leaned back and lighted a big black cigar

 ive made a million or so myself he added reflectively

cresswell leaned back in his chair his face had gone white again and he spoke slowly to still the tremor in his voice

 ive gambled â before ive gambled on cards and on horses ive gambled â for money â and â women â but â 

 but not on cotton hey well i dont know about cards and such but they cant beat cotton

 and say john taylor you re my friend cresswell stretched his hand across the desk and as he bent forward the pistol crashed to the floor

rich this was the thought that awakened harry cresswell to a sense of endless wellbeing rich no longer the mirage and semblance of wealth the memory of opulence the shadow of homage without the substance of power â no now the wealth was real cold hard dollars and in piles how much he laughed aloud as he turned on his pillow what did he care enough â enough not less than half a million perhaps threequarters of a million perhaps â was not cotton still rising â a whole round million that would mean from twentyfive to fifty thousand a year great heavens and hed been starving on a bare couple of thousand and trying to keep up appearances today the cresswells were almost millionaires aye and he might be married to more millions

he sat up with a start today mary was going north he had quite forgotten it in the wild excitement of the cotton corner he had neglected her of course there was always the hovering doubt as to whether he really wanted her or not she had the form and carriage her beauty while not startling was young and fresh and firm on the other hand there was about her a certain independence that he did not like to associate with women she had thoughts and notions of the world which were to his southern training hardly feminine and yet even they piqued him and spurred him like the sight of an untrained colt he had not seen her falter yet beneath his glances or tremble at his touch all this he desired â ardently desired but did he desire her as a wife he rather thought that he did and if so he must speak today

there was his father too to reckon with colonel cresswell with the perversity of the simpleminded had taken the sudden bettering of their fortunes as his own doing he had foreseen he had stuck it out his credit had pulled the thing through and the trust had learned a thing or two about southern gentlemen

toward john taylor he perceptibly warmed his business methods were such as a cresswell could never stoop to but he was a man of his word and colonel cresswells correspondence with mr easterly opened his eyes to the beneficent ideals of northern capital at the same time he could not consider the easterlys and the taylors and such folk as the social equals of the cresswells and his prejudice on this score must still be reckoned with

below mary taylor lingered on the porch in strange uncertainty harry cresswell would soon be coming downstairs did she want him to find her she liked him frankly undisguisedly but from the love she knew to be so near her heart she recoiled in perturbation he wooed her â whether consciously or not she was always uncertain â with every quiet attention and subtle deference with a devotion seemingly quite too delicate for words he not only fetched her flowers but flowers that chimed with day and gown and season â almost with mood he had a womans premonitions in fulfilling her wishes his hands if they touched her were soft and tender and yet he gave a curious impression of strength and poise and will

indeed in all things he was in her eyes a gentleman in the fine oldfashioned aristocracy of the term her own heart voiced all he did not say and pleaded for him to her own confusion

and yet in her heart lay the awful doubt â and the words kept ringing in her ears you will marry this man â but heaven help you if you do 

so it was that on this day when she somehow felt he would speak his footsteps on the stairs filled her with sudden panic without a word she slipped behind the pillars and ran down among the oaks and sauntered out upon the big road he caught the white flutter of her dress and smiled indulgently as he watched and waited and lightly puffed his cigarette

the morning was splendid with that first delicious languor of the spring which breathes over the southland in february mary taylor filled her lungs lifted her arms aloft and turning stepped into the deep shadow of the swamp

abruptly the air the day the scene about her subtly changed she felt a closeness and a tremor a certain brooding terror in the languid sombre winds the gold of the sunlight faded to a sickly green and the earth was black and burned a moment she paused and looked back she caught the mans silhouette against the tall white pillars of the mansion and she fled deeper into the forest with the hush of death about her and the silence which is one great voice slowly and mysteriously it loomed before her â that squat find darksome cabin which seemed so fitly set in the centre of the wilderness beside its crawling slime

she paused in sudden certainty that there lay the answer to her doubts and mistrust she felt impelled to go forward and ask â what  she did not know but something to still this war in her bosom she had seldom seen elspeth she had never been in her cabin she had felt an inconquerable aversion for the evil hag she felt it now and shivered in the warm breeze

as she came in full view of the door she paused on the step of the cabin framed in the black doorway stood zora measured by the squat cabin she seemed in height colossal slim straight as a pine motionless with one long outstretched arm pointing to where the path swept onward toward the town

it was too far for words but the scene lay strangely clear and sharpcut in the green mystery of the sunlight before that motionless fateful figure crouched a slighter smaller woman dishevelled clutching her breast she bent and rose â hesitated â seemed to plead then turning clasped in passionate embrace the child whose head was hid in zoras gown next instant she was staggering along the path whither zora pointed

slowly the sun was darkened and plaintive murmurings pulsed through the wood the oppression and fear of the swamp redoubled in mary taylor

zora gave no sign of having seen her she stood tall and still and the little goldenhaired girl still sobbed in her gown mary taylor looked up into zoras face then paused in awe it was a face she did not know it was neither the beautifully mischievous face of the girl nor the painstricken face of the woman it was a face cold and masklike regular and comely clothed in a mighty calm yet subtly masterfully veiling behind itself depths of unfathomed misery and wild revolt all this lay in its darkness

 goodmorning miss taylor

mary who was wont to teach this woman â so lately a child â searched in vain for words to address her now she stood barehaired and hesitating in the pale green light of the darkened morning it seemed fit that a deep groan of pain should gather itself from the mysterious depths of the swamp and drop like a pall on the black portal of the cabin but it brought mary taylor back to a sense of things and under a sudden impulse she spoke

 is â is anything the matter  she asked nervously

 elspeth is sick replied zora

is she very sick

yes â she has been called solemnly returned the dark young woman

mary was puzzled  called   she repeated vaguely

we heard the great cry in the night and elspeth says it is the end

it did not occur to mary taylor to question this mysticism  she all at once understood â perhaps read the riddle in the dark melancholy eyes that so steadily regarded her

 then you can leave the place zora   she exclaimed gladly

 yes i could leave

 and you will

 i dont know

 but the place looks â evil

 it is evil

and yet you will stay

zoras eyes were now fixed far above the womans head and she saw a human face forming itself in the vast rafters of the forest its eyes were wet with pain and anger

 perhaps she answered

the child furtively uncovered her face and looked at the stranger she was blueeyed and goldenhaired

whose child is this queried mary curiously

zora looked coldly down upon the child

 it is berties her mother is bad she is gone i sent her she and the others like her

 but where have you sent them  

to hell

mary taylor started under the shock impulsively she moved forward with hands that wanted to stretch themselves in appeal

 zora zora you must nt go too 

but the black girl drew proudly back

 i am there she returned with unmistakable simplicity of absolute conviction

the white woman shrank back her heart was wrung she wanted to say more â to explain to ask to help there came welling to her lips a flood of things that she would know but zoras face again was masked

 i must go she said before mary could speak  goodbye and the dark groaning depths of the cabin swallowed her

with a satisfied smile harry cresswell had seen the northern girl disappear toward the swamp for it is significant when maidens run from lovers but maidens should also come back and when after the lapse of many minutes mary did not reappear he followed her footsteps to the swamp

he frowned as he noted the footprints pointing to elspethsâ what did mary taylor want there a fear started within him and something else he was suddenly aware that he wanted this woman intensely at the moment he would have turned heaven and earth to get her he strode forward and the wood rose darkly green nbove him a long low distant moan seemed to sound upon the breeze and after it came mary taylor

he met her with tender solicitude and she was glad to feel his arm beneath hers

 ive been searching for you he said after a silence you should not wander here alone â it is dangerous  why dangerous  she asked

 wandering negroes and even wild beasts in the forest depths â and malaria â see you tremble now

 but not from malaria she slowly returned

he caught an unfamiliar note in his voice and a wild desire to justify himself before this woman clamored in his heart with it too came a cooler calculating intuition that frankness alone would win her now at all hazards he must win and he cast the die

 miss taylor he said  i want to talk to you â i have wanted to for â a year he glanced at her she was white and silent but she did not tremble he went on  i have hesitated because i do not know that i have a right to speak or explain to â to â a good woman he felt her arm tighten on his and he continued  you have been to elspeths cabin it is an evil place and has meant evil for this community and for me elspeth was my mothers favorite servant and my own mammy my mother died when i was ten and left me to her tender mercies she let me have my way and encouraged the bad in me its a wonder i escaped total ruin her cabin became a rendezvous for drinking and carousing i told my father but he in lazy indifference declared the place no worse than all negro cabins and did nothing i ceased my visits still she tried every lure and set false stories going among the negroes even when i sought to rescue zora i tell you this because i know you have heard evil rumors i have not been a good man â mary but i love you and you can make me good

perhaps no other appeal would have stirred mary taylor she was in many respects an inexperienced girl but she thought she knew the world she knew that harry cresswell was not all he should be and she knew too that many other men were not moreover she argued he had not had a fair chance all the schoolmaam in her leaped to his teaching what he needed was a superior person like herself she loved him and she deliberately put her arms about his neck and lifted her face to be kissed

back by the place of the silver fleece they wandered across the big road up to the mansion on the steps stood john taylor and helen cresswell hand in hand and they all smiled at each other the colonel came out smiling too with the paper in his hands

 easterlys right he beamed  the stock of the cotton combine â  he paused at the silence and looked up the smile faded slowly and the red blood mounted to his forehead anger struggled back of surprise but before it burst forth silently the colonel turned and muttering some unintelligible word went slowly into the house and slammed the door

so for harry cresswell the day burst flamed and waned and then suddenly went out leaving him dull and gray for mary and her brother had gone north helen had gone to bed and the colonel was in town outside the weather was gusty and lowering with a chill in the air he paced the room fitfully

well he was happy or was he happy

he gnawed his mustache for already his quick changeable nature was feeling the rebound from glory to misery he was a little ashamed of his exaltation a bit doubtful and uncertain he had stooped low to this yankee schoolmaam lower than he had ever stooped to woman usually while he played at loving women grovelled for was he not a cresswell would this woman recognize that fact and respect him accordingly

then there was zora what had she said and hinted to mary the wench was always eluding and mocking him the black devil but pshaw â he poured himself a glass of brandy â was he not rich and young the world was his

his valet knocked

 gentleman is asking if you forgits its saturday night sir  said sam

cresswell walked thoughtfully to the window swept back the curtain and looked toward the darkness and the swamp it lowered threateningly behind it the night sky was tinged with blood

 no he said  im not going and he shut out the glow

yet he grew more and more restless the devil danced in his veins and burned in his forehead his hands shook he heard a rustle of departing feet beneath his window then a pause and a faint halloo

 all right he called and in a moment went downstairs and out into the night as he closed the front door there seemed to come faintly up from the swamp a low ululation like the prolonged cry of some wild bird or the wail of ones mourning for his dead

within the cabin elspeth heard tremblingly she swayed to her feet a haggard awful sight she motioned zora away and stretching her hands palms upward to the sky cried with dry and fearstruck gasp  ise called ise called 

on the bed the child smiled in its dreaming the red flame of the firelight set the gold to dancing in her hair zora shrank back into the shadows and listened then it came she heard the heavy footsteps crashing through the underbrush â coming coming as from the end of the world she shrank still farther back and a shadow swept the door

he was a mighty man black and whitehaired and his eyes were the eyes of death he bent to enter the door and then uplifting himself and stretching his great arms his palms touched the blackened rafters

zora started forward thick memories of some forgotten past came piling in upon her where had she known him what was he to her

slowly elspeth with quivering hands unwound the black and snakelike object that always guarded her breast without a word he took it and again his hands flew heavenward with a low and fearful moan the old woman lurched sideways then crashed like a fallen pine upon the hearthstone she lay still â dead

three times the man passed his hands wavelike above the dead three times he murmured and his eyes burned into the shadows where the girl trembled then he turned and went as he had come his heavy feet crashing through the underbrush on and on fainter and fainter as to the end of the world

zora shook herself from the trancelike horror and passed her hands across her eyes to drive out the nightmare but no there lay the dead upon the hearth with the firelight flashing over her a bloated hideous twisted thing distorted in the rigor of death a moment zora looked down upon her mother she felt the cold body whence the wandering wrecked soul had passed she sat down and stared death in the face for the first time a mighty questioning arose within a questioning and a yearning

was elspeth now at peace was death the way â the wide dark way she had never thought of it before and as she thought she crept forward and looked into the fearful face pityingly

 mammy  she whispered â with bated breath â  mammy elspeth  out of the night came a whispered answer elspeth elspeth 

zora sprang to her feet alert fearful with a swing of her arm she pulled the great oaken door to and dropped the bar into its place over the dead she spread a clean white sheet into the fire she thrust pineknots they glared in vague red and shadowy brilliance waving and quivering and throwing up thin swirling columns of black smoke then standing beside the fireplace with the white still corpse between her and the door she took up her awful vigil

there came a low knocking at the door then silence and footsteps wandering furtively about the night seemed all footsteps and whispers there came a louder knocking and a voice  elspeth elspeth open the door its me

then muttering and wandering noises and silence again

the child on the bed turned itself murmuring uneasily in its dreams and then they came zora froze watching the door wideeyed while the fire flamed redder a loud quick knock at the door â a pause â an oath and a cry

 elspeth open this door damn you 

a moment of waiting and then the knocking came again furious and long continued outside there was much trampling and swearing zora did not move the child slept on a tugging and dragging a dull blow that set the cabin quivering thenâ  bang crack crash â the door wavered splintered and dropped upon the floor

with a snarl a crowd of some halfdozen white faces rushed forward wavered and stopped the awakened child sat up and stared with wide blue eyes slowly with no word the intruders turned and went silently away leaving but one late comer who pressed forward

what damned mummery is this he cried and snatching at the sheet dragged it from the black distorted countenance of the corpse he shuddered but for a moment he could not stir he felt the midnight eyes of the girl â he saw the twisted oozing mouth of the hag blueblack and hideous

suddenly back behind there in the darkness a shriek split the night like a sudden flash of flame â a great ringing scream that cracked and swelled and stopped with one wild effort the man hurled himself out the door and plunged through the darkness panting and cursing he flashed his huge revolver â bang bang bang  it cracked into the night the sweat poured from his forehead the terror of the swamp was upon him with a struggling and tearing in his throat he tripped and fell fainting under the silent oaks

the silver fleece darkly cloaked and girded lay in the cotton warehouse of the cresswells near the store its silken fibres cramped and close shone yellowwhite in the sunlight sadly soiled yet beautiful many came to see zoras twin bales as they lay handling them and questioning while colonel cresswell grew proud of his possession

the world was going well with the colonel freed from money cares praised for his generalship in the cotton corner able to entertain sumptuously he was again a southern gentleman of the older school and so in his envied element yet today he frowned as he stood poking absently with his cane at the baled fleece

this marriage â or rather these marriages â were not to his liking it was a mesalliance of a sort that pricked him tenderly it savored grossly of bargain and sale his neighbors regarded it with disconcerting equanimity they seemed to think an alliance with northern millions an honor for cresswell blood and the colonel thumped the nearer bale vigorously his cane slipped along the iron bands suddenly and the old man lurching forward clutched in space to save himself and touched a human hand

zora sitting shadowed on the farther bale drew back her hand quickly at the contact and started to move away

 who s that   thundered the colonel more angry at his involuntary fright than at the intrusion  here boys 

but zora had come forward into the space where the sunlight of the wide front doors poured in upon the cotton bales

 it s me colonel she said

he glared at her she was taller and thinner than formerly darkly transparent of skin and her dark eyes shone in strange and dusky brilliance still indignant and surprised the colonel lifted his voice sharply

what the devil are you doing here â sleeping when you ought to be at work get out and see here next week cotton chopping begins â you ll go to the fields or to the chaingang i ll have no more of your loafing about my place

awaiting no reply the colonel already half ashamed of his vehemence stormed out into the sunlight and climbed upon his bay mare

but zora still stood silent in the shadow of the silver fleece hearing and yet not hearing she was searching for the way groping for the threads of life seeking almost wildly to understand the foundations of understanding piteously asking for answer to the puzzle of life all the while the walls rose straight about her and narrow to continue in school meant charity yet she had nowhere to go and nothing to go with to refuse to work for the cresswells meant trouble for the school and perhaps arrest for herself to work in the fields meant endless toil and a vista that opened upon death

like a hunted thing the girl turned and twisted in thought and faced everywhere the blank impossible cold and dreamlike without her shut teeth held back seething fires within and a spirit of revolt that gathered wildness as it grew above all flew the dream the phantasy the memory of the past the vision of the future over and over she whispered to herself  this is not the end this can not be the end

somehow somewhere would come salvation yet what it would be and what she expected she did not know she sought the way but what way and whither she did not know she dared not dream

one thing alone lay in her wild fancy like a great and wonderful fact dragging the dream to earth and anchoring it there that was the silver fleece like a brooding mother zora had watched it she knew how the gin had been cleaned for its pressing and how it had been baled apart and carefully covered she knew how proud colonel cresswell was of it and how daily he had visitors to see it and finger the wide white wound in its side

 yes sir grown on my place by my niggers sir  he assured them and they marvelled

to zoras mind this beautiful baled fibre was hers it typified happiness it was an holy thing which profane hands had stolen when it came back to her as come it must she cried with clenched hands it would bring happiness not the great happiness â that was gone forever â but illumination atonement and something of the power and the glory so involuntarily almost she haunted the cotton storehouse flitting like a dark and silent ghost in among the workmen greeting them with her low musical voice warding them with the cold majesty of her eyes each day afraid of some last parting each night triumphant â it was still there

the colonel â zora already forgotten â rode up to the cresswell oaks pondering darkly it was bad enough to contemplate helens marriage in distant prospect but the sudden almost peremptory desire for marrying at eastertide a little less than two months away was absurd there were  business reasons arising from the presidential campaign in the fall john taylor had telegraphed but there was already too much business in the arrangement to suit the colonel with harry it was different indeed it was his own quiet suggestion that made john taylor hurry matters

harry trusted to the novelty of his fathers new wealth to make the latter complacent he himself felt an impatient longing for the haven of a home he had been too long untethered he distrusted himself the devil within was too fond of taking the bit in his teeth he would remember to his dying day one awful shriek in the night as of a soul tormenting and tormented he wanted the protection of a good woman and sometimes against the clear whiteness of her letters so joyous and generous even if a bit prim and didactic he saw a vision of himself reflected as he was and he feared

it was distinctly disconcerting to colonel cresswell to find harry quite in favor of early nuptials and to learn that the sole objection even in helens mind was the improbability of getting a weddinggown in time helen had all a childs naive love for beautiful and dainty things and a weddinggown from paris had been her life dream on this point therefore there ensued spirited arguments and much correspondence and both her brother and her lover evinced characteristic interest in the planning

said harry  sis i ll cable to paris today they can easily hurry the thing along

helen was delighted she handed over a telegram just received from john taylor  send me express two bales best cotton you can get

the colonel read the message a i dont see the connection between this and hurrying up a weddinggown he growled none of them discerned the handwriting of destiny

 neither do i said harry who detected yielding in his fathers tone  but wed better send him the two prize bales it will be a fine advertisement of our plantation and evidently he has a surprise in store for us

the colonel affected to hesitate but next morning the silver fleece went to town

zora watched it go and her heart swelled and died within her she walked to town to the station she did not see mrs vanderpool arriving from new orleans but mrs vanderpool saw her and looked curiously at the tall tragic figure that leaned so dolorously beside the freight car the bales were loaded into the express car the train pulled away its hoarse snorting waking vague echoes in the forest beyond but to the girl who stood at the end looking outward to darkness those echoes roared like the crack of doom a passing band of contract hands called to her mockingly and one black giant laughing loudly gripped her hand

 come honey he shouted  you se adreaming come on honey 

she turned abruptly and gripped his hand as one drowning grips anything offered â gripped till he winced she laughed a loud mirthless laugh that came pouring like a sob from her deep lungs

 come on she mocked and joined them

they were a motley crowd ragged swaggering jolly there were husky biglimbed youths and boldfaced loudtongued girls tomorrow they would start upcountry to some backwoods barony in the kingdom of cotton and work till christmas time today was the last in town there was craftily advanced money in their pockets and riot in their hearts in the gathering twilight they marched noisily through the streets in their midst wideeyed and laughing almost hysterically marched zora

mrs vanderpool meantime rode thoughtfully out of town toward cresswell oaks she was returning from witnessing the mardi gras festivities at new orleans and at the urgent invitation of the cresswells had stopped off she might even stay to the wedding if the new plans matured

mrs vanderpool was quite upset her french maid on whom she had depended absolutely for five years or more had left her

 i think i want to try a colored maid she told the cresswells laughingly as they drove home  they have sweet voices and they cant doff their uniform helene without her cap and apron was often mistaken for a lady and while i was in new orleans a french confectioner married her under some such delusion now have nt you a girl about here who would do  

 no declared harry decisively but his sister suggested that she might ask miss smith at the colored school

again mrs vanderpool laughed but after tea she wandered idly down the road the sun behind the swamp was crimsoning the world mrs vanderpool strolled alone to the school and saw sarah smith there was no cordiality in the latters greeting but when she heard the callers errand her attention was at once arrested and held the interests of her charges were always uppermost in her mind

cant i have the girl zora mrs vanderpool at last inquired

miss smith started for she was thinking of zora at that very instant the girl was later than usual and she was momentarily expecting to see her tall form moving languidly up the walk

she gave mrs vanderpool a searching look mrs vanderpool glanced involuntarily at her gown and smiled as she did it

 could i trust you with a human soul  asked miss smith abruptly

mrs vanderpool looked up quickly the half mocking answer that rose involuntarily to her lips was checked within mrs vanderpool was a little puzzled at herself why had she asked for this girl she had felt a strange interest in her â a peculiar human interest since she first saw her and as she saw her again this afternoon but would she make a satisfactory maid was it not a rather dangerous experiment why had she asked for her she certainly had not intended to when she entered the house

in the silence miss smith continued  here is a child in whom the fountains of the great deep are suddenly broken up with peace and care she would find herself for she is strong but here there is no peace slavery of soul and body awaits her and i am powerless to protect her she must go away that going away may make or ruin her she knows nothing of working for wages and she has not the servants humility but she has loyalty and pluck for one she loves there is nothing she would not do but she cannot be driven or rather if she is driven it may rouse in her the devil incarnate she needs not exactly affection â she would almost resent that â but intelligent interest and care in return for this she will gradually learn to serve and serve loyally frankly mrs vanderpool i would not have chosen you for this task of human education indeed you would have been my last thought â you seem to me â i speak plainly â a worldly woman yet perhaps â who can tell â god has especially set you to this task at any rate i have little choice i am at my wits end elspeth the mother of this child is not long dead and here is the girl beautiful unprotected and here am i almost helpless she is in debt to the cresswells and they are pressing the claim to her service take her if you can get her â it is i fear her only chance mind you â if you can persuade her and that may be impossible

 where is she now 

miss smith glanced out at the darkening landscape and then at her watch

 i do not know shes very late shes given to wandering but usually she is here before this time

 i saw her in town this afternoon said mrs vanderpool

 zora in town  miss smith rose  i ll send her to you tomorrow she said quietly mrs vanderpool had hardly reached the oaks before miss smith was driving toward town

a small cabin on the towns ragged fringe was crowded to suffocation within arose noisy shouts loud songs and raucous laughter the scraping of a fiddle and whine of an accordion liquor began to appear and happy faces grew redeyed and sodden as the dances whirled at the edge of the orgy stood zora wildeyed and bewildered mad with the pain that gripped her heart and hammered in her head crying in tune with the frenzied music â  the end â the end 

abruptly she recognized a face despite the wreck and ruin of its beauty

 bertie  she cried as she seized the mother of little emma by the arm

the woman staggered and offered her glass

 drink she cried  drink and forget

in a moment zora sprang forward and seized the burning liquid in both hands a dozen hands clapped a devils tattoo a score of voices yelled and laughed the shriek of the music was drowned beneath the thunder of stamping feet men reeled to singing womens arms but above the roar rose the song of the voice of zora â she glided to the middle of the room standing tiptoed with skirts that curled and turned she threw back her head raised the liquor to her lips paused â and looked into the face of miss smith

a silence fell like a lightning flash on the room as that white face peered in at the door slowly zoras hands fell and her eyes blinked as though waking from some awful dream she staggered toward the womans outstretched arms 

late that night the girl lay close in miss smiths motherly embrace

 i was going to hell  she whispered trembling

why zora asked miss smith calmly

 i could nt find the way â and i wanted to forget

 people in hell dont forget was the matteroffact comment  and zora what way do you seek the way where

zora sat up in bed and lifted a gray and stricken face

 its a lie she cried with hoarse earnestness  the way nowhere there is no way you know â i want him â i want nothing on earth but him â and him i cant ever have

the older woman drew her down tenderly

 no zora she said  theres something you want more than him and something you can have 

 what  asked the wondering girl

 his respect said sarah smith  and i know the way

mrs vanderpool watched zora as she came up the path beneath the oaks  she walks well she observed and laying aside her book she waited with a marked curiosity

the girls greeting was brief almost curt but unintentionally so as one could easily see for back in her eyes lurked an impatient hunger she was not thinking of greetings she murmured a quick word and stood straight and tall with her eyes squarely on the lady

in the depths of mrs vanderpools heart something strange â not new but very old â stirred before her stood this tall black girl quietly returning her look mrs vanderpool had a most uncomfortable sense of being judged of being weighedâ and there arose within her an impulse to selfjustification

she smiled and said sweetly wont you sit but despite all this her mind seemed leaping backward a thousand years back to a simpler primal day when she herself white frail and fettered stood before the dusky magnificence of some bejewelled barbarian queen and sought to justify herself she shook off the phantasyâ and yet how well the girl stood it was not every one that could stand still and well

 please sit down she repeated with her softest charm not dreaming that outside the school white persons did not ask this girl to sit in their presence but even this did not move zora she sat down there was in her w alking standing sitting a simple directness which mrs vanderpool sensed and met

 zora i need some one to help me â to do my hair and serve my coffee and dress and take care of me the work will not be hard and you can travel and see the world and live well would you like it 

 but i do not know how to do all these things returned zora slowly she was thinking rapidly â was this the way it sounded wonderful the world the great mysterious world that stretched beyond the swamp and into which bles and the silver fleece had gone â did it lead to the way but if she went there what would she see and do and would it be possible to become such a woman as miss smith pictured

 what is the world like  asked zora

mrs vanderpool smiled  oh i meant great active cities and buildings myriads of people and wonderful sights

yes â but back of it all what is it really what does it look like 

 heavens child dont ask really it is nt worth while peering back of things one is sure to be disappointed

 then whats the use of seeing the world 

 why one must live and why not be happy   answered mrs vanderpool amused baffled spurred for the time being from her chronic ennui

are you happy retorted zora looking her over carefully from silken stockings to garden hat mrs

vanderpool laid aside her little mockery and met the situation bravely

 no she replied simply her eyes grew old and tired

involuntarily zoras hand crept out protectingly and lay a moment over the white jewelled fingers then quickly recovering herself she started hastily to withdraw it but the womans fingers closed around the darker ones and mrs vanderpools eyes became dim  i need you zora she said and then seeing the halfformed question yes and you need me we need each other in the world lies opportunity and i will help you

zora rose abruptly and mrs vanderpool feared with a tightening of heart that she had lost this strangely alluring girl

 i will come tomorrow said zora

as mrs vanderpool went in to lunch reaction and lingering doubts came trouping back to replace the daintiest of trained experts with the most baffling semibarbarian well

 have you hired a maid  asked helen

 ive engaged zora laughed mrs vanderpool lightly  and now im wondering whether i have a jewel or â a white elephant

 probably neither remarked harry cresswell drily but he avoided the ladys inquiring eyes

next morning zora came easily into mrs vanderpools life there was little she knew of her duties but little too that she could not learn with a deftness and divination almost startling her quietness her quickness her young strength were like a soothing balm to the tired woman of fashion and within a week she had sunk back contentedly into zoras strong arms

 its a jewel she decided

with this verdict the house agreed the servants waited on  miss zora  gladly the men scarcely saw her and the ladies ran to her for help in all sorts harry cresswell looked upon this transformation with an amused smile but the colonel saw in it simply evidence of dangerous obstinacy in a black girl who hitherto had refused to work

zora had been in the house but a week when a large express package was received from john taylor its unwrapping brought a cry of pleasure from the ladies there lay a bolt of silkenlike cambric of wondrous fineness and lustre marked  for the weddingdress the explanation accompanied the package that mary taylor had a similar piece in the north

helen and harry said nothing of the cablegram to the paris tailor and helen took no steps toward having the cambric dress made not even when the wedding invitations appeared

 a cresswell married in cotton  helen was almost in tears lest the paris gown be delayed and sure enough a cablegram came at last saying that there was little likelihood of the gown being ready by easter it would be shipped at the earliest convenience but it could hardly catch the necessary boat helen had a good cry and then came a wild rush to get john taylors cloth ready still helen was querulous she decided that silk embroidery must embellish the skirt the dressmaker was in despair

 i have nt a single spare worker she declared

helen was appealing to mrs vanderpool

 i can do it said zora who was in the room

do you know how asked the dressmaker

 no but i want to know

mrs vanderpool gave a satisfied nod  show her she said the dressmaker was on the edge of rebellion  zora sews beautifully added mrs vanderpool

thus the beautiful cloth came to zoras room and was spread in a glossy cloud over her bed she trembled at its beauty and felt a vague inner yearning as if some subtle magic of the woven web were trying to tell her its story

she worked over it faithfully and lovingly in every spare hour and in long nights of dreaming wilfully she departed from the set pattern and sewed into the cloth something of the beauty in her heart in new and intricate ways with soft shadowings and coverings she wove in that white veil her own strange soul and mrs vanderpool watched her curiously but in silence

meantime all things were arranged for a double wedding at cresswell oaks as john and mary taylor had no suitable home they were to come down and the two brides to go forth from the cresswell mansion accordingly the taylors arrived a week before the wedding and the home took on a festive air even colonel cresswell expanded under the genial influences and while his head still protested his heart was glad he had to respect john taylors undoubted ability and mary taylor was certainly lovely in spite of that assumption of cleverness of which the colonel could not approve

mary returned to the old scenes with mingled feelings especially was she startled at seeing zora a member of the household and apparently high in favor it brought back something of the old uneasiness and suspicion

all this she soon forgot under the cadence of harry cresswells pleasant voice and the caressing touch of his arm he seemed handsomer than ever and he was for sleep and temperance and the wooing of a woman had put a tinge in his marble face smoothed the puffs beneath his eyes and given him a more distinguished bearing and a firmer hand and mary taylor was very happy so was her brother only differently he was making money he was planning to make more and he had something to pet which seemed to him extraordinarily precious and valuable

taylor eagerly inquired after the cloth and followed the ladies to zoras room adjoining mrs vanderpools to see it it lay uncut and shimmering covered with dim silken tracery of a delicacy and beauty which brought an exclamation to all lips

 thats what we can do with alabama cotton cried john taylor in triumph

they turned to him incredulously

 butâ

 no  buts  about it these are the two bales you sent me woven with a silk woof no one particularly noticed that zora had hastily left the room  i had it done in easterlys new jersey mills according to an old plan of mine im going to make cloth like that right in this county some day and he chuckled gayly

but zora was striding up and down the halls the blood surging in her ears after they were gone she came back and closed the doors she dropped on her knees and buried her face in the filmy folds of the silver fleece

 i knew it i knew it  she whispered in mingled tears and joy  it called and i did not understand

it was her talisman newfound her love come back her stolen dream come true now she could face the world god had turned it straight again she would go into the world and find â not love but the thing greater than love outside the door came voices â the dressmakers tones helens soft drawl and mrs vanderpools finished accents her face went suddenly gray the silver fleece was not hers it belonged â she rose hastily the door opened and they came in the cutting must begin at once they all agreed

 is it ready zora  inquired helen

 no zora quietly answered  not quite but tomorrow morning early as soon as she was alone again she sat down and considered by and by while the family was at lunch she folded the silver fleece carefully and locked it in her new trunk she would hide it in the swamp during the afternoon she sent to town for oilcloth and bade the black carpenter at miss smiths make a cedar box tight and tarred in the morning she prepared mrs vanderpools breakfast with unusual care she was sorry for mrs vanderpool and sorry for miss smith they would not they could not understand what would happen to her she did not know she did not care the silver fleece had returned to her soon it would be buried in the swamp whence it came she had no alternative she must keep it and wait

she heard the dressmakers voice and then her step upon the stair she heard the sound of harry cresswells buggy and a scurrying at the front door on came the dressmakers footsteps â then her door was unceremoniously burst open

helen cresswell stood there radiant the dressmaker too was wreathed in smiles she carried a big redsealed bundle

 zora  cried helen in ecstasy  its come  zora regarded her coldly and stood at bay the dressmaker was ripping and snipping and soon there lay revealed before them â the paris gown

helen was in raptures but her conscience pricked her she appealed to them  ought i to tell you see marys gown will look miserably common beside it

the dressmaker was voluble there was really nothing to tell and besides helen was a cresswell and it was to be expected and so forth helen pursed her lips and petulantly tapped the floor with her foot

 but the other gown  

where is it asked the dressmaker looking about  it would make a pretty morningdress â 

but helen had taken a sudden dislike to the thought of it

 i dont want it she declared  and besides i have nt room for it in my trunks

of a sudden she leaned down and whispered to zora  zora hide it and keep it if you want it come to the dressmaker  im dying to try this on â now   

remember zora â not a word and all this to zora seemed no surprise it was the way and it was opening before her because the talisman lay in her trunk

so at last it came to easter morning the world was golden with jasmine and crimson with azalea down in the darker places gleamed the misty glory of the dogwood new cotton shook glimmered and blossomed in the black fields and over all the soft southern sun poured its awakening light of life there was happiness and hope again in the cabins and hope and â if not happiness ambition in the mansions

zora almost forgetting the wedding stood before the mirror laying aside her dress she draped her shimmering cloth about her dragging her hair down in a heavy mass over ears and neck until she seemed herself a bride and as she stood there awed with the mystical union of a dead love and a living new born self there came drifting in at the window faintly the soft sound of faroff marriage music

 tis thy marriage morning shining in the sun 

two white and whiteswathed brides were coming slowly down the great staircase of cresswell oaks and two white and blackclothed bridegrooms awaited them either bridegroom looked gladly at the flow of his sisters garments and almost darkly at his brides for helen was decked in parisian splendor while mary was gowned in the fleece

 tis thy marriage morning shining in the sun 

up floated the song of the little darkfaced children and zora listened

bles alwyn was seated in the anteroom of senator smiths office in washington the senator had not come in yet and there were others waiting too

the young man sat in a corner dreaming washington was his first great city and it seemed a neverending delight â the streets the buildings the crowds the shops and lights and noise the kaleidoscopic panorama of a worlds doing the myriad forms and faces the talk and laughter of men it was all wonderful magic to the country boy and he stretched his arms and filled his lungs and cried  here i shall live 

especially was he attracted by his own people they seemed transformed revivified changed some might be mistaken for field hands on a holiday â but not many others he did not recognize â they seemed strange and alien â sharper quicker and at once more overbearing and more unscrupulous

there were yet others â and at the sight of these bles stood straighter and breathed like a man they were well dressed and well appearing men and women who walked upright and looked one in the eye and seemed like persons of affairs and money they had arrived â they were men â they filled his minds ideal â he felt like going up to them and grasping their hands and saying  at last brother  ah it was good to find ones dreams walking in the light in flesh and blood continually such thoughts were surging through his brain and they were rioting through it again as he sat waiting in senator smiths office

the senator was late this morning when he came in he glanced at the morning paper before looking over his mail and the list of his callers  do fools like the american people deserve salvation   he sneered holding off the headlines and glancing at them

  league beats trust     farmers of south smash effort to bear market    send cotton to twelve cents    common people triumph  a man is induced to bite off his own nose and then to sing a pâan of victory it s nauseating â senseless there is no earthly use striving for such blockheads theyd crucify any saviour thus half consciously senator smith salved his conscience while he extracted a certificate of deposit for fifty thousand dollars from his new york mail he thrust it aside from his secretarys view and looked at his list as he rang the bell there was representative todd and somebody named alwyn â nobody of importance easterly was due in a halfhour he would get rid of todd meantime

 poor todd he mused  a lamb for the slaughter

but he patiently listened to him plead for party support and influence for his bill to prohibit gambling in futures

 i was warned that it was useless to see you senator smith but i would come i believe in you frankly there is a strong group of your old friends and followers forming against you they met only last night but i did not go wont you take a stand on some of these progressive matters â this bill or the child labor movement or low tariff legislation 

mr smith listened but shook his head

 when the time comes he announced deliberately  i shall have something to say on several of these matters at present i can only say that i cannot support this bill and mr todd was ushered out he met mr easterly coming in and greeted him effusively he knew him only as a rich philanthropist who had helped the neighborhood guild in washington â one of todds hobbies

easterly greeted smith quietly

 got my letter 

 yes

 here are the three bills you will go on the finance committee tomorrow sumdrich is chairman by courtesy but you ll have the real power put the child labor bill first and we ll work the press the tariff will take most of the session of course we ll put the cotton inspection bill through in the last days of the session â see im manoeuvring to get the southern congressmen into line    oh one thing thompson says he s a little worried about the negroes says theres something more than froth in the talk of a bolt in the northern negro vote we may have to give them a little extra money and a few more minor offices than usual talk with thompson the negroes are sweet on you and hes going to be the new chairman of the campaign you know ever met him  

 yes

 well â so long

 just a moment the statesman stayed the financier

 todd just let fall something of a combination against us in congress â know anything of it  

not definitely i heard some rumors better see if you can run it down well i must hurry â good day while bles alwyn in the outer office was waiting and musing a lady came in out of the corner of his eye he caught the curve of her gown and as she seated herself beside him the suggestion of a faint perfume a vague resentment rose in him colored women would look as well as that he argued with the clothes and wealth and training he paused however in his thought he did not want them like the whites â so cold and formal and precise without heart or marrow he started up for the secretary was speaking to him

 are you the â er â the man who had a letter to the senator 

 yes sir

 let me see it oh yes â he will see you in a moment

bles was returning the letter to his pocket when he heard a voice almost at his ear

 i beg your pardon â 

he turned and started it was the lady next to him and she was colored not extremely colored but undoubtedly colored with waving black hair light brown skin and the fuller facial curving of the darker world and yet bles was surprised for everything else about her â her voice her bearing the set of her gown her gloves and shoes the whole impression was â bles hesitated for a word â well  white

 yes â yes maam he stammered becoming suddenly conscious that the lady had now a second time asked him if he was acquainted with senator smith  that is maam â why was he saying  maam like a child or a servant â i know his sister and have a letter for him

do you live in washington she inquired

no â but i want to ive been trying to get in as a clerk and i have nt succeeded yet thats what im going to see senator smith about

 have you had the civilservice examinations  

 yes i made ninetythree in the examination for a treasury clerkship

and no appointment i see â they are not partial to us there

bles was glad to hear her say  us

she continued after a pause  may i venture to ask a favor of you 

 certainly he responded

 my name is wynn lowering her voice slightly and leaning toward him  there are so many ahead of me and i am in a hurry to get to my school but i must see the senator â couldnt i go in with you i think i might be of service in this matter of the examination and then perhaps id get a chance to say a word for myself  id be very glad to have you come said bles cordially

the secretary hesitated a little when the two started in but miss wynns air was so quietly assured that he yielded

senator smith looked at the tall straight black man with his smooth skin and frank eyes and for a second time that morning a vision of his own youth dimmed his eyes but he spoke coldly  mr alwyn i believe

 yes sir

 and â 

 my friend miss wynn

the senator glanced at miss wynn and she bowed demurely then he turned to alwyn

 well mr alwyn washington is a bad place to start in the world

bles looked surprised and incredulous he could conceive of no finer startingplace but he said nothing

 it is a grave continued the senator  of ambitions and ideals you would far better go back to alabama  â pausing and looking at the young man keenly â  but you wont â you wont â not yet at any rate and bles shook his head slowly

no â well what can i do for you

 i want work â i ll do anything

 no you ll do one thing â be a clerk and then if you have the right stuff in you you will throw up that job in a year and start again

 id like at least to try it sir

well i cant help you much there thats in civilservice and you must take the examination

 i have sir

 so  where and what mark  

 in the treasury department i got a mark of ninetythree

what â and no appointment the senator was incredulous

no sir not yet

here miss wynn interposed

 you see senator she said  civilservice rules are not always impervious to race prejudice

the senator frowned

 do you mean to intimate that mr alwyns appointment is held up because he is colored 

 i do

 well â well  the senator rang for a clerk

 get me the treasury on the telephone

in a moment the bell rang

i want mr cole is that you mr cole goodmorning have you a young man named alwyn on your eligible list what yes a pause indeed well why has he no appointment of course i know he s a negro yes i desire it very much â thank you

 you ll get an appointment tomorrow morning and the senator rose how is my sister he asked absently

 she was looking worried but hopeful of the new endowment when i left the senator held out his hand bles took it and then remembered

 oh i beg pardon but miss wynn wanted a word on another matter

the senator turned to miss wynn

 i am a schoolteacher senator smith and like all the rest of us i am deeply interested in the appointment of the new schoolboard

 but you know the district committee attends to those things said the senator hastily  and then too i believe there is talk of abolishing the schoolboard and concentrating power in the hands of the superintendent

 precisely said miss wynn  and i came to tell you senator smith that the interests which are back of this attack upon the schools are no friends of yours miss wynn extracted from her reticule a typewritten paper

he took the paper and read it intently then he keenly scrutinized the young woman and she steadily returned his regard

 how am i to know this is true 

 follow it up and see

he mused

 where did you get these facts   he asked suddenly

she smiled

 it is hardly necessary to say

 and yet he persisted  if i were sure of its source i would know my ground better and â my obligation to you would be greater

she laughed and glanced toward alwyn he had moved out of earshot and was waiting by the window

 i am a teacher in the m street high school she said  and we have some intelligent boys there who work their way through

 yes said the senator

 some continued miss wynn tapping her boot on the carpet  some â wait on table

the senator slowly put the paper in his pocket

 and now he said  miss wynn what can i do for you  

she looked at him

 if judge haynes is reappointed to the schoolboard i shall probably continue to teach in the m street high school she said slowly

the senator made a memorandum and said  i shall not forget miss wynn â nor her friends and he bowed glancing at alwyn

the woman contemplated bles in momentary perplexity then bowing in turn left bles followed debating just what he ought to say how far he might venture to accompany her what â but she easily settled it all

 i thank you â goodbye she said briefly at the door and was gone bles did not know whether to feel relieved or provoked or disappointed and by way of compromise felt something of all three

the next morning he received notice of his appointment to a clerkship in the treasury department at a salary of nine hundred dollars the sum seemed fabulous and he was in the seventh heaven for many days the consciousness of wealth the new duties the street scenes and the city life kept him more than busy he planned to study and arranged with a professor at howard university to guide him he bought an armful of books and a desk and plunged desperately to work

gradually as he became used to the office routine and in the hours when he was weary of study he began to find time hanging a little heavily on his hands indeed â although he would not acknowledge it â he was getting lonesome homesick amid the myriad men of a busy city he argued to himself that this was absurd and yet he knew that he was longing for human companionship when he looked about him for fellowship he found himself in a strange dilemma those black folk in whom he recognized the old sweettempered negro traits had also looser uglier manners than he was accustomed to from which he shrank the upper classes of negroes on the other hand he still observed from afar they were strangers not only in acquaintance but because of a curious coldness and aloofness that made them cease to seem his own kind they seemed almost at times like black white people â strangers in way and thought

he tried to shake off this feeling but it clung and at last in sheer desperation he promised to go out of a night with a fellow clerk who rather boasted of the  people  he knew he was soon tired of the strange company and had turned to go home when he met a newcomer in the doorway

 why hello sam sam stillings   he exclaimed delightedly and was soon grasping the hand of a slim welldressed man of perhaps thirty with yellow face curling hair and shifting eyes

 well of all things bles â er â ah â mr alwyn  thought you were hoeing cotton

bles laughed and continued shaking his hand he was foolishly glad to see the former cresswell butler whom he had known but slightly his face brought back unuttered things that made his heart beat faster and a yearning surge within him

 i thought you went to chicago cried bles

 i did but goin into politics â having entered the political field i came here and you graduated i suppose and all that 

 no bles admitted a little sadly as he told of his coming north and of senator smiths influence  but â but how are â all  

abruptly sam hooked his arm into alwyns and pulled him with him down the street stillings was a type up from servility and menial service he was struggling to climb to money and power he was shrewd willing to stoop to anything in order to win the very slights and humiliations of prejudice he turned to his advantage when he learned all the particulars of alwyns visit to senator smith and his cordial reception he judged it best to keep in touch with this young man and he forthwith invited bles to accompany him the next night to the fifteenth street presbyterian church

youll find the best people there he said the aristocracy the treble clef gives a concert and everybody that s anybody will be there

they met again the following evening and proceeded to the church it was a simple but pleasant auditorium nearly filled with welldressed people during the programme bles applauded vociferously every number that pleased him which is to say every one â and stamped his feet until he realized that he was attracting considerable attention to himself then the entertainment straightway lost all its charm he grew painfully embarrassed and for the remainder of the evening was awkwardly selfconscious when all was over the audience rose leisurely and stood in little knots and eddies laughing and talking many moved forward to say a word to the singers and players stillings stepped aside to a group of men and bles was left miserably alone a man came to him a whitefaced man with slightly curling close gray hair and highbred ascetic countenance

 you are a stranger  he asked pleasantly and bles liked him

 yes sir he answered and they fell to talking he discovered that this was the pastor of the church

 do you know no one in town  

 one or two of my fellow clerks and mr stillings oh yes i ve met miss wynn

 why here is miss wynn now

bles turned she was right behind him the centre of a group she turned slowly and smiled

 oh  she uttered twice but with difference cadence then something like amusement lurked a moment in her eye and she quietly presented bles to her friends while stillings hovered unnoticed in the offing   miss jones â mr alwyn of â  she paused a second â  alabama miss taylor â mr alwyn â and

with a backward curving of her neck  mr teerswell and so on mr teerswell was handsome and indolent with indecision in his face and a cynical voice in a moment bles felt the subtle antagonism of the group he was an intruder mr teerswell nodded easily and turned away continuing his conversation with the ladies

but miss wynn was perverse and interrupted mi saw you enjoyed the concert mr alwyn she said and one of the young ladies rippled audibly bles darkened painfully realizing that these people must have been just behind him but he answered frankly  yes i did immensely â i hope i did nt disturb you you see im not used to hearing such singing

mr teerswell compelled to listen laughed drily

m plantation melodies i suppose are more your specialty he said with a slight cadence

 yes said bles simply a slight pause ensued

then came the surprise of the evening for bles alwyn even his inexperienced eye could discern that miss wynn was very popular and that most of the men were rivals for her attentions

 mr alwyn she said graciously rising  im going to trouble you to see me to my door its only a block goodnight all  she called but she bowed to mr teerswell

miss wynn placed her hand lightly on bless arm and for a moment he paused a thrill ran through him as he felt again the weight of a little hand and saw beside him the dark beautiful eyes of a girl he felt again the warm quiver of her body then he awoke to the lighted church and the moving welldressed throng the hand on his arm was not so small but it was wellgloved and somehow the fancy struck him that it was a cold hand and not always sympathetic in its touch

i did not know the world was so large remarked zora as she and mrs vanderpool flew east and northward on the new yorknew orleans limited for a long time the girl had given herself up to the sheer delight of motion gazing from the window she compared the lands she passed with the lands she knew noting the formation of the cotton the kind and growth of the trees the state of the roads then the comparisons became infinite endless the world stretched on and on until it seemed mere distance and she suddenly realized how vast a thing it was and spoke

mrs vanderpool was amused  its much smaller than one would think she responded

when they came to atlanta zora stared and wrinkled her brows it was her first large city the other towns were replicas of toomsville strange in number not in kind but this was different and she could not understand it it seemed senseless and unreasonable and yet so strangely so that she was at a loss to ask questions she was very solemn as they rode on and night came down with dreams

she awoke in washington to new fairylands and wonders the endless going and coming of men great piles that challenged heaven and homes crowded on homes till one could not believe that they were full of living things they rolled by baltimore and philadelphia and she talked of everyday matters of the sky which alone stood steadfast amid whirling change of bits of empty earth that shook themselves here and there loose from their burden of men and lay naked in the cold shining sunlight

all the while the greater questions were beating and curling and building themselves back in her brain and above all she was wondering why no one had told her before of all this mighty world mrs vanderpool to whom it seemed too familiar for comment had said no word or if she had spoken zoras ears had not been tuned to understand and as they flew toward the towering ramparts of new york she sat up big with the terror of a new thought suppose this world were full yet of things she did not know nor dream of how could she find out she must know

when finally they were settled in new york and sat high up on the fifth avenue front of the hotel gradually the inarticulate questioning found words albeit strange ones

 it reminds me of the swamp she said

mrs vanderpool just returned from a shopping tour burst into laughter

 it is â but i marvel at your penetration

 i mean it is moving â always moving

 the swamp seemed to me unearthly still

yes â yes cried zora eagerly brushing back the rumpled hair  and so did the city at first to me

still new york

 yes you see i saw the buildings and forgot the men and the buildings were so tall and silent against heaven and then i came to see the people and suddenly i knew the city was like the swamp always restless and changing

 and more beautiful  suggested mrs vanderpool slipping her arms into her loungingrobe

 oh no not nearly so beautiful and yet â more interesting then with a puzzled look  i wonder why 

 perhaps because its people and not things

 it s people in the swamp asserted zora dreamily smoothing out the pillows of the couch   little people i call them the difference is i think that there i know how the story will come out everything is changing but i know how and why and from what and to what now here everything seems to be happening but what is it that is happening 

 you must know what has happened to know what may happen said mrs vanderpool

 but how can i know  

 i ll get you some books tomorrow

 id like to know what it means wistfully

 it is meaningless the womans cynicism was lost upon zora of course but it possessed the salutary effect of stimulating the girls thoughts encouraging her to discover for herself

 i think not so much must mean something she protested

zora gathered up the clothes and things and shaded the windows glancing the while down on the street

 everybody is going going she murmured  i wonder where dont they ever get there  

 few arrive said mrs vanderpool zora softly bent and passed her cool soft hand over her forehead

 then why do they go  

 the zest of the search perhaps

 no said zora as she noiselessly left the room and closed the door  no they are searching for something they have lost perhaps they too are searching for the way and the tears blinded her eyes

mrs vanderpool lay in the quiet darkened room with a puzzled smile on her lips a month ago she had not dreamed that human interest in anybody would take so strong a hold upon her as her liking for zora had done she was a woman of unusual personal charm but her own interest and affections were seldom stirred had she been compelled to earn a living she would have made a successful teacher or manipulator of men as it was she viewed the human scene with detached and cynical interest she had no children few near relations a husband who went his way and still was a gentleman

essentially mrs vanderpool was unmoral she held the code of her social set with sportsmanlike honor but even beyond this she stooped to no intrigue because none interested her she had all the elements of power save the motive for doing anything in particular for the first time perhaps zora gave her life a peculiar human interest she did not love the girl but she was intensely interested in her some of the interest was selfish for zora was going to be a perfect maid the girls language came to be more and more like mrs vanderpools her dress and taste in adornment had been mrs vanderpools first care and it led to a curious training in art and sense of beauty until the lady now and then found herself learner before the quick suggestiveness of zoras mind

when mrs harry cresswell called a month or so later the talk naturally included mention of zora mary was happy and vivacious and noted the girls rapid development

i wonder what i shall make out of her queried mrs vanderpool  do you know i believe i could mould her into a lady if she were not black

mary cresswell laughed  with that hair 

 it has artistic possibilities you should have seen my hairdressers face when i told her to do it up her face and zoras were a pantomine for the gods yet it was done it lay in some great twisted cloud and in that black net gown of mine zora was simply magnificent her form is perfect her height is regal her skin is satin and my jewels found a resting place at last jewels you know dear were never meant for white folk i was tempted to take her to the box at the opera and let new york break its impudent neck

mary was shocked

but mrs vanderpool she protested is it right is it fair why should you spoil this black girl and put impossible ideas into her head you can make her a perfect maid but she can never be much more in america  she is a perfect maid now thats the miracle of it â shes that deft and quick and quiet and thoughtful the hotel employees think her perfect my friends rave â really im the most blessed of women but do you know i like the girl i â well i think of her future

 its wrong to treat her as you do you make her an equal her room is one of the best and filled with books and bricabrac she sometimes eats with you â is your companion in fact

 what of it she loves to read and i guide her while she keeps me up on the latest stuff she can talk much better than many of my friends and then she piques my curiosity shes a sort of intellectual sauce that stirs my rapidly failing mental appetite i think that as soon as i can make up my mind to spare her i ll take her to france and marry her off in the colonies

 well thats possible but one does nt easily give up good servants by the way i learn from miss smith that the boy bles alwyn in whom zora was so interested is a clerk in the treasury department at washington

indeed im going to washington this winter ill look him over and see if hes worth zora â which i greatly doubt

mrs cresswell pursed her lips and changed the subject

 have you seen the easterlys  

 the ladies left their cards â they are quite impossible mr easterly calls this afternoon i cant imagine why but he asked for an appointment will you go south with mr cresswell im glad to hear hes entering politics

no i shall do some early house hunting in washington said mrs cresswell rising as mr easterly was announced

mr easterly was not at home in mrs vanderpools presence she spoke a language different from his and she had shown a disconcerting way in the few times when he had spoken with her of letting the weight of the conversation rest on him he felt very distinctly that mrs vanderpool was not particularly desirous of his company nor that of his family nevertheless he needed mrs vanderpools influence just now and he was willing to pay considerable for it once under obligation to him her services would be very valuable he was glad to find mrs cresswell there it showed that the cresswells were  the quest of the silver fleece still intimate and the cresswells were bound to him and his interests by strong ties he bowed as mrs cresswell left and then did not beat around the bush because in this case he did not know how

 mrs vanderpool i need your aid

mrs vanderpool smiled politely and murmured something

we are you know in the midst of a rather warm presidential campaign continued mr easterly

yes with polite interest

 we are going to win easily but our majority in congress for certain matters will depend on the attitude of southerners and you usually spend the winters in washington if now you could drop a word here and there â 

but why should i asked mrs vanderpool

 mrs vanderpool to be frank i know some excellent investments that your influence in this line would help i take it you re not so rich but that â 

mrs vanderpool smiled faintly

 really mr easterly i know little about such matters and care less i have food and clothes why worry with more 

mr easterly half expected this and he determined to deliver his last shot on the run he arose with a disappointed air

 of course mrs vanderpool i see how it is you have plenty and one cant expect your services or influence for nothing it had occurred to me that your husband might like something political but i presume there will be a change in the french ambassadorship the present ambassador is old and â well i dont know but as i say its possible of course though that may not appeal to you and i can only beg your good offices in charity if â if you see your way to help us well i must be going

 what is â i thought the president appointed ambassadors

 to be sure but we appoint presidents laughed mr easterly  goodday i shall hope to see you in washington

 goodday mrs vanderpool returned absently

after he had gone she walked slowly to zoras room and opened the door for a long time she stood quietly looking in zora was curled in a chair with a book she was in dreamland in a world of books builded thoughtfully for her by mrs vanderpool and before that by miss smith her work took but little of her time and left hours for reading and thinking in that thoughtlife more and more her real living centred

hour after hour day after day she lay buried deaf and dumb to all else her heart cried up on the worlds four corners of the way and to it came the vision splendid she gossiped with old herodotus across the earth to the black and blameless ethiopians she saw the sculptured glories of phidias marbled amid the splendor of the swamp she listened to demosthenes and walked the appian way with cornelia â while all new york streamed beneath her window

she saw the drunken goths reel upon rome and heard the careless negroes yodle as they galloped to toomsville paris she knewâ wonderful haunting paris the paris of clovis and st louis of louis the great and napoleon iii of balzac and her own dumas she tasted the mud and comfort of thick old london and the while wept with jeremiah and sang with deborah semiramis and atala mary of scotland and joan of arc held her dark hands in theirs and kings lifted up their sceptres

she walked on worlds and worlds of worlds and heard there in her little room the tread of armies the paeans of victory the breaking of hearts and the music of the spheres

mrs vanderpool watched her a while

 zora she presently broke into the girls absorption  how would we like to be ambassador to france 

miss caroline wynn of washington had little faith in the world and its people nor was this wholly her fault the world had dealt cruelly with the young dreams and youthful ambitions of the girl partly with its usual heartlessness partly with that cynical and deadening reserve fund which it has today for its darker peoples the girl had bitterly resented her experiences at first she was brilliant and welltrained she had a real talent for sculpture and had studied considerably she was sprung from at least three generations of respectable mulattoes who had left a little competence which yielded her three or four hundred dollars a year furthermore while not precisely pretty she was goodlooking and interesting and she had acquired the marks and insignia of good breeding perhaps she wore her manners just a trifle consciously perhaps she was a little morbid that she would fail of recognition as a lady nor was this unnatural her brown skin invited a different assumption despite this almost unconscious mental aggressiveness she was unusually presentable and always wellgowned and pleasant of speech yet she found nearly all careers closed to her at first it seemed accidental the luck of life then she attributed it to her sex but at last she was sure that beyond chance and womanhood it was the colorline that was hemming her in once convinced of this she let her imagination play and saw the line even where it did not exist

with her bit of property and brilliant parts she had had many suitors but they had been refused one after another for reasons she could hardly have explained for years now tom teerswell had been her escort whether or not caroline wynn would ever marry him was a perennial subject of speculation among their friends and it usually ended in the verdict that she could not afford it â that it was financially impossible

nevertheless the two were usually seen in public together and although she often showed her quiet mastery of the situation seldom had she snubbed him so openly as at the treble clef concert

teerswell was furious and began to plot vengeance but miss wynn was attracted by the personality of bles alwyn southern country negroes were rare in her set but here was a man of intelligence and keenness coupled with an amazing frankness and modesty and perceptibly shadowed by sorrow the combination was so far as she had observed both rare and temporary and she was disposed to watch it in this case purely as a matter of intellectual curiosity at the door of her home therefore after a walk of unusual interest she said  im going to have a few friends in next tuesday night wont you come mr alwyn and mr alwyn said that he would

next morning miss wynn rather repented her hasty invitation but of course nothing could be done now nothing well there was one thing and she went to the telephone a suggestion to bles that he might profitably extend his acquaintance sent him to a certain tailor shop kept by a friend of hers a word to the tailor guarded against the least suspicion of intrigue entering bless head

it turned out quite as miss wynn had designed mr grey the tailor gave bles some points on dressing and made him southern fashion a frockcoat for dress wear that set off his fine figure on the night of the gathering at miss wynns bles dressed with care hesitating long over a necktie but at last choosing one which he had recently purchased and which pleased him particularly he was prompt to the minute and was consequently the first guest but miss wynns greeting was so quietly cordial that his embarrassment soon fled she looked him over at leisure and sighed at his tie otherwise he was thoroughly presentable according to the strictest washington standard

they sat down and talked of generalities then an idea occurring to her she conducted the conversation by devious paths to ties and asked alwyn if he had heard of the fad of collecting ties he had not and she showed him a sofa pillow

your tie quite attracted me she said it would make just the dash of color i need in my new pillow

 you may have it and welcome i ll send â 

 oh no a bird in the hand you know i ll trade with you now for another i have

 done 

the exchange was soon made miss wynn tying the new one herself and sticking a small carved pin in it bles slowly sat down again and after a pause said  thank you

she looked up quickly but he seemed quite serious and goodnatured

 you see he explained  in the country we dont know much about ties

the wellbalanced miss wynn for a moment lost her aplomb but only for a moment

 we must all learn she replied with penetration and so their friendship was established

the company now began to gather and soon the double parlor held an assemblage of twentyfive or thirty persons they formed a picturesque group conventional but graceful in dress animated in movement full of goodnatured laughter but quite unamerican in the beautiful modulation of their speaking tones chiefly noticeable however to a stranger in the vast variety of color in skin which imparted to the throng a piquant and unusual interest every color was here from the dark brown of alwyn who was customarily accounted black to the pale pinkwhite of miss jones who could  pass for white  when she would and found her greatest difficulties when she was trying to  pass  for black midway between these two extremes lay the sallow pastor of the church the creamy miss williams the golden yellow of mr teerswell the golden brown of miss johnson and the velvet brown of mr grey the guests themselves did not notice this they were used to asking ones color as one asks of height and weight it was simply an extra dimension in their world whereby to classify men

beyond this and their hair there was little to distinguish them from a modern group of men and women the speech was a softened english purely and on the whole correctly spoken â so much so that it seemed at first almost unfamiliar to bles and he experienced again the uncomfortable feeling of being among strangers then too he missed the loud but hearty goodnature of what he had always called  his people to be sure a more experienced observer might have noted a lively excitable tropical temperament set and cast in a cold northern mould and yet flashing fire now and then in a sudden anomalous outbursting but bles missed this he seemed to have slipped and lost his bearings and the characteristics of his simple world were rolling curiously about here stood a black man with a white mans voice and yonder a white woman with a negros musical cadences and yet again a brown girl with exactly miss cresswells air and yonder miss williams with zoras wistful wilfulness

bles was bewildered and silent and his great undying sorrow sank on his heart with sickening hopeless weight his hands got in the way and he found no natural nook in all those wide and tastefully furnished rooms once he discovered himself standing by a marble statue of a nude woman and he edged away then he stumbled over a rug and saved himself only to step on miss joness silken train miss joness smile of pardon was wintry when he did approach a group and listen they seemed speaking of things foreign to him â usually of people he did not know their homes their doings their daughters and their fathers they seemed to know people intimately who lived far away

u you mean the smiths of boston  asked miss jones  no of cleveland they re not related

 i heard that mc ghee of st paul will be in the city next week with his daughter

 yes and the bentleys of chicago

bles passed on he was disappointed he was full of things to say of mighty matters to discuss he felt like stopping these people and crying ho what of the morning how goes the great battle for black mens rights i have came with messages from the host to you who guard the mountain tops

apparently they were not discussing or caring about  the problem he grew disgusted and was edging toward the door when he encountered his hostess

 is all well with you mr alwyn   she asked lightly  no im not enjoying myself said bles truthfully delicious and why not

he regarded her earnestly

 there are so many things to talk about he said  earnest things things of importance i â i think when our people â  he hesitated our â was our right but he went on  when our people meet we ought to talk of our situation and what to do and â 

miss wynn continued to smile

we re all talking of it all the time she said

he looked incredulous

 yes we are she insisted  we veil it a little and laugh as lightly as we can but there is only one thought in this room and that s grave and serious enough to suit even you and quite your daily topic

 but i dont understand

 ah theres the rub you havent learned our language yet we dont just blurt into the negro problem thats voted bad form we leave that to our white friends we saunter to it sideways touch it delicately because  â her face became a little graver â  because you see it hurts

bles stood thoughtful and abashed

i â i think i understand he gravely said at last

 come here she said with a sudden turn and they joined an absorbed group in the midst of a conversation

 â thinking of sending jessie to bryn mawr bles heard miss jones saying

 could she pass  

 oh they might think her spanish

 but it s a snobbish place and she would have to give up all her friends

yes freddie could scarcely visitâ the rest was lost

 which being interpreted whispered miss wynn  means that bryn mawr draws the color line while we at times surmount it

they moved on to another group

 â splendid draughtsman a man was saying  and passed at the head of the crowd but of course he has no chance

 why it s civilservice is nt it 

 it is but what of that there was watson â  miss wynn did not pause she whispered  this is the tale of civil service reform and how this mighty government gets rid of black men who know too much

 but â  bles tried to protest

 hush miss wynn commanded and thy joined the group about the piano teerswell who was speaking affected not to notice them and continued   â i tell you its got to come we must act independently and not be bought by a few offices

 thats all well enough for you to talk teerswell you have no wife and babies dependant on you why should we who have sacrifice the substance for the shadow  

 you see the judge has got the substance laughed teerswell  still i insist divide and conquer

 nonsense unite and keep

bles was puzzled

 they re talking of the coming campaign said miss wynn

what exclaimed bles aloud you dont mean that any one can advise a black man to vote the democratic ticket 

an elderly man turned to them

 thank you sir he said  that is just my attitude i fought for my freedom i know what slavery is may i forget god when i vote for traitors and slaveholders

the discussion waxed warm and miss wynn turned away and sought miss jones

 come my dear she said  its  the problem  again they sauntered away toward a ring of laughter

the discussion thus begun at miss wynns did not end there it was on the eve of the great party conventions and the next night sam stillings came around to get some crumbs from this assembly of the inner circle into which alwyn had been so unaccountably snatched and outside of which despite his endeavors stillings lingered and seemed destined to linger but stillings was a patient resolute man beneath his deferential exterior and he saw in bles a stepping stone so he began to drop in at his lodgings and tonight invited him to the bethel literary

 whats that  asked bles

 a debating club â oldest in the city the best people all attend

bles hesitated he had half made up his mind that this was the proper time to call on miss wynn he told stillings so and told him also of the evening and the discussion

 why thats the subject up tonight stillings declared and miss wynn will be sure to be there you can make your call later perhaps you would nt mind taking me when you call alwyn reached for his hat

when they arrived the basement of the great church was filling with a throng of men and women soon the officers and the speaker of the evening appeared the president was a brown woman who spoke easily and well and introduced the main speaker he was a tall thin hatchetfaced black man clean shaven and well dressed a lawyer by profession his theme was  the democratic party and the negro his argument was cool carefully reasoned and plausible he was evidently feeling for the sympathy of his audience and while they were not enthusiastic they warmed to him gradually and he certainly was strongly impressing them

bles was thinking he sat in the back of the hall tense alert nervous as the speaker progressed a white man came in and sat down beside him he was spectacled with bushy eyebrows and a sleepy look but he did not sleep he was very observant

 whos speaking  he asked bles and bles told him then he inquired about one or two other persons bles could not inform him but stillings could and did stillings seemed willing to devote considerable time to him

bles forgot the man he was almost crouching for a spring and no sooner had the speaker with a really fine apostrophe to independence and reason in voting sat down than bles was on his feet walking forward his form was commanding his voice deep and musical and his earnestness terribly evident he hardly waited for recognition from the slightly astonished president but fairly burst into speech

 i am from alabama he began earnestly  and i know the democratic party then he told of government and conditions in the black belt of the lying oppression and helplessness of the sodden black masses then turning he reminded them of the history of slavery finally he pointed to lincolns picture and to sumners and mentioned other white friends

 and my brothers they are not all dead yet the gentleman spoke of senator smith and blamed and ridiculed him i know senator smith but slightly but i do know his sister well

dropping to simple narrative he told of miss smith and of his coming to school and if his audience felt the great depth of emotion that welled beneath his quiet almost hesitating address it was not simply because of what he did say but because too of the unspoken story that lay too deep for words he spoke for nearly an hour and when he stopped for a moment his hearers sighed and then sprang into a whirlwind of applause they shouted clapped and waved while he sat in blank amazement and was with difficulty forced to the rostrum to bow again and again the spectacled white man leaned over to stillings

 who is he  he asked stillings told him the man noted the name and went quietly out

miss wynn sat lost in thought and teerswell beside her fumed she was not easily moved but that speech had moved her if he could thus stir men and not be himself swayed she mused he would be â invincible but tonight he was moved as greatly as his hearers had been and that was dangerous if his intense belief happened to be popular all right but if not she frowned he was worth watching she concluded quite worth watching and perhaps worth guiding

when alwyn accompanied her home that night miss wynn set herself to know him better for she suspected that he might be a coming man the best preliminary to her purpose was she knew to speak frankly of herself and that she did she told him of her youth and training her ambitions her disappointments quite unconsciously her cynicism crept to the fore until in word and tone she had almost scoffed at many things that alwyn held true and dear the touch was too light the meaning too elusive for alwyn to grasp always the point of attack but somehow he got the distant impression that miss wynn had little faith in truth and goodness and love vaguely shocked he grew so silent that she noticed it and concluded she had said too much but he pursued the subject

 surely there must be many friends of our race willing to stand for the right and sacrifice for it

she laughed unpleasantly almost mockingly

 where 

 well â there s miss smith

 she gets a salary does nt she 

 a very small one

 about as large as she could earn north i dont doubt

 but the unselfish work she does â the utter sacrifice  

 oh well we ll omit alabama and admit the exception

 well here in washington â theres your friend the judge who has befriended you so as you admit

she laughed again

you remember our visit to senator smith

 yes

 well it got the judge his reappointment to the school board

 he deserved it did nt he 

 i deserved it she said luxuriously hugging her knee and smiling  you see his appointment meant mine

 well what of it â did nt â 

 listen she cut in a little sharply  once a young brown girl with boundless faith in white folks went to a judges office to ask for an appointment which she deserved there was no one there the benign old judge with his saintly face and white hair suggested that she lay aside her wraps and spend the afternoon

bles arose to his feet

 what â what did you do   he asked

sit down â theres a good boy i said judge a friend is expecting me at two it was then halfpast one  would i not best telephone  

  step right into the booth said the judge quite indulgently miss wynn leaned back and bles felt his heart sinking but he said nothing  and then she continued  i telephoned the judges wife that he was anxious to see her on a matter of urgent business namely my appointment she gazed reflectively out of the window  you should have seen his face when i told him she concluded  i was appointed

but bles asked coldly  why did nt you have him arrested  

 for what and suppose i had 

bles threw out his arms helplessly

 oh it is nt as bad as that all over the world is it   its worse affirmed miss wynn quietly positive and you are still friendly with him

what would you have i use the world i did not make it i did not choose it he is the world through him i earn my bread and butter i have shown him his place shall i try in addition to reform shall i make him an enemy i have neither time nor inclination shall i resign and beg or go tilting at windmills if he were the only one it would be different but theyre all alike her face grew hard  have i shocked you  she said as they went toward the door

 no he answered slowly  but i still â believe in the world

 you are young yet my friend she lightly replied and besides that good miss smith has gone and grafted a new england conscience on a tropical heart and â dear me â but its a gorgeous misfit goodbye â come again she bowed him graciously out and paused to take the mail from the box there was among many others a letter from senator smith

mr easterly sat in mrs vanderpools apartments in the new willard washington drinking tea his hostess was saying rather carelessly  do you know mr vanderpool has developed a quite unaccountable liking for the idea of being ambassador to france

 dear me  mildly exclaimed mr easterly helping himself liberally to cakes  i do hope the thing can be managed but â 

 what are the difficulties  mrs vanderpool interrupted

 well first and foremost the difficulty of electing our man

 i thought that a foregone conclusion

 it was but do you know that we jre encountering opposition from the most unexpected source 

the lady was receptive and the speaker concluded  the negroes

 the negroes 

yes there are five hundred thousand or more black voters in pivotal northern states you know and they re in revolt in a close election the negroes of new york ohio indiana and illinois choose the president

whats the matter

 well business interests have driven our party to make friends with the south the south has disfranchised negroes and lynched a few the darkies say we ve deserted them

mrs vanderpool laughed

 what extraordinary penetration she cried

 at any rate said mr easterly drily  mr vanderpools first step toward paris lies in getting the northern negroes to vote the republican ticket after that the way is clear

mrs vanderpool mused

 i dont suppose you know any one who is acquainted with any number of these northern darkies continued mr easterly

 not on my callinglist said mrs vanderpool and then she added more thoughtfully  theres a young clerk in the treasury department named alwyn who has brains he s just from the south and i happened to read of him this morning â see here

mr easterly read an account of the speech at the bethel literary

well look this young man up he decided he may help of course mrs vanderpool we ll probably win we can buy these negroes off with a little money and a few small offices then if you will use your influence for the party with the southerners i can confidently predict from four to eight years sojourn in paris

mrs vanderpool smiled and called her maid as mr easterly went

 zora  she had to call twice for zora with widened eyes was reading the washington post

meantime in the office of senator smith toward which mr easterly was making his way several members of the national republican campaign committee had been closeted the day before

 now about the niggers the chairman had asked  how much more boodle do they want 

 that s whats bothering us announced a member  it is nt the boodle crowd thats hollering but a new set and i dont understand them i dont know what they represent nor just how influential they are

what can i do to help you asked senator smith this you are here at washington with these negro officeholders at your back find out for us just what this revolt is how far it goes and what good men we can get to swing the darkies into line â see

 very good the senator acquiesced he called in a spectacled man with bushy eyebrows and a sleepy look

 i want you to work the negro political situation directed the senator  and bring me all the data you can get personally im at sea i dont understand the negro of today at all he puzzles me he doesnt fit any of my categories and i suspect that i dont fit his see what you can find out

the man went out and the senator turned to his desk then paused and smiled one day not long since he had met a colored person who personified his perplexity concerning negroes she was a lady yet she was black â that is brown she was educated even cultured yet she taught negroes she was quiet astute quick and diplomatic â everything in fact that  negroes  were not supposed to be and yet she was a  negro she had given him valuable information which he had sought in vain elsewhere and the event proved it correct suppose he asked caroline wynn to help him in this case it would certainly do no harm and it might elect a republican president he wrote a short letter with his own hand and sent it to post

miss wynn read the letter after alwyns departure with a distinct thrill which was something of a luxury for her evidently she was coming to her kingdom the republican boss was turning to her for confidential information

 what do the colored people want and who can best influence them in this campaign 

she curled up on the ottoman and considered the first part of the query did not bother her

 whatever they want they wont get she said decisively

but as to the man or men who could influence them to believe that they were getting or about to get what they wanted â there was a question one by one she considered the men she knew and by a process of elimination finally arrived at bles alwyn

why not take this young man in hand and make a negro leader of him â a protagonist of ten millions it would not be unpleasant but could she do it would he be amenable to her training and become worldly wise she flattered herself that he would and yet â there was a certain steadfast look in the depths of his eyes that might prove to be sheer stubbornness at any rate who was better there was a fellow stillings whom alwyn had introduced and whom she had heard of now he was a politician â but nothing else she dismissed him of course there was the older set of officeholders and rounders but she was determined to pick a new man he was worth trying at any rate she knew none other with the same build the brains the gifts the adorable youth

very good she wrote two letters and then curled up to her novel and candy

next day senator smith held miss wynns letter unopened in his hand when mr easterly entered they talked of the campaign and various matters until at last easterly said  say there s a negro clerk in the treasury named alwyn

 i know him â i had him appointed

 good he may help us have you seen this  

the senator read the clipping

 i had nt noticed it â but heres my agent

the spectacled man entered with a mass of documents he had papers posters programmes and letters

 the situation is this he said  a small group of educated negroes are trying to induce the rest to punish the republican party for not protecting them these men are not politicians nor popular leaders but they have influence and are using it the oldstyle negro politicians are no match for them and the crowd of officeholders are rather bewildered strong measures are needed educated men of earnestness and ability might stem the tide and i believe i know one such man he spoke at a big meeting last night at the metropolitan church his name is alwyn

senator smith listened as he opened the letter from caroline wynn then he started

 well  he ejaculated looking quickly up at easterly  this is positively uncanny from three separate sources the name of alwyn pops up looks like a mascot call up the treasury lets have him up when the subcommittee meets tomorrow

bles alwyn hurried up to senator smiths office hoping to hear something about the school perhaps even about â but he stopped with a sigh and sat down in the anteroom he was kept waiting a few moments while senator smith the chairman and one other member of the subcommittee had a word

 now i dont know the young man mind you said the senator  but hes strongly recommended

what shall we offer him asked the chairman

 try him at twentyfive dollars a speech if he balks raise to fifty dollars but not more

they summoned the young man the chairman produced cigars

 i dont smoke said bles apologetically

 well we have nt anything to drink said the chairman but senator smith broke in taking up at once the paramount interest

 mr alwyn as you know the democrats are making an effort to get the negro vote in this campaign now i know the disadvantages and wrongs which black men in this land are suffering i believe the republicans ought to do more to defend them and im satisfied they will but i doubt if the way to get negro rights is to vote for those who took them away

 i agree with you perfectly said bles

 i understand you do and that you made an unusually fine speech on the subject the other night

 thank you sir this was a good deal more than bles had expected and he was embarrassed

 well now we think you re just the man to take the stump during september and october and convince the colored people of their real interests

 i doubt if i could sir i m not a speaker in fact that was my first public speech

 so much the better are you willing to try 

 why yes sir but i could hardly afford to give up my position

 we ll arrange for a leave of absence

 then i ll try sir

 what would you expect as pay  

 i suppose my salary would stop 

 i mean in addition to that

 oh nothing sir id be glad to do the work

the chairman nearly choked sitting back he eyed the young man either they were dealing with a fool or else a very astute politician if the former how far could they trust him if the latter what was his game

 of course there ll be considerable travelling the chairman ventured looking reflectively out of the window  yes sir i suppose so

 we might pay the railroad fare

 thank you sir when shall i begin 

the chairman consulted his calendar

 suppose you hold yourself in readiness for one week from today

 all right and bles rose  goodday gentlemen but the chairman was still puzzled

 now whats his game  he asked helplessly

 he may be honest offered senator smith contemplating the door almost wistfully

the campaign progressed the national republican committee said little about the negro revolt and affected to ignore it the papers were silent underneath this calm however the activity was redoubled the prominent negroes were carefully catalogued written to and put under personal influence the negro papers were quietly subsidized and they began to ridicule and reproach the new leaders

as the fall progressed massmeetings were held in washington and the small towns larger and larger ones were projected and more and more alwyn was pushed to the front he was developing into a most effective speaker he had the voice the presence the ideas and above all he was intensely in earnest there were other colored orators with voice presence and eloquence but their people knew their record and discounted them alwyn was new clear and sincere and the black folk hung on his words large and larger crowds greeted him until he was the central figure in a half dozen great negro massmeetings in the chief cities of the country culminating in new york the night before election perhaps the secret newspaper work the personal advice of employers and friends and the liberal distribution of cash would have delivered a large part of the negro vote to the republican candidate perhaps â but there was a doubt with the work of alwyn however all doubt disappeared and there was little reason for denying that the new president walked into the white house through the instrumentality of an unknown georgia negro little past his majority this is what senator smith said to mr easterly what miss wynn said to herself and it was what mrs vanderpool remarked to zora as zora was combing her hair on the wednesday after election

zora murmured an indistinct response as already something of the beauty of the world had found question and answer in her soul and as she began to realize how the world had waxed old in thought and stature so now in their last days a sense of the power of men as set over against the immensity and force of their surroundings became real to her she had begun to read of the lives and doing of those called great and in her mind a plan was forming she saw herself standing dim within the shadows directing the growing power of a man a man who would be great as the world counted greatness rich high in position powerful â wonderful because his face was black he would never see her never know how she worked and planned save perhaps at last in that supreme moment as she passed her soul would cry to his  redeemed  and he would understand

all this she was thinking and weaving not clearly and definitely but in great blurred clouds of thoughts of things as she said slowly  he should have a great position for this

 why certainly mrs vanderpool agreed and then curiously  what  

zora considered  negroes she said  have been registers of the treasury and recorders of deeds here in washington and douglas was marshal but i want bles â  she paused and started again  those are not great enough for mr alwyn he should have an office so important that negroes would not think of leaving their party again

mrs vanderpool took pains to repeat zoras words to mr easterly he considered the matter

 in one sense it s good advice he admitted  but there s the south to reckon with i ll think it over and speak to the president oh yes im going to mention france at the same time

mrs vanderpool smiled and leaned back in her carriage she noted with considerable interest the young colored woman who was watching her from the sidewalk a brown wellappearing young woman of notable selfpossession caroline wynn scrutinized mrs vanderpool because she had been speaking with mr easterly and mr easterly was a figure of political importance that very morning miss wynn had telegraphed bles alwyn alwyn arrived at washington just as the morning papers heralded the sweeping republican victory all about he met new deference and new friends strangers greeted him familiarly on the street sam stillings became his shadow and when he reported for work his chief and fellow clerks took unusual interest in him

have you seen senator smith yet miss wynn asked after a few words of congratulation

 no what for 

what for she answered go to him today dont fail i shall be at home at eight tonight

it seemed to bles an exceedingly silly thing to do â calling on a busy man with no errand but he went he decided that he would just thank the senator for his interest and get out or if the senator was busy he would merely send in his card evidently the senator was busy for his waitingroom was full bles handed the card to the secretary with a word of apology but the secretary detained him

ah mr alwyn he said affably glad to see you the senator will want to see you i know wait just a minute and soon bles was shaking senator smiths hand

 well mr alwyn said the senator heartily  you delivered the goods

 thank you sir i tried to

senator smith thoughtfully looked him over and drew out the letters

 your friends mr alwyn he said adjusting his glasses  have a rather high opinion of you here now is stillings who helped on the campaign he suggests an eighteenhundreddollar clerkship for you the senator glanced up keenly and omitted to state what stillings suggested for himself alwyn was visibly grateful as well as surprised

i â i hoped he began hesitatingly  that perhaps i might get a promotion but i had not thought of a firstclass clerkship

 hm senator smith leaned back and twiddled his thumbs staring at alwyn until the hot blood darkened his cheeks then bles sat up and stared politely but steadily back the senators eyes dropped and he put out his hand for the second note

 now your friend miss wynn  â alwyn started â  is even more ambitious he handed her letter to the young man and pointed out the words

 of course senator bles read  we expect mr alwyn to be the next register of the treasury

bles looked up in amazement but the senator reached for a third letter the room was very still at last he found it  this he announced quietly  is from a man of great power and influence who has the ear of the new president he smoothed out the letter paused briefly then read aloud   it has been suggested to me by   â the senator did not read the name if he had  mrs vanderpool  would have meant little to alwyn â   it has been suggested to me by blank that the future allegiance of the negro vote to the republican party might be insured by giving to some prominent negro a high political position â for instance treasurer of the united states â salary six thousand dollars interpolated senator smith â   and that alwyn would be a popular and safe appointment for that position 

the senator did not read the concluding sentence which ran  think this over we cant touch political conditions in the south perhaps this sop will do

for a long time alwyn sat motionless while the senator said nothing then the young man rose unsteadily

 i dont think i quite grasp all this he said as he shook hands  i ll think it over and he went out

when caroline wynn heard of that extraordinary conversation her amazement knew no bounds yet alwyn ventured to voice doubts  im not fitted for either of those high offices there are many others who deserve more and i dont somehow like the idea of seeming to have worked hard in the campaign simply for money or fortune you see i talked against that very thing

miss wynns eyes widened

 well what else â  she began and then changed  mr alwyn the line between virtue and foolishness is dim and wavering and i should hate to see you lost in that marshy borderland by a streak of extraordinary luck you have gained the political leadership of negroes in america heres your chance to lead your people and here you stand blinking and hesitating be a man   alwyn straightened up and felt his doubts going the evening passed very pleasantly

 im going to have a little dinner for you said miss wynn finally and alwyn grew hot with pleasure he turned to fier suddenly and said  why im rather â black she expressed no surprise but said reflectively  you are dark

 and ive been given to understand that miss wynn and her set rather â well preferred the lighter shades of colored folk

miss wynn laughed lightly

 my parents did she said simply  no dark man âier entered their house they were simply copying the white world now i as a matter of aesthetic beauty prefer your brownvelvet color to a jaundiced yellow or even an uncertain cream but the world does nt the world

yes the world and especially america one may be chinese spaniard even indian â anything white or dirty white in this land and demand decent treatment but to be negro or darkening toward it unmistakably means perpetual handicap and crucifixion

 why not then admit that you draw the colorline   because i dont but the world does i am not prejudiced as my parents were but i am foresighted indeed it is a deep ethical query is it not how far one has the right to bear black children to the world in the land of the free and the home of the brave is it fair â to the children  

yes it is he cried vehemently the more to take up the fight the surer the victory

she laughed at his earnestness

 you are refreshing she said  well we ll dine next tuesday and we ll have the cream of our world to meet you

he knew that this was a great triumph it flattered his vanity after all he was entering this higher dark world whose existence had piqued and puzzled him so long he glanced at miss wynn beside him there in the dimly lighted parlor she looked so aloof and unapproachable so handsome and so elegant he thought how she would complete a house â such a home as his prospective four or six thousand dollars a year could easily purchase she saw him surveying her and she smiled at him

 i find but one fault with you she said

he stammered for a pretty speech but did not find it before she continued yes â you are so delightfully primitive you will not use the world as it is but insist on acting as if it were something else

 i am not sure i understand

well there is the wife of my judge she is a fact in my world in yours she is a problem to be stated straightened and solved if she had come to you as she did to me yesterday with her theory that all that southern negroes needed was to learn how to make good servants and lay brick â 

i should have shown her â  bles tried to interject

 nothing of the sort you would have tried to show her and would have failed miserably she has nt learned anything in twenty years

 but surely you did nt join her in advocating that ten million people be menials 

 oh no i simply listened

 well there was no harm in that i believe in silence at times

 ah but i did not listen like a log but positively and eloquently with a nod a halfformed word a comment begun which she finished

bles frowned

 as a result continued miss wynn  i have a check for five hundred dollars to finish our cookingschool and buy a cast of minerva for the assemblyroom more than that i have now a wealthy friend she thinks me an unusually clever person who by a process of thought not unlike her own has arrived at very similar conclusions

 but â but objected bles  if the time spent cajoling fools were used in convincing the honest and upright think how much we would gain

 very little the honest and upright are a sad minority most of these white folk â believe me boy she said caressinglyâ are fools and knaves they dont want truth or progress they want to keep niggers down  i dont believe it there are scores thousands perhaps millions such i admit but the average american loves justice and right and he is the one to whom i appeal with frankness and truth great heavens dont you love to be frank and open

she narrowed her eyelids

yes sometimes i do once i was but its a luxury few of us negroes can afford then too i insist that its jolly to fool them

 dont you hate the deception 

she chuckled and put her head to one side

 at first i did but do you know now i believe i prefer it

he looked so horrified that she burst out laughing he laughed too she was a puzzle to him he kept thinking what a mistress of a mansion she would make

 why do you say these things   he asked suddenly  because i want you to do well here in washington general philanthropy

 no special her eyes were bright with meaning

 then you care â for me 

 yes

he bent forward and cast the die

 enough to marry me 

she answered very calmly and certainly  yes

he leaned toward her and then between him and her lips rose a dark and shadowy face two great stormswept eyes looked into his out of a world of infinite pain and he dropped his head in hesitation and shame and kissed her hand miss wynn thought him delightfully bashful

the election of harry cresswell to congress was a very simple matter the colonel and his son drove to town and consulted the judge together they summoned the sheriff and the local member of the state legislature

 i think its about time that we cresswells asked for a little of the political pie the colonel smilingly opened  well what do you want  asked the judge

 harry wants to go to congress

the judge hesitated wed half promised that to caldwell he objected

 it will be a little costly this year too suggested the sheriff tentatively

 about how much   asked the colonel

 at least five thousand said the legislator

the colonel said nothing he simply wrote a check and the matter was settled in the fall harry cresswell was declared elected there were four hundred and seventytwo votes cast but the sheriff added a cipher he said it would look better

early december found the cresswells domiciled in a small house in du pont circle washington they had an automobile and four servants and the house was furnished luxuriously mary taylor cresswell standing in her morning room and looking out on the flowers of the square told herself that few people in the world had cause to be as happy as she she was tastefully gowned in a way to set off her blonde beauty and her delicate rounded figure she was surrounded with wealth and above all she was in that atmosphere of aristocracy for which she had always yearned and already she was acquiring that poise of the head and a manner of directing the servants which showed her born to the purple

she had cause to be extremely happy she told herself this morning and yet she was puzzled to understand why she was not why was she restless and vaguely ill at ease so often these days

one matter indeed did worry her but that would right itself in time she was sure she had always pictured herself as directing her husbands work she did not plan to step in and demand a share she knew from experience with her brother that a woman must prove her usefulness to a man before he will admit it and even then he may be silent she intended gradually and tactfully to relieve her husband of care connected with his public life so that before he realized it she would be his guiding spirit and his inspiration she had dreamed the details of doing this so long that it seemed already done and she could imagine no obstacle to its realization and yet she found herself today no nearer her goal than when first she married not because mr cresswell did not share his work but because apparently he had no work no duties no cares at first in the dim glories of the honeymoon this seemed but part of his delicate courtesy toward her and it pleased her despite her thrifty new england nature but now that they were settled in washington the election over and congress in session it really seemed time for work and life to begin in dead earnest and new england mary was dreaming mighty dreams and golden futures

but harry apparently was as content as ever with doing nothing he arose at ten dined at seven and went to bed between midnight and sunrise there were some committee meetings and much mail but mary was admitted to knowledge of none of these the obvious step of course would be to set him at work but from this undertaking mary unconsciously recoiled she had already recognized that while her tastes and her husbands were mostly alike they were also strikingly different in many respects they agreed in the daintiness of things the elegance of detail but they did not agree always as to the things themselves given the picture they would choose the same frame â but they would not choose the same picture they liked the same voice but not the same song the same company but not the same conversation of course mary reflected frowning at the flowers â of course this must always be so when two human beings are thrown into new and intimate association in time they would grow to sweet communion only she hoped the communion would be on tastes nearer hers than those he sometimes manifested

she turned impatiently from the window with a feeling of loneliness but why lonely she idly fingered a new book on the table and then put it down sharply there had been several attempts at reading aloud between them some evenings ago and this book reminded her of them she had bought jane addams  newer ideals of peace and he had yawned over it undisguisedly then he had brought this novel and â well she had balked at the second chapter and he had kissed her and called her his little prude she did not want to be a prude she hated to seem so and had for some time prided herself on emancipation from narrow new england prejudices for example she had not objected to wine at dinner it had seemed indeed rather fine imparting as it did an oldfashioned flavor but she did not like the whiskey and harry at times appeared to become just a bit too lively â nothing excessive of course but his eyes and the smell and the color were a little too suggestive and yet he was so kind and good and when he came in at evening he bent so gallantly for his kiss and laid fresh flowers before her could anything have been more thoughtful and knightly 

just here again she was puzzled with her folk hard work and inflexible duty were of prime importance they were the rock foundation and she somehow had always counted on the courtesies of life as added to them making them sweet and beautiful but in this world not perhaps so much with harry as with others of his set the depths beneath the gravely inclined head the deferential smile and ceremonious action the light clever converse had sounded strangely hollow once or twice when she had essayed to sound them and a certain fear to look and see possessed her

the bell rang and she was a little startled at the fright that struck her heart she did not analyze it in reality â pride forbade her to admit it â she feared it was a call of some of harrys friends some languid assured southern ladies perilously gowned with veiled disdain for this interloping northerner and her strong mind especially was there one from new orleans tall and dark â but it was no caller it was simply some one named stillings to see mr cresswell she went down to see him â he might be a constituent â and found a smirky brown man very apologetic

you dont know me â does you mrs cressvell  said stillings he knew when it was diplomatic to forget his grammar and assume his dialect

 why â no

 you remember i worked for mr harry and served youall lunch one day 

 oh yes â why yes i remember now very well

 well i wants to see mr harry very much could i wait in the back hall 

mary started to have him wait in the front hall but she thought better of it and had him shown back less than an hour later her husband entered and she went quickly to him he looked worn and white and tired but he laughed her concern lightly off

 i ll be in earlier tonight he declared

is the congressional business very heavy

he laughed so hilariously that she felt uncomfortable which he observed

 oh no he answered deftly  not very and as they moved toward the diningroom mary changed the subject

 oh she exclaimed suddenly remembering  there is a man â a colored man â waiting to see you in the back hall but i guess he can wait until after lunch

they ate leisurely

 theres going to be racing out at the park this evening said harry  want to go 

 i was going to hear an art lecture at the club mary returned and grew thoughtful for here walked her ghost again of course the club was an affair with more of gossip than of intellectual effort but today largely through her own suggestion an art teacher of european reputation was going to lecture and mary preferred it to the company of the race track and â just as certainly â her husband did nt

 dont forget the man dear she reminded him but he was buried in his paper frowning

 look at that he said finally she glanced at the headlines â  prominent negro politician candidate for high office at hands of new administration b alwyn of alabama

 why it s bles  she said her face lighting as his darkened

 an impudent negro he voiced his disgust  if they must appoint darkies why cant they get tractable ones like my nigger stillings

stillings she repeated  why hes the man thats waiting

sam is it used to be one of our servants â you remember wants to borrow more money i presume he went downstairs after first helping himself to a glass of whiskey and then gallantly kissing his wife mrs cresswell was more unsatisfied than usual she could not help feeling that mr cresswell was treating her about as he treated his wine â as an indulgence a loved one a regular one but somehow not as the reality and prose of life unless â she started at the thought â his life was all indulgence having nothing else to do she went out and paraded the streets watching the people who were happy enough to be busy

cresswell and stillings had a long conference and when stillings hastened away he could not forbear cutting a discreet pigeonwing as he rounded the corner he had been promised the backing of the whole southern delegation in his schemes

that night teerswell called on him in his modest lodgings where over hot whiskey and water they talked

 the damned southern upstart growled teerswell forgetting stillings birthplace  do you mean to say hes actually slated for the place

 hes sure of it unless something turns up

well whod have dreamed it teerswell mixed another stiff dram

 and that is nt all came sam stillings unctuous voice

teerswell glanced at him what else he asked pausing with the steaming drink poised aloft

 if im not mistaken alwyn intends to marry miss wynn

you lie the other suddenly yelled with an oath overturning his tumbler and striding across the floor  do you suppose shed look at that black â 

 well see here said the astute stillings checking the details upon his fingers  they visit senator smiths together he takes her home from the treble clef they say he talked to nobody else at her party she recommends him for the campaign â 

 what  teerswell again exploded but stillings continued smoothly  oh i have ways of finding things out she corresponds with him during the campaign she asks smith to make him register and he calls on her every night

teerswell sat down limply

 i see he groaned  its all up shes jilted me â and i â and i â 

 i dont see as it s all up yet stillings tried to reassure him

 but did nt you say they were engaged  

 i think they are but â well you know carrie wynn better than i do suppose now â suppose he should lose the appointment 

 but you say thats sure

 unless something turns up

 but what can turn up 

 we might turn something

 what â what â i tell you man id â id do anything to down that nigger i hate him if you ll help me i ll do anything for you

stillings arose and carefully opening the hall door peered out then he came back and seating himself close to teerswell pushed aside the whiskey

 teerswell he whispered  you know i was working to be register of the treasury well now when the scheme of making alwyn treasurer came up they determined to appoint a southern white republican and give me a place under alwyn now if alwyn fails to land ive got no chance for the bigger place but i ve got a good chance to be register according to the first plan i helped in the campaign i ve got the negro secret societies backing me and â i do nt mind telling you â the solid southern congressional delegation im trying now ostensibly for a chiefclerkship under blee and i m pretty sure of it it pays twentyfive hundred see here if we can make bles do some fool talking and get it into the papers he ll be ditched and i ll be register

m great  shouted teerswell

 wait â wait now if i get the job how would you like to be my assistant  

like it why great jehoshaphat id marry carrie â but how can i help you  

 this way i want to be better known among influential negroes you introduce me and let me make myself solid especially i must get in miss wynns set so that both of us can watch her and alwyn and make her friends ours

 i ll do it â shake  and stillings put his oily hand into teerswells nervous grip

 now here stillings went on  you stow all that jealousy and heavy tragedy treat alwyn well and call on miss wynn as usual â see

 its a hard pill â but all right

 leave the rest to me im hand in glove with alwyn i ll put stuff into him that ll make him wave the bloody shirt at the next meeting of the bethel literary â see then ill go to cresswell and say  dangerous nigger â just as i told you he ll begin to move things you see cresswell is in with smith â both directors in the big cotton combine â and smith will call alwyn down then we ll think further

 stillings you look like a fool but you re a genius and teerswell fairly hugged him a few more details settled and some more whiskey consumed and teerswell went home at midnight in high spirits stillings looked into the glass and scowled

 look like a fool do i  he mused  well i aint 

congressman cresswell was stirred to his first political activity by the hint given him through stillings he not only had a strong personal dislike for alwyn but he regarded the promise to him of a high office as a menace to the south

the second speech which alwyn made at the bethel literary was as stillings foresaw a reply to the stinging criticisms of certain colored papers engineered by teerswell who said that alwyn had been bribed to remain loyal to the republicans by a six thousand dollar office alwyn had been cut to the quick and his reply was a straight out defence of negro rights and a call to the republican party to redeem its pledges

caroline wynn seeing the rocks for which her political craft was headed adroitly steered several newspaper reports into the waste basket but stillings saw to it that a circumstantial account was in the colored american and that a copy of this paper was in congressman cresswells hands cresswell lost no time in calling on senator smith and pointing out to him that bles alwyn was a dangerous negro seeking social equality hating white people and scheming to make trouble he was too young and heady it would be fatal to give such a man office and influence fatal for the development of the south and bad for the cotton combine

senator smith was unconvinced alwyn struck him as a wellbalanced fellow and he thought he deserved the office he would however warn him to make no further speeches like that of last night cresswell mentioned stillings as a good inoffensive negro who knew his place and could be kept track of

 stillings is a good man admitted smith  but alwyn is better however i ll bear what you say in mind

cresswell found mr easterly in mrs vanderpools parlor and that gentleman was annoyed at the news

 i especially picked out this alwyn because he was southern and tractable and seemed to have sense enough to know how to say well what we wanted to say

 when as a matter of fact drawled mrs vanderpool u he was simply honest

 the south wont stand it cresswell decisively affirmed

 well â  began mr easterly

 see here interrupted mrs vanderpool  i m interested in alwyn in fact an honest man in politics even if he is black piques my curiosity give him a chance and i ll warrant he ll develop all the desirable traits of a first class officeholder

easterly hesitated  we must not offend the south and we must placate the negroes he said

 the right sort of negro â one like stillings â appointed to a reasonable position would do both opined cresswell

 it evidently did nt mrs vanderpool interjected

cresswell arose i tell you mr easterly i object â it must nt go through he took his leave

mrs vanderpool did not readily give up her plea for alwyn and bade zora get mr smith on the telephone for discussion

 well reported easterly hanging up the receiver  we may land him it seems that he is engaged to a washington schoolteacher and smith says she has him well in band she s a pretty shrewd proposition and understands that alwyns only chance now lies in keeping his mouth shut we may land him he repeated

 engaged  gasped mrs vanderpool

zora quietly closed the door

how zora found the little church she never knew but somehow in the long dark wanderings which she had fallen into the habit of taking at nightfall she stood one evening before it it looked warm and she was cold it was full of her people and she was very very lonely she sat in a back seat and saw with unseeing eyes she said again as she had said to herself a hundred times that it was all right and just what she had expected what else could she have dreamed that he should ever marry her was beyond possibility that had been settled long since â there where the tall dark pines wan with the shades of evening cast their haunting shadows across the silver fleece and half hid the bloodwashed west after that he would marry some one else of course some good and pure woman who would help and uplift and serve him

she had dreamed that she would help â unknown unseen â and perhaps she had helped a little through mrs vanderpool it was all right and yet why so suddenly had the threads of life let go why was she drifting in vast waters in uncharted wastes of sea why was the puzzle of life suddenly so intricate when but a little week ago she was reading it and its beauty and wisdom and power were thrilling her delighted hands could it be possible that all unconsciously she had dared dream a forbidden dream no she had always rejected it when no one else had the right when no one thought when no one cared she had hovered over his soul as some dark guardian angel but now now somebody else was receiving his gratitude it was all right she supposed but she the outcast child of the swamp what was there for her to do in the great world â her the burden of whose sin â but then came the voice of the preacher  behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world she found herself all at once intently listening she had been to church many times before but under the sermons and ceremonies she had always sat coldly inert in the south the cries contortions and religious frenzy left her mind untouched she did not laugh or mock she simply sat and watched and wondered at the north in the white churches she enjoyed the beauty of wall window and hymn liked the voice and surplice of the preacher but his words had no reference to anything in which she was interested here suddenly came an earnest voice addressed by singular chance to her of all the world

she listened bending forward her eyes glued to the speakers lips and letting no word drop he had the build and look of the fanatic thin to emaciation brown brillianteyed his words snapped in nervous energy and rang in awful earnestness

 life is sin and sin is sorrow sorrow is born of selfishness and selfseeking â our own good our own happiness our own glory as if any one of us were worth a life no never a single self as an end is and ought to be disappointment it is too low it is nothing only in a whole world of selves infinite endless eternal world on worlds of selves â only in their vast good is true salvation the good of others is our true good work for others not for your salvation but the salvation of the world the audience gave a low uneasy groan and the minister in whose pulpit the stranger preached stirred uneasily but he went on tensely with flying words  unselfishness is sacrifice â jesus was supreme sacrifice amen screamed a voice in your dark lives he cried who is the king of glory sacrifice lift up your heads then ye gates of prejudice and hate and let the king of glory come in forget yourselves and your petty wants and behold your starving people the wail of black millions sweeps the air â east and west they cry help help are you dumb are you blind do you dance and laugh and hear and see not the cry of death is in the air they murder burn and maim us   oh â oh â  moaned the people swaying in their seats  when we cry they mock us they ruin our women and debauch our children â what shall we do 

 behold the lamb of god that taketh away sin behold the supreme sacrifice that makes us clean give up your pleasures give up your wants give up all to the weak and wretched of our people go down to pharaoh and smite him in gods name go down to the south where we writhe strive â work â build â hew â lead â inspire god calls will you hear come to jesus the harvest is waiting who will cry  here am i send me

zora rose and walked up the aisle she knelt before the altar and answered the call  here am i â send me

and then she walked out above her sailed the same great stars around her hummed the same hoarse city but within her soul sang some new song of peace

 what is the matter zora  mrs vanderpool inquired for she seemed to see in the girls face and carriage some subtle change something that seemed to tell how out of the dream had stepped the dreamer into the realness of things how suddenly the seeker saw how to the wanderer the way was opened

just how she sensed this mrs vanderpool could not have explained nor could zora was there a change sudden cataclysmic no there were to come in future days all the old doubts and shiverings the old restless cry  it is all right â all right  but more and more above the doubt and beyond the unrest rose the great end the mighty ideal that flickered and wavered but ever grew and waxed strong until it became possible and through it all things else were possible thus from the grave of youth and love amid the soft low singing of dark and bowed worshippers the angel of the resurrection rolled away the stone

 what is the matter zora  mrs vanderpool repeated

zora looked up almost happily â standing poised on her feet as if to tell of strength and purpose

 i have found the way she cried joyously

mrs vanderpool gave her a long searching look

 where have you been   she asked  ive been waiting

 im sorry â but ive been â converted and she told her story

 pshaw zora  mrs vanderpool uttered impatiently  hes a fakir

 maybe said zora serenely and quietly  but he brought the word

zora dont talk cant it isnt worthy of your intelligence

 it was more than intelligent â it was true

zora â listen child you were wrought up tonight nervous â wild you were happy to meet your people and where he said one word you supplied two what you attribute to him is the voice of your own soul

but zora merely smiled  all you say may be true but what does it matter i know one thing like the man in the bible  whereas i was blind now i see 

mrs vanderpool gave a little helpless gesture  and what shall you do  she asked

 im going back south to work for my people when the old careworn look stole across mrs vanderpools features

zora came gently forward and slipped her arms lovingly about the other womans neck

not right off she said gently not until i learn more i hate to leave you but â it calls 

mrs vanderpool held the dark girl close and began craftily  you see zora the more you know the more you can do

 yes

 and if you are determined i will see that you are taught you must know settlementwork and reform movements not simply here but â  she hesitated â  in england â in france

 will it take long  zora asked smoothing the ladys hair

mrs vanderpool considered  no â five years is not long it is all too short

 five years it is very long but there is a great deal to learn must i study five years 

mrs vanderpool threw back her head

 zora i am selfish i know but five years truly is none too long then too zora we have work to do in that time

what

 there is alwyns career and mrs vanderpool looked into zoras eyes

the girl did not shrink but she paused

 yes she said slowly  we must help him

 and after he rises â 

 he will marry

whom   the woman he loves returned zora quietly

 yes â that is best sighed mrs vanderpool  but how shall we help him 

 make him treasurer of the united states without sacrificing his manhood or betraying his people

 i can do that said mrs vanderpool slowly

 it will cost something said zora 

 i will do it was the ladys firm assurance zora kissed her

the nest afternoon mrs cresswell went down to a white social settlement of which congressman todd had spoken where a meeting of the civic club was to be held she had come painfully to realize that if she was to have a career she must make it for herself the plain unwelcome truth was that her husband had no great interests in life in which she could find permanent pleasure companionship and love there was and she told herself always would be but in some respects their lives must flow in two streams last night for the second time she had irritated him he had spoken almost harshly to her and she knew she must brood or work today and so she hunted work eagerly

she felt t he atmosphere the moment she entered there were carelessly gowned women and men smart and shabby but none of them were thinking of clothes nor even of one another they had great deeds in mind they were scanning the earth they were toiling for men the same grim excitement that sends smaller souls hunting for birds and rabbits and lions had sent them hunting the enemies of mankind they were bent to the chase scenting the game knowing the infinite meaning of their hunt and the glory of victory mary cresswell had listened but a half hour before her world seemed so small and sordid and narrow so trivial that a sense of shame spread over her these people were not only earnest but expert they acknowledged the need of mr todds educational bill

 but the republicans are going to sidetrack it i have that on the best authority said one

 true but cant we force them to it 

 only by political power and they ve just won a campaign

 they won it by negro votes and the negro who secured the votes is eager for this bill hes a fine honest fellow

 very well work with him and when we can be of real service let us know meantime this child labor bill is different its bound to pass both parties are back of it and public opinion is aroused now our work is to force amendments enough to make the bill effective

discussion followed not flamboyant and declamatory but tense staccato pointed mrs cresswell found herself taking part someone mentioned her name and one or two glances of interest and even curiosity were thrown her way congressmens wives were rare at the civic club

congressman todd urged mrs cresswell to stay after the discussion and attend a meeting of the managers and workers of the washington social settlements

have you many settlements she inquired

 three in all â two white and one colored

and will they all be represented

 yes of course mrs cresswell if you object to meeting the colored people â 

mrs cresswell blushed

 no indeed she answered i used to teach colored people

she watched this new group gather a business man two fashionable ladies three college girls a grayhaired colored woman and a young spectacled brown man and then to her surprise mrs vanderpool and zora

zora was scarcely seated when that strange sixth sense of hers told her that something had happened and it needed but a sideglance from mrs vanderpool to indicate what it was she sat with folded hands and the old dreamy look in her eyes in one moment she lived it all again â the red cabin the moving oak the sowing of the fleece and its fearful reaping and now when she turned her head she would see the woman who was to marry bles alwyn she had often dreamed of her and had set a high ideal she wanted her to be handsome well dressed earnest and good she felt a sort of personal proprietorship in her and when at last the quickened pulse died to its regular healthy beat she turned and looked and knew

caroline wynn deemed it a part of the white worlds education to participate in meetings like this doing so was not pleasant but it appealed to her cynicism and mocking sense of pleasure she always roused hostility as she entered her gown was too handsome her gloves too spotless her air had hauteur enough to be almost impudent in the opinion of most white people then gradually her intelligence her cool wit and selfpossession would conquer and she would go gracefully out leaving a rather bewildered audience behind she sat today with her dark gold profile toward zora and the girl looked and was glad she was such a woman she would have bles marry she was glad and she choked back the sob that struggled and fought in her throat

the meeting never got beyond a certain constraint the congressman made an excellent speech there were various sets of figures read by the workers and miss wynn added a touch of spice by several pertinent questions and comments then as the meeting broke up and mrs cresswell came forward to speak to zora mrs vanderpool managed to find herself near miss wynn and to be introduced they exchanged a few polite phrases fencing delicately to test the others wrist and interest they touched on the weather and settlement work but miss wynn did not propose to be stranded an the negro problem

 i suppose the next bit of excitement will be the inauguration she said to mrs vanderpool

 i understand it will be unusually elaborate returned mrs vanderpool a little surprised at the turn

then she added pleasantly  i think i shall see it through from speech to ball

 yes i do usually miss wynn asserted adjusting her furs

mrs vanderpool was further surprised did colored people attend the ball

we sorely need a national ballroom she said  is nt the census building wretched  

 i do not know smiled miss wynn

 oh i thought you said â 

 i meant our ball

 oh  said mrs vanderpool in turn  oh  here a thought came of course the colored people had their own ball she remembered having heard about it why not send zora she plunged in  miss wynn i have a maid â such an intelligent girl i do wish she could attend your ball â  seeing her blunder she paused miss wynn was coolly buttoning her glove

 yes she acknowledged politely  few of us can afford maids and therefore we do not usually arrange for them but i think we can have your prot sgee look on from the gallery goodafternoon

as mrs vanderpool drove home she related the talk to zora zora was silent at first then she said deliberately   miss wynn was right

why zora

 did helene attend the ball four years ago  

 but zora must you folk ape our nonsense as well as our sense 

 you force us to said zora

the new president had been inaugurated beneath the creamy pile of the old capitol and facing the new library he had stood aloft and looked down on a waving sea of faces â blackcoated jostling eagereyed fellow creatures they had watched his lips move had scanned eagerly his dress and the gowned and decorated dignitaries beside him and then with blare of band and prancing of horses he had been whirled down the dip and curve of that long avenue with its medley of meanness and thrift and hurry and wealth until swinging sharply the dim walls of the white house rose before him he entered with a sigh

then the vast welter of humanity dissolved and streamed hither and thither gaping and laughing until night when thousands poured into the red barn of the census shack and entered the artificial fairyland within the president walked through smiling the senators protected their friends in the crush and harry cresswell led his wife to a little oasis of southern ladies and gentlemen  this is democracy for you said he wiping his brow from a whirling eddy mrs vanderpool waved at them and they rescued her

 i think i am ready to go she gasped  did you ever 

 come cresswell invited but just then the crowd pushed them apart and shot them along and mrs cresswell found herself clinging to her husband amid two great whirling variegated throngs of driving whitefaced people the band crashed and blared the people laughed and pushed and with rhythmic sound and swing the mighty throng was dancing

it took much effort but at last the cresswell party escaped and rolled off in their carriages they swept into the avenue and out again then up th street where turning for some street obstruction they passed a throng of carriages on a cross street

 it s the other ball cried mrs vanderpool and amid laughter she added  let s go 

it was â the other ball for washington is itself and something else besides along beside it ever runs that dark and haunting echo that shadowy worldinworld with its accusing silence its emphatic selfsufficiency mrs cresswell at first demurred she thought of elspeths cabin the dirt the smell the squalor of course this would be different but â well mrs cresswell had little inclination for slumming she was interested in the underworld but intellectually not by personal contact she did not know that this was a sideworld not an underworld yet the imposing building did not look sordid

 hired   asked some one

 no owned

 indeed

then there was a hitch

 tickets 

 where can we buy them  

 not on sale was the curt reply

 actually exclusive  sneered cresswell for he could not imagine any one unwelcome at a negro ball then he bethought himself of sam stillings and sent for him in a few minutes he had a dozen complimentary tickets in his hand

they entered the balcony and sat down mary cresswell leaned forward it was interesting beneath her was an ordinary pretty ball â flowered silked and ribboned with swaying whirling figures music and laughter and all the human fun of gayety and converse

and then she was impressed with the fact that this was no ordinary scene it was on the contrary most extraordinary

there was a black man waltzing with a white woman â no she was not white for mary caught the cream and curl of the girl as she swept past but there was a white man was he white and a black woman the color of the scene was wonderful the hard human white seemed to glow and live and run a mad gamut of the spectrum from morn till night from white to black through red and sombre browns pale and brilliant yellows dead and living blacks through her operaglasses mary scanned their hair she noted everything from the infinitely twisted crackled dead and grayishblack to the piled mass of red golden sunlight her eyes went dreaming there below was the gathering of the worlds she saw types of all nations and all lands swirling beneath her in human brotherhood and a great wonder shook her they seemed so happy surely this was no nether world it was upper earth and â her husband beckoned he had been laughing incontinently he saw nothing but a crowd of queer looking people doing things they were not made to do and appearing absurdly happy over it it irritated him unreasonably

 see the washerwoman in red he whispered  look at the monkey come let s go

they trooped noisily downstairs and cresswell walked unceremoniously between a black man and his partner mrs vanderpool recognized and greeted the girl as miss wynn mrs cresswell did not notice her but she paused with a start of recognition at the sight of the man

 why bles  she exclaimed impetuously starting to hold out her hand she was sincerely pleased at seeing him then she remembered she bowed and smiled looking at him with interest and surprise he was correctly dressed and the white shirt set off the comeliness of his black face in compelling contrast he carried himself like a man and bowed with gravity and dignity she passed on and heard her husbands petulant voice in her ear

 mary â mary for heavens sake come on dont shake hands with niggers

it was recurring flashes of temper like this together with evidences of dubious company and a growing fondness for liquor that drove mary cresswell more and more to find solace in the work of congressman todds civic club she collected statistics for several of the committee wrote letters interviewed a few persons and felt herself growing in usefulness and importance she did not mention these things to her husband she knew he would not object but she shrank from his ridicule

the various causes advocated by the civic club felt the impetus of the aggressive work of the organization this was especially the case with the national education bill and the amendment to the child labor bill the movement became strong enough to call mr easterly down from new york he and the inner circle went over matters carefully

 we need the political strength of the south said easterly  not only in framing national legislation in our own interests but always in state laws particularly we must get them into line to offset todds foolishness the child labor bill must either go through unamended or be killed the cotton inspection bill â our chief measure â must be slipped through quietly by southern votes while in the tariff mixup we must take good care of cotton

now on the other hand we are offending the southerners in three ways todds revived blair bill is too good a thing for niggers the south is clamoring for a first class embassy appointment and the presidents nomination of alwyn as treasurer will raise a howl from virginia to texas

there is some strong influence back of alwyn said senator smith  not only are the negroes enthused but the president has daily letters from prominent whites

the strong influence is named vanderpool easterly drily remarked  shes playing a bigger political game than i laid out for her thats the devil with women they cant concentrate they get too damned many side issues now i offered her husband the french ambassadorship provided shed help keep the southerners feeling good toward us shes hand in glove with the southerners all right but she wants not only her husbands appointment but this darkeys too

but that s been decided has nt it   put in smith

yes grumbled easterly but it makes it hard already at any rate the educational bill must be killed right off no more talk no more considerationâkill it and kill it now now about this child labor bill todds civic club is raising the mischief whos responsible  

the silent jackson spoke up  congressman cresswells wife has been very active and todd thinks theyve got the south with them

 congressman cresswells wife  easterlys face was one great exclamation point  now what the devil does this mean  

 i m afraid said senator smith  that it may mean an attempt on the part of cresswells friends to boost him for the french ambassadorship hes the only southerner with money enough to support the position and theres been a good deal of quiet talk i understand in southern circles

 but its treason  easterly shouted  it will ruin the plans of the combine to put this amended child labor bill through john taylor has just written me that hes starting mills at toomsville and that he depends on unrestricted labor conditions as we must throughout the south doesnt cresswell know this

 of course i think its just a bluff if he gets the appointment he ll let the bill drop

 i see â everybody is raising his price is he pretty soon the darky will be holding us up well see cresswell and put it to him strong i must go wire me

senator smith presented the matter bluntly to cresswell as soon as he saw him  which would the south prefer â todds education bill or alwyns appointment 

it was characteristic of cresswell that the smaller matter of stillings intrigue should interest him more than todds measure of which he knew nothing

what is todds bill asked harry cresswell darkening

smith surprised got out a copy and explained cresswell interrupted before he was half through

 dont you see he said angrily  that that will ruin our plans for the cotton combine

 yes i do replied smith  but it will not do the immediate harm that the amended child labor bill will do

whats that demanded cresswell frowning again

senator smith regarded him again was cresswell playing a shrewd game

 why he said at length  are nt you promoting it 

 no was the reply  never heard of it

 but senator smith began and paused he turned and took up a circular issued by the civic club giving a careful account of their endeavors to amend and pass the child labor bill cresswell read it then threw it aside

nonsense he indignantly repudiated the measure  that will never do its as bad as the education bill

 but your wife is encouraging it and we thought you were back of it

cresswell stared in blank amazement

 my wife  he gasped then he bethought himself  its a mistake he supplemented  mrs cresswell gave them no authority to sign her name

 shes been very active smith persisted  and naturally we were all anxious

cresswell bit his lip  i shall speak to her she does not realize what use they are making of her passing interest

he hurried away and senator smith felt a bit sorry for mrs cresswell when he recalled the expression on her husbands face

mary cresswell did not get home until nearly dinner time then she came in glowing with enthusiasm her work had received special commendation that afternoon and she had been asked to take the chairmanship of the committee on publicity finding that her husband was at home she determined to tell him â it was so good to be doing something worth while perhaps too he might be made to show some interest she thought of mr and mrs todd and the old dream glowed faintly again

cresswell looked at her as she entered the library where he was waiting and smoking she was rumpled and muddy with flying hair and thick walking shoes and the air of bustle and vigor which had crept into her blood this last month truly her cheeks were glowing and her eyes bright but he disapproved softness and daintiness silk and lace and glimmering flesh belonged to women in his mind and he despised amazons and  business  women he received her kiss coldly and marys heart sank she essayed some gay greeting but he interrupted her

whats this stuff about the civic club he began sharply

 stuff  she queried blankly

 thats what i said

 im sure i do nt know she answered stiffly  i belong to the civic club and have been working with it

why didnt you tell me his resentment grew as he proceeded

 i did not think you were interested

 did nt you know that this child labor business was opposed to my interests  

 dear i did not dream it it s a republican bill to be sure but you seemed very friendly with senator smith who introduced it we were simply trying to improve it

 suppose we did nt want it improved

 thats what some said but i did not believe such â deception

the blood rushed to cresswells face

 well you will drop this bill and the civic club from now on

 why 

 because i say so he retorted explosively too angry to explain further

she looked at him â a long fixed penetrating look which revealed more than she had ever seen before then turned away and went slowly upstairs she did not come down to dinner and in the evening the doctor was called

cresswell drooped a bit after eating hesitated and reflected he had acted too cavalierly in this civic club mess he concluded and yet he would not back down hed go see her and pet her a bit but be firm

he opened her boudoir door gently and she stood before him radiant clothed in silk and lace her hair loosened he paused astonished but she threw herself upon his neck with a joyful half hysterical cry

 i will give it all up â everything willingly willingly   her voice dropped abruptly to a tremulous whisper  oh harry i â i am to be the mother of a child

there is not the slightest doubt miss wynn senator smith was saying  but that the schools of the district will be reorganized

and the board of education abolished  she added  yes the power will be delegated to a single white superintendent

the vertical line in caroline wynns forehead became pronounced

 whose work is this senator  she asked

 well there are of course various parties back of the change the  outs the reformers the whole tendency to concentrate responsibility and so on but frankly the deciding factor was the demand of the south

 is there anything in washington that the south does not already own  

senator smith smiled thinly

not much drily  but we own the south

 and part of the price is putting the colored schools of the district in the hands of a southern man and depriving us of all voice in their control 

 precisely miss wynn but youd be surprised to know that it was the negroes themselves who stirred the south to this demand

 not at all you mean the colored newspapers i presume

 the same with teerswells clever articles then his partner stillings worked the  impudent negro teacher  argument on cresswell until cresswell was wild to get the south in control of the schools

 but what do teerswell and stillings want 

 they want bles alwyn to make a fool of himself

 that is a trifle cryptic miss wynn mused the senator amplified

 we are giving the south the washington schools and killing the education bill in return for their support of some of our measures and their assent to alwyns appointment you see i speak frankly

 i can stand it senator

 i believe you can well now if alwyn should act unwisely and offend the south somebody else stands in line for the appointment

 as treasurer  she asked in surprise

 oh no they are too shrewd to ask that it would offend their backers or shall i say their tools the southerners no they ask only to be register and assistant register of the treasury this is an office colored men have held for years and it is quite ambitious enough for them so stillings assures cresswell and his friends  i see miss wynn slowly acknowledged  but how do they hope to make mr alwyn blunder 

 too easily i fear â unless you are very careful alwyn has been working like a beaver for the national educational bill he s been in to see me several times as you probably know his heart is set on it he regards its passage as a sort of vindication of his defence of the party

 yes

 now the party has dropped the bill for good and alwyn does nt like it if he should attack the party â 

 but he would nt cried miss wynn with a start that belied her conviction

 did you know that he is to be invited to make the principal address to the graduates of the colored highschool 

 but  she objected  they have selected bishop johnson  i â 

 i know you did laughed the senator  but the judge got orders from higher up

 shrewd mr teerswell remarked miss wynn sagely

 shrewd mr stillings the senator corrected  but perhaps too shrewd suppose mr alwyn should take this occasion to make a thorough defence of the party

but â will he

 thats where you come in senator smith pointed out rising  and the real reason of this interview we re depending on you to pull the party out of an awkward hole and he shook hands with his caller

miss wynn walked slowly up pennsylvania avenue with a smile on her face

 i did not give him the credit she declared repeating it i did not give him the credit here i was playing an alluring game on the side and my dear tom transforms it into a struggle for bread and butter for of course if the board of education goes i lose my place she lifted her head and stared along the avenue

a bitterness dawned in her eyes the whole street was a living insult to her here she was an american girl by birth and breeding a daughter of citizens who had fought and bled and worked for a dozen generations on this soil jet if she stepped into this hotel to rest even with full purse she would be politely refused accommodation should she attempt to go into this picture show she would be denied entrance she was thirsty with the walk but at yonder fountain the clerk would roughly refuse to serve her it was lunch time there was no place within a mile where she was allowed to eat the revolt deepened within her beyond these known and definite discriminations lay the unknown and hovering in yonder store nothing hindered the clerk from being exceptionally pert on yonder streetcar the conductor might reserve his politeness for white folk this policemans business was to keep black and brown people in their places all this caroline wynn thought of and then smiled

this was the thing poor blind bles was trying to attack by appeals for justice nonsense does one  appeal  to the redeyed beast that throttles him  no he composes himself looks death in the eye and speaks softly on the chance whereupon miss wynn composed herself waved gayly at a passing acquaintance and matched some ribbons in a department store the clerk was new and anxious to sell

meantime her brain was busy she had a hard task before her alwyns absurd conscience and quixotic ideas were difficult to cope with after his last indiscreet talk she had ventured deftly to remonstrate and she well remembered the conversation

 was nt what i said true  he had asked perfectly is that an excuse for saying it

 the facts ought to be known

 yes but ought you to tell them 

 if not i who 

 some one who is less useful elsewhere and whom i like less

 carrie he had been intensely earnest  i want to do the best thing but im puzzled i wonder if im selling my birthright for six thousand dollars

 in case of doubt do it

but theres the doubt i may convert i may open the eyes of the blind i may start a crusade for negro rights

 dont believe it it s useless we ll never get our rights in this land

 you dont believe that  he had ejaculated shocked

well she must begin again as she had hoped he was waiting for her when she reached home she welcomed him cordially made a little music for him and served tea

 bles she said  the opposition has been laying a pretty shrewd trap for you

what he asked absently

 they are going to have you chosen as high school commencement orator

me stuff

you â and not stuff but education will be your natural theme indeed they have so engineered it that the party chiefs expect from you a defence of their dropping of the educational bill

 what 

 yes and probably your nomination will come before the speech and confirmation after

bles walked the floor excitedly for a while and then sat down and smiled

 it was a shrewd move he said  but i think i thank them for it

 i dont but still   t is the sport to see the engineer hoist by his own petar 

bles mused and she watched him covertly suddenly she leaned over

 moreover she said  about that same date im liable to lose my position as teacher

he looked at her quickly and she explained the coming revolution in school management

he did not discuss the matter and she was equally reticent but when he entered the doors of his lodgingplace and gathering his mail slowly mounted the stairs there came the battle of his life

he knew it and he tried to wage it coolly and with method he arrayed the arguments side by side on this side lay success the greatest office ever held by a negro in america â greater than douglass or bruce or lynch had held â a landmark a living example and inspiration a man owed the world success there were plenty who could fail and stumble and give multiple excuses should he be one he viewed the other side what must he pay for success  aye face it boldly â what mechanically he searched for his mail and undid the latest number of the colored american he was sure the answer stood there in teerswells biting vulgar english and there it was with a cartoon his masters voice alwyn is ordered to eat his words or get out watch him do it gracefully the republican leaders etc

he threw down his paper and the hot blood sang in his ears the sickening thought was that it was true if he did make the speech demanded it would be like a dog obedient to his masters voice

the cold sweat oozed on his face throwing up the window he drank in the spring breeze and stared at the city he once had thought so alluring somehow it looked like the swamp only less beautiful he stretched his arms and his lips breathed â  zora 

he turned hastily to his desk and looked at the other piece of mail â a single sealed note carefully written on heavy paper he did not recognize the handwriting then his mind flew off again what would they say if he failed to get the office how they would silently hoot and jeer at the upstart who suddenly climbed so high and fell and carrie wynn â poor carrie with her pride and position dragged down in his ruin how would she take it he writhed in soul and yet to be a man to say calmly  no  to stand in that great audience and say  my people first and last  to take carries hand and together face the world and struggle again to newer finer triumphs â all this would be very close to attainment of the ideal he found himself staring at the little letter would she go would she could she lay aside her pride and cynicism her dainty ways and little extravagances an odd fancy came to him perhaps the answer to the riddle lay sealed within the envelope he fingered

he opened it within lay four lines of writing â no more â no address no signature simply the words  it matters not how strait the gate how charged with punishment the scroll i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul

he stared at the lines eleven oclock â twelve â one â chimed the deepvoiced clock without before alwyn went to bed

miss wynn had kept a vigil almost as long she knew that bles had influential friends who had urged his preferment it might be wise to enlist them before she fell asleep she had determined to have a talk with mrs vanderpool she had learned from senator smith that the lady took especial interest in alwyn

mrs vanderpool heard miss wynns story next day with some inward dismay really the breadth and depth of intrigue in this city almost frightened her as she walked deeper into the mire she had promised zora that bles should receive his reward on terms which would not wound his manhood it seemed an easy almost an obvious thing to promise at the time yet here was this rather unusual young woman asking mrs vanderpool to use her influence in making alwyn bow to the yoke she fenced for time

 but i do not know mr alwyn

 i thought you did you recommended him highly

 i knew of him slightly in the south and i have watched his career here

 it would be too bad to have that career spoiled now

but is it necessary suppose he should defend the education bill

and criticise the party asked miss wynn it would take strong influence to pull him through

 and if that strong influence were found  said mrs vanderpool thoughtfully

 it would surely involve some other important concession to the south

mrs vanderpool looked up and an interjection hovered on her lips was it possible that the price of alwyns manhood would be her husbands appointment to paris and if it were

 i ll do what i can she said graciously  but i am afraid that will not be much

miss wynn hesitated she had not succeeded even in guessing the source of mrs vanderpools interest in alwyn and without that her appeal was but blind groping she stopped on her way to the door to admire a bronze statuette and find time to think

you are interested in bronzes asked mrs vanderpool

 oh no im far too poor but ive dabbled a bit in sculpture

indeed mrs vanderpool revealed a mild interest and miss wynn was compelled to depart with little enlightenment

on the way up town she concluded that there was but one chance of success she must write alwyns speech with characteristic decision she began her plans at once

 what will you say in your speech  she asked him that night as he rose to go

he looked at her and she wavered slightly under his black eyes the fight was becoming a little too desperate even for her steady nerves

 you would not like me to act dishonestly would you he asked

 no she involuntarily replied regretting the word the moment she had uttered it he gave her one of his rare sweet smiles and rising before she realized his intent he had kissed her hands and was gone

she asked herself why she had been so foolish and yet somehow sitting there alone in the firelight she felt glad for once that she had risen above intrigue then she sighed and smiled and began to plot anew teerswell dropped in later and brought his friend stillings they found their hostess gay and entertaining

miss wynn gathered books about her and in the days of april and may she and alwyn read up on education he marvelled at the subtlety of her mind and she at the relentlessness of his they were very near each other during these days and yet there was ever something between them a vision to him of dark and pleading eyes that he constantly saw beside her cool keen glance and he to her was always two men one man above men whom she could respect but would not marry and one man like all men whom she would marry but could not respect his devotion to an ideal which she thought so utterly unpractical aroused keen curiosity and admiration she was sure he would fail in the end and she wanted him to fail and somehow somewhere back beyond herself her better self longed to find herself defeated to see this mind stand firm on principle under circumstances where she believed men never stood deep within her she discovered at times a passionate longing to believe in somebody yet she found herself bending every energy to pull this man down to the level of timeservers and even as she failed feeling something like contempt for his stubbornness

the great day came he had her notes her suggestions her hints but he had no intimation of what he would finally say

will you come to hear me he asked

 no she murmured

 that is best he said and then he added slowly  i would not like you ever to despise me

she answered sharply  i want to despise you 

did he understand she was not sure she was sorry she had said it but she meant it fiercely then he left her for it was already four in the afternoon and he spoke at eight

in the morning she came down early despite some dawdling over her toilet she brought the morning paper into the diningroom and sat down with it sipping her coffee she leaned back and looked leisurely at the headings there was nothing on the front page but a divorce a revolution and a new trust she took another sip of her coffee and turned the page there it was  colored high schools close â vicious attack on republican party by negro orator

she laid the paper aside and slowly finished her coffee a few minutes later she went to her desk and sat there so long that she started at hearing the clock strike nine

the day passed when she came home from school she bought an evening paper she was not surprised to learn that the senate had rejected alwyns nomination that samuel stillings had been nominated and confirmed as register of the treasury and that mr tom teerswell was to be his assistant also the bill reorganizing the school board had passed she wrote two notes and posted them as she went out to walk

when she reached home stillings was there and they talked earnestly the bell rang violently teerswell rushed in

 well carrie  he cried eagerly

 well tom she responded giving him a languid hand stillings rose and departed teerswell nodded and said  well what do you think of last night w  a great speech i hear

 a fool speech â that speech cost him i calculate between twentyfour and fortyeight thousand dollars  possibly he s satisfied with his bargain

possibly are you

with his bargain quickly yes

no he pressed her with your bargain

 what bargain   she parried

 to marry him

 oh no thats off

is it off cried teerswell delightedly good it was foolish from the first â that black country â 

 gently miss wynn checked him  i m not yet over the habit

 come see what ive bought you know i have a salary now he produced a ring with a small diamond cluster

 how pretty  she said taking it and looking at it then she handed it back

he laughed gayly  it s yours carrie you re going to marry me

she looked at him queerly

 am i  but ive got another ring already she said  oh send alwyns back

 i have this is still another and uncovering her hand she showed a ring with a large and beautiful diamond

he rose whose is that he demanded apprehensively

 mine â  her eyes met his

 but who gave it to you  

 mr stillings was the soft reply

he stared at her helplessly i â i â dont understand   he stammered

 well to be brief im engaged to mr stillings

 what to that flatheaded â 

 no she coolly interrupted  to the register of the treasury

the man was too dumbfounded too overwhelmed for coherent speech

 but â but â come why in gods name â will you throw yourself away on â on such a â youre joking â you â 

she motioned him to a chair he obeyed like one in a trance

 now tom be calm when i was a baby i loved you but that is long ago today tom you re an insufferable cad and i â well im too much like you to have two of us in the same family

 but stillings  he burst forth almost in tears  the snake â what is he 

nearly as bad as you ill admit but he has four thousand a year and sense enough to keep it in truth i need it for thanks to your political activity my own position is gone

 but he s a â a damned rascal  wounded selfconceit was now getting the upper hand

she laughed

 i think he is but hes such an exceptional rascal he appeals to me you know tom we re all more or less rascally â except one

except who he asked quickly

 bles alwyn

the fool

 yes she slowly agreed  bles alwyn the fool â and the man but by grace of the negro problem i cannot afford to marry a man â hark some one is on the steps i m sure its bles youd better go now dont attempt to fight with him hes very strong goodnight

alwyn entered he did nt notice teerswell as he passed out he went straight to miss wynn holding a crumpled note and his voice faltered a little

 do you mean it  

yes bles

 why

 because i am selfish and â small

no you are not you want to be but give it up carrie it isnt worth the cost come lets be honest and poorâand free

she regarded him a moment searchingly then a look half quizzical half sorrowful came into her eyes she put both her hands on his shoulders and said as she kissed his lips  bles almost thou persuadest me â to be a fool now go

 never realized before just what a lie meant said zora

the paper in mrs vanderpools hands fell quickly quickly to her lap and she gazed across the toilettable

as she gazed that odd mirage of other days haunted her again she did not seem to see her maid nor the white and satin morningroom she saw with some long inner sight a vast hall with mighty pillars a smooth marbled floor and a great throng whose silent eyes looked curiously upon her strange carven beasts gazed on from a setting of rich barbaric splendor and she herself â the liar â lay in rags before the gold and ivory of that lofty throne whereon sat zora

the foolish phantasy passed with the second of time that brought it and mrs vanderpools eyes dropped again to her paper to those linesâ  the president has sent the following nominations to the senate    to be ambassador to france john vanderpool esq

the first feeling of triumph thrilled faintly again until the low voice of zora startled her it was so low and calm it came as though journeying from great distances and weary with travel

 i used to think a lie a little thing a convenience but now i see it is a great no and it kills things you remember that day when mr easterly called 

 yes replied mrs vanderpool faintly u i heard all he said i could not help it my transom was open and then too after he mentioned â mr alwyns name i wanted to hear i knew that his appointment would cost you the embassy â unless bles was tempted and should fall so i came to you to say â to say you must nt pay the price

 and i lied said mrs vanderpool  i told you that he should be appointed and remain a man i meant to make him see that he could yield without great cost but i let you think i was giving up the embassy when i never intended to

she spoke coldly yet zora knew she reached out and took the white still hands in hers and over the ladys face again flitted that stricken look of age

 i do not blame you said zora gently  i blame the world

 i am the world mrs vanderpool uttered harshly then suddenly laughed but zora went on  it bewildered me when i first read the news early this morning the world â everything â seemed wrong you see my plan was all so splendid just as i turned away from him back to my people i was to help him to the highest i was so afraid he would miss it and think that right did nt win in life that i wrote him â 

 you wrote him so did i

zora glanced at her quickly

 yes said mrs vanderpool  i thought i knew him he seemed an ordinary rather priggish opinionated country boy and i wrote and said â oh i said that the world is the world take it as it is you wrote differently and he obeyed you

no he did not know it was i i was just a voice from nowhere calling to him i thought i was right i wrote each day sometimes twice sending bits of verse quotations references all saying the same thing right always triumphs but it doesnt does it

 no it never does save by accident

 i do not think that is quite so zora pondered aloud  and i am a little puzzled i do not belong in this world where right and wrong get so mixed with us yonder there is wrong but we call it wrong â mostly oh i dont know even there things are mixed she looked sadly at mrs vanderpool and the fear that had been hovering behind her mistresss eyes became visible

 it was so beautiful said zora  i expected a great thing of you â a sacrifice i do not blame you because you could not do it and yet â yet after thisâ dont you see â i cannot stay here

mrs vanderpool arose and walked over to her she stood above her in her silken morninggown her brown and gray sprinkled hair rising above the pale stronglined face

zora she faltered will you leave me

zora answered  yes it was a soft  yes a  yes  full of pity and regret but a  yes  that mrs vanderpool knew in her soul to be final

she sat down again on the lounge and her fingers crept along the cushions

 ambassadorships come â high she said with a catch in her voice then after a pause  when will you go zora 

 when you leave for the summer

mrs vanderpool looked out upon the beautiful city she was a little surprised at herself she had found herself willing to sacrifice almost anything for zora no living soul had ever raised in her so deep an affection and yet she knew now that although the cost was great she was willing to sacrifice zora for paris after all it was not too late a rapid ride even now might secure high office for alwyn and make cresswell ambassador it would be difficult but possible but she had not the slightest inclination to attempt it and she said aloud half mockingly you are right zora i promised â and â i lied liars have no place in heaven and heaven is doubtless a beautiful place â but oh zora you havent seen paris  two months later they parted simply knowing well it was forever mrs vanderpool wrote a check

 use this in your work she said  miss smith asked for it long ago it is â my campaign contribution zora smiled and thanked her as she put the sealed envelope in her trunk her hand came in contact with a long untouched package zora took it out silently and opened it and the beauty of it lightened the room

 it is the silver fleece said zora and mrs vanderpool kissed her and went

zora walked alone to the vaulted station she did not try to buy a pullman ticket although the journey was thirtysix hours she knew it would be difficult if not impossible and she preferred to share the lot of her people once on the foremost car she leaned back and looked the car seemed clean and comfortable but strangely short then she realized that half of it was cut off for the white smokers and as the door swung whiffs of the smoke came in but she was content for she was almost alone

it was eighteen little months ago that she had ridden up to the world with widening eyes in that time what had happened everything how well she remembered her coming the first reflection of yonder gilded dome and the soaring of the capitol the swelling of her heart with inarticulate wonder the pain of the thirst to know and understand she did not know much now but she had learned how to find things out she did not understand all but some things she â  ticket  â the tone was harsh and abrupt zora started she had always noted how polite conductors were to her and mrs vanderpool â was it simply because mrs vanderpool was evidently a great and rich lady she held up her ticket and he snatched it from her muttering some direction

i beg your pardon she said

 change at charlotte he snapped as he went on

it seemed to zora that his discourtesy was almost forced that he was afraid he might be betrayed into some show of consideration for a black woman she felt no anger she simply wondered what he feared the increasing smell of tobacco smoke started her coughing she turned to be sure not only was the door to the smoker standing open but a white passenger was in her car sitting by the conductor and puffing heartily as the black porter passed her she said gently is smoking allowed in here 

 it aint none o my business he flung back at her and moved away all day white men passed back and forward through the car as through a thoroughfare they talked loudly and laughed and joked and if they did not smoke they carried their lighted cigars at her they stared and made comments and one of them came and lounged almost over her seat inquiring where she was going

she did not reply she neither looked nor stirred but kept whispering to herself with something like awe  this is what they must endure â my poor people 

at lynchburg a newsboy boarded the train with his wares the conductor had already appropriated two seats for himself and the newsboy routed out two colored passengers and usurped two other seats then he began to be especially annoying he joked and wrestled with the porter and on every occasion pushed his wares at zora insisting on her buying

aint you got no money he asked where you going 

 say he whispered another time  dont you want to buy these gold spectacles i found em and i dassent sell em open see they re worth ten dollars â take em for a dollar

zora sat still keeping her eyes on the window but her hands worked nervously and when he threw a book with a picture of a man and halfdressed woman directly under her eyes she took it and dropped it out of the window

the boy started to storm and demanded pay while the conductor glared at her but a white man in the conductors seat whispered something and the row suddenly stopped

a gang of colored section hands got on dirty and loud they sprawled about and smoked drank and bought candy and cheap gewgaws they eyed her respectfully and with one of them she talked a little as he awkwardly fingered his cap

as the day wore on zora found herself strangely weary it was not simply the unpleasant things that kept happening but the continued apprehension of unknown possibilities then too she began to realize that she had had nothing to eat travelling with mrs vanderpool there was always a dainty lunch to be had at call she did not expect this but she asked the porter  do you know where i can get a lunch  

 search me he answered lounging into a seat  aint no chance betwixt here and danville as i knows on

zora viewed her plight with a certain dismay â twelve hours without food how foolish of her not to have thought of this the hours passed she turned desperately to the gruff conductor

could i buy a lunch from the diningcar she inquired

 no was the curt reply

she made herself as comfortable as she could and tried to put the matter from her mind she remembered how forgotten years ago she had often gone a day without eating and thought little of it night came slowly and she fell to dreaming until the cry came  charlotte change cars  she scrambled out there was no step to the platform her bag was heavy and the porter was busy helping the white folks to alight she saw a dingy lunchroom marked  colored but she had no time to go to it for her train was ready

there was another colored porter on this and he was very polite and affable

 yes miss certainly i ll fetch you a lunch â plenty of time and he did it did not look clean but zora was ravenous

the white smoker now had few occupants but the white train crew proceeded to use the colored coach as a loungingroom and sleepingcar there was no passenger except zora they took off their coats stretched themselves on the seats and exchanged jokes but zora was too tired to notice much and she was dozing wearily when she felt a touch on the arm and found the porter in the seat beside her with his arm thrown familiarly behind her along the top of the back she rose abruptly to her feet and he started up

 i beg pardon he said grinning

zora sat slowly down as he got up and left she determined to sleep no more yet a vast vision sank on her weary spirit â the vision of a dark cloud that dropped and dropped upon her and lay as lead along her straining shoulders she must lift it she knew though it were big as a world and she put her strength to it and groaned as the porter cried in the ghostly morning light  atlanta all change 

away yonder at the school near toomsville miss smith sat waiting for the coming of zora absently attending the duties of the office dark little heads and hands bobbed by and soft voices called  miss smith i wants a penny pencil

 miss smith is yo got a speller fo ten cents  

 miss smith mammy say please lemme come to school this week and she ll sho pay sataday

yet the little voices that summoned her back to earth were less clamorous than in other years for the school was far from full and miss smith observed the falling off with grave eyes this condition was patently the result of the cotton corner and the subsequent manipulation when cotton rose the tenants had already sold their cotton when cotton fell the landlords squeezed the rations and lowered the wages when cotton rose again up went the new spring rent contracts so it was that the bewildered black serf dawdled in listless inability to understand the cresswells in their new wealth the maxwells and tollivers in the new pinch of poverty stretched long arms to gather in the tenants and their children excuse after excuse came to the school

i cant send the chilluns dis term miss smith dey has to work

 mr cress well wont allow will to go to school this term

 mr tolliver done put sam in the field

and so miss smith contemplated many empty desks

slowly a sort of fatal inaction seized her the school went on daily the dark little cloud of scholars rose up from hill and vale and settled in the white buildings the hum of voices and the busy movements of industrious teachers filled the day the office work went on methodically but back of it all miss smith sat half hopeless it cost five thousand a year to rim the school and this sum she raised with increasingly greater difficulty extra and heartstraining effort had been needed to raise the eight hundred dollars additional for interest money on the mortgage last year next year it might have to come out of the regular income and thus cut off two teachers beyond all this the raising of ten thousand dollars to satisfy the mortgage seemed simply impossible and miss smith sat in fatal resignation awaiting the coming day

u it s the lords work i ve done what i could i guess if he wants it to go on he ll find a way and if he does nt â  she looked off across the swamp and was silent

then came zoras letter simple and brief but breathing youth and strength of purpose miss smith seized upon it as an omen of salvation in vain her shrewd new england reason asked  what can a halftaught black girl do in this wilderness her heart answered back  what is impossible to youth and resolution   let the shabbiness increase let the debts pile up let the boarders complain and the teachers gossip â zora was coming and somehow she and zora would find a way

and zora came just as the sun threw its last crimson through the black swamp came and gathered the frail and whitehaired woman in her arms and they wept together long and low they talked far into the soft southern night sitting shaded beneath the stars while nearby blinked the drowsy lights of the girls dormitory at last miss smith said rising stiffly  i forgot to ask about mrs vanderpool how is she and where 

zora murmured some answer but as she went to bed in her little white room she sat wondering sadly where was the poor spoiled woman who was putting her to bed and smoothing the pillow who was oaring for her and what was she doing and zora strained her eyes northward through the night

at this moment mrs vanderpool rising from a gala dinner in the brilliant drawingroom of her lake george mansion was reading the evening paper which her husband had put into her hands with startled eyes she caught the impudent headlines vanderpool dropped senate refuses to confirm todd insurgents muster enough votes to defeat confirmation of presidents nominee rumored revenge for machines defeat of child labor bill amendment

the paper trembled in her jewelled hands she glanced down the column

todd asks who is vanderpool anyhow what did he ever do he is known only as a selfish millionaire who thinks more of horses than of men

carelessly mrs vanderpool threw the paper to the floor and bit her lips as the angry blood dyed her face

 they shall confirm him she whispered  if i have to mortgage my immortal soul  and she rang up long distance on the telephone

was the child born dead 

worse than dead

somehow somewhere mary cresswell had heard these words long long ago down there in the great painswept shadows of utter agony where earth seemed slipping its moorings and now today she lay repeating them mechanically grasping vaguely at their meaning long she had wrestled with them as they twisted and turned and knotted themselves and she worked and toiled so hard as she lay there to make the thing clear â to understand

was the child born dead

worse than dead

then faint and fainter whisperings what could be worse than death she had tried to ask the grey old doctor but he soothed her like a child each day and left her lying there today she was stronger and for the first time sitting up looking listlessly out across the world â a queer world why had they not let her see the child â just one look at its little dead face that would have been something and again as the doctor cheerily turned to go she sought to repeat the old question he looked at her sharply then interrupted saying kindly there now youve been dreaming you must rest quietly now and with a nod he passed into the other room to talk with her husband

she was not satisfied she had not been dreaming she would tell harry to ask him â she did not often see her husband but she must ask him now and she arose unsteadily and swayed noiselessly across the floor a moment she leaned against the door then opened it slightly from the other side the words came distinctly and clearly  â other children doctor

 you must have no other children mr cresswell

 why

 because the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generation

slowly softly she crept away her mind seemed very clear and she began a long journey to reach her window and chair â a long long journey but at last she sank into the chair again and sat dryeyed wondering who had conceived this world and made it and why

a long time afterward she found herself lying in bed awake conscious clearminded yet she thought as little as possible for that little was pain but she listened gladly for without she heard the solemn beating of the sea the mighty rhythmic beating of the sea long days she lay and sat and walked beside those vast and speaking waters till at last she knew their voice and they spoke to her and the seacalm soothed her soul

for one brief moment of her life she saw herself clearly a wellmeaning woman ambitious but curiously narrow not willing to work long for the vision but leaping at it rashly blindly with a deepseated sense of duty which she made a source of offence by preening and parading it and forcing it to illtimed notice she saw that she had looked on her husband as a means not an end she had wished to absorb him and his work for her own glory she had idealized for her own uses a very human man whose life had been full of sin and fault she must atone

no sooner in this brief moment did she see herself honestly than her old habits swept her on tumultuously no ordinary atonement would do the sacrifice must be vast the world must stand in wonder before this clever woman sinking her soul in another and raising him by sheer will to the highest

so after six endless months mary cresswell walked into her washington home again she knew she had changed in appearance but she had forgotten to note how much until she saw the stare â almost the recoil â of her husband the muttered exclamation the studied almost overdone welcome then she went up to her mirror and looked long and knew

she was strong she felt well but she was slight almost scrawny and her beauty was gone forever it had been of that blonde whiteandpink type that fades in a flash and its going left her body flattened and angular her skin drawn and dead white her eyes sunken from the radiant girl whom cresswell had met three years earlier the change was startling and yet the contrast seemed even greater than it was for her glory then had been her abundant and almost golden hair now that hair was faded and falling so fast that at last the doctor advised her to cut it short this left her illshaped head exposed and emphasized the sunken hollows of her face she knew that she was changed but she did not quite realize how changed until now as she stood and gazed

yet she did not hesitate but from that moment set herself to her new life task characteristically she started dramatically and largely she was to make her life an endless sacrifice she was to revivify the manhood in harry cresswell and all this for no return no partnership of soul â all was to be complete sacrifice and sinking of soul in soul

if mary cresswell had attempted less she would have accomplished more as it was she began well she went to work tactfully seeming to note no change in his manner toward her but his manner had changed he was studiously scrupulously polite in private and in public devoted but there was no feeling no passion no love the polished shell of his clan reflected conventional light even more carefully than formerly because the shell was cold and empty there were no little flashes of anger now no poutings nor sweet reconciliations life ran very smoothly and courteously and while she did not try to regain the affection she strove to enthrall his intellect she supplied a subcommittee upon which he was serving â not directly but through him â with figures with reports books and papers so that he received special commendations a praise that piqued as well as pleased him because it implied a certain surprise that he was able to do it

the damned yankees he sneered they think they ve got the brains of the nation

 why not make a speech on the subject  she suggested

he laughed the matter under discussion was the cottongoods schedule of the new tariff bill about which really he knew a little his wife placed every temptation to knowledge before him even inspiring senator smith to ask him to defend that schedule against the lowtariff advocate mary cresswell worked with redoubled energy and for nearly a week harry staid at home nights and studied thanks to his wife the speech was unusually informing and well put and the fact that a prominent freetrader spoke the same afternoon gave it publicity while mr easterly saw to the press despatches

cresswell subscribed to a clippingbureau and tasted the sweets of dawning notoriety and mrs cresswell arranged a select dinnerparty which included a cabinet officer a foreign ambassador two millionaires and the leading southern congressmen the talk came around to the failure of the senate to confirm mr vanderpool and it was generally assumed that the president would not force the issue

who then should be nominated there were several suggestions but the knot of southern congressmen about mrs cresswell declared emphatically that it must be a southerner not since the war had a prominent southerner represented america at a firstclass foreign court it was shameful the time was ripe for change but who here opinions differed widely nearly every one mentioned a candidate and those who did not seemed to refrain from motives of personal modesty

mary cresswell sped her departing guests with a distinct purpose in mind she must make herself leader of the southern set in washington and concentrate its whole force on the appointment of harry cresswell as ambassador to france quick reward and promotion were essential to harrys success he was not one to keep up the strain of effort a long time unless then tangible results came and came quickly he was liable to relapse into old habits therefore he must succeed and succeed at once she would have preferred a less ornamental position than the ambassadorship but there were no other openings the alabama senators were firmly seated for at least four years and the governorship had been carefully arranged for a term of four years abroad however might bring harry cresswell back in time for greater advancement at any rate it was the only tangible offering and mary cresswell silently determined to work for it

here it was that she made her mistake it was one thing for her to be a tactful hostess pleasing her husband and his guests it was another for her to aim openly at social leadership and political influence she had at first all the insignia of success her dinners became of real political significance and her husband figured more and more as a leading southerner the result was twofold cresswell on the one hand with his usual selfishness took his rising popularity as a matter of course and as the fruits of his own work he was rising he was making valuable speeches he was becoming a social power and his only handicap was his plain and overambitious wife but on the other hand mrs cresswell forgot two pitfalls the cleft between the old southern aristocracy and the pushing new southerners and above all her own northern birth and presumably pronegro sympathies

what mrs cresswell forgot mrs vanderpool sensed unerringly she had heard with uneasiness of cresswells renewed candidacy for the paris ambassadorship and she set herself to block it she had worked hard the president stood ready to send her husbands appointment again to the senate whenever easterly could assure him of favorable action easterly had long and satisfactory interviews with several senators while the todd insurgents were losing heart at the prospect of choosing between vanderpool and cresswell at present four southern votes were needed to confirm vanderpool but if they could not be had easterly declared it would be good politics to nominate cresswell and give him republican support manifestly then mrs vanderpools task was to discredit the cresswells with the southerners it was not a work to her liking but the die was cast and she refused to contemplate defeat

the result was that while mrs cresswell was giving large and brilliant parties to the whole southern contingent mrs vanderpool was engineering exclusive dinners where old new york met stately charleston and gossiped interestingly on such occasions it was hinted not once but many times that the cresswells were well enough but who was that upstart wife who presumed to take social precedence

it was not however until mrs cresswells plan for an allsouthern art exhibit in washington that mrs vanderpool in a flash of inspiration saw her chance in the annual exhibit of the corcoran art gallery a southern girl had nearly won first prize over a western man the concensus of southern opinion was that the judgment had been unfair and mrs cresswell was convinced of this with quick intuition she suggested a southern exhibit with such social prestige back of it as to impress the country

the proposal caught the imagination of the southern set none suspected a possible intrusion of the eternal race issue for no negroes were allowed in the corcoran exhibit or school this mrs vanderpool easily ascertained and a certain sense of justice combined in a curious way with her political intrigue to bring about the undoing of mary cresswell

mrs vanderpools very first cautious inquiries by way of the back stairs brought gratifying response â for did not all black washington know well of the work in sculpture done by mrs samuel stillings nee wynn mrs vanderpool remembered mrs stillings perfectly and she walked that evening through unobtrusive thoroughfares and called on mrs stillings had mrs stillings heard of the new art movement did she intend to exhibit mrs stillings did not intend to exhibit as she was sure she would not be welcome she had had a bust accepted by the corcoran art gallery once and when they found she was colored they returned it but if she were especially invited that would make a difference although even then the line would be drawn somehow

would it not be worth a fight suggested mrs vanderpool with a little heightening of color in her pale cheek

 perhaps said mrs stillings as she brought out some specimens of her work

mrs vanderpool was both ashamed and grateful with money and leisure mrs stillings had been able to get in new york and boston the training she had been denied in washington on account of her color the things she exhibited really had merit and one curiously original group appealed to mrs vanderpool tremendously

 send it she counseled with strangely contradictory feelings of enthusiasm and added enter it under the name of wynn

in addition to the general invitations to the art exhibit numbers of special ones were issued to promising southern amateurs who had never exhibited for these a prize of a longterm scholarship and other smaller prizes were offered when mrs vanderpool suggested the name of  miss wynn  to mrs cresswell among a dozen others for special invitation there was nothing in its sound to distinguish it from the rest of the names and the invitation went duly as a result there came to the exhibit a little group called  the outcasts which was really a masterly thing and sent the director signor albemi into hysterical commendation

in the private view and award of prizes which preceded the larger social function the jury hesitated long between  the outcasts  and a painting from georgia mrs cresswell was enthusiastic and voluble for the bit of sculpture and it finally won the vote for the first prize

all was ready for the great day the president was coming and most of the diplomatic corps high officers of the army and all the social leaders congress would be well represented and the boom for cresswell as ambassador to france was almost visible in the air

mary cresswell paused a moment in triumph looking back at the darkened hall when a little woman fluttered up to her and whispered mrs cresswell have you heard the gossip

 no â what 

 that wynn woman they say is a nigger some are whispering that you brought her in purposely to force social equality they say you used to teach darkies of course i dont believe all their talk but i thought you ought to know she talked a while longer then fluttered furtively away

mrs cresswell sat down limply she saw ruin ahead â to think of a black girl taking a prize at an allsouthern art exhibit but there was still a chance and she leaped to action this colored woman was doubtless some poor deserving creature she would call on her immediately and by an offer of abundant help induce her to withdraw quietly

entering her motor she drove near the address and then proceeded on foot the street was a prominent one the block one of the best the house almost pretentious she glanced at her memorandum again to see if she was mistaken perhaps the woman was a domestic probably she was for the name on the door was stillings it occurred to her that she had heard that name before â but where she looked again at her memorandum and at the house

she rang the bell asking the trim black maid  is there a person named caroline wynn living in this house 

the girl smiled and hesitated

 yes maam she finally replied  wont you come in   she was shown into the parlor where she sat down the room was most interesting furnished in unimpeachable taste a few good pictures were on the walls and mrs cresswell was examining one when she heard the swish of silken skirts a lady with gold brown face and straight hair stood before her with pleasant smile where had mrs cresswell seen her before she tried to remember but could not

you wished to see â caroline wynn

 yes

 what can i do for you 

mrs cresswell groped for her proper cue but the brown lady merely offered a chair and sat down silently mrs cresswells perplexity increased she had been planning to descend graciously but authoritatively upon some shrinking girl but this woman not only seemed to assume equality but actually looked it from a rapid survey mrs cresswell saw a black silk stocking a bit of lace a tailormade gown and a head with two full black eyes that waited in calmly polite expectancy

something had to be said

i â er â came that is i believe you sent a group to the art exhibit

 yes

 it was good â very good

miss wynn said nothing but sat calmly looking at her visitor mrs cresswell felt irritated

 of course she managed to continue  we are very sorry that we cannot receive it

indeed i understood it had taken the first prize mrs cresswell was aghast who had rushed the news to this woman she realized that there were depths to this matter that she did not understand and her irritation increased

you know that we could not give the prize to a â negro

 why not 

 that is quite immaterial social equality cannot be forced at the same time i recognize the injustice and i have come to say that if you will withdraw your exhibit you will be given a scholarship in a boston school

 i do not wish it

well what do you want

 i was not aware that i had asked for anything

mrs cresswell felt herself getting angry

 why did you send your exhibit when you knew it vas not wanted 

 because you asked me to

 we did not ask for colored people

 you asked all southernborn persons i am a person and i am southern bom moreover you sent me a personal letter

mrs cresswell was sure that this was a lie and was thoroughly incensed

 you cannot have the prize she almost snapped  if you will withdraw i will pay you any reasonable sum

 thank you i do not want money i want justice

mrs cresswell arose and her face was white

 that is the trouble with you negroes you wish to get above your places and force yourselves where you are not wanted it does no good it only makes trouble and enemies mrs cresswell stopped for the colored woman had gone quietly out of the room and in a moment the maid entered and stood ready mrs cresswell walked slowly to the door and stepped out then she turned

 what does miss wynn do for a living 

the girl tittered

 she used to teach school but she dont do nothing now shes just married her husband is mr stillings register of the treasury

mrs cresswell saw light as she turned to go down the steps there was but one resource â she must keep the matter out of the newspapers and see stillings whom she now remembered well

 i beg pardon does the miss wynn live here who got the prize in the art exhibition 

mrs cresswell turned in amazement it was evidently a reporter and the maid was admitting him the news would reach the papers and be blazoned tomorrow slowly she sought her motor and fell wearily back on its cushions

where to madame asked the chauffeur

i dont care returned madame so the chauffeur took her home

she walked slowly up the stairs all her carefully laid plans seemed about to be thwarted and her castles were leaning toward ruin

yet all was not lost if her husband continued to believe in her if as she feared he should suspect her on account of this negro woman and quarrel with her â but he must not this very night before the morning papers came out she must explain he must see he must appreciate her efforts

she rushed into her dressingroom and called her maid contrary to her puritan notions she frankly sought to beautify herself she remembered that it was the anniversary of her coming to this house she got out her weddingdress and although it hung loosely the maid draped the silver fleece beautifully about her

she heard her husband enter and come upstairs quickly finishing her toilet she hurried down to arrange the flowers for they were alone that night the telephone rang she knew it would ring upstairs in his room but she usually answered it for he disliked to she raised the receiver and started to speak when she realized that she had broken into the midst of a conversation

 â committee wont meet tonight harry

 so all right anything on 

yes â big spree at nells will you go

sure thing you know me what time

 meet us at the willard by nine slong

 goodbye

she slowly half guiltily replaced the receiver she had not meant to listen but now to her desperate longing to keep him home was added a new motive where was  nells   what was  nells   what was â and there was fear in her heart at dinner she tried all her powers on him she had his favorite dishes she mixed his salad and selected his wine she talked interestingly and listened sympathetically to him he looked at her with more attention her cheeks were more brilliant for she had touched them with rouge her eyes flashed but he glanced furtively at her short hair she saw the act but still she strove until he was content and laughing then coming round back of his chair she placed her arms about his neck

 harry will you do me a favor 

 why yes â if â 

 it is something i want very very much

 well all right if â 

 harry i feel a little â hysterical tonight and â you will not refuse me will you harry 

standing there she saw the tableau in her own mind and it looked strange she was afraid of herself she knew that she would do something foolish if she did not win this battle she felt that overpowering fanaticism back within her raging restlessly if she was not careful â  but what is it you want  asked her husband

 i dont want you to go out tonight

he laughed awkwardly

 nonsense girl the subcommittee on the cotton schedule meets tonight â very important otherwise â 

she shuddered at the smooth lie and clasped him closer putting her cheek to his

harry she pleaded just this once â for me

he disengaged himself half impatiently and rose glancing at the clock it was nearly nine a feeling of desperation came over her

 harry she asked again as he slipped on his coat

 dont be foolish he growled

 just this once â harry â i â  but the door banged to and he was gone

she stood looking at the closed door a moment something in her head was ready to snap she went to the rack and taking his long heavy overcoat slipped it on it nearly touched the floor she seized a soft broadbrimmed hat and umbrella and walked out just what she meant to do she did not know but somehow she must save her husband and herself from evil she hurried to the willard hotel and watched walking up and down the opposite sidewalk a woman brushed by her and looked her in the face

 hell i thought you was a man she said  is this a new gag 

mrs cresswell looked down at herself involuntarily and smiled wanly she did look like a man with her hat and coat and short hair the woman peered at her doubtingly she was as mrs cresswell noticed a young woman once pretty perhaps and a little overdressed

are you walking she asked

 what do you mean   asked mrs cresswell and then in a moment it flashed upon her she took the womans arm and walked with her suddenly she stopped

 wheres â nells 

the woman frowned  oh thats a swell place she said  senators and millionaires too high for us to fly

mrs cresswell winced  but where is it  she asked

 we ll walk by it if you want to

and mary cresswell walked in another world up from the ground of the drowsy city rose pale gray forms pale flushed and brilliant in silken rags up and down they passed to and fro looking and gliding like sheeted ghosts now dodging policemen now accosting them familiarly

 hello elise growled one big bluecoat

 hello jack

 what s this  and he peered at mrs cresswell who shrank back

friend of mine all right

a horror crept over mary cresswell where had she lived that she had seen so little before what was washington and what was this fine tall quiet residence was this â  nells  

yes this is it â goodbyeâi must â wait â what is your name

 i have nt any name answered the woman suspiciously

 well â pardon me here  and she thrust a bill into the womans hand

the girl stared  well you re a queer one thanks guess i ll turn in

mary cresswell turned to see her husband and his companions ascending the steps of the quiet mansion she stood uncertainly and looked at the opening and closing door then a policeman came by and looked at her

 come move on he brusquely ordered her vacillation promptly vanished and she resolutely mounted the steps she put out her hand to ring but the door flew silently open and a manservant stood looking at her

 i have some friends here she said speaking coarsely

 you will have to be introduced said the man she hesitated and started to turn away thrusting her hand in her pocket it closed upon her husbands cardcase she presented a card it worked a rapid transformation in the servants manner which did not escape her

 come in he invited her

she did not stop at the outstretched arm of the cloakman but glided quickly up the stairs toward a vision of handsome women and strains of music harry cresswell was sitting opposite and bending over an impudent blueandblonde beauty mary slipped straight across to him and leaned across the table the hat fell off but she let it go

 harry  she tried to say as he looked up

then the table swayed gently to and fro the room bowed and whirled about the voices grew fainter and fainter â all the world receded suddenly far away she extended her hands languidly then feeling so utterly tired let her eyelids drop and fell asleep

she awoke with a start in her own bed she was physically exhausted but her mind was clear she must go down and meet him at breakfast and talk frankly with him she would let bygones be bygones she would explain that she had followed him to save him not to betray him she would point out the great career before him if only he would be a man she would show him that they had not failed for herself she asked nothing only his word his confidence his promise to try

after his first start of surprise at seeing her at the table cresswell uttered nothing immediately save the commonplaces of greeting he mentioned one or two bits of news from the paper upon which he commented while dawdling over her egg when the servant went out and closed the door she paused a moment considering whether to open by appeal or explanation his smooth tones startled her of course after your art exhibit and the scene of last night mary it will be impossible for us to live longer together

she stared at him utterly aghastvoiceless and numb

i have seen the crisis approaching for some time and the negro business settles it he continued i have now decided to send you to my home in alabama to my father or your brother i am sure you will be happier thee

he rose bowing courteously he waited coldly and calmly for her to go

all at once she hated him and hated his aristocratic repression this cold calm that hid hell and its fires she looked at him wideeyed and said in a voice hoarse with horror and loathing you brute you nasty brute

zora was looking on her world with the keener vision of one who blind from very seeing closes the eyes a space and looks again with wider clearer vision out of a nebulous cloudland she seemed to step a land where all things floated in strange confusion but where one thing stood steadfast and that was love when love was shakenall things moved but now at last for the first time she seemed to know the real and mighty world that stood behind that old and shaken dream

so she looked on the world about her with new eyes these men and women of her childhood had hitherto walked by her like shadows today they lived for her in flesh and blood she saw hundreds and thousands of black men and women  crushed halfspirited and blind she saw how high and clear a light sarah smith for thirty years and more had carried before them she saw too how that light had not simply shone in darkness but had lighted answering beacons here and there in these dull souls

there were thoughts and vague stirrings of unrest in this mass of black folks they talked long about their firesides and here zora began to sit and listen often speaking a word herself all through the countryside she flitted till gradually the black folk came to know her and in silent deference to some subtle difference they gave her the title of white folk calling her  miss  zora

today more than ever before zora sensed the vast unorganized power in this mass and her mind was leaping here and there scheming and testing when voices arrested her

it was a desolate bit of the cresswell manor a tiny cabin newboarded and bare in front of it a blazing bonfire a white man was tossing into the flames different household articles â a feather bed a bedstead two rickety chairs a young boyish fellow goldenfaced and curly stood with clenched fists while a woman with tearstained eyes clung to him the white man raised a cradle to dash it into the flames the woman cried and the yellow man raised his arm threateningly but zoras hand was on his shoulder

whats the matter rob she asked

 they re selling us out he muttered savagely  millies been sick since the last baby died and i had to neglect my crop to tend her and the other little ones â i did nt make much theyve took my mule now they re burning my things to make me sign a contract and be a slave but by â 

 there rob let millie come with me â we ll see miss smith we must get land to rent and arrange somehow

the mother sobbed  the cradle â was babys 

with an oath the white man dashed the cradle into the fire and the red flame spurted aloft

the crimson fire flashed in zoras eyes as she passed the overseer

well nigger what are you going to do about it he growled insolently

zoras eyelids drooped her upper lip quivered

 nothing she answered softly  but i hope your soul will burn in hell forever and forever

they proceeded down the plantation road but zora could not speak she pushed them slowly on and turned aside to let the anger the impotent futile anger rage itself out alone in the great broad spaces she knew she could fight it down and come back again cool and in calm and deadly earnest to lead these children to the light

the sorrow in her heart was new and strange not sorrow for herself for of that she had tasted the uttermost but the vast vicarious suffering for the evil of the world the tumult and war within her fled and a sense of helplessness sent the hot tears streaming down her cheeks she longed for rest but the last plantation was yet to be passed far off she heard the yodle of the gangs of peons she hesitated looking for some way of escape if she passed them she would see something â she always saw something â that would send the red blood whirling madly

 here you â loafing again damn you  she saw the black whip writhe and curl across the shoulders of the ploughboy the boy crouched and snarled and again the whip hissed and cracked

zora stood rigid and gray

my god  her silent soul was shrieking within  why doesnt the coward â 

and then the coward  did the whip was whirring in the air again but it never fell a jagged stone in the boys hand struck true and the overseer plunged with a grunt into the black furrow in blank dismay zora came back to her senses

 poor child  she gasped as she saw the boy flying in wild terror over the fields with hue and cry behind him

 poor child â running to the penitentiary â to shame and hunger and damnation 

she remembered the rector in mrs vanderpools library and his question that revealed unfathomable depths of ignorance  really now how do you account for the distressing increase in crime among your people 

she swung into the great road trembling with the woe of the world in her eyes cruelty poverty and crime she hud looked in the face that morning and the hurt of it held her heart pinched and quivering a moment the mists in her eyes shut out the shadows of the swamp and the roaring in her ears made a silence of the world

before she found herself again she dimly saw a couple sauntering along the road but she hardly noticed their white faces until the little voice of the girl raised timidly greeted her

 howdy zora

zora looked the girl was emma and beside her smiling stood a halfgrown white man it was emma berties child and yet it was not for in the child of other days zora saw for the first time the dawning woman

and she saw too the white man suddenly the horror of the swamp was upon her she swept between the couple like a gust gripping the childs arm till she paled and almost whimpered

i â i was just going on an errand for miss smith  she cried

looking down into her soul zora discerned its innocence and the fright shining in the childs eyes her own eyes softened her grip became a caress but her heart was hard

the young man laughed awkwardly and strolled away zora looked back at him and the paramount mission of her life formed itself in her mind she would protect this girl she would protect all black girls she would make it possible for these poor beasts of burden to be decent in their toil out of protection of womanhood as the central thought she must build ramparts against cruelty poverty and crime all this in turn â but now and first the innocent girlhood of this daughter of shame must be rescued from the devil it was her duty her heritage she must offer this unsullied soul up unto god in mighty atonement â but how here now was no protection already lustful eyes were in wait and the child was too ignorant to protect herself she must be sent to boardingschool somewhere far away but the money god it was money money always money then she stopped suddenly thrilled with the recollection of mrs vanderpools check

she dismissed the girl with a kiss and stood still a moment considering money to send emma off to school money to buy a school farm money to  buy  tenants to live on it money to furnish them rations money â she went straight to miss smith

miss smith how much money have you miss smiths hand trembled a bit ah that splendid strength of young womanhood â if only she herself had it but perhaps zora was the chosen one she reached up and took down a wellworn book

 zora she said slowly  ive been going to tell you ever since you came but i had nt the courage zora miss smith hesitated and gripped the book with thin white fingers  im afraid â i almost know that this school is doomed

there lay a silence in the room while the two women stared into each others souls with startled eyes swallowing hard miss smith spoke

 when i thought the endowment sure i mortgaged the school in order to buy tollivers land the endowment failed as you know because â perhaps i was too stubborn

but zoras eyes snapped no and miss smith continued  i borrowed ten thousand dollars then i tried to get the land but tolliver kept putting me off and finally i learned that colonel cresswell had bought it it seems that tolliver got caught tight in the cotton corner and that cresswell through john taylor offered him twice what he had agreed to sell to me for and he took it i dont suppose taylor knew what he was doing i hope he didnt

 well there i was with ten thousand dollars idle on my hands paying ten per cent on it and getting less than three per cent i tried to get the bank to take the money back but they refused then i was tempted â and fell she paused and zora took both her hands in her own

you see continued miss smith just as soon as the announcement of the prospective endowment was sent broadcast by the press the donations from the north fell off letter after letter came from old friends of the school full of congratulations but no money i ought to have cut down the teaching force to the barest minimum and gone north begging â but i couldnt i guess my courage was gone i knew how id have to explain and plead and i just could not so i used the ten thousand dollars to pay its own interest and help run the school

already its half gone and when the rest goes then will come the end

without the great red sun paused a moment over the edge of the swamp and the long low cry of night birds broke sadly on the twilight silence zora sat stroking the lined hands

not the end she spoke confidently it cannot end like this i ve got a little money that mrs vanderpool gave me and somehow we must get more perhaps i might go north and â beg she shivered then she sat up resolutely and turned to the book

lets go over matters carefully she proposed

together they counted and calculated

the balance is four thousand seven hundred and ninetyeight dollars said miss smith

yes and then there s mrs vanderpools check

how much is that 

zora paused she did not know in her world there was little calculation of money credit and not cash is the currency of the black belt she had been pleased to receive the check but she had not examined it

i really dont know she presently confessed i think it was one thousand dollars but i was so hurried in leaving that i did nt look carefully and the wild thought surged in her suppose it was more

she ran into the other room and plunged into her trunk beneath the clothes beneath the beauty of the silver fleece till her fingers clutched and tore the envelope a little choking cry burst from her throat her knees trembled so that she was obliged to sit down

in her fingers fluttered a check for â ten thousand dollars

it was not until the next day that the two women were sufficiently composed to talk matters over sanely

 what is your plan   asked zora

 to put the money in a northern savings bank at three per cent interest to supply the rest of the interest and the deficit in the running expenses from our balance and to send you north to beg

zora shook her head  it wont do she objected  id make a poor beggar i dont know human nature well enough and i cant talk to rich white folks the way they expect us to talk

 it would nt be hypocrisy zora you would be serving in a great cause if you dont go i â 

wait you shant go if any one goes it must be me but lets think it out we pay off the mortgage we get enough to run the school as it has been run then what there will still be slavery and oppression all around us the children will be kept in the cotton fields the men will be cheated and the women â  zora paused and her eyes grew hard

she began again rapidly  we must have land â our own farm with our own tenants â to be the beginning of a free community

miss smith threw up her hands impatiently

but sakes alive where zora where can we get land with cresswell owning every inch and bound to destroy us

zora sat hugging her knees and staring out the window toward the sombre ramparts of the swamp in her eyes lay slumbering the madness of long ago in her brain danced all the dreams and visions of childhood

 im thinking she murmured  of buying the swamp

its a shame asserted john taylor with something like real feeling he was spending sunday with his fatherinlaw and both over their afterdinner cigars were gazing thoughtfully at the swamp

whats a shame asked colonel cresswell

 to see all that timber and prime cottonland going to waste dont you remember those fine bales of cotton that came out of there several seasons ago 

the colonel smoked placidly  you cant get it cleared he said

but couldnt you hire some good workers

 niggers wont work now if we had italians we might do it

 yes and in a few years theyd own the country

 that s right so there we are theres only one way to get that swamp cleared

 how

 sell it to some fool darkey

 sell it its too valuable to sell

 that s just it you dont understand the only way to get decent work out of some niggers is to let them believe they re buying land in nine cases out of ten he works hard a while and then throws up the job we get back our land and he makes good wages for his work

 but in the tenth case â suppose he should stick to it

oh â easily  we could get rid of him when we want to white people rule here

john taylor frowned and looked a little puzzled he was no moralist but he had his code and he did not understand colonel cresswell as a matter of fact colonel cresswell was an honest man in most matters of commerce between men he was punctilious to a degree almost annoying to taylor but there was one part of the world which his code of honor did not cover and he saw no incongruity in the omission the uninitiated cannot easily picture to himself the mental attitude of a former slaveholder toward property in the hands of a negro such property belonged of right to the master if the master needed it and since ridiculous laws safeguarded the property it was perfectly permissible to circumvent such laws no negro starved on the cresswell place neither did any accumulate property colonel cresswell saw to both matters

as the colonel and john taylor were thus conferring zora appeared coming up the walk

 whos that  asked the colonel shading his eyes

 it s zora â the girl who went north with mrs vanderpool taylor enlightened him

 back is she too trifling to stick to a job and full of northern nonsense growled the colonel  even got a northern walk â i thought for a moment she was a lady

neither of the gentlemen ever dreamed how long how hard how heartwringing was that walk from the gate up the winding way beneath their careless gaze it was not the coming of the thoughtless careless girl of five years ago who had marched a dozen times unthinking before the faces of white men it was the approach of a woman who knew how the world treated women whom it respected who knew that no such treatment would be thought of in her case neither the bow the lifted hat nor even the conventional title of decency yet she must go on naturally and easily boldly but circumspectly and play a daring game with two powerful men

 can i speak with you a moment colonel  she asked

the colonel did not stir or remove his cigar he even injected a little gruffness into his tone

well what is it

of course she was not asked to sit but she stood with her hands clasped loosely before her and her eyes half veiled

 colonel ive got a thousand dollars she did not mention the other nine

the colonel sat up

 where did you get it  he asked

 mrs vanderpool gave it to me to use in helping the colored people

 what are you going to do with it  

 well that s just what i came to see you about you see i might give it to the school but i ve been thinking that id like to buy some land for some of the tenants

 i ve got no land to sell said the colonel

 i was thinking you might sell a bit of the swamp

cresswell and taylor glanced at each other and the colonel relit his cigar

 how much of it  he asked finally

 i dont know i thought perhaps two hundred acres

 two hundred acres  do you expect to buy that land for five dollars an acre

 oh no sir i thought it might cost as much as twentyfive dollars

 but you ve only got a thousand dollars

 yes sir i thought i might pay that down and then pay the rest from the crops

 whos going to work on the place 

zora named a number of the steadiest tenants to whom she had spoken

 they owe me a lot of money said the colonel

 wed try to pay that too

colonel cresswell considered there was absolutely no risk the cost of the land the back debts of the tenants â no possible crops could pay for them then there was the chance of getting the swamp cleared for almost nothing

 hows the school getting on   he asked suddenly

very poorly answered zora sadly you know its mortgaged and miss smith has had to use the mortgage money for yearly expenses

the colonel smiled grimly

 it will cost you fifty dollars an acre he said finally zora looked disappointed and figured out the matter slowly

 that would be one thousand down and nine thousand to pay â 

 with interest said cresswell

zora shook her head doubtfully

what would the interest be she asked

 ten per cent

she stood silent a moment and colonel cresswell spoke up  it s the best land about here and about the only land you can buy â i would nt sell it to anybody else

she still hesitated

 the trouble is you see colonel cresswell the price is high and the interest heavy and after all i may not be able to get as many tenants as id need i think though id try it if â if i could be sure youd treat me fairly and that id get the land if i paid for it colonel cresswell reddened a little and john taylor looked away

 well if you dont want to undertake it all right zora looked thoughtfully across the field â  mr maxwell has a bit of land she began meditatively

worked out and not worth five dollars an acre snapped the colonel but he did not propose to hand maxwell a thousand dollars  now see here i ll treat you as well as anybody and you know it

 i believe so sir acknowledged zora in a tone that brought a sudden keen glance from taylor but her face was a mask  i reckon i ll make the bargain

 all right bring the money and we ll fix the thing up

 the money is here said zora taking an envelope out of her bosom

 well leave it here and i ll see to it

but you see sir miss smith is so methodical she expects some papers or receipts

 well its too late tonight

 possibly you could sign a sort of receipt and later â  cresswell laughed  well write one he indulgently assented and zora wrote

when zora left colonel cresswells about noon that sunday she knew her work had just begun and she walked swiftly along the country roads calling here and there would uncle isaac help her build a log home

would the boys help her some time to clear some swamp land would rob become a tenant when she asked for this was the idle time of the year crops were laid by and planting had not yet begun

this too was the time of big church meetings she knew that in her part of the country on that day the black population man woman and child were gathered in great groups all day they had been gathering streaming in snakelike lines along the country roads in wellbrushed brilliant attire half fantastic half crude down where the toomsvillemontgomery highway dipped to the stream that fed the cresswell swamp squatted a square barn that slept through day and weeks in dull indifference but on the first sunday it woke to sudden mighty life the voices of men and children mingled with the snorting of animals and the cracking of whips then came the long drone and singsong of the preacher with its sharp wilder climaxes and the answering  amens  and screams of the worshippers this was the shrine of the baptists â shrine and oracle centre and source of inspiration â and hither zora hurried

the preacher was jones a big man fat black and greasy with little eyes unctuous voice and three manners his white folks manner soft humble wheedling his black folks manner voluble important condescending and above all his pulpit manner loud wild and strong he was about to don this latter cloak when zora approached with a request briefly to address the congregation remembering some former nubs his manner was lordly

 i does nt see he returned reflectively wiping his brows m as how i can rightly spare you any time the brethren is agettin mighty onpatient to hear me he pulled down his cuffs regarding her doubtfully

 i might speak after you re through she suggested but he objected that there was the regular collection and two or three other collections a baptism a meeting of the trustees there was no time in short but â he eyed her again

 does you want â a collection   he questioned suspiciously for he could imagine few other reasons for talking then too he did not want to be too inflexible for all of his people knew zora and liked her

 oh no i want no collection at all i only want a little voluntary work on their part he looked relieved frowned through the door at the audience and looked at his bright gold watch the whole crowd was not there yet â perhaps â you kin say just a word before the sermont he finally yielded but not long â not long theyse just adying to hear me

so zora spoke simply but clearly of neglect and suffering of the sins of others that bowed young shoulders of the great hope of the childrens future then she told something of what she had seen and read of the worlds newer ways of helping men and women she talked of cooperation and refuges and other efforts she praised their way of adopting children into their own homes and then finally she told them of the land she was buying for new tenants and the helping hands she needed the preacher fidgeted and coughed but dared not actually interrupt for the people were listening breathless to a kind of straightforward talk which they seldom heard and for which they were hungering

and zora forgot time and occasion the moments flew the crowd increased until the wonderful spell of those dark and upturned faces pulsed in her blood she felt the wild yearning to help them beating in her ears and blinding her eyes

 oh my people  she almost sobbed  my own people i am not asking you to help others i am pleading with you to help yourselves rescue your own flesh and blood â free yourselves â free yourselves and from the swaying sobbing hundreds burst a great  amen  the ministers dusky face grew more and more sombre and the angry sweat started on his brow he felt himself hoaxed and cheated and he meant to have his revenge two hundred men and women rose and pledged themselves to help zora and when she turned with overflowing heart to thank the preacher he had left the platform and she found him in the yard whispering darkly with two deacons she realized her mistake and promised to retrieve it during the week but the week was full of planning and journeying and talking

saturday dawned cool and clear she had dinner prepared for cooking in the yard sweet potatoes hoecake and buttermilk and a hog to be barbecued everything was ready by eight oclock in the morning emma and two other girl helpers were on the tiptoe of expectancy nine oclock came and no one with it ten oclock came and eleven high noon found zora peering down the highway under her shading hand but no soul in sight she tried to think it out what could have happened her people were slow tardy but they would not thus forget her and disappoint her without some great cause she sent the girls home at dusk and then seated herself miserably under the great oak then at last one halfgrown boy hurried by

 i wanted to come miss zora but i was afeared preacher jones has been talking everywhere against you

he says your mother was a voodoo woman and that you dont believe in god and the deacons voted that the members must nt help you

and do the people believe that she asked in consternation

 they just dont know what to say they dont zactly believe it but they has to low that you didnt say much bout religion when you talked you aint been near big meetin â and â and â you aint saved he hurried on

zora leaned her head back wearily watching the laced black branches where the starlight flickered through â as coldly still and immovable as she had watched them from those gnarled roots all her life â and she murmured bitterly the worldold question of despair  whats the use  it seemed to her that every breeze and branch was instinct with sympathy and murmuring  whats the use  she wondered vaguely why and as she wondered she knew

for yonder where the black earth of the swamp heaved in a formless mound she felt the black arms of elspeth rising from the sod â gigantic mighty they stole toward her with stealthy hands and clawlike talons they clutched at her skirts she froze and could not move down down she slipped toward the black slime of the swamp and the air about was horror â down down till the chilly waters stung her knees and then with one grip she seized the oak while the great hand of elspeth twisted and tore her soul faint afar nearer and nearer and ever mightier rose a song of mystic melody she heard its human voice and sought to cry aloud she strove again and again with that gripping twisting pain â that awful hand â until the shriek came and she awoke

she lay panting and sweating across the bent and broken roots of the oak the hand of elspeth was gone but the song was still there she rose trembling and listened it was the singing of the big meeting ip the church far away she had forgotten this religious revival in her days of hurried preparation and the preacher had used her absence and apparent indifference against her and her work the hand of elspeth was reaching from the grave to pull her back but she was no longer dreaming now drawing her shawl about her she hurried down the highway

the meeting had overflowed the church and spread to the edge of the swamp the tops of young trees had been bent down and interlaced to form a covering and benches twined to their trunks thus a low and wide cathedral all green and silver in the starlight lay packed with a living mass of black folk flaming pine torches burned above the devotees the rhythm of their stamping the shout of their voices and the wild music of their singing shook the night four hundred people fell upon their knees when the huge black preacher uncoated redeyed frenzied stretched his long arms to heaven zora saw the throng from afar and hesitated after all she knew little of this strange faith of theirs â had little belief in its mummery she herself had been brought up almost without religion save some few mystic remnants of a halfforgotten heathen cult the little she had seen of religious observance had not moved her greatly save once yonder in washington there she found god after a searching that had seared her soul but he had simply pointed the way and the way was human

humanity was near and real she loved it but if she talked again of mere men would these devotees listen

already the minister had spied her tall form and feared her power he set his powerful voice and the frenzy of his hearers to crush her

 who is dis what talks of doing the lords work for him what does de good book say take no thought bout de morrow why is you trying to make dis ole world better i spits on the world come out from it seek jesus heaven is my home is it yos yes groaned the multitude his arm shot out and he pointed straight at zora

 beware the ebil one  he shouted and the multitude moaned  beware of dem dat calls ebil good beware of dem dat worships debbils the debbils dat crawl de debbils what forgits god

 help him lord  cried the multitude

zora stepped into the circle of light a hush fell on the throng the preacher paused a moment then started boldly forward with upraised hands then a curious thing happened a sharp cry arose far off down toward the swamp and the sound of great footsteps coming coming as from the end of the world there swelled a rhythmical chanting wilder and more primitive than song on on it came until it swung into sight an old man led the band â tall massive with tufted gray hair and wrinkled leathery skin and his eyes were the eyes of death he reached the circle of light and zora started once before she had seen that old man the singing stopped but he came straight on till he reached zoras side and then he whirled and spoke

the words leaped and flew from his lips as he lashed the throng with bitter fury he said what zora wanted to say with two great differences first he spoke their religious language and spoke it with absolute confidence and authority and secondly he seemed to know each one there personally and intimately so that he spoke to no inchoate throng â he spoke to them individually and they listened awestruck and fearsome

 god is done sent me he declared in passionate tones to preach his acceptable time faith without works is dead who is you that dares to set and wait for the lord to do your work  then in sudden fury  ye generation of vipers â who kin save you he bent forward and pointed his long finger  yes he cried pray sam collins you black devil pray for the corn you stole thursday the black figure moved  moan sister maxwell for the backbiting you did today yell jack tolliver you sneaking scamp twil the lord tell uncle bill who ruined his daughter weep may haynes for that baby â 

but the womans shriek drowned his words and he whirled full on the preacher stamping his feet and waving his hands his anger choked him the fat preacher cowered gray and trembling the gaunt fanatic towered over him

you â you â ornery hound of hell god never knowed you and the devil owns your soul  there leapt from his lips a denunciation so livid specific and impassioned that the preacher squatted and bowed then finally fell upon his face and moaned

the gaunt speaker turned again to the people he talked of little children he pictured their sin and neglect  god is done sent me to offer you all salvation he cried while the people wept and wailed  not in praying but in works follow me the hour was half way between midnight and dawn but nevertheless the people leapt frenziedly to their feet

 follow me  he shouted

and singing and chanting the throng poured out upon the black highway waving their torches zora knew his intention with a halfdozen of younger onlookers she unhitched teams and rode across the land calling at the cabins before sunrise tools were in the swamp axes and saws and hammers the noise of prayer and singing filled the sabbath dawn the news of the great revival spread and men and women came pouring in then of a sudden the uproar stopped and the ringing of axes and grating of saws and tugging of mules was heard the forest trembled as by some mighty magic swaying and falling with crash on crash huge bonfires blazed and crackled until at last a wide black scar appeared in the thick south side of the swamp which widened and widened to full twenty acres

the sun rose higher and higher till it blazed at high noon the workers dropped their tools the aroma of coffee and roasting meat rose in the dim cool shade with ravenous appetites the dark halffamished throng fell upon the food and then in utter weariness stretched themselves and slept lying along the earth like huge bronze earthspirits sitting against trees curled in dense bushes

and zora sat above them on a high richscented pile of logs her senses slept save her sleepless eyes amid a silence she saw in the little grove that still stood the cabin of elspeth tremble sigh and disappear and with it flew some spirit of evil

then she looked down to the new edge of the swamp by the old lagoon and saw bles alwyn standing there it seemed very natural and closing her eyes she fell asleep

bles alwyn stared at mrs harry cresswell in surprise he had not seen her since that moment at the ball and he was startled at the change her abundant hair was gone her face was pale and drawn and there were little wrinkles below her sunken eyes in those eyes lurked the tired look of the bewildered and the disappointed it was in the lofty waitingroom of the washington station where alwyn had come to meet a friend mrs cresswell turned and recognized him with genuine pleasure he seemed somehow a part of the few things in the world â little and unimportant perhaps â that counted and stood firm and she shook his hand cordially not minding the staring of the people about he took her bag and carried it towards the gate which made the observers breathe easier seeing him in servile duty someway she knew not just how she found herself telling him of the crisis in her life before she realized not everything of course but a great deal it was much as though she were talking to some one from another world â an outsider but one she had known long one who understood both from what she recounted and what she could not tell he gathered the substance of the story and it bewildered him he had not thought that white people had such troubles yet he reflected why not they too were human

i suppose you hear from the school he ventured after a pause

 why yes â not directly â but zora used to speak of it

bles looked up quickly

 zora 

yes didnt you see her while she was here she has gone back now

then the gate opened the crowd surged through sweeping them apart and next moment he was alone

alwyn turned slowly away he forgot the friend he was to meet he forgot everything but the field of the silver fleece it rose shadowy there in the pale concourse swaying in ghostly breezes the purple of its flowers mingled with the silver radiance of tendrils that trembled across the hurrying throng like threads of mists along low hills in its midst rose a dark slim and quivering form she had been here â here in washington why had he not known what was she doing  she has gone back now  â back to the sun and the swamp back to the burden

why should not he go back too he walked on thinking he had failed his apparent success had been too sudden too overwhelming and when he had faced the crisis his hand had trembled he had chosen the right â but the right was ineffective impotent almost ludicrous it left him shorn powerless and in moral revolt the world had suddenly left him as the vision of carrie wynn had left him alone a mere clerk an insignificant cog in the great grinding wheel of humdrum drudgery his chance to do and thereby to be had not come

he thought of zora again why not go back to the south where she had gone he shuddered as one who sees before him a cold black pool whither his path leads to face the proscription the insult the lawless hate of the south again â never and yet he went home and sat down and wrote a long letter to miss smith

the reply that came after some delay was almost curt it answered few of his questions argued with none of his doubts and made no mention of zora yes there was need of a manager for the new farm and settlement she was not sure whether alwyn could do the work or not the salary was meagre and the work hard if he wished it he must decide immediately

two weeks later found alwyn on the train facing southward in the jim crow car how he had decided to go back south he did not know in fact he had not decided he had sat helpless and inactive in the grip of great and shadowed hands and the thing was as yet incomprehensible and so it was that the vision zora saw in the swamp had been real enough and alwyn felt strangely disappointed that she had given no sign of greeting on recognition

in other ways too zora when he met her was to him a new creature she came to him frankly and greeted him her gladness shining in her eyes yet looking nothing more than gladness and saying nothing more just what he had expected was hard to say but he had left her on her knees in the dirt with outstretched hands and somehow he had expected to return to some corresponding mental attitude the physical change of these three years was marvellous the girl was the woman wellrounded and poised tall straight and quick and with this went mental change a selfmastery a veiling of the self even in intimate talk a subtle air as of one looking from great and unreachable heights down on the dawn of the world perhaps no one who had not known the child and the girl as he had would have noted all this but he saw and realized the transformation with a pang â something had gone the innocence and wonder of the child and in their place had grown up something to him incomprehensible and occult

miss smith was not to be easily questioned on the subject she took no hints and gave no information and when once he hazarded some pointed questions she turned on him abruptly observing acidly  if i were you id think less of zora and more of her work

gradually in his spiritual perplexity alwyn turned to mary cresswell she was staying with the colonel at cresswell oaks her coming south was supposed to be solely for reasons of health and her appearance made this excuse plausible she was lonely and restless and naturally drawn toward the school her intercourse with miss smith was only formal but her interest in zoras work grew down in the swamp at the edge of the cleared space had risen a log cabin long low spacious overhung with oak and pine it was zoras centre for her settlementwork there she lived and with her a halfdozen orphan girls and children too young for the boarding department of the school mrs cresswell easily fell into the habit of walking by here each day coming down the avenue of oaks across the road and into the swamp she saw little of zora personally but she saw her girls and learned much of her plans

the rooms of the cottage were clean and light supplied with books and pictures simple toys and a phonograph the yard was one wide green and golden playground and all day the music of childrens glad crooning and the singing of girls went echoing and trembling through the trees as they played and sewed and washed and worked

from the cresswells and the maxwells and others came loads of clothes for washing and mending the tolliver girls had simple dresses made embroidery was ordered from town and soon there would be the gardens and cotton fields mrs cresswell would saunter down of mornings sometimes she would talk to the big girls and play with the children sometimes she would sit hidden in the forest listening and glimpsing and thinking thinking till her head whirled and the world danced red before her eyes today she rose wearily for it was near noon and started home she saw alwyn swing along the road to the school diningroom where he had charge of the students at the noonday meal

alwyn wanted mrs cresswells judgment and advice he was growing doubtful of his own estimate of women evidently something about his standards was wrong consequently he made opportunities to talk with mrs cresswell when she was about hoping she would bring up the subject of zora of her own accord but she did not she was too full of her own cares and troubles and she was only too glad of willing and sympathetic ears into which to pour her thoughts miss smith soon began to look on these conversations with some uneasiness black men and white women cannot talk together casually in the south and she did not know how far the north had put notions in alwyns head

today both met each other almost eagerly

mrs cresswell had just had a bit of news which only he would fully appreciate

 have you heard of the vanderpools  she asked

 no â except that he was appointed and confirmed at last

well they had only arrived in france when he died of apoplexy i do not know added mrs cresswcll  i may be wrong and â i hope i m not glad then there leapt to her mind a hypothetical question which had to do with her own curious situation it was characteristic of her to brood and then restlessly to seek relief in consulting the one person near who knew her story she started to open the subject again today

but alwyn his own mind full spoke first and rapidly he too had turned to her as he saw her come from zoras home he must know more about the girl he could no longer endure this silence zora beneath hr apparent frankness was impenetrable and he felt that she carefully avoided him although she did it so deftly that he felt rather than observed it miss smith still systematically snubbed him when he broached the subject of zora with others he did not speak the matter seemed too delicate and sacred and he always had an awful dread lest sometime somewhere a chance and fatal word would be dropped a breath of evil gossip which would shatter all he had hated to obtrude his troubles on mrs cresswell who seemed so torn in soul but today he must speak although time pressed

 mrs cresswell he began hurriedly  theres a matter â a personal matter of which i have wanted to speak â a long time â i â  the dinnerbell rang and he stopped vexed

 come up to the house this afternoon she said  colonel cresswell will be away â  then she paused abruptly a strange startling thought flashed through her brain alwyn noticed nothing he thanked her cordially and hurried toward the dininghall meeting colonel cresswell on horseback just as he turned into the school gate

mary cresswell walked slowly on flushing and paling by turns could it be that this negro had dared to misunderstand her â had presumed she reviewed her conduct perhaps she had been indiscreet in thus making a confidant of him in her trouble she had thought of him as a boy â an old student a sort of confidential servant but what had he thought she remembered miss smiths warning of years before â and he had been north since and acquired northern notions of freedom and equality she bit her lip cruelly

yet she mused she was herself to blame she had unwittingly made the intimacy and he was but a negro looking on every white woman as a goddess and ready to fawn at the slightest encouragement there had been no one else here to confide in she could not tell miss smith her troubles although she knew miss smith must suspect harry cresswell apparently had written nothing home of their quarrel all the neighbors behaved as if her excuse of illhealth were sufficient to account for her return south to escape the rigors of a northern winter alwyn and alwyn alone really knew well it was her blindness and she must right it quietly and quickly with hard ruthless plainness she blushed again at the shame of it then she began to excuse

after all which was worse â a cresswell or an alwyn it was no sin that alwyn had done it was simply ignorant presumption and she must correct him firmly but gently like a child what a crazy muddle the world was she thought of harry cresswell and the tale he told her in the swamp she thought of the flitting ghosts that awful night in washington she thought of miss wynn who had jilted alwyn and given her herself a very bad quarter of an hour what a world it was and after all how far was this black boy wrong just then colonel cresswell rode up behind and greeted her

she started almost guiltily and again a sense of the awkwardness of her position reddened her face and neck the colonel dismounted despite her protest and walked beside her they chatted along indifferently of the crops her brothers new baby the proposed mill

 mary his voice abruptly struck a new note  i dont like the way you talk with that alwyn nigger

she was silent

 of course he continued  you re northern born and you have been a teacher in this school and feel differently from us in some ways but mark what i say a nigger will presume on the slightest pretext and you must keep them in their place then too you are a cresswell now â 

she smiled bitterly he noticed it but went on  you are a cresswell even if you have caught harry up to some of his deviltryâ she startedâ  and got miffed about it it ll all come out right you re a cresswell and you must hold yourself too high to  mister  a nigger or let him dream of any sort of equality

he spoke pleasantly but with a certain sharp insistence that struck a note of fear in marys heart for a moment she thought of writing alwyn not to call but no a note would be unwise she and colonel cresswell lunched rather silently

 well i must get to town he finally announced

 the mill directors meet today if maxwell calls by about that lumber tell him i ll see him in town and away he went

he had scarcely reached the highway and ridden a quarter of a mile or so when he spied bles alwyn hurrying across the field toward the cresswell oaks he frowned and rode on then reining in his horse he stopped in the shadow of the trees and watched alwyn

it was here that zora saw him as she came up from her house she too stopped and soon saw whom he was watching she had been planning to see mr cresswell about the cut timber on her land by legal right it was hers but she knew he would claim half treating her like a mere tenant seeing him watching alwyn she paused in the shadow and waited fearing trouble she too had felt that the continued conversations of alwyn and mrs cresswell were indiscreet but she hoped that they had attracted no one elses attention now she feared the colonel was suspicious and her heart sank alwyn went straight toward the house and disappeared in the oak avenue still colonel cresswell waited but zora waited no longer alwyn must be warned she must reach cresswells mansion before cresswell did and without him seeing her this meant a long detour of the swamp to approach the oaks from the west she silently gathered up her skirts and walked quickly and carefully away

she was a strong woman lithe and vigorous living in the open air and used to walking once out of hearing she threw away her hat and bending forward ran through the swamp for a while she ran easily and swiftly then for a moment she grew dizzy and it seemed as though she was standing still and the swamp in solemn grandeur marching past â in solemn mocking grandeur she loosened her dress at the neck and flew on

she sped at last through the oaks up the terraces and slowing down to an unsteady walk staggered into the house no one would wonder at her being there she came up now and then and sorted the linen and piled the baskets for her girls she entered a side door and listened the colonels voice sounded impatiently in the front hall

mary mary

a pause then an answer  yes father 

he started up the front stairway and zora hurried up the narrow back stairs almost overturning a servant

 im after the clothes she explained she reached the back landing just in time to see colonel cresswells head rising up the front staircase with a quick bound she almost fell into the first room at the top of the stairs

bles alwyn had hurried through his dinner duties and hastened to the oaks the questions the doubts the uncertainty within him were clamoring for utterance how much had mrs cresswell ever known of zora what kind of a woman was zora now mrs cresswell had seen her and had talked to her and watched her what did she think thus he formulated his questions as he went half timid and fearful in putting them and yet determined to know

mrs cresswell waiting for him was almost panicstricken probably he would beat round the bush seeking further encouragement but at the slightest indication she must crush him ruthlessly and at the same time point the path of duty he ought to marry some good girl â not zora but some one somehow zora eemed too unusual and strange for him â too inhuman as mary cresswcll judged humanity she glanced out from her seat on the upper verandah over the front porch and saw alwyn coming where should she receive him on the porch and have mr maxwell ride up in the parlor and have the servants astounded and talking if she took him up to her own sittingroom the servants would think he was doing some work or fetching something for the school she greeted him briefly and asked him in

 goodafternoon bles  â using his first name to show him his place and then inwardly recoiling at its note of familiarity she preceded him upstairs to the sittingroom where leaving the door ajar she seated herself on the opposite side of the room and waited

he fidgeted then spoke rapidly

 mrs cresswell â this is a personal affair she reddened angrily  a love affair  â she paled with something like fear â  and i  â she started to speak but could not â i want to know what you think about zora

 about zora  she gasped weakly the sudden reaction the revulsion of her agitated feelings left her breathless

 about zora you know i loved her dearly as a boy â how dearly i have only just begun to realize i ve been wondering if i understood â if i wasnt â 

mrs cresswell got angrily to her feet

you have come here to speak to me of that â that â  she choked and bles thought his worst fears realized

mary mary colonel cresswells voice broke suddenly in upon them with a start of fear mrs cresswell rushed out into the hall and closed the door

 mary has that alwyn nigger been here this afternoon  mr cresswell was coming upstairs carrying his ridingwhip

 why no  she answered lying instinctively before she quite realized what her lie meant she hesitated  that is i have nt seen him i must have nodded over my book â looking toward the little verandah at the front of the upper hall where her easy chair stood with her book then with an awful flash of enlightenment she realized what her lie might mean and her heart paused

cresswell strode up

 i saw him come up â he must have entered hes nowhere downstairs he wavered and scowled  have you been in your sittingroom and then not waiting for a reply he strode to the door

 but the damned scoundrel would nt dare 

he deliberately placed his hand in his righthand hippocket and threw open the door

mary cresswell stood frozen the full horror of the thing burst upon her her own silly misapprehension the infatuation of alwyn for zora her thoughtless â no vindictive â betrayal of him to something worse than death she listened for the crack of doom she heard a bird singing far down in the swamp she heard the soft raising of a window and the closing of a door and then â great god in heaven must she live forever in this agony â and then she heard the door bang and mr cresswells gruff voice â  well where is he â he is nt in there 

mary cresswell felt that something was giving way within she swayed and would have crashed to the bottom of the staircase if just then she had not seen at the opposite end of the hall near the back stairs zora and alwyn emerge calmly from a room carrying a basket full of clothes colonel cresswell stared at them and zora instinctively put up her hand and fastened her dress at the throat the colonel scowled for it was all clear to him now

 look here he angrily opened upon them  if you niggers want to meet around keep out of this house hereafter i ll send the clothes down by god if you want to make love go to the swamp  he stamped down the stairs while an ashy paleness stole beneath the darkred bronze of zoras face

they walked silently down the road together â the old familiar road alwyn was staring moodily ahead

 we must get married â before christmas zora he presently avowed not looking at her he felt the basket pause and he glanced up her dark eyes were full upon him and he saw something in their depths that brought him to himself and made him realize his blunder

zora  he stammered  forgive me will you marry me 

she looked at him calmly with infinite compassion but her reply was uttered unhesitatingly distinct direct  no bles

the people of toomsville started in their beds and listened a new song was rising on the air a harsh low murmuring croon that shook the village ranged around its old square of dilapidated stores it was not a song of joy it was not a song of sorrow it was not a song at all perhaps but a confused whizzing and murmuring as of a thousand illtuned busy voices some of the listeners wondered but most of the town cried joyfully  it s the new cottonmill

john taylors head teemed with new schemes the mill trust of the north was at last a fact the small mills had not been able to buy cotton when it was low because cresswell was cornering it in the name of the farmers league now that it was high they could not afford to and many surrendered to the trust

 next thing wrote taylor to easterly  is to reduce cost of production too much goes in wages gradually transfer mills south

easterly argued that the labor was too unskilled in the south and that to send northern spinners down would spread labor troubles taylor replied briefly never fear we ll scare them with a vision of niggers in the mills 

colonel cresswell was not so easily won over to the new scheme in the first place he was angry because the school which he had come to regard as on its last legs somehow still continued to flourish the tenthousanddollar mortgage had but three more years and that would end all but he had hoped for a crash even earlier instead of this miss smith was cheerfully expanding the work hiring new teachers and especially she had brought to help her two young negroes whom he suspected colonel cresswell had prevented the tolliver land sale only to be inveigled himself into zoras scheme which now began to worry him he must evict zoras tenants as soon as the crops were planted and harvested there was nothing unjust about such a course he argued for negroes anyway were too lazy and shiftless to buy the land they would not they could not work without driving all this he imparted to john taylor to which that gentleman listened carefully

 hm i see he owned  and i know the way out

 how

 a cotton mill in toomsville

 whats that got to do with it 

 bring in whites

 but i dont want poor white trash id sooner have niggers

 now see here argued taylor  you cant have everything you want â days gone by for aristocracy of old kind you must have neighbors choose then white or black i say white

 but they ll rule us â outvote us â marry our daughters warmly objected the colonel

 some of them may â most of them wont a few of them with brains will help us rule the rest with money

we ll plant cotton mills beside the cotton fields use whites to keep niggers in their place and the fear of niggers to keep the poorer whites in theirs

the colonel looked thoughtful

 there s something in that he confessed after a while  but its a mighty big experiment and it may go awry

 not with brains and money to guide it and at any rate weve got to try it it s the next logical step and we must take it

 but in the meantime im not going to give up good old methods im going to set the sheriff behind these lazy niggers said the colonel  and im going to stop that school putting notions into their heads

in three short months the mill at toomsville was open and its wheels whizzing to the boundless pride of the citizens

 our enterprise sir  they said to the strangers on the strength of the five thousand dollars locally invested once it had vigor to sing the song of the mill knew no resting morning and evening day and night it crooned its rhythmic tune only during the daylight sundays did its murmur die to a sibilant hiss all the week its doors were filled with the coming and going of men and women and children many men more women and greater and greater throngs of children it seemed to devour children sitting with its myriad eyes gleaming and its black maw open drawing in the pale white mites sucking their blood and spewing them out paler and ever paler the face of the town began to change showing a ragged tuberculous looking side with dingy homes in short and homely rows

there came gradually a new consciousness to the town

hitherto town and country had been ruled by a few great landlords but at the very first election colton an unknown outsider had beaten the regular candidate for sheriff by such a majority that the big property owners dared not count him out they had however an earnest consultation with john taylor

its just as i said growled colonel cresswell if you dont watch out our whole plantation system will be ruined and we ll be governed by this white trash from the hills

 theres only one way sighed caldwell the merchant   weve got to vote the niggers

john taylor laughed nonsense he spurned the suggestion  you re oldfashioned let the millhands have the offices what good will it do 

 what good why they ll do as they please with us

 bosh dont we own the mill  cant we keep wages where we like by threatening to bring in nigger labor 

 no you cant permanently maxwell disputed  for they sometime will call your bluff

 let em call said taylor  and we ll put niggers in the mills

what ejaculated the landlords in chorus only maxwell was silent  and kill the plantation system    oh maybe some time of course but not for years not until you ve made your pile you dont really expect to keep the darkies down forever do you

 no i dont maxwell slowly admitted  this system cant last always â sometimes i think it cant last long its wrong through and through its built on ignorance theft and force and i wish to god we had courage enough to overthrow it and take the consequences i wish it was possible to be a southerner and a christian and an honest man to treat niggers and dagoes and white trash like men and be big enough to say  to hell with consequences   

colonel cresswell stared at his neighbor speechless with bewilderment and outraged traditions such unbelievable heresy from a northerner or a negro would have been natural but from a southerner whose father had owned five hundred slaves â it was incredible the other landlords scarcely listened they were dogged and impatient and they could suggest no remedy they could only blame the mill for their troubles

john taylor left the conference blithely  no he said to the committee from the new millworkers union  cant raise wages gentlemen and cant lessen hours mill is just started and not yet paying expenses you re getting better wages than you ever got if you dont want to work quit there are plenty of others white and black who want your jobs

the mention of black people as competitors for wages was like a red rag to a bull the laborers got together and at the next election they made a clean sweep judge sheriff two members of the legislature and the registrars of votes undoubtedly the following year they would capture harry cresswells seat in congress

the result was curious from two sides from landlord and white laborer came renewed oppression of black men the laborers found that their political power gave them little economic advantage as long as the threatening cloud of negro competition loomed ahead there was some talk of a strike but colton the new sheriff discouraged it

 i tell you boys where the trouble lies its the niggers they live on nothing and take any kind of treatment and they keep wages down if you strike they ll get your jobs sure we ll just have to grin and bear it a while but get back at the darkies whenever you can i ll stick em into the chaingang every chance i get

on the other hand inspired by fright the grip of the landlords on the black serfs closed with steadily increasing firmness they saw one class rising from beneath them to power and they tightened the chains on the other matters simmered on in this way and the only party wholly satisfied with conditions was john taylor and the few young southerners who saw through his eyes he was making money the landlords on the contrary were losing power and prestige and their farm labor despite strenuous efforts was drifting to town attracted by new and incidental work and higher wages the millhands were more and more overworked and underpaid and hated the negroes for it in accordance with their leaders directions

at the same time the oppressed blacks and scowling mill hands could not help recurring again and again to the same inarticulate thought which no one was brave enough to voice once however it came out flatly it was when zora crowding into the village courthouse to see if she could not help aunt rachels accused boy found herself beside a gaunt overworked white woman the woman was struggling with a crippled child and zora turning lifted him carefully for the weak mother who thanked her half timidly  that mills about killed him she said

at this juncture the manacled boy was led into court and the woman suddenly turned again to zora

 durned if i dont think these white slaves and black slaves had ought ter git together she declared

 i think so too zora agreed

colonel cresswell himself caught the conversation and it struck him with a certain dismay suppose such a conjunction should come to pass he edged over to john taylor and spoke to him but taylor who had just successfully stopped a suit for damages to the injured boy merely shrugged his shoulders

 whats this nigger charged with demanded the judge when the first black boy was brought up before him

 breaking his labor contract

 any witnesses  

 i have the contract here announced the sheriff  he refuses to work

 a year or one hundred dollars

colonel cresswell paid his fine and took him in charge  whats the charge here  said the judge pointing to aunt rachels boy

 attempt to kill a white man

 any witnesses  

 none except the victim

 and i said zora coming forward

both the sheriff and colonel cresswell stared at her of course she was simply a black girl but she was an educated woman who knew things about the cresswell plantations that it was unnecessary to air in court the newly elected judge had not yet taken his seat and cresswells word was still law in the court he whispered to the judge

 case postponed said the court

the sheriff scowled

 wait till jim gets on the bench he growled

the white bystanders however did not seem enthusiastic and one man â he was a northern spinner â spoke out plainly

 it s none o my business of course i ve been fired and i m damned glad of it but see here if you mutts think you re going to beat these big blokes at their own game of cheating niggers you re daffy you take this from me get together with the niggers and hold up this whole capitalist gang if you do nt get the niggers first they ll use em as a club to throw you down you hear me and he departed for the train

colton was suspicious the sentiment of joining with the negroes did not seem to arouse the bitter resentment he expected there even came whispers to his ears that he had sold out to the landlords and there was enough truth in the report to scare him thus to both parties came the uncomfortable spectre of the black men and both sides went to work to lay the ghost

particularly was colonel cresswell stirred to action he realized that in bles and zora he was dealing with a younger class of educated black folk who were learning to fight with new weapons they were he was sure as dissolute and weak as their parents but they were shrewder and more aspiring they must be crushed and crushed quickly to this end he had recourse to two sources of help â johnson and the whites in town

johnson was what colonel cresswell repeatedly called  a faithful nigger he was one of those constitutionally timid creatures into whom the servility of his fathers had sunk so deep that it had become secondnature to him a white man was an archangel while the cresswells his fathers masters stood for god he served them with doglike faith asking no reward and for what he gave in reverence to them he took back in contempt for his fellows âniggers  he applied the epithet with more contempt than the colonel himself could express to the negroes he was a  white folks nigger to be despised and feared

to him colonel cresswell gave a few pregnant directions then he rode to town and told taylor again of his fears of a labor movement which would include whites and blacks taylor could not see any great danger

 of course he conceded u they ll eventually get together their interests are identical ill admit its our game to delay this as long possible

 it must be delayed forever sir

 cant be w as the terse response m but even if they do ally themselves our way is easy separate the leaders the talented the pushers of both races from their masses and through them rule the rest by money

but colonel cresswell shook his head  it s precisely these leaders of the negroes that we must crush he insisted taylor looked puzzled

i thought it was the lazy shiftless and criminal negroes you feared 

hang it no we can deal with them we ve got whips chaingangs and â mobs if need be â no it s the negro who wants to climb up that weve got to beat to his knees

taylor could not follow this reasoning he believed in an aristocracy of talent alone and secretly despised colonel cresswells pretensions of birth if a man had ability and push taylor was willing and anxious to open the way for him even though he were black the caste way of thinking in the south both as applied to poor whites and to negroes he simply could not understand the weak and the ignorant of all races he despised and had no patience with them  but others â a mans a man isnt he he persisted but colonel cress well replied  no never if he s black and not always when hes white and he stalked away

zora sensed fully the situation she did not anticipate any immediate understanding with the laboring whites but she knew that eventually it would be inevitable meantime the negro must strengthen himself and bring to the alliance as much independent economic strength as possible for the development of her plans she needed bles alwyns constant cooperation he was business manager of the school and was doing well but she wanted to point out to him the larger field so long as she was uncertain of his attitude toward her it was difficult to act but now since the flash of the imminent tragedy at cresswell oaks had cleared the air with all its hurt a frank understanding had been made possible the very next day zora chose to show bles over her new home and grounds and to speak frankly to him they looked at the land examined the proposed farm sites and viewed the livingroom and dormitory in the house

 you have nt seen my den said zora

 no

 miss smith is in there now she often hides there come

he went into the large central house and into the livingroom then out on the porch beyond which lay the kitchen but to the left and at the end of the porch was a small building it was ceiled in dark yellow pine with figured denim on the walls a straight desk of rough hewn wood stood in the corner by the whitecurtained window and a couch and two large easychairs faced a tall narrow fireplace of uneven stone a thick green ragcarpet covered the floor a few pictures were on the walls â a madonna a scene of mad careering horses and some sad baby faces the room was a unity things fitted together as if they belonged together it was restful and beautiful from the cheerful pine blaze before which miss smith was sitting to the squarepaned window that let in the crimson rays of gathering night all round the room stopping only at the fireplace ran low shelves of the same yellow pine filled with books and magazines he scanned curiously platos republic gorkys  comrades a cyclopaedia of agriculture balzacs novels spencers  first principles tennysons poems

 this is my university zora explained smiling at his interested survey they went out again and wandered down near the old lagoon

now bles she began  since we understand each other can we not work together as good friends she spoke simply and frankly without apparent effort and talked on at length of her work and vision

somehow he could not understand his mental attitude toward zora had always been one of guidance guardianship and instruction he had been judging and weighing her from on high looking down upon her with thoughts of uplift and development always he had been holding her dark little hands to lead her out of the swamp of life and always when in senseless anger he had half forgotten and deserted her this vision of elder brotherhood held still remained now this attitude was being revolutionized she was proposing to him a plan of wide scope â a bold regeneration of the land it was a plan carefully studied out long thought of and read about he was asked to be coworker â nay in a sense to be a follower for he was ignorant of much

he hesitated then all at once a sense of his utter unworthiness overwhelmed him who was he to stand and judge this unselfish woman who was he to falter when she called a sense of his smallness and narrowness of his priggish blindness rose like a mockery in his soul one thing alone held him back he was not unwilling to be simply human a learner and a follower but would he as such ever command the love and respect of this new and inexplicable woman would not comradeship on the basis of the new friendship which she insisted on be the death of love and thoughts of love

thus he hesitated knowing that his duty lay clear in her direst need he had deserted her he had left her to go to destruction and expected that she would by a superhuman miracle she had risen and seated herself above him she was working here was work to be done he was asked to help he would help if it killed his old and newborn dream of love well and good it was his punishment

yet the sacrifice the readjustment was hard he grew to it gradually inwardly revolting feeling always a groat longing to take this woman and make her nestle in his arms as she used to catching himself again and again on the point of speaking to her and urging yet ever again holding himself back and borrowing in silent respect to the dignity of her life only now and then when their eyes met suddenly or unthinkingly a great kindling flash of flame seemed struggling behind showers of tears until in a moment she smiled or spoke and then the dropping veil left only the frank open glance unwavering soft kind but nothing more then alwyn would go wearily away vexed or disappointed or merely sad and both would turn to their work again

colonel cresswell started all the more grimly to overthrow the new work at the school because somewhere down beneath his heart a pity and a wonder were stirring pity at the perfectly useless struggle to raise the unraisable a wonder at certain signs of rising but it was impossible â and unthinkable even if possible so he squared his jaw and cheated zora deliberately in the matter of the cut timber he placed every obstacle in the way of getting tenants for the school land here johnson the  faithful nigger was of incalculable assistance he was among the first to hear the call for prospective tenants

the meeting was in the big room of zoras house and aunt rachel came early with her cheery voice and smile which faded so quickly to lines of sorrow and despair and then twinkled back again after her hobbled old sykes fully a halfhour later rob hurried in

 johnson he informed the others  has sneaked over to cresswells to tell of this meeting we ought to beat that nigger up but zora asked him about the new baby and he was soon deep in childlore higgins and sanders came together â dirty apologetic and furtive then came johnson

 how do miss zora â mr alwyn i sure is glad to see you sir well if there aint aunt rachel looking as young as ever and higgins you scamp â ah mr sanders â well gentlemen and ladies this sure is gwine to be a good cotton season i remember â  and he ran on endlessly now to this one now to that now to all his little eyes all the while dancing insinuatingly here and there about nine oclock a buggy drove up and carter and simpson came in â carter a silent strongfaced brown laborer who listened and looked and simpson a worried nervous man who sat still with difficulty and commenced many sentences but did not finish them alwyn looked at his watch and at zora but she gave no sign until they heard a rollicking song outside and tylor burst into the room he was nearly seven feet high and broadshouldered yellow with curling hair and laughing brown eyes he was chewing an enormous quid of tobacco the juice of which he distributed generously and had had just liquor enough to make him jolly his entrance was a breeze and a roar

alwyn then undertook to explain the land scheme

 it is the best land in the county â 

 when its clared interrupted johnson and simpson looked alarmed

 it is partially cleared continued alwyn  and our plan is to sell off small twentyacre farms â 

 you cant do nothing on twenty acres â  began johnson but tylor laid his huge hand right over his mouth and said briefly  shut up 

alwyn started again  we shall sell a few twentyacre farms but keep one central plantation of one hundred acres for the school here miss zora will carry on her work and the school will run a model farm with your help we want to centre here agencies to make life better we want all sorts of industries we want a little hospital with a resident physician and two or three nurses we want a cooperative store for buying supplies we want a cottongin and sawmill and in the future other things this land here as i have said is the richest around we want to keep this hundred acres for the public good and not sell it we are going to deed it to a board of trustees and those trustees are to be chosen from the ones who buy the small farms

whos going to get whats made on this land asked sanders

 all of us it is going first to pay for the land then to support the home and the school and then to furnish capital for industries

johnson snickered you mean youse gwine to git yo livin off it 

 yes answered alwyn but im going to work for it

 who s gwine â  began simpson but stopped helplessly

 whos going to tend this land  asked the practical carter

 all of us each man is going to promise us so many days work a year and we re going to ask others to help â the women and girls and school children â they will all help

 can you put trust in that sort of help  

 we can when once the community learns that it pays

does you own the land asked johnson suddenly

 no we re buying it and it s part paid for already

the discussion became general zora moved about among the men whispering and explaining while johnson moved too objecting and hinting at last he arose

 brethren ha began  the plans good enough for talkin but you cant work it who ever heerd tell of such a thing first place the land aint yours second place you cant get it worked third place white folks wont low it who ever heerd of such working land on shares 

 you do it for white folks each day why not for yourselves alwyn pointed out

 cause we aint white and we cant do nothin like that

tylor was asleep and snoring and the others looked doubtfully at each other it was a proposal a little too daring for them a bit too far beyond their experience one consideration alone kept them from shrinking away and that was zoras influence not a man was there whom she had not helped and encouraged nor who had not perfect faith in her in her impetuous hope her deep enthusiasm and her strong will even her defects â the hardheld temper the deeply rooted dislikes â caught their imagination

finally after several other meetings five men took courage â three of the best and two of the weakest during the spring long negotiations were entered into by miss smith to  buy  the five men colonel cresswell and mr tolliver had them all charged with large sums of indebtedness and these sums had to be assumed by the school as colonel cresswell counted over two thousand dollars of school notes and deposited them beside the mortgage he smiled grimly for he saw the end yet even then his hand trembled and that curious doubt came creeping back he put it aside angrily and glanced up

 nigger wants to talk with you announced his clerk

the colonel sauntered out and found bles alwyn waiting

 colonel cresswell he said  i have charge of the buying for the school and our tenants this year and i naturally want to do the best possible i thought id come over and see about getting my supplies at your store

 that s all right you can get anything you want said colonel cresswell cheerily for this to his mind was evidence of sense on the part of the negroes bles showed his list of needed supplies â seeds meat cornmeal coffee sugar etc the colonel glanced over it carelessly then moved away

 all right come and get what you want â any time he called back

 but about the prices said alwyn following him

 oh they ll be all right

 of course but what i want is an estimate of your lowest cash prices

 cash

 yes sir

cresswell thought a while such a businesslike proposition from negroes surprised him

 well i ll let you know he said

it was nearly a week later before alwyn approached him again

 now see here said colonel cresswell  theres practically no difference between cash and time prices we buy our stock on time and you can just as well take advantage of this as not i have figured out about what these things will cost the best thing for you to do is to make a deposit here and get things when you want them if you make a good deposit i ll throw off ten per cent which is all of my profit

 thank you aid alwyn but he looked over the account and found the whole bill at least twice as large as he expected without further parley he made some excuse and started to town while mr cresswell went to the telephone

in town alwyn went to all the chief merchants one after another and received to his great surprise practically the same estimate he could not understand it he had estimated the current market prices according to the montgomery paper yet the prices in toombsville were fifty to a hundred and fifty per cent higher the merchant to whom he went last laughed

 dont you know we re not going to interfere with colonel cresswells tenants he stated the dealers attitude and alwyn saw light he went home and told zora and she listened without surprise

 now to business she said briskly  miss smith turning to the teacher  as i told you they re combined against us in town and we must buy in montgomery i was sure it was coming but i wanted to give colonel cresswell every chance bles starts for montgomery â  alwyn looked up  does he  he asked smiling

 yes said zora smiling in turn  we must lose no further time

 but theres no train from toombsville tonight

 but theres one from barton in the morning and barton is only twenty miles away

 it is a long walk alwyn thought a while silently then he rose  im going he said  goodbye

in less than a week the storehouse was full and tenants were at work the twenty acres of cleared swamp land attended to by the voluntary labor of all the tenants was soon bearing a magnificent crop colonel cresswell inspected all the crops daily with a proprietary air that would have been natural had these folk been simply tenants and as such he persisted in regarding them

the cotton now growing was perhaps not so uniformly fine as the first acre of silver fleece but it was of unusual height and thickness

 at least a bale to the acre alwyn estimated and the colonel mentally determined to take twothirds of the crop after that he decided that he would evict zora immediately since sufficient land was cleared already for his purposes and moreover he had seen with consternation a herd of cattle grazing in one field on some early green stuff and heard a drove of hogs in the swamp such an example before the tenants of the black belt would be fatal he must wait a few weeks for them to pick the cotton â then the end he was fighting the battle of his color and caste

the children sang merrily in the brownwhite field the wide baskets poised aloft foamed on the erect and swaying bodies of the dark carriers the crop throughout the land was short that year for prices had ruled low last season in accordance with the policy of the combine this year they started high again would they fall many thought so and hastened to sell

zora and alwyn gathered their tenants crops ginned them at the cresswells gin and carried their cotton to town where it was deposited in the warehouse of the farmers league

 now  said alwyn  we would best sell while prices are high

zora laughed at him frankly

 we cant she said  do nt you know that colonel cresswell will attach our cotton for rent as soon as it touches the warehouse 

 but it s ours

 nothing is ours no black man ordinarily can sell his crop without a white creditors consent

alwyn fumed

 the best way he declared  is to go to montgomery and get a firstclass lawyer and just fight the thing through the land is legally ours and he has no right to our cotton

 yes but you must remember that no man like colonel cresswell regards a business bargain with a colored man as binding no white man under ordinary circumstances will help enforce such a bargain against prevailing public opinion

 but if we cannot trust to the justice of the case and if you knew we could nt why did you try 

 because i had to try and moreover the circumstances are not altogether ordinary the men in power in toomsville now are not the landlords of this county they are poor whites the judge and sheriff were both elected by millhands who hate cresswell and taylor then there s a new young lawyer who wants harry cresswells seat in congress he dont know much law im afraid but what he dont know of this case i think i do i ll get his advice and then â i mean to conduct the case myself zora calmly concluded

 without a lawyer  bles alwyn stared his amazement

without a lawyer in court

 zora that would be foolish 

 is it lets think for over a year now i ve been studying the law of the case and she pointed to her law books  i know the law and most of the decisions moreover as a black woman fighting a hopeless battle with landlords i ll gain the one thing lacking

 whats that 

 the sympathy of the court and the bystanders

pshaw from these southerners

 yes from them they are very human these men especially the laborers their prejudices are cruel enough but there are joints in their armor they are used to seeing us either scared or blindly angry and they understand how to handle us then but at other times it is hard for them to do anything but meet us in a human way

 but zora think of the contact of the court the humiliation the coarse talk â 

zora put up her hand and lightly touched his arm looking at him she said  mud does nt hurt much this is my duty let me do it

his eyes fell before the shadow of a deeper rebuke he arose heavily

 very well he acquiesced as he passed slowly out

the young lawyer started to refuse to touch the case until he saw â or did zora adroitly make him seeâa chance for eventual political capital they went over the matter carefully and the lawyer acquired a respect for the young womans knowledge

 first he said  get an injunction on the cotton â then go to court and to insure the matter he slipped over and saw the judge

colonel cresswell next day stalked angrily into his lawyers office

 see here he thundered handing the lawyer the notice of the injunction

 see the judge began the lawyer and then remembered as he was often forced to do these days who was judge

he inquired carefully into the case and examined the papers then he said  colonel cresswell who drew this contract of sale   the black girl did

 impossible 

 she certainly did â wrote it in my presence

 well its mighty well done

you mean it will stand in law

 it certainly will theres but one way to break it and thats to allege misunderstanding on your part cresswell winced it was not pleasant to go into open court and acknowledge himself overreached by a negro but several thousand dollars in cotton and land were at stake

 go ahead he concurred

you can depend on taylor of course added the lawyer

 of course answered cresswell  but why prolong the thing 

you see shes got your cotton tied by injunction

 i dont see how she did it

easy enough this judge is the poor white you opposed in the last primary

within a week the case was called and they filed into the courtroom cresswelis lawyer saw only this black woman â no other lawyer or sign of one appeared to represent her the place soon filled with a lazy tobaccochewing throng of white men a few blacks whispered in one corner the dirty stove was glowing with pinewood and the judge sat at a desk

wheres your lawyer he asked sharply of zora i have none returned zora rising

there came a silence in the court her voice was low and the men leaned forward to listen the judge felt impelled to be overgruff

 get a lawyer he ordered

 your honor my case is simple and with your honors permission i wish to conduct it myself i cannot afford a lawyer and i do not think i need one

cresswells lawyer smiled and leaned back it was going to be easier than he supposed evidently the woman believed she had no case and was weakening

the trial proceeded and zora stated her contention she told how long her mother and grandmother had served the cresswells and showed her receipt for rent paid

 a friend sent me some money i went to mr cresswell and asked him to sell me two hundred acres of land he consented to do so and signed this contract in the presence of his soninlaw

just then john taylor came into the court and cresswell beckoned to him

 i want you to help me out john

 all right whispered taylor  what can i do  

 swear that cresswell did nt mean to sign this said the lawyer quickly as he arose to address the court

taylor looked at the paper blankly and then at cresswell and some inkling of the irreconcilable difference in the two natures leapt in both their hearts cresswell might gamble and drink and lie  like a gentleman but he would never willingly cheat or take advantage of a white mans financial necessities taylor on the other hand had a horror of a lie never drank nor played game of chance but his whole life was speculation and in thâ business game he was utterly ruthless and respected no one such men could never thoroughly understand each other to cresswell a man who had cheated the whole south out of millions by a series of misrepresentations ought to regard this little falsehood as nothing

meantime colonel cresswells lawyer was on his feet and he adopted his most irritating and contemptuous manner

 this nigger wench wrote out some illegible stuff and colonel cresswell signed it to get rid of her we are not going to question the legality of the form â thats neither here nor there the point is mr cresswell never intended â never dreamed of selling this wench land right in front of his door he meant to rent her the land and sign a receipt for rent paid in advance i will not worry your honor by a long argument to prove this but just call one of the witnesses well known to you â mr john taylor of the toomsville mills

taylor looked toward the door and then slowly took the stand

 mr taylor said the lawyer carelessly  were you present at this transaction

 yes

did you see colonel cresswell sign this paper 

 yes

 well did he intend so far as you know to sign such a paper 

 i do not know his intentions

 did he say he meant to sign such a contract 

taylor hesitated

 yes he finally answered colonel cresswell looked up in amazement and the lawyer dropped his glasses

i â i dont think you perhaps understood me mr taylor he gasped i â er â meant to ask if colonel cresswell in signing this paper meant to sign a contract to sell this wench two hundred acres of land 

 he said he did reiterated taylor  although i ought to add that he did not think the girl would ever be able to pay if he had thought she would pay i dont think he would have signed the paper

colonel cresswell went red then pale and leaning forward before the whole court he hurled you damned scoundrel

the judge rapped for order and fidgeted in his seat there was some confusion and snickering in the courtroom finally the judge plucked up courage  the defendant is ordered to deliver this cotton to zora cresswell he directed

the raging of colonel cresswells anger now turned against john taylor as well as the negroes wind of the estrangement flew over town quickly the poor whites saw a chance to win taylors influence and the sheriff approached him cautiously taylor paid him slight courtesy he was irritated with this devilish negro problem he was making money his wife and babies were enjoying life and here was this fool trial to upset matters but the sheriff talked

 the thing im afraid of he said  is that cresswell and his gang will swing in the niggers on us

 how do you mean  

let em vote

 but theyd have to read and write

 sure

 well then said taylor  it might be a good thing colton eyed him suspiciously

 you d let a nigger vote 

 why yes if he had sense enough

 there aint no nigger got sense

 oh pshaw  taylor ejaculated walking away

the sheriff was angry and mistrustful he believed he had discovered a deeplaid scheme of the aristocrats to cultivate friendliness between whites and blacks and then use black voters to crush the whites such a course was in coltons mind dangerous monstrous and unnatural it must be stopped at all hazards he began to whisper among his friends one or two meetings were held and the flame of racial prejudice was studiously fanned

the atmosphere of the town and country quickly began to change whatever little beginnings of friendship and understanding had arisen now quickly disappeared the town of a saturday no longer belonged to a happy careless crowd of black peasants but the black folk found themselves elbowed to the gutter while ugly quarrels flashed here and there with a quick arrest of the negroes

colonel cresswell made a sudden resolve he sent for the sheriff and received him at the oaks in his most respectable style filling him with good food and warming him with good liquor

 colton he asked  are you sending any of your white children to the nigger school yet 

 what  yelled colton

the colonel laughed frankly telling colton john taylors philosophy on the race problemâ his willingness to let negroes vote his threat to let blacks and whites work together his contempt for the officials elected by the people

 candidly colton he concluded  i believe in aristocracy i cant think it right or wise to replace the old aristocracy by new and untried blood and in a sudden outburst â  but by god sir im a white man and i place the lowest white man ever created above the highest darkey ever thought of this yankee taylor is a niggerlover he s secretly encouraging and helping them you saw what he did to me and im warning you in time

coltons glass dropped

 i thought it was you that was corralling the niggers against us he exclaimed

the colonel reddened  i dont count all white men my equals i admit he returned with dignity  but i know the difference between a white man and a nigger

colton stretched out his massive hand  put it there sir said he i misjudged you colonel cresswell im a southerner and i honor the old aristocracy you represent im going to join with you to crush this yankee and put the niggers in their places they are getting impudent around here they need a lesson and by gad they ll get one they ll remember

now see here colton â nothing rash the colonel charged him warningly  do nt stir up needless trouble but â well things must change

colton rose and shook his head

 the niggers need a lesson he muttered as he unsteadily bade his host goodbye cresswell watched him uncomfortably as he rode away and again a feeling of doubt stirred within him what new force was he loosening against his black folk â his own black folk who had lived about him and his fathers nigh three hundred years  he saw the huge form of the sheriff loom like an evil spirit a moment on the rise of the road and sink into the night he turned slowly to his cheerless house shuddering as he entered the uninviting portals

when emma berties child came home after a two years course of study she had passed from girlhood to young womanhood she was white and sandyhaired she was not beautiful and she appeared to be fragile but she also looked sweet and good with that peculiar innocence which peers out upon the world with calm round eyes and sees no evil but does methodically its simple everyday work zora mothered her miss smith found her plenty to do and bles thought her a good girl but mrs cresswell found her perfect and began to scheme to marry her off for mary cresswell with the restlessness and unhappiness of an unemployed woman was trying to atone for her former blunders

her humiliation after the episode at cresswell oaks had been complete it seemed to her that the original cause of her whole life punishment lay in her persistent misunderstanding of the black people and their problem zora appeared to her in a new and glorified light â a vigorous selfsacrificing woman she knew that zora had refused to marry bles and this again seemed fitting zora was not meant for marrying she was a born leader wedded to a great cause she had long outgrown the boy and girl affection she was the sort of woman she herself might have been if she had not married

alwyn on the other hand needed a wife he was a great virile boy requiring a simple affectionate mate no sooner did she see emma than she was sure that this was the ideal wife she compared herself with helen cresswell helen was a contented wife and mother because she was fitted for the position and happy in it while she who had aimed so high had fallen piteously from such a fate she would save zora and bles

emmas course in nursetraining had been simple and short and there was no resident physician but emma in her unemotional way was a born nurse and did much good among the sick in the neighborhood zora had a small log hospital erected with four white beds a private room and an office which was also emmas bedroom the new white physician in town just fresh from school in atlanta became interested and helped with advice and suggestions

meantime john taylors troubles began to increase under the old political regime it had been an easy matter to avoid serious damagesuits for the accidents in the mill much child labor and the lack of protective devices made accidents painfully frequent taylor insisted that the chief cause was carelessness while the mill hands alleged criminal neglect on his part when the new labor officials took charge of the court and the break occurred between colonel cresswell and his soninlaw taylor found that several damagesuits were likely to cost him a considerable sum

he determined not to let the bad feeling go too far and when a particularly distressing accident to a little girl took place he showed more than his usual interest and offered to care for her the new young physician recommended zoras infirmary as the only near place that offered a chance for the childs recovery

 take her out taylor promptly directed

zora was troubled when the child came she knew the suspicious temper of the town whites the very next day taylor sent out a second case a child who had been hurt some time before and was not recovering as she should under the care of the little hospital and the gentle nurse the children improved rapidly and in two weeks were outdoors playing with the little black children and even creeping into classrooms and listening the grateful mothers came out twice a week at least at first with suspicious aloofness but gradually melting under zoras tact until they sat and talked with her and told their troubles and struggles zora realized how human they were and how like their problems were to hers they and their children grew to love this busy thoughtful woman and zoras fears were quieted

the catastrophe came suddenly the sheriff rode by scowling and hunting for some poor black runaway when he saw white children in the negro school and white women whom he knew were millhands looking on he was black with anger turning he galloped back to town a few hours later the young physician arrived hastily in a cab to take the women and children to town he said something in a low tone to zora and drove away frowning

zora came quickly to the school and asked for alwyn he was in the barn and she hurried there

 bles she said quietly  it is reported that a toomsville mob will burn the school tonight

bles stood motionless

 i ve been fearing it the sheriff has been stirring up the worst elements in the town lately and the mills pay off tonight

 well she said quietly  we must prepare

he looked at her his face aglow with admiration

you wonderwoman he exclaimed softly

a moment they regarded each other she saw the love in his eyes and he saw rising in hers something that made his heart bound but she turned quickly away

you must hurry bles lives are at stake and in another moment he thundered out of the barn on the black mare

along the pike he flew and up the plantation roads across broad fields and back again over to the barton pike and along the swamp at every cabin he whispered a word and left behind him grey faces and whispering children

his horse was reeking with sweat as he staggered again into the schoolyard but already the people were gathering with frightened anxious desperate faces women with bundles and children men with guns tottering old folks wideeyed boys and girls up from the swamp land came the children crying and moaning the sun was setting the women and children hurried into the school building closing the doors and windows a moment alwyn stood without and looked back the world was peaceful he could hear the whistle of birds and the sobbing of the breeze in the shadowing oaks the sky was flashing to dull and purplish blue and over all lay the twilight hush as though god did not care

he threw back his head and clenched his hands his soul groaned within him  heavenly father was man ever before set to such a task fight god if he could but fight if he could but let go the elemental passions that were leaping and gathering and burning in the eyes of yonder caged and desperate black men but his hands were tied â manacled one desperate struggle a whirl of blood and the whole world would rise to crush him and his people the white operator in yonder town had but to flash the news  negroes killing whites to bring all the country all the state all the nation to red vengeance it mattered not what the provocation what the desperate cause

the door suddenly opened behind him and he wheeled around

zora  he whispered

 bles she answered softly and they went silently in to their people

all at once from floor to roof the whole schoolhouse was lighted up save a dark window here and there then some one slipped out into the darkness and soon watchfire after watchfire flickered and flamed in the night and then burned vividly sending up sparks and black smoke thus ringed with flaming silence the school lay at the edge of the great black swamp and waited owls hooted in the forest afar the shriek of the montgomery train was heard across the night mingling with the wail of a wakeful babe and then redoubled silence the men became restless and johnson began to edge away toward the lower hill alwyn was watching him when a faint noise came to him on the eastern breeze â a low rumbling murmur it died away and rose again then a distant gunshot woke the echoes

 they re coming  he cried standing back in the shadow of a front window he waited slowly intermittently the murmuring swelled till it grew distinguishable as yelling cursing and singing intermingled with the crash of pistolshots far away a flame as of a burning cabin arose and a wilder louder yell greeted it now the tramp of footsteps could be heard and clearer and thicker the grating and booming of voices until suddenly far up the pike a black moving mass with glitter and shout swept into view they came headlong guided by pinetorches which threw their white and haggard faces into wild distortion then as bonfire after bonfire met their gaze they moved slowly and more slowly and at last sent a volley of bullets at the fires one bullet flew high and sang through a lighted window without a word uncle isaac sank upon the floor and lay still silence and renewed murmuring ensued and the sound of high voices in dispute then the mass divided into two wings and slowly encircled the fence of fire starting noisily and confidently and then going more slowly quietly warily as the silence of the flame began to tell on their heated nerves

strained whispers arose

 careful there 

 go on damn ye 

 there s some one by yon fire

 no there aint

 see the bushes move

bang bang bang

whos that

 its me

 lets rush through and fire the house

 and leave a pacel of niggers behind to shoot your lights out not me

what the hell are you going to do

 i dont know yet

 i wish i could see a nigger

 hark 

stealthy steps were approaching a glint of steel flashed behind the fire lights each band mistook the other for the armed negroes and the leaders yelled in vain human power can not stay the dashing torrent of fearinspired human panic whirling the mob fled till it struck the road in two confused surging masses then in quick frenzy shots flew three men threw up their hands and tumbled limply in the dust while the main body rushed pellmell toward town

at early dawn when the men relaxed from the strain of the nights vigil alwyn briefly counselled them  hide your guns

 why   blustered rob  have nt i a right to have a gun  

yes you have rob but dont be foolish â hide it weve not heard the last of this

but rob tossed his head belligerently

in town rumor spread like wildfire a body of peaceful whites passing through the black settlement had been fired on from ambush and six killed â no three killed â no one killed and two severely wounded

 the thing must nt stop here shouted sheriff colton   these niggers must have a lesson and before nine next morning fully half the grown members of the same mob now sworn in as deputies rode with him to search the settlement they tramped insolently through the school grounds but there was no shred of evidence until they came to robs cabin and found his gun they tied his hands behind him and marched him toward town

but before the mob arrived the night before johnson feeling that his safety lay in informing the white folks had crawled with his gun into the swamp in the mornmg he peered out as the cavalcade approached and not knowing what had happened he recognized colton the sheriff and signalled to him cautiously in a moment a dozen men were on him and he appealed and explained in vain â the gun was damning evidence the voices of robs wife and children could be heard behind the two men as they were hurried along at a dog trot

the town poured out to greet them â  the murderers  the murderers kill the niggers  and they came on with a rush the sheriff turned and disappeared in the rear there was a great cloud of dust a cry and a wild scramble as the white and angry faces of men and boys gleamed a moment and faded

a hundred or more shots rang out then slowly and silently the mass of women and men were sucked into the streets of the town leaving but black eddies on the corners to throw backward glances toward the bare towering pine where swung two red and awful things the pale boyface of one with soft brown eyes glared up sightless to the sun the dead leathered bronze of the other was carved in piteous terror

three months had flown it was spring again and zora sat in the transformed swamp â now a swamp in name only â beneath the great oak dreaming and what she dreamed there in the golden day she dared not formulate even to her own soul she rose with a start for there was work to do aunt rachel was ill and emma went daily to attend her today as she came back she brought news that colonel cresswell who had been unwell for several days was worse she must send emma up to help and as she started toward the school she glanced toward the cresswell oaks and saw the armchair of its master on the pillared porch

colonel cresswell sat in his chair on the porch alone as far as he could see there was no human soul his eyes were bloodshot his cheeks sunken and his breath came in painful gasps a sort of terror shook him until he heard the distant songs of black folk in the fields he sighed and lying back closed his eyes and the breath came easier when he opened them again a white figure was coming up the avenue of the oaks he watched it greedily it was mary cresswell and she started when she saw him

 you are worse father  she asked

 worse and better he replied smiling cynically then suddenly he announced  ive made my will

 why â why â  she stammered

why sharply because im going to die

she said nothing he smiled and continued  i ve got it all fixed harry was in a tight place â gambling as usual â and i gave him a lump sum in lieu of all claims then i gave john taylor â you need nt look i sent for him hes a damned scoundrel but he wont lie and i needed him i willed his children all the rest except two or three legacies one was one hundred thousand dollars for you â 

 oh father  she cried  i dont deserve it

 i reckon two years with harry was worth about that much he returned grimly  then theres another gift of two hundred thousand dollars and this house and plantation whom do you think thats for

 helen

 helen  he raised his hand in threatening anger  i might rot here for all she cares no â no â but then â i ll not tell you â i â ah â  a spasm of pain shot across his face and he lay back white and still abruptly he sat up again and peered down the oaks hush he gasped whos that

 i dont know â its a girl â i â 

he gripped her till she winced

my god â it walks â like my wife â i tell you â she held her head so â who is it he half rose

 oh father it s nobody but emma â little emma â berties child â the mulatto girl she s a nurse now and i asked to have her come and attend you

 oh he said  oh â  he looked at the girl curiously  come here he peered into her white young face  do you know me 

the girl shrank away from him

 yes sir

what do you do

 i teach and nurse at the school

good well im going to give you some money â do you know why  

a flash of selfconsciousness passed over the girls face she looked at him with her wide blue eyes

 yes grandfather she faltered

mrs cresswell rose to her feet but the old man slowly dropped the girls hand and lay back in his chair with lips half smiling  grandfather he repeated softly he closed his eyes a space and then opened them a tremor shivered in his limbs as he stared darkly at the swamp

 hark  he cried harshly  do you hear the bodies creaking on the limbs its rob and johnson i did it â i â 

suddenly he rose and stood erect and his wild eyes stricken with death stared full upon emma slowly and thickly he spoke working his trembling hands

nell â nell is it you little wife come back to accuse me ah nell dont shrink i know â i have sinned against the light and the blood of your poor black people is red on these old hands no dont put your clean white hands upon me nell till i wash mine i ll do it nell i ll atone im a cresswell yet nell a cresswell and a gen â  he swayed vainly he struggled for the word the shudder of death shook his soul and he passed

a week after the funeral of colonel cresswell john taylor drove out to the school and was closeted with miss smith his sister installed once again for a few days in her old room at the school understood that he was conferring about emmas legacy and she was glad she was more and more convinced that the marriage of emma and bles was the best possible solution of many difficulties she had asked emma once if she liked bles and emma had replied in her innocent way  oh so much

as for bles he was often saying what a dear child emma was neither perhaps realized yet that this was love but it needed mrs cresswell was sure only the lightningflash and they would know and who could furnish that illumination better than zora the calm methodical zora who knew them so well

as for herself once she had accomplished the marriage and paid the mortgage on the school out of her legacy she would go abroad and in travel seek forgetfulness and healing there had been no formal divorce and so far as she was concerned there never would be but the separation from her husband and america would be forever

her brother came out of the office nodded casually for they had little intercourse these days and rode away she rushed in to miss smith and found her sitting there â straight upright composed in all save that the tears were streaming down her face and she was making no effort to stop them

 why â miss smith  she faltered

miss smith pointed to a paper mrs cresswell picked it up curiously it was an official notification to the trustees of the smith school of a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars together with the cresswell house and plantation mrs cresswell sat down in openmouthed astonishment twice she tried to speak but there were so many things to say that she could not choose

 tell zora miss smith at last managed to say

zora was dreaming again somehow the old dreamlife with its glorious phantasies had come silently back richer and sweeter than ever there was no tangible reason why and yet today she had shut herself in her den searching down in the depths of her trunk she drew forth that filmy cloud of white â silkbordered and half finished to a gown why were her eyes wet today and her mind on the silver fleece it was an anniversary and perhaps she still remembered that moment that supreme moment before the mob she half slipped on half wound about her the white cloud of cloth standing with parted lips looking into the long mirror and gleaming in the fading day like midnight gowned in mists and stars abruptly there came a peremptory knocking at the door

zora zora sounded mrs cresswells voice forgetting her informal attire she opened the door fearing some mishap mrs cresswell poured out the news zora received it in such motionless silence that mary wondered at her want of feeling at last however she said happily to zora  well the battle s over is nt it 

 no it s just begun

just begun echoed mary in amazement

 think of the servile black folk the half awakened restless whites the fat land waiting for the harvest the masses panting to know â why the battle is scarcely even begun

 yes i guess thats so mary began to comprehend

 we ll thank god it has begun though

 thank god  zora reverently repeated

 come lets go back to poor dear miss smith suggested mary

i cant come just now â but pretty soon

why oh i see youre trying on something â how pretty and becoming well hurry

as they stood together the white woman deemed the moment opportune she slipped her arm about the black womans waist and began  zora ive had something on my mind for a long time and i should nt wonder if you had thought of the same thing

 what is it 

 bles and emma

 what of them 

 their liking for each other

zora bent a moment and caught up the folds of the fleece

 i had nt noticed it she said in a low voice

 well you re busy you see they ve been very much together â his taking her to her charges bringing her back and all that i know they love each other yet something holds them apart afraid to show their love do you know â ive wondered if â quite unconsciously it is you you know bles used to imagine himself in love with you just as he did afterward with miss wynn

 miss â wynn  

 yes the washington girl but he got over that and you straightened him out finally still emma probably thinks yours is the prior claim knowing of course nothing of facts and bles knows she thinks of him and you and i m convinced if you say the word theyd love and marry

zora walked silently with her to the door where looking out she saw bles and emma coming from aunt rachels he was helping her from the carriage with smiling eyes and her innocent blue eyes were fastened on him

zora looked long and searchingly

 please run and tell them of the legacy she begged i â i will come â in a moment and mrs cresswell hurried out

zora turned back steadily to her room and locked herself in after all why shouldnt it be why had it not occurred to her before in her blindness if she had wanted him â and ah god was not all her life simply the want of him â why had she not bound him to her when he had offered himself why had she not bound him to her she knew as she asked â because she had wanted all not a part â everything love respect and perfect faith â not one thing could she spare then â not one thing and now oh god she had dreamed that it was all hers since that night of death and circling flame when they looked at each other soul to soul but he had not meant anything it was pity she had seen there not love and she rose and walked the room slowly fast and faster

with trembling hands she drew the silver fleece round her her head swam again and the blood flashed in her eyes she heard a calling in the swamp and the shadow of elspeth seemed to hover over her claiming her for her own dragging her down down    she rushed through the swamp the lagoon lay there before her presently gleaming in the darkness â cold and still and in it swam an awful shape

she held her burning head â was not everything plain 

was not everything clear this was sacrifice this was the atonement for the unforgiven sin emmas was the pure soul which she must offer up to god for it was god a cold and mighty god who had given it to bles â her bles it was well god willed it but could she live must she live did god ask that too

all at once she stood straight her whole body grew tense alert she heard no sound behind her but knew he was there and braced herself she must be true she must be just she must pay the uttermost farthing

 bles she called faintly but did not turn her head

 zora

 bles she choked but her voice came stronger  i know â all emma is a good girl i helped bring her up myself and did all i could for her and she â she is pure marry her

his voice came slow and firm emma but i dont love emma i love â some one else

her heart bounded and again was still it was that washington girl then she answered dully groping for words for she was tired  who is it 

 the best woman in all the world zora

 and is  â she struggled at the word madly â  is she pure 

 she is more than pure

 then you must marry her bles

 i am not worthy of her he answered sinking before her

then at last illumination dawned upon her blindness she stood very still and lifted up her eyes the swamp was living vibrant tremulous there where the first long note of night lay shot with burning crimson burst in sudden radiance the wide beauty of the moon there pulsed a glory in the air her little hands groped and wandered over his closecurled hair and she sobbed deep voiced  will you â marry me bles
