murder link the johnson henry t 
all gables and shadows the lone house loomed against the cloudy sky elmer dring pushing through the rusty gate with creaked expostulation reflected that the abode like the apparel oft proclaimed the man for never was house shabbier or drearier than the lone house wherein old stingy lived

its windows were as bleary as his eyes and as grimy as his hands patched too as crudely as his garments its garden was as ragged its grass plot r tangled and matted as his hair in the centre of i that grass plot yawned the cracked basin all grey and green with moss of the duckweed covered fishpond

on the other side of the dank weedchoked path a gaunt and grisly cedar swayed its sombre head and waved black bony arms as though despairing of the desolation beneath its shadows

if elmer letting fall the rustred knocker with a reverberating thud upon the dingy door had been a creature of imagination instead of a solicitor who dabbled in financial speculation and whose heart and soul were concentrated in his dabbling he might have said with thomas hood the house is haunted

and when that huge door after much clanking and rattling of bolts swung back and jane collins stood framed in the gloom of its portal he might have deemed he saw the ghost

old man at home he asked and jane collins answered fancy asking 

i didnt know for certain he sniggered apologetically i thought it just possible he might have gone to the mayoress fancy dress ball or up to london for a ramble round the westend hes such a gay dog

that you elmer a voice croaked out of the darkness of the wormeaten staircase and elmer his tone changing from mockery to suavity replied yes mr abbs hows your bronchitis

whats that do with you you aint a doctor rasped the bowed figure at the stairhead and elmer dring after just a momentary fierce convulsion of the features laughed merrily

did you hear that jane he will have his joke did ever anybody know such humourthen under his breath he muttered the fellow ought to be dead

i want a word with you whispers jane collins hurry up  hurry up comes the ravenlike croak again i am standing in a draught

and elmer dring whispering when im going  and fixing his hat and overcoat upon a peg chirps all right mr abbs im coming and with quickened footsteps ascends the creaking gloomy stairs and follows the old miser into the barelyfurnished room that serves him for sittingroom and sanctum

a chessboard with the pieces all set out lies ready upon the table the miser taking up a black pawn and a white and placing his hands behind him passes and repasses them from fist to fist

but first he asks did you put the screw on saunders

i did and he gave me a bill of sale upon his sticks for interest principal and costs

burgoyne

i put in execution he and his wife arc going to the union tomorrow

there didnt i say they were dishonest fancy a man hardly seventy and his wife burdening the rates with their maintenance how about flinders

the lawyer hesitated pursing his double chin

he wants another month to pay up in

well he cant have it he cant have another week another day foreclose tomorrow sell up the farm stock plant and homesteadâlock stock and barrel pack him off to join his friend burgoyne in the workhouse the deepsunken eyes sparkled the veins stood out in the bald and shiny cranium every fibre of the old mans being twitched with the intensity of greed and rage and he went off into a fit of coughing that left him pantingâalmost collapsingâin the high armchair beside the table

meantime below bolts chains and lock were clanking and clattering other footsteps creaked up the stairway

judex said the old man listening and the  second visitor as lean as the first was plump as black and swarthy as the first was white and pink entered the room

the lawyer seemed to hail the interruption with relief not so the old man who had failed to beat down the doctor below half a crown for visit and medicine

i heard you coughing  said the latter severely even as i approached the gate and you have no fire

i dont want it the room is quite hot isnt it elmersaid the old man hastily endeavouring to repress a shiver youll stay and play the conqueror doctor

providing i may keep my overcoat on judex esslin answered taking a third chair as the others seated themselves and began the game

all three being enthusiasts they sat for a long while very like three ravens in a silence broken only by the intermittent click of pieces moved or taken and an occasional check or you cant go there until at last gideon abbs triumphantly exclaiming got you  came down with his queen and pinned the black king against a horde of his own men

mate l  croaked the miser and leaned back in his chair and judex esslin remarked yes you might have made that move much earlier and with the pieces he demonstrated how

yes yes grunted gideon abbs with puckered forehead but the fact is my mind was running on something else it generally is for almost always some rascals trying to rob me

the lawyer looked up suddenly now mark me said gideon you foreclose on flinderss farm tomorrow put the screw on sell the very bed from under him

the law wont let me do that replied the lawyer mores the pity after all whats the hurry i dont say it wouldnt serve him right only you remember what the jury said when tom spatchett suicided after youd sold him up

what do i care almost screamed the old man after all what did they say didnt they bring it in temporary insanity the man was mad wasnt he doctor

everybody is answered judex esslin seizing the opportunity of trotting out the hobby which absorbed him the insanity dormant in all men in his instance took the form of suicidal monomania

and while they rearranged the pieces judex esslin who detected kleptomania in a childs grab at its fathers watchchain and incipient dipsomania in a thirsty porters request for a pint of beer was warming thoroughly to his arguments when gideon abbs who regarded them with the contempt born of familiarity snarled stuff and nonsense lets talk of something else elmer old burbidge was sold up today

i know the other nodded did you go to the auction

yes it was a beautiful morning

do any good

not much it was poor lot of stuff just what youd expect of halfpay service peopleâall pride and poverty to my mind the greatest curiosity is the craze for collecting curiosities if people want to collect anything why dont they go in for modern coins

buy anything

one or two small lots that i can sell again i say elmer are you anything of a lapidary

the other shrugged his shoulders and gideon turned an inquiring look upon the doctor who with a sardonic smile wreathing his darklined face inquired why have you been buying diamonds for beads no such luck  snarled gideon but amongst the captains curios there was a case of weapons hed picked up in different quarters of the world such rubbish didnt appeal to me except one little dagger thing the hilt shaped like a coiled and twisted scaly snake the turnedback mouth making all of guard and for a fang its got a blade of blue steel

fancy collecting such creepy things  elmer dring and esslin harping on his remarked a mans hobbies form the index to his the man we speak of in question collected lethal weaponsâinstruments of death what form mania was incipient in him dont you see only thing wanting was the peculiar combination circumstances and conditions to make that man murderer only natural death came along first he will sleep in the shadow of a tombstone inscribed with a glowing epitaph

do be quiet  expostulated the miser  make ones flesh creep of course i gave a fair price for the things at public auction mine was highest bid and the widow couldnt make a could she elmer if one of the snakes eyes that thought was red glass and the other that she t for green glass should turn out to beâwell a ruby and an emerald

his cunning little eyes peered inquiringly from under their bushy brows into those of the lawyer who together with the doctor forthwith a keen interest in the lethal lot he had that purchased at burbidges auction and after a rising he with some hesitation crossed the room disclosing a collection of murderous weapons had been worn in various waistbelts

an italian stiletto a spanish poniard a backwoodsmans bowieknife a malay creese a strangelyfashioned weapon worn by a creole to secure her blueblack tressesâand defend her honour these and othersâbut the old man with a hoarse guttural cry exclaimed the snake dagger  its goneâgoneâgone someone has stolen it

impossible his guests exclaimed simultaneously and elmer dring suggested he might have left it that morning at the sale but the old man cried excitedly even angrily no no i locked it in the case there before i left the house i tell you its been stolen some wicked thief has guessed its value i tell you the handle was of virgin goldâcalifornian goldâthats why there was no hallmark on it the one eye was a ruby the other an emerald and the sheath was inlaid with jade i knowâi know 

dashing across the room he tugged frantically at the bell and to jane collins ascending the stairs he shrieked send up that girl 

tut tut both guests exclaimed remonstratingly but he turned fiercely upon them hold your tongues i know what i am doing i tell you i will not be robbed 

a lighter footstep sounded on the stair the door opened the room was entered by a girl a mere slip of a girl meanly clad but so exquisitely beautiful that the eyes of both doctor and lawyer lit up as they fixed on her a steadfast gaze only relaxed when each gave a furtive watchful glance at the other

come here you jade you hussy you ungrateful baggage cried the old man

then fastening the door behind her and pointing to the opened case he demanded fiercely and  hoarsely where is it where is the other one

what do you mean the girl exclaimed the peach bloom dying from her cheeks leaving them white and fair as lilies oh what does he mean and she fixed her longlashed violet eyes wide opened on the two visitors seeking an explanation of this latest item of the long string of insult injury vituperation and false accusation

speak out you wretched jezebel see i have witnesses tell the truth where have you hidden the snakeshaped dagger with the hilt of gold come confess at once or jane collins fetches in a constable 

i dont even know what you mean cried the girl in an anguished tone you know i never wronged you in my life you know i am incapable of anything dishonest oh do please let me go away from here you hate me soâwhy do you keep me prisoned here 

listen to her  shrieked the old man thats gratitude thats my return for giving her five years ago a home a shelter thats my return for feeding and clothing this outcast penniless pauperpauperâpauperâthief

he flung the words at her as though they had been missiles and she indeed flinched and writhed with anguish as though each of them had struck her physically

but the last lie roused her from anguish to desperation

no no  she said you shall not call me that i will not stay to hear it day by day you have  taunted me with my poverty well then i will do what i have implored you to let me do day by day and year by year i will go away fromthis place i hate and where i am hated and by work win the bread of independence there are magistrates  i will appeal to them to aid me to my liberty

i cannotâi will not stay here to endure the outrage of your false and cruel accusation 

tut tut tut exclaimed elmer bring hastily and fussily my dear miss armadaleâpansy pansy your guardian does not mean everything he says you must make allowance for his annoyance at losing or rather mislaying doubtless only for a while the trinket that he prizes there there there now dont cry  then turning swiftly to gideon abbs he whispered take care you are going too far only fancyâsuppose she began to talk outside

and with one arm he thrust back the infuriated old curmudgeon with the other he urged the girl out of the room

she stood there on the bare landing tremblingâin the dark alone wondering whether there was another girl in the world so desolate and in such darkness she dreaded going along the eerie corridors up the stairs with the big black rats scuttling within the wainscot and across her path dreaded the blank bare room against whose rattling window the moaning cedar branches swished but she feared still more returning down to that stone vault of a kitchen and to jane collins with her evil tongue âyes and now and then her spiteful hands

so she went back to what to make her still more wretched they had told her was the haunted room

what wonder gideon abbs lost the next game and the next how could any man play any game he kept on crooning knowing that his house harboured a thief that he had been sheltering an adder that had stung him

so the lawyer and the doctor battled with each other neither seeming in a hurry to leave though each kept on remarking that the hour was growing late and each beneath his breath was muttering will he never go

old abbs was pacing the room like an angry tiger for his part muttering will they never go

ive nothing to ask you to drink at last he said you know i keep nothing in the house except a little brandy for medicinal purposes and that defiantly to the lawyer is all run out    its getting very late    arent you getting tired doctor    youve a long way to go elmer

and just as the lawyer perceiving that the doctor meant outstaying him was about saying straight out he wanted a few minutes private talk with gideon the doctor himself remarked pray dont let me detain you elmer i dont go your way and i want to speak to gideon

well dont be long about it growled the miser and good night elmer good nightâmind you put the screw on flinders tomorrow

elmer dring ran his fingers through his long silver hair in a hesitating manner

well well he said good night judex good night gideonâjane will let me out and he went down in the dark

reaching the dimlit lobby he glanced round yes jane collins was gliding out of the shadows a finger on her lip

she whispered to himâfinally he said stay i want you only to pretend to let me out  i must speak to the old man when that mad maddoctors gone

meantime judex esslin fixing his vulture gaze upon the withered wizened miser was warning him not to carry tyranny too far with that girl though it is regrettable to confess that his advice was prompted less by chivalry than prudence

it is not safe my friendâit is not safe

then am i to be plundered by an outcast i have sheltered

tut tut in the first place i doubt if she has stolen what you have lost in the second if she has she has been driven to it by starvation incipient kleptomania thirdly my friend suppose you were to prosecute herâhow are you to answer certain questions

wait till the time comes snarled the old man until then suppose you mind your own business thats just what i am doing

what do you mean the old man asked wrathfully suspiciously

thisâand it is to tell you this i stayed pansy armadale is now a woman before another year has gone i mean to make her mrs esslin

what the old man leaning against the table broke into a mocking laugh that shook his sides an swelled into a hacking cough that shook them eve more and when at length he had recovered gravity and breath he said opening the door go on get out

very well said the other only remember that is my destination half a loaf is better than no bread which would you rather disgorge of on parcel you have plunderedâhalf or the whole steady for the old mans bony hand was moving towards the tongs think it over

he vanished in the darkness of the staircase the old man on the landing listened to his descending footstepsâto the closing of the big door the click of the lock the rattle of the chain

the thief  the traitor  he hissed between his remaining fangs oh what a wicked world it is fullâfullâfull of thieves

suddenly he started at the recollection that he had not heard jane bolt the door downstairs he crossed the room to call to her then suddenly started and gasped convulsively you whats brought you back for there again stood elmer bring

i want another word with youâabout flinders i want you to extend his time

i wontâi wont you shall foreclose tomorrow why man what do you mean what are you standing woolgathering there for come out with it 

i cant foreclose he brought the money this day last week iâive mixed it with my own in an investmentâiâi cant get it in for a few daysâa weekâten days

youve done what i knowâi guessed you had my money youve given up my deeds youve sunk it in one of your wildcat speculations but you dont play that game with me you dont rob me you thief oh what a wicked world it is now dont stop here to argue you know i never go back on my word goâgo 

he thrust forth his bony hand the other slowly disappeared back in the gloom the old man sank into a chair gasping with agitation he sat there â  listening to the descending footsteps to the rattle of the chain the click of the lock the thud of the bolts

then when his heart had ceased its gallop he rose doused the light and himself went out on to the landing

over the stairhead he called jane collins put out that light dont waste my gas at two and eleven a thousand no wonder im so poor 

all right sir

the glimmer there below was swallowed in the dark in the dark the old man climbed one flight of stairs turned along a corridor groping his way with sense of touch keener than the sight of many eyes and so reached the end of the passage mumbling and snarling what a wicked world what a wickedâwicked world 

and all of a sudden he quivered from head to heel uttered a gurling inarticulate cry that sank into a moan then collapsed and went down in a heapâ there in the dark 

clear cold and blue the moonlight flooded all the landâand into that flood of silver light pansy armadale through an unlatched latticed window crept out of the lone houseâand the dark

we find the foreman of the jury deliberately answered that the old chapâbeg pardonâthe deceased was wilfully murdered on the night in question by some person or persons unknownâ and that is the verdict of us all hold your row the last three words in an audible whisper to a fidgety fellowjuror whom he had brought back into the jurybox under his especial wing

after the evidence of jane collins and doctor esslin the coroner remarkedâand the fidgety juror gave vent to a deep expressive ah  eloquent of much contention before he had reluctantly acquiesced in the verdict of the majority

the coroner dismissed them with a glance intended to be withering and principally concentrated on the juror who had stood out strenuously for a verdict of wilful murder against pansy armadale until overcome by the protestations and derision of his comrades an intense craving for liquid and solid refreshment and a thorough weariness of the whole proceedings

when later on he recounted these things to his wife her look was even more withering than the coroners

you weathercock she said if the girl was innocent why did she run away

just what i said my dear i pinted out doctord said she werent sponsible for her actionsâ but they would have it that seeing the number of poor souls old gideon had brought to bankruptcy and ruin there was no telling who might or might not have been driven to desperation by him one thing they never would allowâthat a sweet tender hearted creature like miss pansy could do a thing like that

whereupon the wife of his bosom reiterated viciously that men were fools in ordinary but when a slip of a girl with a dolls face was in question they were bigger fools than ever

for the next nine days the popularity of dassborough divided itself mainly into two sections the pro and antipansy armadalesâthe latter faction being mainly feminine the former contending sturdily that even if the girls hand dealt the fatal blow she had been doubtless goaded to it by her wretched guardians tyranny and that his blood lay on his own head

still they stubbornly declined to be convinced that in this instance flight was tantamount to guilt contending that it was as natural for such a girl to run away from such a man as for a dove to escape if possible the beak and talons of a cormorant and so the time elapsed the wonder slackened and still no warrant had been issued for the apprehension of pansy armadale

for one thing there was no known relative at hand to initiate proceedings as for friends gideon left noneâthose who had known him best had hated him worst

no will was to be found elmer dring declaring his conviction that abbs had left none certainly he had consistently refused to let him draw oneâ probably because he knew his man

it does seem such a pity he said to judex esslin for a fat estate gathered with such zeal and industry by our dear friend to fall to pieces for the want of a securing hand

so i suppose you want to get it into your grasp itll be secure enough then

in the interests of justice certainly i as creditor in respect of certain bills of costs am thinking of administering the estate

come off your perch said judex what about me once a week for years the old hunks has lured me to his den to play chess and worm out of me free gratis advice and prescriptions for his bronchitis and lumbago why with his ailments and his means he ought to have been an income to me

same as the old vagaâi mean our lamented friend served me said dring viciously hed sound me on a dozen points and if i charged a single sixandeightpence call me a thief for claiming a fee for a social chat and what he called his hospitalityâone tablespoonful of whisky all the evening

but fortunately ive kept a record of my attendances and i suppose you can compile a list of your visits and medicine supplies for some years past on a liberal scale here elmers left eyelid gently drooped meantime we may as well gather up anything of any value lying loose aboutâit would be such a pity to let anything garnered by our dear friend fall into evil hands he couldnt take it with him

and if he had it would have melted and jane collinss thin lips snapped viciously at the remark

and then and there they sketched the outline of their plan their claims compiled elmer was to throw the estate into chancery on behalf of himself and all other creditors get judex appointed receiver andâwell in this instance the supply might create the demand

the three were all agreed upon the admirable nature of the arrangement and were about on the point of instituting an elaborate inspection of the lone house

jane collins smiled as if that had not been already done as if strange things had not been already found in strange placesâand others placed to be found thereafter in other places

where do i come in elmer the writhing thin lips asked

why of course you will prefer your claimâ your wellsubstantiated claimâfor services and disbursementsâoutofpocket payments for all sorts of mattersâmind for many years i as administrator shall admit that claim come sirâwho are you and what do you mean sir by practically forcing your way into these premises

suppose i ask the same question of you replied the other

and elmer dring for a moment shifted uneasily before the gaze of a squarecut face with resolute set jaws a mouth of iron and eyes riveted on his own face in a scintillating gaze

my name is elmer dring and i may as well inform you i am a solicitor of the supreme court

is that soâand were you old gideons lawyer

i had the honour of advising the late mr abbs since you are so inquisitive young man spluttered elmer dring

and the imperturbable newcomer responded so well just now let me advise you dont try to use me for a doormatâim not built that way

but who are you and what do you want sharply inquired jane collins and judex esslin with a significant glance to each of his two companions tapped his forehead and shook his head in pitying despondency

i think youre right this time remarked elmer dring it sounds like it anyway

but the new arrival remarked cheerfully no youve guessed wrong and pulling off his gloves he threw them on to the table beside his hat and stickâthen facing them squarely said to cut the cackle and come to cues i may just as well tell you my name is harvey darrell i am the heiratlaw and nextofkin of gideon abbs deceasedâand i have come to stay but first to put a seal on every door and lock and lid inside this house

onâonâon she pressed she knew not whither cared not except that now and then she threw a scared look behind to assure herself the handful of chimneys clustered round the steeple was looming tinier against the night sky and her pace slackened only when the lanes and roads grew stranger

she thanked the kind white moon for lighting her way she was so glad to breathe the sweet fresh summer nightair outside and every minute farther from the hated walls of the lone house that at times she sang

only when she had traversed miles and miles and crossed not merely parochial but county borders she realised that her feet yes and her eyelids were growing heavierâand at times she would seat herself upon a milestone and snatch a minutes rest

then on again now and then climbing a stile and just for variety leaving the hard wide road for a bridlepath across fields glistening with diamond dew the path sometimes leading through the gloom of coppices under arches made of overhanging trees now and then she would be startled by a hare or other living thing scuttling across her path and the trees began to take fantastic shapes to stretch out gaunt menacing arms and she was glad to emerge from the tunnel of interlacing boughs âgladder still though colder when the dark began to lift to grey and up from the horizon there stole a faint suffusing light growing from grey to lilac then less faint to crimson and to gold and the twittering in the woods told that the birds were waking

and she was wanting to be sleeping and byandby the pathway she had followed just round the bend was checked abruptly by a stream and for the life of her she could not toil back through that eerie dreary coppice past the goblin trees to find again the highroad

close byâoh heaven there was a hayrick one side of it all tumbled and into the sweetsmelling mound she crept for rest and warmthâand just as dawn was rising bright and golden and the twittering of the songbirds was swelling to fullthroated rapture she sank with a sigh into delicious slumber

austen lisle confound you sir what do you think of yourself sir do you know mr lisle its beginning to strike me that you are more than and worse than incorrigibleâyou are callous consider when you ought to be eating your heart out in the temple for briefs that wont come here you are betaking yourself with your rods and tackle your easel your bicycle and your kodak down into this drowsy dear old country dale instead of righteously grinding and groaning and drudging and despairingâenjoying life as though youd retired from a judgeship in all your pristine juvenility

here the fanner and the object of the indictment paused to refil and light his pipe then resumed the arraignment furthermore sir even here your perverted nature still asserts itself and you flout and mock remorse realty austen lisle after sitting into the small hours in the company of jovial graziers and yeomen fanners to say nothing of mine host of the come and welcome smoking much tobacco drinking mayhap too much punch joining in lusty choruses and thumping the dominoes till the feet and hearts of your boon companions were set adancing you should of rights be seeking your belated rest with a racking brain a heavy heart and a conscience bowed down by remorse

but shame upon you here you are feeling as fit as a threeyearold as chirpy as the dear little dicky birds who seem to be singing for your delectation absolutely glorying in the dissipation that has kept you out of doors to watch the golden lances of the morning rout the dark hosts of night the feathery green of the springtime boughs gleaming through the vanishing mists and the dawnlight kissing the bosom of the sleeping stream to gold austen youre past praying for

and out of the very gladness of his youthful heart and the exuberance of the joy of life at oneandtwenty as he strode along beside the stream he was longing to be whipping once again he broke into the chorus and his voiceâyoung strong and clear ârang clarionlike upon the spring morning air twas the sound of his horn brought me from my bed and the cry of his hounds that he ofttimes led and his view halloohoâwhoâwhoâoop  that would waken

oh

something started up from the mound beside the broken rick austen lisle started nearly into the stream

good lord what is it

and thenâwhy its a girl  

and so it was and a pretty girl to wit and instinctively he doffed his tweed hat with a cheerful goodmorning i hope i didnt startle you i am afraid i woke you up

yes you did said the girl with both hands j disentangling the hay from her hair but i am not angry with you on the contrary i am very much obliged ive beenâoh dear  she yawned lying here quite long enough

but excuse me stammered austenâof course its no affair of mineâbut it seems rather extraordinary to find a young lady at this time of the day

sleeping in a hayrickâi knowâi know but i assure you i never enjoyed a nap more in my life

but dont you think it was rather risky suppose for instance a tramp of the wrong sort were to come along

oh they wouldnt hurt me surely and ive nothing they could steal

then again the rats

oh

she sprang up with a scream and scuttled out of her improvised al fresco couch brushing her skirts and gathering them round her ankles

how long have you been lying there  he asked and she answered not very long

what brought you out so early

i might ask the same question

oh but iâi havent been to bed ive been sitting up with a friendâwho was rather poorly

this was literally true in respect of one grass farmer

how good of you i  she said goodmorningâ and thank you for not letting me oversleep myself

but i sayâwhich way are you going

she passed her hand across her brow with a puzzled air then asked which way are you

oh im off to my digs im staying at widow meldrums cottage in the village yonder

he pointed to the left along the towpath of the stream

really  she answered im going this way and she moved along to the right with a pleasant nod

he watched her curiously

how very strange he said quite a girl and quite a ladyâthough what brings her here at this time in the morning not particularly smart her boots were all dusty and grimed by jingo i believe that girls been up all night

and watching her he kept on wondering why had she had a row at home and flown out in a whirlwind of hysteria he watched her pause at the foot of the rustic bridge as if undecided which way to take

he called out i say miss and as if that decided her she stepped on to its planks to cross

and he knowing that within twentyfour hours one of those planks had loosened and had not been yet repaired hurried after her

here miss you musnt cross there its dangerous

but his following instead of delaying only hurried her she broke into a run

stop stop he shouted

too late she had stepped on to the loosened plankâher foot turned with it frantically she clutched at a twisted rail missed it stumbled then fell grasped with one hand the rough edge of the gangway

and with all her weight upon that feeble slipping grasp there she lay suspendedâwith terror dilated eyes gazing into the deep still waters which almost kissed her paling lips

confound the girl

his words were far less gallant than his action for just in time he dashed up and caught her ere her grip of the bridge planking had quite relaxed then gathering her up in his arms he carried her since she wanted to cross to the other bank

her heart still beating violently and her face still white she said in a trembling voice how brave and good of youâi might have been drowned  

didnt you hear me shout

yes i didnt know what you meant she answered in confusion feeling some diffidence in explaining to this good fellow who had saved her from at the least a dangerous ducking that she had mistaken his call for inquisitiveness if not impertinence

so acute indeed the distress of her confusion seemed that being a gentleman austen lisle said never mind alls well that ends well im glad it was no worse goodmorning

thanks again for saving most likely my life she answered and goodbye so rarely had she cause for being grateful that the very joy of emotion lit up her violet eyes beneath the sweeping lashes and austen lisle could never forget their light

goodbye he said and good luck

thanks once again she answered realising how she needed it

across the fields bright with summers sheen of green and gold she went the young mans eyes following her with softening gaze

extraordinary young person he muttered and extraordinarily goodlookingâwith those fine eyes of hers shes limpingâpoor little girl i suppose her ankle turned with that wretched plank

he was inclined to ask if he could be of further aid but she had clambered over the stile in the hedgegap and was gone

he had guessed right her ankle had twisted with the plank and with every step the pain of it grew more acute still she pressed onâthe sun came up strong and fierce and the roads gleamed aggressively and dustily and the hot pain throbbed within the dull numbness of the heavy swollen ankle

her eyes ached with the dust and glare these too parched her throat till she thought of dives in the post purple and fine linen period with even more compassion than she had felt for lazarus in the ante mortem and she was hungry not with the hearty healthy appetite whence spring pleasures of anticipation but with the faint sickly sinking yearning of endurance overtaxed

cruel sun to shine so unfeeling birds to sing so when i who love you so dearly am so sad she murmured piteously

out of the dusky white ceaselessly glaring road she turned into a winding lane sheltered by overhanging boughs through which the sun threw a waving lacework on the grassy path just round the bend she paused to glance across the gate of the sweetest cottage she had ever seen

a trim bright grass plot stretched from that gate to a verandah smothered with clustering roses honeysuckle and wistaria framing the latticed  casements blinking sleepily right up to the thatched roof along whose eaves a brood of fantail pigeons roocooed and struttedâto the right the trimmest fullest of box hedges and to the left a red brick wall covered with apricots peaches and other fruits made two sides of the quadrangle swarms of velvet bees humming around five beehives ranged at the foot of that righthand side

pansy leaned against that gate to wrench off the boot she could no longer bear and because it all looked so cool so sweet and so happy and she was so done up dusty and weary and in such soul racking pain she burst into a flood of tears and a prim little elderly lady surely made to match that prim little elderly house and who from the ambush of a summerhouse had been watching pansy came bustling out to the gate exclaiming why bless the child what is vexing you and why dont you put your boot on oh dear dear dear what a silly soul i am of course you cant youve sprained your ankle job wattlesâjob wattles bless the manâwhere is he

 ere oi be maam and a shockheaded bowlegged roundshouldered gardener dropped a cuttingsladen barrow with a thud

now job lend a hand here this poor young lady is in great pain you must help her to the house and i must bind up that poor swollen ankle oh dear dear shes going to faint

pansy coming to found herself lying on a chintzcovered couch in the cool and pleasant morningroom opening on to the lawn beside her a tray laden liberally with milk and honey and looking down she realised that her foot was swathed in fine linen rags soaked in oils comforting and cold

now child said the little good samaritan lady if youll tell me your destination when you have got rested job wattles shall put the ponychaise to and drive you

pansy reflected vaguely then answered quite frankly i havent any

but your home

i havent any

but what are you going to do

thank you so much now that i am rested i will be getting on my journeyi

your journey where are you goingâwhat are you seeking

a situation as governess shopgirl maidofallworkâanything i can sew and scrub and i know french and german and something of music

your parents

the lips quivered and it was left to the moistening eyes to tell that she had none

poor child  said the dear little old lady may i ask your name dear

pansy armadale she had answered not very distinctly before the second thought had flashed across her brain

pansy alma dale i like alma and the pansy is my favourite flower will you play something miss dale

pansy deeming it just as well not to correct the misunderstanding as to her name and only too glad of any opportunity to express her gratitude limped across to the piano

job wattles without ceased for a moment straining at the huge roller and listened to what seemed to him all the throstles in all the world joining in one bewildering burst of harmony and then to one inimitable solo by the rarest songster of them all and after that he wonderedâwas he dreaming or were whiterobed angels floating in the rainbow light flooding through the stained windows of the old church aisle calling him to lay down lifes bowed and stunted shell and join their song the music dying merged into the humming of the bees job was back on earth again bowed with the burden of his mortality

through the open windows floated on the summer sunshine madams voice within the cool and darkened room and she was saying child make this your home stay and make me happy with your music

and pansy stayed

and a year flew by

the best laid schemes o mice an men gang aft agley said bobbie bums who was something of a philospher and considerably more of a poet and elmer dring who was neither expressed himself to the like effect the old man at the lone house had only been tolerable as a client contributing largely to elmers practice particularly his sharp practice and the latter had always looked forward confidently to the time when having shuffled off the mortal coil the miser would have left his hoard to elmers manipulation

but if the old man was a trial the young man at the lone house was a terror such as elmer never yet before had met and hoped never to meet again first the lawyer tried bluffâbounce harvey darrell gripped him by the collar twisted him round slung him down the steps

elmer threatened all the terrors of the law darrell threatened the duckweedcovered pond

the lawyer relying on his craft flew to the armoury of his profession and found himself as an archer pitted against a marksman armed with a leeenfield

he had trespassed at his own risk the owner was within his legal right

title the onus probandi lay upon the trespasser not but what darrells title was unassailable open to all the world to challenge and when the newcomer scorning other aid appeared in person and in this strain defied all others particularly elmer dring dasborough held its breath astounded

its bench decided in his favour and elmer dring slunk back to his den a cowed and beaten man aghast with dread of what might happen should this aggressive whippersnapper happen on the clues to sundry transactions particularly certain matters of account and take the initiative dangerous in defence what would he be on the offensive

if i were a younger man you wouldnt call me names said elmer vindictively as harvey passed him on the court steps

no id flog you replied the other lighting a cigar and the new arrival at the lone house was certainly on the right way to bringing things to light from upstairs and downstairs from top  to bottom the lone house was ransacked every drawer door and lid flung or wrenched open every crook and cranny scoured and ransacked the very wainscots and panelling ripped open the flooring and the rafters torn up and down and rummaged

wondrous stories were afloat concerning the treasures and the mysteries brought to light losing nothing in the telling seachests clamped with rusty iron stowed with glittering gold doubloons and such like quaint old bullion precious stones whose lustre swathed in cobwebs and hidden in dark comers for decades suddenly dragged to light dazzled astounded beholders with their scintillating fire whole sheaves of notes moist and mildewed

the heart stood still the brain reeled the mouth watered to think of the wondrous treasuretrove young fortunatus was gathering in the dreary old ramshackle house needless to say these fired not only the imagination but cupidity of some

begging letters claims on the justice or the generosity of the heir arrived in sacks and in sacks went away as wastepaper the heir openly contracting with his butterman for same

it would be a shame to waste all that labourâa very great shame he laughed

one night three forms with masked faces and listslippered feet scaled the now trimmer wall and hedge smothering with difficulty remarks aroused by unsuspected meshes of barbed wire in the dark one blundered across a line of same and plunged into that stagnant fountain basin whereupon his language also would not admit of publication his comrades meantime prising a sash set all of a sudden a hundred bells aringing the trio turning to flee scuttled like rabbits through the darkâ save one pinned hurled to earth by a dun great dane with cavernous jaws and dragon fangs nor had his comrades gone far through the darkâbefore a blaze of light and a shot rang out

one fell a bullet in his shoulder and the other would have fallen before the crashing blow between the eyes but that his neck was gripped as in a vice while his captor in a short sharp voice called  out ive got this one sergeant clap the bracelets on him ha ha ha weve bagged the three glad i was at home when you called gentlemen do you know em sergeant

and the sergeant answered yes mr darrell my chap will go back for another seven years the other will be lucky if he gets off with ten this chaps a new hand

yes selp me govnor exclaimed the unfortunate shivering wretch darrell himself had collared selp me its the first time ive been on the crook

and bowled first ball 

shaking him like a rat he dragged him in his herculean grasp towards the open gate into the black shadow of the cedar

go on then take another chance he said get out of it and propelled by a heavy hand and a heavier boot the terrified tyro flew through the black night like a hare that had just slipped the hounds

let him go sir

i couldnt help it sergeant hes been in the pond and he was so slimy and above all he hummed so i couldnt hold him

dr esslin thought fit to adopt a neutral attitude in respect of the questions between dring and darrellâthese being no concern of his besides which there was his own claim to be satisfied and the result of the lawyers tactics offered no inducement to their adoption

furthermore he intimated to mr dring he was curiously interested in diagnosing harvey darrells case classifying his peculiar form of mental aberration as to the existence of which he entertained no doubt whatever probably regarding as one unequivocal symptom the circumstance that darrell had paid his bill for attendance on the late gideon abbs without demur

it is sometimes less expensive to be robbed than to kick against you know said darrell handing jane collins the doctors bill with cheque in full annexed and instructions to bring back a receipt

the greygreen eyes glanced furtively across at the square resolute farfrombadlooking face then shifted before the steely look of her new masters

everything about this man betokened strength of body mind and purpose the dark hair curling close the wellshaped forehead the alert movement of the long lithe limbs the keen dilated nostrils and the iron mouth

strangely enough jane collins had elected to stay on at the lone house she had reasoned that even in the event of certain discoveries being made it would perhaps be safer to be upon the spot while possibly being present she might avert or at all events retard those discoveries

thirdly she herself wanted to find out something it was certainly marvellous how thoroughly and systematically harvey darrell went to work in overhauling his new possessions the way he gripped matters of involved account and nosed out the ramifications of the old usurers affairs

the old man lent seven thousand pounds on a mortgage of flinderss farm where are the deeds jane could not tell that is she did not but she gave elmer dring warning that hounds had got the scent harvey darrell seeking farmer flinders was confronted with the release signed by gideon abbs and duly attested also with elmer drings receipt on the mortgagees behalf for the repaid money principal interest and costs

where was the money he searched the old mans ledgers then he sought elmer dring but when the hounds drew cover the fox was gone away

elmer dring had taken a holiday abroad

harvey darrell whistled softly and made notesâ and went on rummaging and so lighted upon an item of five thousand pounds very definitely earmarked he traced it through various entries invested on one date in consols later realised and reinvested in cable railway and other stock a while in goldfields then westralians and always growing and growing

armadaleâarmadale who was armadale he presently asked jane collins

i dont exactly know she answered repressing a start

i dont want to know exactly he answered tell me all you know about him

he was a friend of masters

ah master was a friend of hisâtook care of what he entrusted to him eh

perhaps so sir

the tray trembled in her hands

good his property securities eh jane do you know what he entrusted to him

how should i sir being no scholar and only a servant

but there are servants andâconfidential servants jane however i wouldnt have you tax your memory unduly just about as much lithia as whisky thanks hallo whats this

out of a bundle of papers written in fading ink there slipped the portrait of a very little girl neither the tumbling curls nor the smile quite faded out

what a cheerful kid whos this jane

iâi dont know sir

he turned it over

pansy i why of course pansy armadaleâ that was the girl they spoke of at the inquest the girl who helped in the kitchen the girl who went away no one quite knew when or where did you know jane

if youve read about the inquest youll know i swore i didnt

of course i know but im asking you never mind she looks as if shed grow up pretty did she

of course not snapped jane with more than ordinary animation dont pretty children always grow up plain

really i havent noticed were you a very nice child jane now i suppose this little person was part of the trust confided to the late unlamented gideon abbs how frequently the wolf is set to guard the lamb well wellâfor the present well let in re armadale rest

he lit a cigarâpaced the room that had been the misers sanctum sanctorum the centre of the maze the innermost mesh of the old spiders web

im going to refurnish he said when ive rearranged as for the old lumber here now ive overhauled most of it i think he paused

if its in the way id get somebody to clear it out for you sir

i daresay lots of folks would do that jane ramshackle as it is

and i daresay i could get a price for it sir better than youd get brokers always beat down gentlemen

do they then well beat up the brokers no we wont i have a better notion for the present ill stack it in the lumber attics

the pale thin lips writhed even more than usual yes sir said jane oh by the bye i was going to ask sir if youd let me have some little keepsake of my poor old master something that would remind me of him nothing of value sirâ the old wornout chair there that he dozed in so many years praps as youre going to clear the things out youd let me take it now sir

her new master pulling at the cigar in silence looked intently at janeâthen at the chairâthen again at jane

ill think it over he said

it isnt much of a favour for an old servant idâid give you a price for it more than youd get from the brokers sirâmore than its worth ill think it over he repeated recommencing his sentry go and as he turned his eye lit on one box as yet not rummaged a workbox in a moment he had snatched it up it was locked with a chisel he had ever at hand for such purposes he prised it open so swiftly so deftly that the womans sandy eyebrows knitted then he cried hallo whats here needles pins kerchief bobbins reels by jove another portrait a portrait of a girl by the lord harry i what a girl   and rapt and spellbound for some moments he regarded the photograph held in his palm

cheap somewhat crude the work of an itinerant camerabearer and beneath it was written in a girls hand a recent date andâpansy armadale

why he said in a tone of strange exultation this is the child grown to a girl almost a womanâ and such a woman the bud burst into bloom

yes hissed jane collins thats the girlâthe photographer gave her one for herself to let him take one forâhis gallery he called it

shes very beautiful

theres no telling by photographs snarled jane sometimes the plainest people come out pretty and bestlooking plain

youd make a good photo you didnt like the young lady janeâi shant require you any more tonight

i hated her said jane i wish for all they said id spoken out you wont forget the chair sir and she closed the door behind her

i will not forget the chair jane he said softly when the door had closed behind her

for some moments he sat rapt in contemplation of the portrait which after a while he placed in his breastpocket

i will by no means forget the chair he repeated rising and stooping over that article of furniture and opening a knife keen as a razor he sliced and slashed its cushion and its padding ripped out the horsehair and the wadding groping with both hands all over it and at last moved and  clutched something which rustled crisply

just what i thought he said come out

from within the bowels of the seat he withdrew a canvas bag dragged its mouth wide open and his eyes lit up for it was full of banknotes and treasury notes in neat wads

and then from amongst the wads tumbled a foolscap document folded otherwise and endorsed last will and testament of gideon abbs

bingo bingo here sir pansys fresh young voice rang clear and sweet across the lawn how dare you scamper across the flowerbeds what do you think little birds care for you sir i am surprised at your letting them make you look so ridiculous 

the broadchested brindled bulldog of ferocious aspect whom most persons held in awe lumbered across the lawn and snuffling snorting fawned at her feet

just like im and just like er meditated job wattles seated on the handle of his wheelbarrow and puffing at his cutty pipe for all his ugly looks its only ugly characters as need be afeared of im tramps and wagroms and suchlike she is too good and sweet to be afeared of anything or anybody brute or human

quite right job wattlesâquite right said miss nepean equipped in sun hat garden gloves and all the panoply of horticulture clipping a boxhedge as prim and trim as herself

it was job wattless habit to think aloud and hers to enter into conversation he often thus unconsciously commenced

summer had come again but pansy so far from having departed had become to all appearance a more permanent fixture at homecroft

whatever should we do without her

lardy marm thats what i often thinks of cause sure enough we cant expect her to stop with us much longer

good gracious man what nonsense youre talking what do you mean the prim little old lady with the silver hair snapped looking as severe as with her was possible through her goldrimmed glasses

and job answered why lor bless yer marm lookee at them ripe red apples over the orchard hedge dye expect them aint goin to be gathered or if they aint gathered the birds wont be pickin at em

these here is quiet parts with few folks about and them mostly quiet uns but whenever i drives you and miss pansy whether to church on sundays or into conington on marketdays aint all the young fellows eyes afollowing our chaise and if some of the young chaps in church was to pay as much attention to the parson as they do to miss pansys pretty picture of a face it would be better for their peace of mind

tut tut job wattlesâmiss pansy is far too sensible to think of such nonsense

in course marm said job wattles subsiding girls at her age generally is

and as he trundled his barrow along the path nannie nepean resuming active clipclipping mused i suppose jobs rightâ he generally is drat the man and i shall have to make up my mind to lose my dearie some day and for the moment a chill fell on her gentle heartâjust such a chill as might have fallen had she seen that face peering across her garden wicket the face of a seedy elderly somewhat obese individual regarding intently the girl in muslin scolding the bulldog

surely it cant be the girlâno such luck for me and yetâwhy yes theres no other face in the world like the one shaded by that summer hat its pansyâpansy and im within sight and scent of clover after all

pansyâpansy 

why yes the call of the little old lady clipping the hedge confirmed itâand he chuckled audibly unheeded by the girl who skipped across the green to her dear benefactress

not so by bingo the brindled bull who swirling quickly round and catching a glimpse of the flabby face that in an instant disappeared stampeded madly towards the wicket over lawn flowerbeds and all and in spite of the remonstrances of his two divinities dashed across and flung himself against the wicket baying yelping snorting snarling furiously clamouring as plainly as canine expression would permit let me get at himâlet me tear him limb from limb 

but elmer dring had shuffled along the grassy lane and round the bend then until at last well screened by the flowering dogrose clambered hawthorn he paused to take stockâand notes

brute of a dog  he mumbled  i loathe dogsâ theyre always so beastly suspicious of me id like to strangle that one no no that would involve considerable risk but id like to just lure him to friendship with a nice savoury morsel wrapped round a dose of prussic acid but what a bit of luck to happen on that girl

and by such a fluke after all the pains and trouble ive taken all in vain now to find out all about her and all about the elderly party that little old woman with the silver hair and the gold glasses seems to me to suggest wealthâwealth that very possibly pansy has the handling of and that if she has i must handle tooâor else theres going to be bad luck for pansy

he made his way along the lanes to a cluster of red tiled and thatched roofs and to one quaint old house in the midst of them in front of which swung and creaked the sign of the jolly haymakers he entered the sanded floored taproom and called for a mug of ale

he was accorded the timehonoured rustic greeting that is to say each member of the company joining in the general chorus of goodmarn zur  and forthwith emptying his mug replaced it with an eloquent thump upon the ringstained trestle table the replenishing of these mugs was an infallible avenue to conversation and ere long elmer dring had brought that conversation round to the cottage and occupants

oh ay they knawed homecroft miss nepeans place and her too bless her heart and the company set off each in turn with some anecdote illustrating the little old maids goodness of heart and gentleness alike to human and to bruteâa sick child saved by badlyneeded nourishment a struggling debtor set on his legs an ailing woman nursed back to life a despairing wrongdoer given pardon and another chance each and all had some such tale to tell of her

and elmer dring subtly leading the conversation to means those present testified abundantly to her vast fortune her gorgeous plate her priceless jewels for all she lived so simple and secluded a life why squire himself had declared in public that she gave in charity more than he expended in the upkeep of the hall per annum

casual questions as to her household elicited information as to job wattles a good sort but mazin bigoted against getting drunk martha the cook who scolded and worshipped her mistress julia the parlourmaid a bouncing girl and miss dale who had arrived at homecroft just a year agoânone knew whenceâand whom nannie nepean treated as a child of her own and no wonder since what a hangel she were

dale what a transparent incognito pansy had adopted elmer chuckled in his sleeve

between the lights that evening lying in wait he encountered her gathering wild flowers in that grassy leafy lane

she stood still when accosted deeming it was some tramp who had seen better days but when he called her by her name the rose tint fled from her cheeks

who are you and what can i do for you she asked

youll have to do a lot he answered or else theres a bad time coming you know who i am 

she scanned him intently

no no that seedy shabby flabby old man could not be the once sleek unctuous venerable elmer dring but as if in answer to her unspoken expostulation he snarled im elmer dring

im so sorry she faltered and he snarled daresay you areâin lots of ways

what can i do for you asked pansy feeling that a black cloud had suddenly obscured the sky a little while ago so blue

lots he answered im thinking which ways best theres so many you might for instance introduce me at homecroft as your dear longlost father

but you are not pansy replied joyfully

and he went on with a glare i hear you pay all the accounts you might get me one of the old girls cheques already signedâ rest of it blank for preference

her eyes dilated as she listened and he continued then again i hear the old girls got no end of jewellery well nothing would be easier than for you to pass out a parcel of it on the qt whyâ whats the matter

i dont know pansy exclaimed white and palpitating it seems to me i must be dreamingâ it cant be the real elmer dring whos talking to me time does work lots of changes in peoples looks their surroundings their circumstances but the elmer dring of old could never have said the things you are saying

for the old unctuousness had imposed on pansy too

dont be a little fool he answered youve got to do as i tell you else back you go to dassborough

no no she answered i wontâthey shant take me miss nepean wont let them 

she cant stop them he said the police and the magistrate wont care for her

but the police and magistrates are only menâ mostly kind men and theyd never be so cruel as to make me leave a dear sweet friend like her to go back to him

to him he looked at her in mute surprise was it possible she had not heard was this world that is so small still so wide

after all this was just one of its quaint comers where one might never hear of things happening at ones elbow with which the rest of the world might be ringing and as if in confirmation she asked did gideon abbs send you in quest of me

gideon abbs is inâwell never mind whereâ hes dead

dead her face blanched unlovely in his life as she had found him her heart was tender and she was young and youth always whispers deaths name when and how did he die

he was stabbed to deathâan hour or so before you left the lone house as if you didnt know  and he leered at her as the devil might leer when complimenting one of his own on clever workmanship

stabbed the night i left the house murdered 

yes with just such a weapon as that he charged you with stealingâa weapon that was missing just before they missed you ive held my tongue so far on that point but ive only got to say the word âremember that pansy and now cant you get me a blank cheque signed by the old woman cant you pass out some of those jewels she keeps locked up and never looks at

we could even get dummies made like em and the change might never be dreamed of im desperate pansy youve got to be desperate too

and indeed she was hers was the desperation of despair

you wicked wicked man she cried her ordinarily gentle eyes blazing like sapphires you are worse than the murderer of gideon abbs it was only his body that was killedâyou would slay my soul stand backâlet me go 

for he had seized her wrist a satyr gleam in his eyes a satyr grin wreathing his thick lipsâher words had thrilled him with an exultant thought yes she was in his thrall soul and bodyâto defile and to destroy just as he would

a moment she struggled and writhed then raising the other hand slashed him across the face with the dogwhip she carried and swiftly placing the handle to her lips blew the whistle

you jezebel ill pay you out in full you shall swing for this  he hissedâthen slunk away for through the hedgerow came the sound of stentorian snuffing and snorting and a whine deepening into a bay in answer to that signal of her peril

and as the brindled bulldog gambolled down the bank into the lane elmer turned out of it

mr harvey darrell had unmistakably stirred things up at dassborough to begin with the lone house was far less lonesome its gardens had ceased suggesting to the beholder wildernesses barren of all save weeds and had begun to justify their name

the old windows opaque with grime and long past cleaning had been bodily removed and in their places bright clean ones beamed smiled from ear to ear or rather curtain to curtainâruthless war had been made upon the weeds that choked even the stone doorsteps the only weeds the new owner could tolerate he declared with a smile were his incomparable cigars

the old stabling and coachhouse past redemption had been cleared away a garage and new stable were built upon their site and the place began to look as spick and span as its owner

but though darrell got rid of the weeds the cobwebs and the grime one unprepossessing feature of the old place remainedânamely jane collins and dassborough wondered why wouldnt or couldnt its owner get rid of her whatever the reason the fact remainedâthat she remained still moving to and fro with stealthy step her fishy eyes slily suspiciously scanning all and sundry from beneath the lowering colourless brows

that she should voluntarily stay was as much a mystery as that darrell voluntarily retained her for other servants had been engagedâa bouncing buxom cook a prim precise neat parlourmaid a smart young chauffeur and groom and a gardener none of whom acknowledged any fealty to jane collins and all of whom reciprocated her distrust and dislike

probably though it suited her purpose to remain there jane was as much surprised as anyone at being allowed to do so

he wants to pump meâthats one reason she soliloquised in selfcommunion but thats not the only reason

if not the only it certainly was one reason for her new master daily plied her with questions using his own discretion as to what reliance he placed upon her answers questions mainly relating to her late master but more particularly to her late masters ward in whom he evinced peculiar interestâ infinitely more interest than in the lady neighbours who manifested so lively a concern in him and so openly expressed compassion for his solitude

the portrait of pansy in the daintiest procurable of frames was placed upon the smart new overmantel and harvey darrell pacing the now bright luxuriouslyfurnished morningroom would halt and apostrophise it

you dainty dear i know youre just as good and sweet as you are beautiful jane did you know her mother

yes she halfspat halfhissed out the word oho i see pansy inherited your hatred and her father you knew him

scarcely scarcely same as i knew her master knew them both before he came to live here years gone by

he brought pansy here five years agoâfrom goodness knows where

so ive heard master

youve heard you knowâyou came here with her lets seeâfrom where

i came from my last place as ive told you oh yes from the northâmistress and master dead also all their friends and relations i see you destroy clues as you go its a good idea jane collins if you would tell me why pansy went and where she went id make it worth your while

ive told you a dozen times i dont know she hated me too much to tell me

feared you i suppose a girl with eyes like that doesnt know what hate isânot but what ill swear she had cause to do you know ive sometimes wondered whether she ever left this place that was one reason why i cleared the fishpond and had the cellar flooring turned up

but found nothing hed never let meâi mean âwhat did you think youd find there

possibly her remains ifâas you aptly intimated âgideon abbs had let you wreak your hate jane collins but i tell you she went right enough  cried the woman goaded to wrath because this man like all the rest was crazy where that girl was in question though he had only seen her picture esslin was right all men were mad on some point she went to save her neck after what shed done and if theyd only have let me speak out at the inquest the country would have been scourged high and low and shed have been brought back to the gallows

youd have liked that jane i can imagine your genial smile watching that girl crouching in the dock while the cute counsel for the prosecution link by link forged and interlinked and riveted a chain of circumstantial evidence by which theyd drag her within the shadow of the crossbeam where the noose dangles

he little guessed what realisation of imagination the future held in its lap

you can go jane collins goodnight

goodnight master she said softly and when outside the door she hissed beneath her breath goodnight you devil i think i hate you worse than herâyou know so much 

she paused crept back crouched peered through the keyhole click the door flew open

have you lost something jane

no sir but i thought id dropped a hairpin goodnight master

once again the door was closed with the escutcheon covering the keyhole and harvey darrell seated in his easychair and lighting another cigar mused thoughtfully jane youll have to goâwhen ive quite pumped you dry people like you arent safe aboutâ especially having regard to the modern facilities for obtaining poison then from a cellaret that he religiously kept locked he drew a tantalus and syphon and mixed himself a drink after which resettling himself in the easychair he withdrew from his pocket and carefully perused the document endorsed last will and testament of gideon abbs

although harvey darrell scarce ever went to bed before the small hours he as seldom remained there long after them and on this particular morning he was up with the lark before any of his household had himself saddled his cob and been for a rousing gallop before the postman had arrived with the mornings letters

indeed as frequently happened he met the postman at the corner of the road the lone house fronted and obligingly saved the man a bit of his journey by taking them

and scanning the mornings mail intently he noted one addressed to jane collins in a hand he recognised and a little later in his bathroom he steamed open and perused that letter which read as follows nature of the plant she would not help to workâ notwithstanding elmers threats

harvey was certain he had threatened her and bit by bit he wrung from him the nature of those threats

what was his game elmer was puzzled to guess for the present at all events darrell seemed to contemplate no hostile steps in respect of the mortgage moneys he had misappropriated

elmer was convinced that he was a thoughtreader for his next words answered the unspoken question racking elmers brain

look hereâi hold you in the hollow of my hand a word from me means for youâportland i dont propose to speak that word so long as you aid me in a little scheme i have in hand i might even see my way to wipe that awkward matter off the slate it all depends on how you work with me and for me

but make one move against meâand elmer dring solicitor churchwarden sidesman pillar and pattern of respectability takes a still longer holidayâone that may last seven years and he may spend most of it inhaling the channel breezes in the vicinity of portland bill in the company of the scum of the earth clad like himself in an unbecoming uniform plentifully sprinkled with broad arrows

job wattless prophecy had come to pass at last that smart young chap had come to court miss pansy

there was no mistaking his mission whatever else might be vague about himâas for instance his occupation his origin his source of income

by some this mr darrell was supposed to be an actor chap out of employment others inclined to the opinion that he was one of them there writing chaps in quest of quiet anyway he was unanimously voted a very affable gentleman and the village loafers held him in high estimation as good for a quart at any time

but for all his affability the new visitor to the village kept himself to himself and was perfectly capable of resenting any attempt to intrude upon his reserve as was made speedily apparent when one goodfornothing loafer the bully and the terror of the village animated partly by impertinent curiosity and partly by chronic thirst endeavoured to draw him out and resented the difficulty he experienced in doing so

theres a bet of half a gallon on about you maister he said with a jocular familiarity accosting mr darrell while tossing coppers to the children he had been regarding dumplings sudden inclination to steeplechasing

for harvey darrell plied his suit boldly openly vehemently it was far from difficult to fall in love with pansy so far his plan worked very smoothly the very picture of her attracted himâhad awakened strange thoughts and fancies in him

when he met her face to face looked in those violet eyes listened to the music of her velvet voice all his being thrilled with a yearning to clasp the girls form close to his heart to run kisses on those heavenly lips he burned with just such a passion for her as that bedouin whose lovesong he had sung to her in the summer twilight

strangely enough pansy herself seemed to see nothing dream nothing of the fiery love encompassing her the laughing comments of the wise women of the village seemed only to puzzle her nannie nepean gently questioning her ceased in quiet amazement wondering to herself can it be that love has not yet awakened in her heart for him that she even does not guess this young man loves her madly

harvey darrell too began to ask himself those questions and with the quick decision of his nature resolved that she should answer them  that her answer should be negative he could not would not dream

and so one summer night when they had left off playing and singing and he had taken leave of his hostess he said quietly but with much meaning in his voice pansy for almost from the first he had called her by that name walk with me to the wicket i want to speak to you

nannie nepean old maid as she was guessed what he wanted to say and gently throwing a silk wrap round pansys shoulders kissed her forehead

they went out into the moonlight that touched the dewy lawn to diamonds out into the sweet summer night air that kissing the fair oval face toyed with the ringlets on her forehead her eyes glistened and she sighed with rapture born of the beauty of the summer night the fragrance of the roses gleaming from their bushes through the moonlit dusk from the woods afar came on the nights sweet breath the nightingales melodious notes

pansy said harvey darrell i am going to tell you something something that im almost sure you knowâthat you must have known ever since i first looked in your eyes

as he spoke he halted she drew back a step watching the moonlight glittering in his deepset eyesânoting the heave of his breast

what is it she whispered almost afraid i love you he answered madlyâpassionately i loved you as i have never loved a girl  beforeâshall never love again tell me that you love me tooâthat you will be mine for ever and a day comeâcome let me kiss you and clasp you in my arms

but she drew back swiftly and stood there trembling

ohâno no she answered with a deep quick indrawn breath i never knewânever dreamed anything of this but now i know and understandâ what i couldnt understand before oh mr darrellâimâim very sorryâim afraid ive been to blame 

sorryâto blame why tell me what you mean

his voice was slow hoarse and harsh

i mean that i liked you ever so as a friend but nothing elseânot as you mean

but you dont knowâyou cant tellâall that will come in timeâshall comeâmust come he replied impetuously almost fiercely at the first sign j of the wavering of a house of cards he had raised so high so carefully

but she repeated no no it cant be i couldnt love you i couldnt come to care for you like that believe me im very sorryâbut its best to speak right out for your own sake

she might have said more but her voice faltered and a strange vague chill alarm spread over her as there in the cold moonlight she watched his face âand the change in it for now it was not like the the same mans face his lips were set hard in a sinister snarl his brows met in a menacing frown his eyes glittered with a cold and cruel light his nostrils were dilated and his breast heaved with the gasps that told of a hell of fury seething bubbling in the cauldron of his heart

it was as though her words had changed the nature of the manâthe man himself and his voice too was no longer the voice of love but the voice of menaceâfierce unrelenting

take care take care he grated you dont know what you are sayingâyou dont know what youre doing come here

roughly rudely he clapped an iron hand upon her wrist and held it in his grip

and she trembling in heart and in every limb quailed before the vehement rancour of his regard even as a timorous dove in the thrall of the rattlesnakes doomglittering eyes

listen   he said until just now i loved youâ now i love and hate you i wanted you to love me âthat was part of the plan though not an essential part but the life and soul the beginning and the end the root and branch of my plan was to make you mineâand that remains you are going to be mineâdo you hear that girl mine at all hazardsâ all risksâall costs 

no no she said struggling to free herself from his grip it cant beâit will never be 

but i swear it shall be do you know who i am

i only know mr darrell that you are quite different from what i thought you until just now i thought you gentle kind and braveâbut now i find you are brutal cowardly and more a ruffian than a gentleman let me goâyou are paining meâhow dare you sir

your cheeks are like ice or has anything alarmed you dearie tell me

the girl hiding her head on the shoulder of the dearest friend that she remembered remained for some time silent then she answered in a weary voice mr darrell has asked me to marry him dear

well hasnt my little girl been guessing that was coming

oh no no no she answered i never dreamed of it

what surelyâsurely my old eyes are not keener than your beautiful young ones pansy why everyones been seeing itâeven job wattles and is my darling going to leave me

oh no no  she answered clinging to her and nestling to her like a frightened bird beneath its mothers wing i never want to leave youânever âneverânever 

why then my dear you shant heaven knows i dont want to lose youâive already been crying at the thought of it weve been so happy havent we

its all happiness hereâalways said pansy peace and calm andâsafety

safety why child youre overstrung youre trembling like a leaf tell me how did mr darrel take his refusal i daresay it was a shock to the poor fellow but ive no doubt he was as gentle as he was sorrowful pansy was it wise to throw away that young mans loveâperhaps the very first love of his heart have you thought how sad and lonely you may have left his lifeâthat whatever he may achieve there may always be amongst the roses one rankling thorn one empty chair in the home of his heart and have you thought too dear of your own future

are you certain that you dont love him and that in the aftertime you may not sigh for the very boon which he just now has laid at your feet i hope dear you were tender with him i am sure you would be

perhaps while she spoke her mind was straying back along the vista of the bygone years when someone else laid the treasure of a lads first love at the feet of another maid just as sweet and fair as pansyâthen a very young maid now an old maid thought perhaps of a soldiers grave marked with a tiny cross

then after a pause she said stroking the silky tresses tell me pansy

and pansy answered he was angry

angry hoity toity the presumption of the man i could scarcely have believed it of him i but to tell the truth i dont think young mens i manners grow nicer as the years roll on

angry indeed that was nannie nepeans last thought before she sank to sleep that nightâher waking thought next morning and when pansy came  into breakfast paler still and with that strange look of terror that the dear old lady could not comprehend in her eyes miss nepean determined to give that young man a piece of her mind if he indulged in any hectoring nonsense with her dear one

and when that evening job wattles announced mr darrell was waiting at the wicket and would miss pansy speak to him for a moment nannie nepean was herself for interviewing him but that pansy with strange insistence would not hear of it and flitted out herself across the lawn to where her menacing suitor waited

i have come for my answer he said brusquely yes or no

i gave you my answer last night she said cant you let it rest at that cant we be as we were as i would like again to beâfriends 

friends he answered with a harsh mocking grating laugh you never had a foe so deadly as youll find me if you try to thwart my plan once more your answerâyes or no

no she answered and turned and fled

then god help you  he whispered bringing his clenched fist down upon the gate

what ailed the dog that he bayed so desperately in the middle of the nightâtugging frantically at his chain was it at the moon or at the shadow it castâthe shadow of elmer dring digging with something in the flowerbed inside the gate and burying and covering with his hands the thing with which he had dug the hole

well indeed the world had gone with austen lisle possibly all the better because he never worried how it wentâwhen things were bad thanking his stars they were no worse

of course there was grit in the man but somehow while many of his compeers even better endowed with brains toiled and moiled and feverishly plucked at fortunes skirts she just like her sex turned from them coldly to beam on this breezy youngster who chaffed her and while the more serious friends of his youth were poring day by day over precedents in the temple library or briefless and disconsolate haunting the law courts corridors were eating their hearts out plump chirpy solicitors were tripping up mr lisles staircase with briefs as plump and chirpy marked with fat fees genial kcs got quite used to meeting him in consultation and learned judges to his appearance in their courts

people had already marked him for a rising man  the weedy youth who officiated as his clerk had no longer leisure to gloat over lurid literature and had  begun to give himself airs and take an interest in the fluctuations of the income tax

late one night austen having dined in the hall sat somewhat late in chambers reading briefs which had reached him for the ensuing assizes for on the morrow he was to be away again on circuit one of these strangely interested him

and long after he had perused and put aside the rest he sat turning over slowly again and again the sheets of this brief for the crown on the prosecution of one pansy armadale who had been committed for trial at the dunchester assizes for the murder of one gideon abbs late of dassborough

for that eminent silk his leader had informed austen lisle that afternoon that very possibly he would be occupied in a more important civil action involving not a mere life but a huge sum of money and that lisle might have to undertake the whole burden of the case for the treasury

it looks bad against her he muttered puffing a big cloud from his briar root i cant make out how they came to let her get awayâwhy the hue and cry wasnt raised immediately i shouldnt wonder if the court has something to say to this mr dring for not mentioning at the inquest the little incident of the missing dagger

according to his depositions he went away shortly afterwards for his health and i suppose she being a mere girl and as he says in his depositions a girl he had regarded with a semipaternal interest he tried not to think of and not to remember damaging facts for quite a girl she is even still poor little wretchâfatherless and motherless too gad i hope rowntree wont leave this case to me i shant like hanging this child and on this brief it looks as though shell hang

stay this doctors deposition seems rather peculiar deponent had for some time after close observation entertained doubts as to prisoners mental condition had detected in particular symtoms of a predisposition of kleptomania um at times had noticed fitful outbursts of passion âwhich might or might not have been the outward and visible signs of inward homicidal tendency rather farfetched that onlyâwait a minute this chappie too entertained a most friendly regard for the prisoner i think i see isnt it possible that these two old gentlemen having known this girlâ possibly a prepossessing girlâfor some years past should be straining every nerve to let her down lightly well if the worst comes to the worst on my reading of this brief i shall be inclined to let it go at that

but how on earth came that jury to return an open verdict in the face of that girls disappearance of course the missing weapon wasnt mentioned or rather all mention of it was suppressed i should not be surprised to find that this girls very pretty that tells with juries theres evidently something attractive about her from the way that old lady her present employerâoh no i see she wont have that descriptionâher friend she calls herselfâfrom the way she sticks to her eighteen tut tut what a child

still austen lisle youve got to remember youre a lawyer not a sentimentalist the law sir the law remember the logic of the law the rigours of the lawâand whether that girls pretty or plain whether shes sweet or sour youre going toâto play light with soft gloves no knockout this time sir i wonder where that wretched dagger went to that was the tool that did the work whosoevers the handâand the hand that plied it secreted itâi wonder where

he retied the brief paced his chambers to and fro still thinking of that girl so young in plight so parlous just about the age of that other girl ah that was a pleasanter subject to think of altogether oh the sweet memory bringing back the golden glint of the early sunshine the crisp hayscented morning air

would he ever forget those violet eyes with their long sweeping lashes and the rare red lips of her he called his dreamgirl

austen lisleâausten lisle youre a colossal fraud you a brainy lawyer blest with abundance of the saving grace of common sense a lucid and relentless logician tut tut jehu junior of vanity fair didnt know the man he was writing about you are nothing but a downright sentimental simpleton you ought to abandon the bar and all its works and let your hair grow long and write erotic drivel for the magazines 

he seized a hat and coat banged his oak behind him swiftly descended the staircase and made his way out to fleet streetâwhere he hailed a taxicab to seek in the club smokingroom refuge from that fatal predisposition to romance

it was so to speak the height of the season at dunchester that is to say the summer assizes were on as also the flower show and the festival the two latter being shrewdly annually arranged to synchronise with the first

and the grey old cathedral city relic of mediãval england was brightened up with floral waggonloads carriages and cars bearing bevies of beauty visitors in holiday attire the high sheriff in his magnificence his trumpeters furnishing the crowning note of bravery and the judges in scarlet and ermine come to determine grave issues and adjust the scales of liberty and duranceâlife and death

but on this momentous summer day all the interest of all the city was withdrawn awhile from the festival of song that formed one facet of the citys fame from the yeomanry inspection and ball even from the flower show and centred in the old shire hall wherein the county assizes were being heldâand a vaster crowd surged round the doors of the public entrance than had last night been gathered at those of the theatre royal albeit a london constellation were shining there

for at the shire hall they were giving a matinee performance of a human tragedy not particularly originalâas old as the hills as love and hate as the branding of cain the exacting of an eye for an eye and blood for blood and the great ladies of the countryside had clamoured and schemed for reserved seats on the bench far more vehemently than for stalls and boxes at the opposition show where they were anathematising the bad luck of their mornings performance clashing with the sensational murder trial

amid the excitement of the crowd the high sheriffs car dashed up a fanfare of the trumpets the cheers of the crowd and the making way for his majestys judges and their train and within the packed court later when the ushers shouted silence silence   that throng rose and the man in the scarlet gown with an ermine cope a grey wig and a yellow face took his seat and they called for the players to begin that human tragedy which they named the king against pansy armadale

harvey darrell smartly groomed imperturbable was there in the court well unconcernedly flicking the dust from his immaculate patent leather shoesâ and no little interest was shown in the smart young heir of the murdered miser

elmer dring was there looking all the older and none the better folks said for his mysterious illness and mysterious absence judex esslin was there with his white face his black eyes and his black hair beginning to streak with grey they looked hard at him too for it was whispered that his evidence might save the prisoners neck

jane collins was thereâher greenish eyes and pale moist lips working and writhing even more restlessly than ever

austen lisle was there particular interest was manifested in him because mr rowntree kc was not there and possibly it was this young man who would fix the rope on the young womans neck folks said

and nannie nepean was there her eyes bright with much crying job wattles beside her each adjuring the other to bear up and not give wayâ and each gazing with anguished eyes at a square pew in the centre of that crowded court as yet empty

there was a strained hush of agonising suspense then came the sound of heavy footsteps the slithering of lighter ones and two burly men in uniform entered up a stairway into that space which seemed so like a pew and was the felons dock

and between them followed by a hardfaced wardress a mere slip of a girl looking so slight so small and oh so pale a halfsigh halfmurmur of pity rose like the rustling of a breeze from all around that sea of faces and nannie nepean only halfchecked a short sharp cry my darling

upon the girls neck fell a mass of wavy light brown hair and the longlashed darkringed eyes was identified as the one bought by gideon abbs at the sale of captain burbidges effectsâas the one he on the night of the murder accused the prisoner of stealing

people began to whisper that though the girl was pretty to look at she was evidently an accomplished liar and thief concealing under that innocent and mild demeanour a world of cruel callous wickedness

austen lisle put judex esslin in the box and judex esslin was in excelsis for led on gently from stage to stage instead of as usual being baulked and controverted at every step he propounded and dilated upon his theory at least he would have done so and have demonstrated to his own satisfaction if not that of the court and jury the universatility of insanity and that absolutely the socalled abnormal was really in that particular respect the normal only that austen lisle cleverly kept him to one track letting him gallop along that one at his willâthe individual case of pansy armadale

oh yes yes he had always been sure of the existence of mental aberration in her case she had told him of the instinctive impulse to fall over when looking from a dizzy height to do certain things because of their very inherent absurdity and so on and out of the most trivial circumstances he constructed his pessimistic theory

not that it was looked upon in this instance as the doctrine of despair because even pansys counsel recognising how securely the chains of circumstantial evidence were being forged in fetters for her perceived in this harebrained doctors theory a loophole in the event of all others being shut

nannie nepean in the impatience of common sense exclaimed aloud tut tut who ever heard such nonsense the girls as sane as i am its the man himself whos mad 

the usher of the court said sternly silence

and job wattles mumbled lardy marm dont ee go an spoil her chances

god forbid the dear old lady cried but i knowâand you knowâthat my darlings innocent and we know she wouldnt save even her life by that selfbranding and malingering lie

this closed the case for the crown then pansys counsel rose with his speech for the defence

she had no witnesses to callâcould call no witnesses  all she could say and swear was that she was innocent and he reminded thejury that by the law everyone not proved to be guilty must be presumed innocent and he submitted that guilt though it might have been surmised had not yet been strictly proved against her

true it had been proved that the murdered man had treated her with harshness that his whole being was absorbed in an avarice that made him suspect humanity at large of rank dishonesty

where circumstantial evidence was relied upon it was the practice to seek the motive

what was the alleged motive in this girls case the deceased had been unkind to her had illtreated her had alleged that she had robbed him  but that man it had been proved was unkind to everyoneâ suspected everyone charged everyone with robbing him

even assuming that a prey to some uncontrollable impulse this mere girl did pilfer that dangerous baubleâto be a thief was not necessarily to be a murderer as to the presence of mammalian blood it was a weapon constructed to kill or wound might it not have been put to the use for which it was intended even before gideon abbs acquired it

and then was there not another theory possible was it not possible that the real murderer anxious to avert suspicion from himself or herself had planted that weapon where it was found to throw the sleuthhounds of justice off their scent if the defence could not prove that that was so the prosecution at all events had not proved it was not so

a terrible responsibility was upon them a human life was in their hands by giving the prisoner so youthful so desolate so helpless the benefit of the doubt they would at all events spare themselves one harrowing and haunting reflectionâthat they had without absolute irrefutable proof run the risk even the remote risk of wrongly sacrificing a fellowcreatures lifeâa life called into being by the heavenly father of them all

and the learned counsel resumed his seat convinced that he had done the best possible with the worst possible material

then the counsel for the crown rose for the reply

under ordinary circumstances it is doubtful whether austen lisle would have availed himself of this right but that in truth he meant if possible to save the child he commenced by telling the jury that the advocates career even in the case of the most eminent ornaments of the profession of which he was so humble a member had always this alloyâthat he had to stand in the position he that day was by duty compelled to occupy that of piecing together the fragments that made up the picture of an evil deed committed heaven knew no man amongst them more sincerely pitied and deplored than he the position of the unhappy girl on trial for her life before them on trial for that life of which as yet she merely lingered on the threshold

they had heard the evidence it was unnecessary for him to dilate upon or even further recapitulate it one portion of it however he would commend to their most profound considerationâthe evidence of dr judex esslin and having regard to the testimony that had been given by others to the general disposition of the prisoner her amiability her tenderness to the suffering even to the lower brute creation he would not deny that the theory that she was not herself when she struck the fatal blow was quite consonant with the other aspects of the caseâand with this he would leave the issue in their hands praying that a higher power would aid them to their duty

once again as he uttered the closing words of his reply those eyes were raised and met his own

and strangely enough in them despite his training despite his reasoning despite the chain of evidence that he himself had forged and riveted he seemed to see in them the clear effulgent light of truth and innocence

then the judge summed up with much of the usual judicial platitude if they believed the evidence of the prosecution they would find the prisoner guilty if they did not believe it they would find her innocent and then being a man as well as a judge and to boot the father of girls of about her age and perchance he too reading in her eyes something that austen lisle had read in them the judge laid stress upon the one alternativeâeven assuming that they found her hand dealt the fatal blow

and with that intimation he left them to consider their verdict

the jury quitted the box the judge the bench the prisoner the dock and there ensued perhaps the worst quarter of an hour of allâthe buzz of tongues released all asking all answering one question what would the verdict be

job wattles trembling like a leaf quavered oh marm what will we do without our sweet miss pansy god that they were only as sure as i am that she is innocentâwhat shall we do  what shall we do

he knows he will sustain both her and us and life is after all only a series of farewells the dear old lady answered then very quietly and not all alone she sobbed in her handkerchief

after a while of a sudden that murmur of many voices was stilled by another sound the tramp and shuffling of twelve mens feet and the jury filed again into the box the judge reentered and resumed his seat

the girl came back into the dock and faced the twelve good men and true

harvey darrell riveting his gaze upon her from the well thought how like a vision from heaven she seemed

the clerk of arraigns rising in his place in a clear voice demanded gentlemen of the jury are you agreed upon your verdict

and the foreman said we are

what say you gentlemen of the jury do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty

and every breath was held in one great hush

we find said the foreman of the jury the prisoner guilty of the murder of gideon abbs but that she was not at the time responsible for her actions

a sigh of relief rustled through the court one an eerie dreary place it was of long superlatively clean corridors now silent and empty anon threaded by strange processions of women with wild eyesâthen silent and deserted again corridors opening with much clanking and clanging of bolts and keys into wards with shiny floors across which strange creatures flitted chattering and mumbling

outside the building trim gardens and grass plots wherein gods plants and flowers flourished and blossomed to cheer his smitten creatures made in his image beyondâthe belting wall with spikes

here she lived no no passed her existence not that she was doomed to solitude there were times she wished she had beenâbut she had companionship in most things strange types all sad mostly terrible pansy appalled found surrounding her

for instance every morning she exercised with on her right a young person who had strangled her child the father of that child who had left both babe and mother to the desperation of despair was meantime moving in the most select circles untrammelled by any rules unlimited by any spiked walls and on her left a woman who had smashed her mistresss head in with a hammer

to occupy her mind pansy was given a little garden plot to cultivate in cooperation with an old lady who had dropped her grandchildren down a well and there was one who used at irregular intervals to break the monotony of the regulation without discrimination but with deadly determination and enlivening the knitting circles of an afternoon by clutching the wardress in attendance by the throat and biting such as sought to stay her her they named the tigress

and there was one they called the saint a woman with soft gentle eyes soft and gentle of speech with an oval face pale and serene that might have looked down from some old masters canvas depicting seraphimâa woman with fair hair and small hands ivory whiteâand her they watched particularly closely

and yet another case as pitiful if not as terrible as anyâwas a woman who shrank from every gaze startled and gasped at every sound and whose shuffling gait ever and anon suddenly haltedâshe standing swaying to and fro like a wand at the mercy of the breeze victim of some strange nerve disorder to whom the trifles of existence were insoluble problems of vital moment who wavered in agonising irresolution whether to turn to right or left to advance or retreat to step with one foot or the other collapsing midway on a staircase daring neither to go up nor down to whom holding a precious vase the very knowledge of its value would compel her to let it fall and shatter

alas there was no lack of companyâyoung and old cultured uncultured brutal refined some who had killed because they hated others because they lovedâso complex are the ills that flesh is heir have saved her from what was infinitely worse and somehow it brought her strange glimmers of hope when nannie declared her certainty that austen lisle believed her innocent

furthermore the dear old ladys stout declaration of faith inspired the girl to a confidence she had not yet made fearing lest because of her reticence perhaps her disingenuousness on that one point she would not be believed and so when she had told this gentle loyal old lady of certain matters that till then deeming immaterial she had not mentioned nannie nepean for once was angry with her exclaiming child  child why did you not tell me of these things before

but there were other visits not angelic neither few nor far between

elmer dring in the interests of justice and judex essline in the interests of science sought from the home office and obtained special facilities to visit the prisoner

and once jane collins came and in the presence of others and with many tears endeavoured to bring the poor girl to a proper state of mind to prevail upon her by evincing repentance and remorse to bring along and indicate the glimmering of returning reason

and when alone with her to whisper you little devil how i hate you it does me oh such good to see you here crushed and done for to see the cheeks fools of men compared to peaches and to roses growing haggard and your eyes that the idiots used to rave about sinking in and losing their light and your hair beginning to grow thin and lank a few more years of this and it will be turning grey youll be old before your time  youll be ageing like the other wretches here

and jane collins chuckled that life had its pleasant moments after all

one day in the garden of the palace of despair pansy beheld flitting from flower to flower like a butterfly from the outer gladder world an angelchild some four summers old with childhoods sunshine in her hair and eyes and childhoods music in her laugh and because pansy herself inclined to what was lovable such inclined to her and as her eyes met the childs and her face reflected the smile of the child the little one looked up with a happy trustful laugh asking please lady pick me a flower 

and pansy gathering a blossom gave it to the child with gentle words

whats your name the little one asked pansy why thats a flowers name i suppose thats why you live in the garden i love pansies âtheyre so pretty just like you

great heaven miss enid you tiresome girl

a nurse neither of the staff nor in the uniform of the place rushed at the child snatching her away with a terrified look at poor panicstricken pansy

you know what mamma told youânever to leave your own garden and never to speak toâ these people

but i like her shes so nice and kind and she

that was all the girl who had become a number heard as the little one was whirled away by her fluttered and angry custodian and pansys cup of bitterness again overflowed she watched the little vision of happiness out of sight saw her disappear within the enclosure of the medical superintendents house then turning encountered with a shudder the tigress and the saint who ranging themselves walked on each side of her and thought aloud and incomprehensibly

mamma said little enid me met a real flower that had grown into a real lady in the big garden outside oursâsuch a pretty flowerladyâa pansy do all the flowers grow into real people swiftly the nurse interposed with an exclamation she had only turned a moment miss enid was so quick and after all had only wandered a little way

but the medical superintendents wife checked and chid her bidding her reflect what might have happened had the poor creatures delusion taken a more harmful turn than that she was a pansy transformed into a human being

pansys tender heart smarted more than ever comprehending all to think that she who so loved little children should be marked out as one to be avoided by a little child

tearfully she hurried from the garden and sought her one solace in that palace of despair in the large kind of common room there was a piano and it was pansys wont to while away many hours in playing over the melodies that her dear nannie had loved so fondly

oft times while her fingers strayed along the keyboard gaunt sadeyed women would gather noiselessly around hushing incoherent babblingsâand over many faces would steal a happier and a hopeful calm wild eyes would quench their restless fires in tears so that those whose province it was to keep watch and ward there fostered pansys devotion to the piano encouraging her to minister to those minds diseased with rhapsody sonata nocturne and fantasia at her own sweet will

and when through the open windows that were barred across the garden beneath and beyond across the other garden the molten gold and silver notes rippled through another window that was not barred and it was said that it was the girl pansy armadale playing so marvellously little enid declared that that was her flower lady and that she was sure that she was good and kind and lovable as she was lovely or else how could she play such music

what strange spell had come over austen lisle

his boon companions of the temple and the club were positive that something was the matter because ordinarily the dear chap was so sparkling and exhilarating there was such a buzz and seething of cheerfulness about himâand nowâwhat ailed the wine it was so flat and lifeless like a last night

was it overworkâwas it worry his friends asked each other and bytheby him direct he laughed in answer and they noted that even his mirth had not the spontaneity nor the pleasant ring of old

the slatternly laundress who did for him the callow youth who read novels all day in his clerks room both of whom adored him were too perturbed about him and the former confided to the latter her worst fears ive seen so many go like it in my time in the templeâfine young gents as ever paid accounts without demeanin of themselves by askin questions depend upon it erbert hes in love and one of these days hell be agivin up residence in chambers an livin in the suburbs ive lost amany in my time and iâi feels it like a hicy wind the presentiment of losin himâwith mrs austen lisle to tot up every penny to the housekeepin and make out she can do cheaper at the stores

and herbert who was himself beginning to evince a keen interest in building societies and houserents complacently reflecting that even if the governor took unto himself a sharer of his joys and sorrows the partnership would not extend to the practice remarked philosophically that after all it was only what was to be expected and that there came a time when a man got tired of seeing life and inclined to double harness

indeed all was not well with austen lisle and that which was amiss with him by day and night stood between him and the judges and juries he addressed mocked him in whispers in the pauses of the arguments of learned friends hovered at his elbow striding through the busy street even at the play intruded on him in the midst of all the lights all the jingle all the merriment and at midnight tracked him up the silent reverberating staircase and facing him in his lonely sittingroom gripped him by the throat

that awful growing suspicion developing into a dread that he had been the victim of instructions drawn from faulty premises

no no hot the victimâthat was the haunting taunting exasperation of it the blame of it the shame of it i for if those conclusions or those premises or any or all were faulty false or fraudulent then he was the instrument of a terrible miscarriage of justice and the victim was the girl in whose violet eyes he had read the light of truth and the protestations against the false

and so night after night when over the temple courts and cloisters hung nights starry veil of silence not broken but intensified by the fountains muted plashing austen lisle sat far into the small hours by the light of his readinglamp turning over again and again the pages of the brief he had begged the treasury solicitors to loan to him again

depositions shorthand notes instructions he reread them all line for line word for word he had them by heart and there ensued with his brain âwellbalanced welltrained wellstored though it was the strangest conflict in his experience there it all was piece fitting into piece the girls flight after the quarrel after the accusation after the threatâwhy he himself might have borne witness to her irrational wandering in the small hours through the countryside her remaining perdu all that while âthen most overwhelming convincing of all the discovery of the weapon with which the deed was done buried in the gardenplot she tended

there it all was crushingly convincing apparently irrefutable and yet there in his minds eye he could see her now truth and innocence reposing in her eyes yet common sense impatiently replied âhow could she be innocent

unlessâah unless there had been devised and wrought against her villainy surpassing the crime of which she was accused unless deliberately foully some personâno some personsâdirectly or indirectly concerned in the murder had planned to throw suspicion upon her unless indeed there had been a foul conspiracy to add by perjury murder to murder

then he scanned the matter from that point of view noting the points he would have laboured had he been retained upon the other side why hadnt he been on that side what a fight he would have made 

and at the rising of the court next day which was a saturday austen lisle flinging his briefbag to herbert and his kitbag into a hansom dashed away to paddington where he took a weekend ticket to conington which was the nearest town to homecroft

nannie nepean seated alone in the little drawingroom opening on to the flowerbeds and the lawn was thinking how desolately quiet the place seemed without pansyâwhich was indeed just what she had been thinking ever since that heartrending time when the burly men in uniform from conington had taken the dear child away no merry laugh no rippling music broke the silence now as for the piano it was closed unattuned like nannies heart

i shall have to sell the place up pension off job wattles and go and be a paying guest somewhere with a landlady making remarks about my appetite and people putting me down for a fussy old maid but then whats to become of you bingo they wont put up with bulldogs in select boardinghouses and i couldnt part with youâfor she loved you and you worshipped her didnt you and bingo assented with a snort and two wags of his kinky tail

then of a sudden his eyes flamed and with a growl which swelled into a bark he dashed across the lawn and presently job wattles bandier and more bowed than ever shuffled along pulling his forelock to announce that a strange gentleman was asking whether madam was at home

miss nepean with a distrust of strange gentlemen nourished since the days of harvey darrell inquired suspiciously what sort of gentleman job

lardy i pleasant enough marm never seed bingo take to a stranger the like of it before and yet for all i says stranger theres summat in the face i seem to know but cannot recollect

that bingo had taken to the stranger was counted in his favour and a few moments later he was ushered into the little drawingroom and nannie too was wondering where had she seen that pleasant face before

my name is austen lisle miss nepean he said and the object of my visit is a matter requiring some explanation

austen lisle  she exclaimed clapping her hand upon her heart oh yes yes i remember it was you who persecutedâi mean prosecuted my darling and prevailed upon them to declare that whitesouled little martyr guilty of what she never could have done and here her voice broke into a little cry

and bingo the brindled bulldog snuffled and snarled suspiciously

job wattles paused at the door of the room into which he had just ushered the visitor with the name and madams words jobs somewhat hazy memory cleared in an instant why yes the face the voice were unchanged  it was only that wig and gown were replaced by a tweed hat and suit else he would have recognised in a moment the lawyer who had put miss pansy away and whom accordingly job had catalogued as a villain of the deepest dye and tapping the open door he inquired significantly whether madam was likely to want him if so hed wait handy

for not even the difference in their physique and years would have deterred the old gardener had nannie nepean then and there decreed the visitors summary removal

such a reception might have chilled many a visitor but austens mind was intent on matters of far graver moment

no doubt he said you are surprised at my visit indeed i myself can hardly realise it for frankly i have thrown conventionality professional etiquetteâeverything to the winds and why because i tell you candidly that since the trial of pansy armadale my mind has never really been at rest

nannie nepean gazed in his face with dilated eyesâa ray of light was glimmering through her gloom

you say that she faltered you who prosecutedâoh dont think im bitter against you sir you are a barristeratlawâyour duty is to your own clients

subject to what is just and right said austen gravely

and nannie nepean replied with animation yesâyes  that too i understandâi can read that in your face even while you were unfolding your case against her forging the chain of evidence against her link by link the most appalling thought of all was that it was all so logical that there was nothing unfair to protest againstâonly some fearful mistake or misunderstanding or something even worse underlying all the others told me when it was all over that you fought the case with only half your energyâthat you scarcely seemed yourself

an advocate said austen is only human sometimes very human from experience of many varied phases of humanity part of what was in your mind has been in mine

is it possible that this girl who had in you so staunch a friend had in others deadly relentless unscrupulous enemiesâfor to my mind it is on that hypothesis alone that any theory as to her innocence can be constructed now i am here in confidence and with a desire that justice may prevail and if upon that understanding you care to receive me you and i upon the merits of this case will think aloud

she held out both her hands grasping austen lisles

they told me you were a great lawyer she said now i know that you are that which is greaterâ you are a true and honest man within whose mind justice occupies a higher pedestal than law

the law he said is the body and justice is the soul justice is the cause and the law is the sword that strikes for itâthe buckler that defends it if perchance at times the sword is slow to strike and the shield fails to avert some swift thrust of evil it is because the shield and sword are mortal for law is human made by humanity for humanityâbut justice is divine

then they went at length once more into the case which twelve good men and true presided over by a learned judge had triedâonly this time austen lisle asked questions which would have been put had he briefed upon the other side

what were the antecedents of this harvey darrell this second cousin of the murdered man and whence had he arrived at dassborough

nannie nepean could give no answer she only knew that mr darrell when visiting at homecroft had spoken of years of travel in many lands that he seemed to know most of the cities of the west

and for the first time austen learned that darrell had been for the fortnight preceding pansys arrest a frequent visitor at homecroft

what he exclaimedâa suitor he had made love to the girl and she had rejected him oh why on earth was all this not brought out in evidence 

and what of pansys parents and how came gideon abbs to be her guardian

nannie nepean could only tell what little she had gathered from the bewildered girl since her arrestâ how that until her father died while she was quite a little girl she had lived happily with him in a comfortable house with spacious grounds in the north country where gideon abbs used at long intervals to come to see her father and they used to talk dry talk over dry dusty deeds once they quarrelled and she remembered her father telling gideon that he believed hed been his enemy for years that he was a wolf in sheeps clothing and that he meant now his eyes were opened to alter his will for he wouldnt leave a dog to his care let alone a daughter and how a few days later her father was brought home covered on a hurdle after a burst that ended with the death ofânot the fox but the foxhunter how later on gideon abbs had made his last visit to the house that had been her place of drear captivity and bondage

for hours austen lisle sat with nannie nepean asking question after question and writing down every answer with bingo dozing contentedly at his feet for bingo the brindled bulldog was like most dogs a judge of character and knew friends from foes

it was characteristic of pansy that everybodyâ except jane collinsâloved her elmer dring esslin and darrell only cherished rancour against her because they had desired her in vain in the palace of despair the poor distraught creatures hovered about her seemingly soothed by all things of or appertaining to herâher girlish beauty her voice her ways her gentleness in all things

pansy tell us a story pansy sing to us play to us stay with us the terror in the throes of a paroxysm ceased her shrieks her curses her battling and at the sound of pansys voice and the touch of her cool little hands suddenly burst into a flood of weeping that eased her heart and freed of the seven devils that had possessed her knelt at the girls feet as at a guardian angels

the girl who had killed her child talked to pansy and to her only of itâof its pretty ways of the cling and touch of its tiny fingers at her breast and the music of its cooing the woman who hesitatedâand was lost with pansy near ceased the nervous twitching of her hands and her eyes awhile were still

nor were those entrusted with the care of the distraught creatures unmindful of these things and they began to exchange opinions that circumstances and conditions must have been especially exceptional tor this dove of a girl to have played the pantheress that the old curmudgeon must have broken all records in goading and exasperating

some of the younger doctors even hazarded the possibility that in this instance justice had been blind because of dust thrown into her eyes

children of all things that yearned for tenderness she had always charmed little enid gave her parents no peace until after many vain petitions and much earnest pleading ignored they at last were partly persuaded partly wearied into allowing her subject to abundant precautions to walk and talk with the pretty flower lady by degrees a confidence was established the stringency of the conditions was relaxedâpansy was allowed or rather besought to visit the superintendents garden and byandby to supplement little enids musiclessons with further tuition and it was noted that the little one learned more with pansy during a month than in the preceding year

when later the child lay sick with measles and lightheaded with fever calling for pansy to come and tell her a pretty tale to make daisychains to play to her mrs glenfern ignoring all rules and precautions sent to pansy and implored her to help nurse enid and pansy who loved the child devotedly willingly eagerly kept long loving vigil by her bedside reading and chatting in her sweet low voice to her soothing her to sleep with music eloquent of the ripple of silvery cascades tire song of birds at dawn and june breezes amid rosesâso what wonder that after those days enid came to love and cling to her pansy more and more

from the beginning nurse declared it was courting disaster to give such freedom and indulgence to an inmate and that dr glenfern ought to have been the last to tolerate itâthat some day mark her words he would be sorry for it and it seemed to be a sore point with nurse that both the sorrow and the occasion for it were so long deferred

until at last one day it was in a triumphant voice that she exclaimed there maam i told you so i knew it i knew itâwhos a croaker now i should like to know

for little enid was nowhere to be found

high and low they searched at last with blanching faces but for any trace of the little one in vain

then flustered herself and doing her best to fluster those around her nurse emden fluttered to and fro clamouring stridentlyâwhere was the child and where was the wretched girl who had been trusted with her by those who should have had more sense

here here pansy answering her name clamoured along the corridors appeared looking so bright and cheerful that ann emden bit her lips in momentary chagrin

then after a baffled pause she demanded shrilly where is miss enid

yes pansy the childs mother repeated though in a gentler tone enid disappeared a little while ago and we thought perhaps she was taking a ramble round the garden with you or that you were giving her a musiclesson

but pansy answered no she had not seen the child and mrs glenfern paused puzzled and the doctor too where could she have gone to

ann emden approaching menacingly said in a rapid undertone look here it will be worse for you if theres any nonsense speak out when did you last see her

half an hour back pansy answered after her musiclesson she walked with me to the gate of the housegarden where i left her

there was a stir of consternation once again the garden was traversed and the grounds of the place were ransacked high and low but with no trace of enid

it was then that arose that thrilling cry terrible at all times in all places to hear then and there trebly terribleâfire fire

the cry was taken up again and again by other voices attendants and others with grave faces hurried to and fro glenfem not forgetting his child but remembering his duty swiftly gave orders for opening the hydrants and manning the engine a rush was made towards all the fire appliances and the engineshed

from the doors of the block went scuttling inmates in the uniform of the place from some of the windows wreaths of smoke began to curl here and there a tongue of flame and there was the clink of splintering and falling glass

mrs glenfern beside herself with the double horror hastened with her husband heading the rush towards where the fire was taking hold and in the stress and panic of that stampede attention for the moment was diverted from the bewildered pansy

except that ann emden giving vent to jealousy and spleen screamed at her this is your work you little hussy youve shown your claws at last but ill be even with you

it had been her intent to see that pansy was secured but at the moment a throng of panicstricken inmates surging along the corridor swept them asunder shrieking fire fire fire

surely enough along the wards and corridors came rolling huge billowy clouds of choking smoke a blast of heat the sound of crackling and tongues of lurid flame driving all living things before it save such as it smote down and as if at the touch and bidding of a malignant appalling terror arose rampant in those regions of despair as through the tenebrous swirling mist wild dishevelled forms with wilder features rushed hither and thither shrieking gesticulating frantic and frenzied

pansy caught the contagion of the terror but her fear was not for herself but for the loving child she loved and swiftly desperately she threaded wards and corridors crying frantically enid enid my darlingâwhere are you

and suddenly through the blinding yellow haze she heard a voice screaming pansy pansy and a wild form winding and whirling in maniacal exultation swirled through the smoke towards her seized her

it was the saintâtransformed into a devil shrieking in the fiendish hysteria of a hecate

glorious glorious at last the devils come into his own 

the childâthe child gasped pansy have you seen her

yesâyes

in heavens nameâis she safe

safe oh yes trust meâive seen to that safe bind safe find shes in the storeroom there where they keep the oils the turpentine the methylated spirits i coaxed her there to see the lovely toys and pictures and i said youd come and sing to her it was for me to bind and for the fire to find

merciful heaven  shrieked pansy

then she flung herself with all her force against the door screaming the childs name but it was locked and the maniac broke into a pealing yell of laughter

no ones to enter there after me except the fire kingâand see he comes to claim her this is the sacrifice ive vowed look the flames have caught the wainscotâtheyre creeping on their hungry tongues are licking the walls close to the lintel that was my bargain to be last to see her as she wasâ with the sunny curls and the rosy cheeksâno one else will see her except as she will be 

give me the keyâthe key  shrieked pansy in a frenzy

and she flung herself upon the saint to take by force the key that had been turned on enids life

but the saint was strong with the strength of the seven devils within her and poor pansy panting halfchoked with the heat and fumes reeled back before her blows

i tell you none shall see her as i left herâexcept the fire king look where he comes dancing you hussy go and play the music for him 

then desperation lent pansy cunning

yes yes she gasped hastily he must have a tune to dance to onlyâmy musics all in there give me the keyâquickâquick come come

dont make the fire king angryâand oh ill play you such a dance youve never heard before come come the key

she crooned the last words her hand closing round the fingers hooked on the key and still crooning detached them from that grasp then how she knew not but swiftly desperately she plunged it into the lock wrenched it round and dashed into the room where the terrorpalsied child was clinging to the window bars

enid enid she cried

she snatched the little one in her armsâthen ran with her from that place of doom

shrieking a torrent of imprecations the saint flew at her and pansy desperately screaming enid run for your life along there   dropped her and grappled with the woman

you cheat you jadeâill kill you yelled the saint youve cheated me youve robbed the fire king of his preyâyou wicked thief i 

yes said pansy i was wrongâi am sorryâ let me undo the wrong i have done and bring her back i

she slipped from the relaxing grasp dashed desperately into the density of the smokefilled corridors stumbled along until she saw the loom of a tiny figure within the yellow cloudâheard the sound of a faint gasping cry

enid enid she cried again

again she caught up the little one and staggered stumbling with her through the smoke which now belched even more furiously

her foot struck a firebucket in this she drenched the childs pinaforeâthen her own handkerchief which she wound over her mouth and nostrils

so she blundered on fearing that each step would be her last that the smoke would smite her down for the fire to wreak its wrath on her she clutched an iron railing and summoning all her waning strength dragged herself to a stairhead then staggered downâdown into lesser density till at last she could breathe a prayer of thanks then halfblinded she staggered along the lower corridor down another staircase to where men and women were assembled plashing to and fro in water oozing and pouring from serpentine hose

one woman catching sight of her sprang out of the throng with wide opened arms crying pansy pansy you have found her you have saved her  then she placed enid in her mothers clasp and reeling would have fallen but that they held her

hurriedly as well as might be they took a musterroll and in spite of all that had been and still was being done found gaps here and there the staff was working heroicallyâthe brigade as the brigade always works even among the inmates pansy was not the only one to render welcome aid

strange changes had been wrought in some by the excitement and the shock notably in one the woman who hesitated hesitating now no longer but clothed and in her right mind was working with the staff calm and collected as any of their number

the terror was crouching in a corner trembling like an aspen whimpering like a tiny whipped child

but where was the saint

it was only pansy recovering from her semiswoon who could tell them where could show them where and forgetting all save that she was a fellowcreature afflicted and in peril pansy made her way back in spite of the protestations and evading the efforts to persuade her back to the corridors above back through the smoke gloom in quest of the woman who in her blindness had threatened her with death

but where smoke had loomed fire now roared and blazed and the bewildered baffled girl was forced hither and thither along tortuous waysâthose by which she had come being here and there cut off

and so it came to pass that retreating before the belching cloud and swiftly but not a second too soon wrenching open a door ahead of her she found herself in an isolated corner of the grounds

close to a gateâan open gate left by workmen of the staff hurrying to the scene of the fire close by ran the hedge of the gardens allotted to the staff and on its broad welltrimmed back linen was bleachingâalso a sun hat and a print skirt and blouse no one was about

and none saw pansy as she passed through the gate ajar attired in these

she was dead and death had come to her with tenfold terror to the last ghastly chapter of her life the ghastlier finis had been inscribed in flame ashes to ashes with her it was ashes to cinders

jane smiled at the flash of her own humour and felt quite gay and young reading again and again the lurid narrative of the lurid catastrophe and the wine of life coursing through her veins brought a colour to her pallid cheeks the colour of a parboiled shrimp

yes it was thereâthere seeing was believing she would like to have seen it blazoned in letters of brass let into stoneâbut there it was in print not that that was proof infallible in these days but the news was too good for jane and too bad to others not to be true

and jane collins who wallowed in the morbid and gloated over the ghastly as a rule reread till she had by heart the account of the awful conflagration in the palace of despair when the fire king had crowned the other horrors abiding there she would have read it with interest under ordinary circumstances but there among the list of those reported perished in the holocaust appeared one name investing it all with a transcendent glamour for jane collinsâthe name of pansy armadale

harvey darrell noting the strange alacrity in janes demeanour as she entered the breakfastroom wondered what had happenedâwhat disaster had overtaken anybody

quite a nice morning jane he said

and jane replied instead of is it according to her wont a most delightful morning sirâand theres the newspaper

confound the newspaper  said harvey darrell with chops and kidneys and newlaid eggs and hot new milk and fragrant coffee on the breakfasttray why encumber it with what cant be swallowed my chops my newlaid eggs my fragrant coffee myâwell if not pretty passably attentive janeâand let them force their pills their beans and their encyclopaedias down other peoples throats but jane was minded that he should learn the mornings news and moreover that she should witness its effect upon him

theres plenty in this mornings paper sir besides advertisements she suggested

surprised at her communicativeness he answered with an enquiring look then said no doubt the opinions of nobodies who know no more than i on subjects i dont care two straws about buckets of gush over the humbugs on their own side of gall for those upon the other the comments of one fraud scribbling at a desk on the utterances of another fraud to parliament or on a platform theres the opinion of the gentleman whose bad play had been rejected on the possibly worse one that the rejector had produced together with the prophecies of certain twolegged asses relating to sundry horses over whom much illafforded money will be lost by greater asses who have never seen them

but theres the news sir

exactly jane there are the murders the horrible accidents my genial jane the breaches of our glorious lawsâsome of the breaches

he shrugged his shoulders as he sliced his chop

theres been a big fire sir

and doubtless another bankruptcy averted and yet its a long while between quarter days isnt there a close time for big fires jane

it aint a shop it aint a warehouse she said with eager trembling fingers holding back the newspaper which she clapped on the table before him its there sirâthere look

and with one bony finger she pointed to the scarehead appalling fire at a lunatic asylum

frowning at her persistence he glanced at the column then his eyes dilated he dropped his knife and fork took up the paper seized with a strange emotion whose existence in his being he himself had scarce suspected

and he knew that deep down in his nature there was hidden a chord of tenderness that never had been struck until he gazed on pansys picture then only faintly but which vibrated thrilling all his being when he had met her face to face had held her hand and listened with rapture to her voice

the savagery dominant in him had silenced that heartstring when she had said him no but now that he read the news that she had ceased to be that that sweet image was no more that that tender flower of girlhood had been cut down in her bloomâit was the savagery in him that was stilled and the one tender chord that wakened in his heart

just for a moment then he bethought himself how much easier the game was now how much more secure the stakes and after all his procrastination in destroying a certain document did not matter now

only when jane collins unable to keep down the fierce joy bubbling in what served her for a heart chuckled sibilantly shes got her deserts at last harvey darrell turned upon her such a thunderous face with such vivid lightning flashing from his eyes and such a grim sneer in the hard lines of his face that she turned hastily to shuffle from the room

no he said people dont get their deserts in this world they get other peoples its the blatant fool who gets the clever chaps deserts the straight smart man very often gets the luck that ought to be the wasters the woman who hasnt a soul to lose has frequently a pairhorse carriage to ride in and the girl as good as gold is mudsplashed by its wheels such a fate as hers was probably designed for such as you but fate in flinging her awards somehow contrives to mix them up

he lit a cigarette rose from the table and sauntered off in dressinggown and slippers to complete his toilet

he was clean gone on her  mused jane collins packing her tray he liked her almost as much as he dislikes me what a time i should have had of it if shed fancied him too but its given him a jar the news i meant it to  

what was that glittering upon the tray amongst the cutlery

a silver matchbox and jane collins forthwith scrutinised it as was her way with everything of harvey darrells there was nothing noticeable about it except that it was engraved with the monogram a v and in a corner m c m

just as she looked about her for materials for an imprint a bell rang her pulses quickened at the sound of a voiceâelmer drings

there was no need for her when passing with her tray to ask if he had heard the newsâhis lifted eyebrows answered that a little later he was closeted with harvey darrell

youve heard ofâthis calamitous affair he asked

jane collins reported it to me with gusto the other answered

of course we couldnt foresee that that was going to happen said dring mopping his moist forehead with a silk handkerchief and harvey darrell sententiously replied of course not you merely meant to hang her not to burn her

no no  expostulated dring it was arranged all along to corroborate esslins theory and as for youâwhy not we you engineered it all

my good man said harvey darrell drily is that all youve come here to say

no no  said the other and of course whats done cant be undone only as things have turned out worse than was intended its only right that the terms should be revised

my dear good man what are you driving at asked darrell and the other said you knowâyou cant bluff me this time you know the price that was agreed when the plan was agreed and you know theres five hundred due to me and now its turned out as it has i mean that five hundred to be a thousand or else

or else what  asked the other youve hinted once or twice what would be the consequence of my submitting toâshall we say blackmail no nasty wordâwell call it your demands i think the idea was that you were to seek miss armadale direct and impress upon her that she was a deeply wronged young ladyâthat the jury who convicted her were under quite a wrong impression well my friend by all means carry out that grand idea

you know i cant you know its too late thats why youre riding the high horse i see your game âonly remember you cant play this game on your own youre one to three theres jane collins to deal with

yes said harvey thoughtfully there remains jane for you to deal with and he laughed at the uneasy twitch of the lawyers features

dont forget esslin he said significantly

not by any manner of means forget friend esslin who couldâand talking of the devil

he turned from the window through which he was glancing as he spoke and striding across to the door shouted show doctor esslin up at once showing up is the order of the houreh mr dring

the lawyer answered with a malignant glance there was neither cordiality nor honour amongst those thieves just then esslin entered sallower of hue blacker of visage than ever streaks of grey in the ravenblack hair a fiercer light in his still more sunken eyes

you have heard the news he said in an awed undertone

yes said elmer dring its as well you are here hes going to jibâthinks he can throw us over safely now

hows that asked esslin with a significant glance at their host

my dear esslin said harvey darrell i am charmed even more than usual to see youâtake a cigar at the very moment of your arrival we were discussing you how strange just as you rang i was maintaining that judex esslins theory was unassailable that all men and women on some point were mad and citing an instance

magna est veritas et próvalebit chuckled the doctor with a shrug of his shoulders whose was the case in point

elmer drings own case harvey darrell exclaimed stridently and he smote the table with his clenched fist for just imagine what the man contends

he darted a defiant glance at the man of whom he spoke then to the other went on slowly distinctly out worse than was intended its only right that the terms should be revised

my dear good man what are you driving at asked darrell and the other said you knowâyou cant bluff me this time you know the price that was agreed when the plan was agreed and you know theres five hundred due to me and now its turned out as it has i mean that five hundred to be a thousand or else

yes said harvey thoughtfully there remains jane for you to deal with and he laughed at the uneasy twitch of the lawyers features

dont forget esslin he said significantly

not by any manner of means forget friend esslin who couldâand talking of the devil

he turned from the window through which he was glancing as he spoke and striding across to the door shouted show doctor esslin up at once showing up is the order of the hour eh mr dring

the lawyer answered with a malignant glance there was neither cordiality nor honour amongst those thieves just then esslin entered sallower of hue blacker of visage than ever streaks of grey in the ravenblack hair a fiercer light in his still more sunken eyes

you have heard the news he said in an awed undertone

yes said elmer dring its as well you are here hes going to jibâthinks he can throw us over safely now

hows that asked esslin with a significant glance at their host

my dear esslin said harvey darrell i am charmed even more than usual to see youâtake a cigar at the very moment of your arrival we were discussing you how strange just as you rang i was maintaining that judex esslins theory was unassailable that all men and women on some point were mad and citing an instance

magna est veritas et prcevalebit chuckled the doctor with a shrug of his shoulders whose was the case in point

elmer drings own case harvey darrell exclaimed stridently and he smote the table with his clenched fist for just imagine what the man contends

he darted a defiant glance at the man of whom he spoke then to the other went on slowly distinctly measuring the weight and noting the effect of every word and with the significance of his glance conveying much more than his words

he says that you and i and he three men of position conspired to accuse falsely and to swear away the life of the unhappy illfated pansy armadale what can be done to cure our poor friend of this wild hallucination

to the devil with your bluff i elmer bring flared up what did i tell you esslin look here were in this swim togetherâwe neednt measure phrases or mince matters

with a wink harvey darrell drew the other just for an instant aside and whispered to the doctor youve weighed our last nights chat

yes and agree

their eyes met esslin with his most professional air hands on hips scanned elmer dring from head to foot

excuse me he said and seizing his wrist with one hand with the other he took out his gold repeater

to the devil with your foolery  shouted elmer what games this youre playing

now dont excite yourself i want you to keep quite quiet ill send you a draught round directly only i want to take your temperature and from its morocco case he produced a clinical thermometer requesting dring to place it underneath his tongue

then elmers rage broke bounds

i see your game  he shouted this jobs been planned between you you think that being two to one youll throw me over but im not done with yet

they listened to his stertorous breathing as he descended the stairs then darrell mixed two whiskies and sodas and they sat down to discuss terms and ways and means particularly as to jettisoning jonah

meantime jonah in the person of elmer dring was pacing the narrow lane skirting the lone house grounds

wants to break the contractâwants to throw you over eh just like a man just like you wanted to serve me elmer oh yes i know you if you could have coaxed the old man into forcing that girl to marry youâah anyway she wont come between us any more

of course not jane he said with the unctuousness of old nobody will ever come between us havent i sworn it

youve sworn lots of things elmer replied miss collins and elmer uneasily adjured her not to be inconsequential and to stick to the point

thats just what i am doingâwhat i mean to do and what i want you to do she went on hurriedly fitfully when are you going to keep your word your oath its easy enoughâjust walking into a registry office idâsomehow id rather not go through it with you in a church i should be afraid of being struck by lightning what do you want to keep putting me off for

dont i tell you that im only waiting till ive settled with this fellowâtill ive got quits with him curse him oh jane if we could only bowl him out as im certain hes to be bowled outâif we could only get a clue help me to be revenged on him and ill marry you the next day before all the world with the archbishop of canterburys special licence

even the pale blood in her pulses leaped as he spoke

you mean that elmerâtrue and honest ah whatever we are to others were going hand in glove together right to the end elmerâright to the end and listen ive found out somethingânot muchâ only you never know

and then she described the monogram upon the matchbox

theyre not his initials elmer a v dont stand for harvey darrell and whats m c m for

and elmer dring explained that that was one way of setting forth one thousand nine hundred and when after more protestations and yet more vows he had parted from jane collins he went his way wondering who was a v and what was harvey darrell in the year one thousand nine hundredâand where

a pleasanter dinnertable one could hardly imagine the fare was good the wine was good the company was good the wit as dry as the wine and when the ladies had risen and the blue fragrant mists began to wreathe from rare havannas and the decanters glowing like mammoth rubies of wondrous fire circled and the comfortable cheerful circle drew closer round the dessertladen mahogany cracking jokes with walnuts and bandying anecdotes taken like the nuts with just a grain of salt on each of the cleancut clever faces there sat an expression which might have been interpreted ye gods i have dined today

that the company gathered round his hospitable mahogany in bryanston square was shoppy and much of the conversation was shoppy wickham manners the solicitor would have owned cheerfully to be true he would however have denied that that was detrimental for the man loved the profession he had been bred and reared in held that its lore was the most learned its wisdom the most profound its wit the prettiest in the world

he would defy you to cite a jeu desprit more sparkling than chittys remark to the leader whose speech the falling plaster interrupted go on

fiat justitia ruat cålum or a happier retort than that of the bland junior who when a certain just but overbearing judge snapped out i can teach you law but i cant teach you manners replied i dont think you can my lord

they were a goodly type of manhood the learned judge who had just set them chuckling with a little story about lord chief justice cockbum and the high sheriff had in his day stroked an oxford eight to victory the learned kc chuckling at the yarn was equally at home in the pigskin as among the parchments the rising junior with the brawny build and suntanned features only a few years back had made his century at lords for cambridge austen lisle albeit a trifle fine drawn the result they had just been telling him of overwork had at the latter university attained the high distinction of a double blue

its always the way said wickham manners in the law as in other professions a man has either not enough or else too much to do but youre certainly overdoing it lisleâyoure working at a gallop

never mind said the eminent kc mp works better than worry when a young man is up to his eyes in it he hasnt time to make mistakes and brood over them for instance he might be falling in love with some girl he couldnt marry

austen lisle answered with a laugh that told little what was in his mind only just then he had been reflecting how the one remorse of his life had come in the natural course of his daily work he was thankful when the conversation drifted into another channel

on to strangely enough the subject of selfmade menâmen who had risen from the bottom rung by their own merits some all the better kindlier for the memory of the days of early struggle others who because they had climbed from the bottom rung seemed never to dare or care to look back upon that rung or recognise any common interest with those ranged on it

somebody cited sugden who began life by sweeping out the paternal barbers shop and became lord high chancellor of englandânever ashamed of his former lowly station nor shaming the lofty one he reached then someone called to mind the instance of another barber who in far earlier times reached eminenceâoliver le dain who while clipping the hair of louis onze whispered information in his ear and became in time that kings most trusted ministerânot keeper of his conscience since he apparently had none to be kept

one man hazarded the view that in these days such a climb would be even more difficult but wickham manners would not have it so contending that figaros occupation offered exceptional advantages for the man of brains and ambitions minus means

for instance he said i had once in my office a young fellow who though when he came to me he knew nothing of legal routine struck me by the scope and variety of his general knowledge he knew a smattering of most languages and seemed familiar not only with the principal seaports and cities of the world but and that is what struck me most the routes and means of reaching them curiosity led me to question him and i found that he had started life as a hairdressers apprentice and having a desire for travel had found no difficulty in securing not only a passage but good wages on board any of the liners he had thus visited new york boston frisco yokohama tokio pekin calcutta cape town alexandria melbourneâin fact as i say the principal cities of the world and still following his trade had obtained employment in the principal hotels wherever he found himself

smart chap said the judge

wickham manners made a wry face

bit too smart

he disappearedâsimultaneously with a trifle of â in notes out of the office safe

being a barberâhe thought it time to cut chuckled the kc

i should like to meet him again said wickham manners thoughtfully and grimly but it was a pity he wasnt straight he was a most intelligent fellow he was engaged at the time with one of my managing men in investigating the matter of one abbsâgideon abbs you know the man who was murdered at dassborough an occasional client of mine had an idea that his wife was the nextofkin and instructed my firm to investigate matters it turned out however that there was a nearer claimant in the person of one mr harvey darrell i remember the man nodded the learned judge you know i tried that girlâpansy armadale wasnt that the nameâfor the murder ah you prosecuted i remember lisle i never thought there was much in the contention of that man esslin that she was non compos mentis i dont think the jury did either for the matter of that at the same time im very glad they let the child off it would have upset me frightfully to have passed the capital sentence on her

i recollect the case rejoined wickham manners lisle have another glass of portâyoure not looking very fit and gentlemen what do you say shall we join the ladies oh heres a special standard nothing happened i suppose of any importance

and casually carelessly he took the paper from the salver with which his butler had entered opened it gave a roving glance across the sheet then exclaimed good god

whats the matter and his guests clustered round

look he said appalling fire at the very place they sent that girl of whom we were talking list of missing oh how terrible see theres the poor childs nameâpansy armadale

a murmur of pity filled the room above it there was the sound of a groan then a thudâand austen lisle went down in a heap upon the floor

having used the precious trio to further his ends harvey darrell cast about him how most easily to rid himself of esslin bring and jane collinsâthe jettisoning of his three jonahsâfully appreciating that the jonahs would object to the jettisoning

his first step was to set them by the ears a task far more difficult having regard to their mutual distrust

nothing was easier than to convince judex that elmer was his unrelenting enemy he had read it in his eyes he said together with the glare of inordinate avarice culminating in a form of mental aberration akin to that which had dominated abbs âthe only difference being that abbs had a weakness for an appearance of legality liked to make believe that he was honest would assume the virtue of a title if he had it notâwhereas elmer bring ostensibly a man of law was a law unto himself drew the line only at being found out

beware of him i he said beware of placing trust in him 

harvey darrell cheerfully promised to beware

jane collins whom judex had treated with some distinction as possessing considerable influence over gideon abbs he now regarded as harvey darrells servant on sufferance with impatience and it only required darrells covert intimation that jane had poohpoohed the doctors theories and impugned his integrity for judex excitedly to proclaim her a morbid monomaniac with a latent homicidal tendency hastening to climacteric development he instanced her fury at the narrow escape of pansy armadale from the laws ultimate penalty and her unconcealed exultation at the dread fate reported to have overtaken her

beware of her also he said dont let her mix your drinks

they both hate you he added vehemently i have heard them collectively and individually express the most ardent desire that some crushing disaster might befall youâbeware of both 

harvey darrell laughed between puffs at his cigarette then exclaiming contemptuously skittles flung the fagend from him as though that typified such measure of importance as he extended to the pair in question

nevertheless he kept a sharp eye on janes movements and at night the great dane slept on the mat outside his bedroom he adopted too a fashion of moving stealthily about the house appearing here and there most unexpectedly and he had taken to wearing list slippers noiseless as janes own

one morning entering the library he thought he noticed jane collins moving away from an oldfashioned bureau he religiously kept locked

what are you doing at those drawers  he asked sharply

dusting answered jane flickering a feather brush

he eyed her keenly

by the by jane he said as i explained some time ago there is no necessity for you to hurry or flurry yourself in looking out for another situation i know you dont like hurrying or flurrying even when youre dusting

you said i could stay on as long as i liked that was the understanding when we talked over the evidence i was to give

jane i am afraid you are the victim of a misunderstanding true i said there was no hurry but many months have flown and there has not been any hurry at the same time it was not arranged that you were to be considered as a fixture appurtenant to the freehold

oh but i understood differently you said i was to stay indefinitely that was the word

precisely that word being absolutely distinct from eternally there is a saying jane that variety is charming you i am sure wedded to convention as you areâthough otherwise a spinster until such time as friend dring shall screw his courage to the point and implore his pretty jane to name the dayâeven you i say must at times yearn for new surroundings even at the cost of leaving the employment of one to whom you are naturally so ardently devoted

if you mean im only stopping on here to suit myself thats all right if it hadnt suited me i shouldnt have stopped a minute but it was settled i could stay just as long as i liked when we settled what i was to say before the magistrates and at the assizes

settled jane you are dreaming

no fear you know what was settled between you and me and elmer dring

tut tut jane collins i shall begin to believe that theres something in doctorâi mean in a theory of a scientific friend of mineâthat in matters of memory your mental balance is not quite accurate that at intervals you are subject to a certain not uncommon lapsus of memory the outcome of some strange cerebral paralysis

i know what you mean snapped out jane thats judex esslins gibberish youre talking and i know what your game is you want to get rid of me now that you think youre safe and settled here very well then only think it overâthink whether its going to pay you in the long run i dont think it will

you mean i am to weigh the importance of a discharged servants testimony tut tut jane collins go downstairs and while you remain in my service conduct yourself respectfully or you and your boxes will be simultaneously bundled into the street her pallor became more ghastly her eyes gleamed like a cats green and yellow their sparse sandy lashes quivering distinctly

if looks could kill if eyes could wither it would have fared ill with harvey darrell as she after a silent pause breathing heavily sidled from the room

then with a gasp culminating in a shriek she tripped staggered almost fell over the huge pied great dane crouching beyond the door and who started up with a fierce ominous growl and deadly as was janes hatred for her new master for once she welcomed his appearance when hastening to the door he seized the brassstudded collar circling the big brutes massive neck exclaiming hallo there steady steady lucifer impetuous rascal i gave no word jane i think youd better clear

jane collins thought so too and scuttled livid with terror from where he stood straining with both hands at the huge collar of the ferocious beast

that night in the shadow of the trees along the narrow lane skirting the lone house jane collins walked alongside elmer dring

your old master was not what people would call a particular man jane collins he was saying but this young one is the most unscrupulous person i ever knew anything else to report jane

yes if you wont interrupt hes taking on amazing over whats happened to her nearly every time i happen on him hes striding to and fro like a tiger in a cage muttering about the white face gleaming through the flames judex might have something to say about it also

anything else jane

yes if you wont chatter

oh dont be angry janeâim in such a state do you know that man that curse hes serving me as badly as hes serving you flinging down the ladder thats helped him in his climbing you know what ive done for him what ive risked for him penal servâwell anyway unpleasant consequences

oh go on say it penal servitude for perjury both of us for a price

yes my price was to be five hundred pounds i meant to make that five hundred a thousandâi told him soâand now what do you think his answer is he says that if im going to spring hell spring tooâthe other way hell meet bluff with bluff he said hed be content to have given me five hundred but now that ive claimed a thousand i can go to the devilâdo my best or my worst hell give me nothing theres a villain and theres a womandunning me through her lawyers for a matter of a thousand pounds of hers iâwas taking care of

i knowâi know said jane collins significantlyâshe in her time having entrusted various sums to elmers care

and now shes threatening to sue meâto prosecute me ive had a letter from her lawyers a big firm in londonâwickham manners and co they threaten hist what was that

a rat i suppose or perhaps a weasel amongst the bushes walk further from the bank

they threaten jane to swear an information and have me arrested on a warrant and i relied upon that thousand pounds and a bit more what shall i doâwhat shall i do

i suppose said jane thoughtfully it wouldnt be any good going straight to them and telling them how this villains disappointed you do you think that would lead to anything

yes janeâit would probably lead me to portland a little sooner than i seem like going cant you think of something sensible woman

he spoke with fierce vehemence and clutching her lean arm until she winced beneath the grip

dont you see he said that i cant keep my word to you till i get through this whirlpool that is threatening to sink me down in its vortex

i dont see what whirlpools and vortexes and such things have to do with that snapped jane i dont see why you cant do tomorrow what you promised to do months agoâyears ago walk into a registry office with me and fix up our union ah if youd only done thatâeven now ive got a card up my sleeve

what do you mean what card and he clutched the lean arm again as excitedly as though she had been referring to concealed cards literally

i mean what i say she went on vaguely i mean if youd been straight with me i might have saved you even now

but i always meant being straight with youâ you know that jane he said reverting to the unctuous manner that he had found so potent with this woman whose one flatterer throughout her life he had been you know ive been the victim of circumstancesâhavent i there was old gideon always wanting me to square up accounts and then there was this fellow going to smash me over flinderss mortgageâand now theres this trouble and not any one of em need have hindered our walking quietly into the registry for the matter of ten minutes

but you know what was always my idea my dream my chiefest ambition jane dearâi wanted you to have a wedding a real wedding with orange blossoms and a big cake and bridesmaids a pair of greys dashing up to the church door the organ playing the roguesâi mean the wedding march and all the women envying you jane and all the men envying me

yes yes she said in a hasty whisper her anaemic pulses wakening into a flutter ive heard of it so oftenâbut whens it going to happen 

as soon as i get round this comer janeâas soon as i get into the straight with my field settled said mr dring betraying an intimacy with turf metaphor scarcely to have been expected of so austere a pillar of respectability jane tell meâ whats the card you are hiding up your sleeve

ive come across a willâgideons will she whispered

he started as though a heavy hand had struck him a blow in the dark thereâthough as a matter of fact there was only a clenched fist shaken at him in the darkâten yards away

his will who prepared it

its in his own hand and its short and sweet at leastânoânoânot sweet short and bitterâat least it was for me to read i found a rusty old key âone of gideonsâthat fitted the bureau that vagabond keeps his papers in i opened one drawer after anotherâi darent rummage hes so artful if id stirred a single paper hed have known it and all at once i came on a document folded in four inscribed last will and testament of gideon abbs i opened it and just as id glanced through it i heard that brute of a dog at the door moving and guessed the brute of a man was comingâand id barely time to replace the will and relock the drawer when he quiet as a ghost slipped into the room

but the willâthe will how did the old man leave his propertyâthe realtyâthe personalty

everything to one personâand who do you think that was

to me jane exclaimed elmer eagerly i always felt he thought a lot of me and that his snarling was his way of showing it and after all i never robbed him of muchâi mean it was the people in his grip i squeezed most you dont mean to say that his residuary legatee and his heir are his esteemed and valued friend and lawyer elmer dring

i dont mean to say anything of the sort answered jane there wasnt a word about you the old rat what he got served him right and after a pause he went on then who was it jane you dont mean to say it was youâand yet who more likelyâwho mere deserving than jane my dearest jane my peretty jane

noâit wasnt your jane and as she spoke she felt the tender pressure of his arm relax the ungrateful old brute never even left me a legacy then it was that mad mad doctor hed talked him into it remember hes always said in your presence and in mine that the old man was non compos mentis so we can queer his pitch unless he squares usâwe can say enough to set the will aside for undue influence if it was esslin

but it wasnt youve guessed wrong again it was pansyâpansy armadale the daughter of the only woman hed ever cared for he saidâthe child he said hed persecuted for her fathers sake and he went on to say he left her for her mothers sake and to make amends for all that persecution all his estate both real and personal whatsoever or wheresoever whether in possession reversion contingency or expectancy absolutely not altogether that he hated her less but that he hated the crawling liars around him more and because of the disappointment it would be to judex esslin elmer bring and jane collins wasnt he a bad old man dont it seem like a judgment that she wasnt to live to have it

ah i know what youre thinking she went on when she and elmer had walked some paces in unbroken silence youre thinking what a pity it was she wouldnt look at youâwouldnt listen to youâthat gideon wouldnt fall in with your scheme and make her marry you you know you were always sweet on her for all the difference in your ages thats why i always hated her worst of all dont tell me im dreamingâi know itâgideon told me he used to chuckle when he told me and say there was no fool like an old fool

did he the old vagabond iâi paidâi meanâah he met with his deserts but lets talk of something else janeâthis may alter the complexion of affairs altogether

but the girls dead

yes but she may have left relatives this wants thinking out i wonder who acted for her father meantime if i could only stave off wickham mannersâif only for a month or so i know what ill doâill go down to town ill see him 

austen lisles collapse was attributed not unnaturally to the strain of overwork which his success at the bar had entailed though doubtless it was agreed the shock of learning the fate of the poor girl whom he had prosecuted had proved the last straw which had broken down the overworked system

for many weeks after his sudden collapse at wickham mannerss house in bryanston square he remained in a critical condition and eminent physicians whispered gravely their fears as to brainfever greatly to the dismay of herbert who had of late been conjuring up visions of himself in later life hovering around the bench in the capacity of a judicial body clerkâas also of the tenderhearted but untidy person who tidied his chambers

for hes a gentleman every inch of him the lady in the privacy of the essex head declared to a bevy of others in her own line over a quartern and four outs hed never so much as add up an account and as for examining the items there was no wheres this and wheres that and whats become of so and so and all the thingammy gone already  he knew what was due to his laundress and paid it up prompt and pleasantâand now pore dear there he is with his temperature that igh and his pulse that lowâand heres my best respects

naturally his collapse having happened at their house the wickham mannerses were especially concerned as to his progress and when at length his constitution asserted itself and after a spell of seaair during a short cruise he had returned to town and practice practically convalescent their hospitable doors were among the first he visited

he dined with them en famille and good mrs wickham manners as tenderhearted as she was comely and who had times out of number declared to jack that it seemed such a pity with such a lot of dear nice girls as they knew single that a charming clever man such as austen lisle should have no one to care for him and look after him was especially gracious and sympathetic

we were all quite shocked she said when the news came upstairs wed been waiting and wondering for ever so long before jack sent up and asked me to speak to him and so many of the ladies had enjoyed your conversation at the dinnertableâin fact were talking about you most of the time i mustnt tell you the nice things they said about you

yes by jove it gave us all an awful shock said wickham manners i can tell you the judge was dreadfully upset old aynsley dell couldnt have been more grieved if youd been his son well needless to say we were all shocked and pained

you are always everything that is kind said lisle as a matter of fact i feel i owe everybody an apology for making everything so uncomfortable

tut tut ours was the sorrow for your sakeâ everybody is very glad that you have so thoroughly recovered

of course the circumstances were peculiarly distressing said mrs wickham manners as i understand you were reading the account of that terrible calamity in which the poor soul whom youd prosecuted perished

yes yes  said wickham manners bending his brows and with a quick appealing glance at his wife i am sure austen would rather not discuss the matter forgive me my dear shall we talk about something else come the academy the operaâoh i know nowâheres a subject you arc great onâservants

i am sure im not one of those bores of women who are always chattering about their senants certainly my maids as a rule arc excellentâthey stay with me quite a time

yes laughed wickham manners cissie has them straight up from the country transforms them from raw rosy country lasses into pattern housewivesâthen just as they are drilled to perfection off they go with the grocers man butchers man the milkmans man or some other tradesmans man all smiles and beams with cissies advice in their ears and her wedding presents in their boxes

and the dear souls all turn out well said comely mrs wickham manners oh and do you know ive recently engaged a most interesting girlânot as a maidservant nor yet quite as a governess originally she came as a sort of help to assist in the nursery with needlework and as she was evidently quite a lady i got her to take the younger children with their lessons she seemed quite delighted and theyre so fond of her and then we made a most glorious discoveryâwe found that miss sylvester thats her name was absolutely a genius with music âplays exquisitely with the most beautiful touch the butler entering delivered a message in an undertone to wickham manners who replied you told him i was at dinner

yes sirâbut he said the business was most urgent 

why didnt he come to my office before i left i object to seeing people here on businessâbesides its most unprofessional then to his wife and austen its a man named dringâelmer dring ive had to make certain demands of himâas a matter of fact unpleasant ones hes come up to ask if ill see himâi think i must decline

elmer dring exclaimed austen lisle passing his hand across his brow stay dont send him awayânever mind me in fact after your interview with him id like a chat with him myself he was a witness against the poor girl you were speaking ofâpansy armadale 

ill tell you what i said wickham manners if you dont mind ill ask you to be present at the interview having regard to the nature of the business it would be just as well to have a witness to it

meanwhile elmer bring waiting in the library drummed with his feet in impatient agitation

its like his insolence to keep me kicking my heels here like a lackey he muttered id tell him soâif i dared if he hadnt got the whiphand ah

he started up as the door opened in a tremor of agitation for he was come on ticklish business

but a scowl of malignant dismay convulsed his features when he observed the man he had come to temporise with to wheedle into clemency practically into condonation of lachesâcandid people would have said of fraudâwas accompanied by one of the most astute as well as rigidly conscientious menâone of the most trenchant crossexaminers at the bar of england

iâi must apologise for this intrusion elmer faltered but my business is urgent and with a glance at the other confidential

indeed wickham manners answered drily

and yet i can well understand that nothing but the most urgent business would necessitate my being approached on a professional matter in my private house

i knowâi knowâand i have to ask your indulgenceâbut it is a matter of life and death to me as you will understand else l would not presume to ask an interview with you upon that matterâalone

and again his glance travelled significantly from wickham manners to his companion

oh as to that the master of the houseâand of the situation said airily putting his cigarette this is mr austen lisle austen this is mr elmer bringâbut i take it introduction would be superfluous eh

i have met mr bring said austen quietly

and the other with even abnormal unctuousness replied all the world knows mr austen lisleâthe hope or the despair if i may say so of the evildoer accordingly as he is for or against him and he added pleadingy but our business mr wickham manners is strictly private

i beg your pardon the other replied seeing how matters stand at present i would much prefer this interview to take place in the presence of a third party

oh really  squired elmer that is unreasonableâimpossible 

then said the other man decisively the interview is altogether impossible

elmer paused baffled he knew that he who faced him was a man of his word as firm of purpose as clear of brain and his sycophantic smile gave way to the sullen darkling of the found out cheat at bay

what does he know about it he growled

nothingâas yet i am going to state the positionâunless you object and this interview is to terminate immediately

go on then  said the other only remember were all birds of a feather

what do you mean said wickham manners sternly that we are members of the same professionâat present i admit mr lisle belongs io one branch of it i and for the present youâto another

there was a world of significance in that for the present that made elmer drings flesh creep

meantime the other went on to state the case

some eighteen months ago this gentlemanâwe attorneys are all gentlemen you know lisleâ by act of parliamentâsomewhat mysteriously absented himself from the town of dassborough where he practised and certain of his clients found some difficulty in tracing also the whereabouts of their trust funds in some cases their titledeeds after an absence of almost a year he again turned up almost as mysteriously as he had disappeared and sundry pressing claims were at all events temporarily satisfied not however all   

a certain confiding widow woman for whom mr

dring had acted but for whom i am now concerned alarmed for the safety of a sum of a thousand pounds mr dring had persuaded her to commit to ills hands for investment pressed for the immediate return of her money and at last declined to be content with mr drings assurances as to its safety unwilling however to proceed to extremities in the case of one whom she had for years regarded as the personification of honour and integrity she temporised to the extent of accepting in lieu of so many pounds sterling mr drings promissory note at three months for the amount and a letter acknowledging that he had misapplied the moneys entrusted to his case   

three months elapsed three monthsâsix months elapsed that note long since matured remains unpaid dishonoured and mr dring has been unable to wheedle it out of his quondam client for the simple reason that she consulting me as a friend of many years standing placed it together with instructions to safeguard her interests in my hands as a matter of fact at the present moment it reposes in that identical safe   

you see lisle i have waived professional formality in receiving not only the debtor but the security within my domestic threshold

elmer dring was staring in the direction indicated at the unpretentious private safe holding that which was of such moment that was as near and yet so far

and he ransacked his memory in quest of any clue to any exceptionally gifted burglar whom he might have shielded from his full deserts

that said wickham manners is the position of affairs now comes mr elmer dring solicitor of the supreme court with particulars perhaps as to his own position or anyway of his proposals

my position is this said elmer dring my funds are still locked up the two last words halted in his throat he didnt like the sound of them moneys very very tight just now and hang it all  he went on suddenly were brother solicitorsâim in a holeâthings have gone wrong with me in a sequence ever since he drew a gaspâthinking of the time since when you must give me time i 

i think it very possible said wickham manners that any one of his majestys judges before whom the matter might be brought would feel constrained to give youâtime 

ah but youd never go so far as that were brother solicitors

youll pardon me from observing said wickham manners that it is you who appear to have overlooked that circumstance

i knowâi know the other mumbled and i know how down they are uponâpeople in my position nowaday its so easy for the judges to be independent of them to be down on them now the time is far away when they looked to them to make them butâcome come youre not going to extremities theres no money to he got out of a criminal prosecution

perhaps not said manners but its a beautiful screw so many people who will face with confidence your special or your common jury in any division of the high court you please and play the glorious and timehonoured game of bluff to perfection have a morbid horror of facing a judge and jury trying the issues in the less rarefied atmosphere of the old bailey

dring winced then exclaimed spasmodically i swear i meant to make things straight and i could have done it i held the trump card in my hands if onlyâah if only she hadnt perished in the flames

siteâwho 

ah you dont knowâyou dont understand but he does you remember mr austen lisle when last we met and when you held the brief for the prosecution in rex versus pansy armadale

wickham manners and his guest exchanged glances of mutual wonder whether under the stress of his ordeal the mans brain was weakening

then wickham manners said please dont imagine mr dring that its a treasure to me to act antagonistically towards any member of the profession it is my honour and my privilege to follow it is a painâbut where a mans duly is in question pain or pleasure must beâout of the question come nowâwe are in the presence of a man whose name is a synonym for professional rectitude lisle between lawyers between men what is your view as to what can be done consistently with mercy with professional brotherhood and with duty

austen lisle in silence strode across the room slowly onceâtwice

your duty he said i need not tell you is consistently with justice first and last towards your clientâjust as it was his duty and if one is to suffer it must be he who forgets not he who remembers his duty

the words fell on elmer dring with the crushing weight of the stroke of doom

for he knew his men he knew those words meant âaction

think it over  he said give me a chanceâ a last chance you dont know what ive gone through ah its easy to talk about the downward path while youre safe upon the tableland at the summitâbut when youre going down the slope its so hard to climb backâits hard to stop ah i everythingâyour own weight even drags you down 

i am sorry said wickham manners but you see my position i am helpless my duty is to my client

from upstairs came melodious piano chords

yesâbut dutys easy when youre in clover when youre on hard pan sometimes its a bitter awkward word to spell you dont know what it means to meâim desperate

door said wickham manners to the servant answering

elmer bring leaning against the rails of the substantial house there under the stairs muttered its all upâits all over if the old fool of a woman hadnt gone to him i might have silenced her by fair means or he clenched his fist as though it gripped some harbinger of silence now which is it to beâa bolt or a smash if only that cursed austen lisle hadnt been there i knowâi know what ill doâill wait and watch till hes clearedâthen ill go backâi dont care how late it isâand see if i cant tackle the other manâalone 

oh the relief of it to exchange that painful interview with duty warring with compassionâto leave the heavy somewhat sombre library for the light and daintiness of cissie wickham manners drawingroom

youve been quite a time she said not crossly but plaintively only that miss sylvester let me coax her to come in and play something i should have been quite crossâor sleepyâor both ill tell you whatâi think we shall want one of those brass plates on this door as well as at lincolns inn fields you know office hours ten till six

awfully sorry little womanâcouldnt help it not quite a routine matterâalmost professional i say austen l am afraid we were very personalâ once or twice cissie austen may smoke maynt he

he may laughed mrs wickham manners i dont think you deserve any indulgence

i dont deserve the dearest little missis in the world but ive got her he chuckled i say dont you think you could manage to coax miss sylvester back again to give us some music such an awfully nice girl austen she came as a lady help and shes an exception in this respect she is a ladyâ and she helps now cissie do persuade her 

id like to jack was the reply but im afraid its hopelessâyou know what a shy girl she is

what  cried austen lisle in these days oh then you must entice her downâwe dont see wonders every day

youre a cynical wretch austen and ive a good mind not to in fact i cant just yet shes putting the two wee birdies into their nestsâtucking them up in byebye and then she says she must mend jackies knickers i should never have got her to come in just now only she knew i was so lonely

and husband and wife entered upon a joint and general panegyric of the paragon young person the veritable angel of the house who had entered into their midst as it were from the clouds for there was an undeniable vagueness about her antecedents who seemed endowed with the almost fairy gifts of patching up the childrens quarrels as neatly as the rents in their pinafores frocks and knickers making their musiclessons their delight instead of their despair controlling them with a sweet and gentle influence suggestive almost of a spell a bright whitemagic

austen lisle so far from being bored by these encomiums found it a novel experience listening to praise instead of blame by the heads of a household towards one of the domestic staff and was possessed of a strange yearning to set eyes on the paragonâthis dodo this blue dahlia this white blackbird and expressed himself accordingly

byandby mrs wickham manners by no means loth to display her prize at the sound of a light footfall flitted across the room and called up the staircase miss sylvester please please come here dear the gentlemen are dying for some music oh do be sweet and come and play something 

there was a whispered colloquy respecting socks to be darned music to be mended accounts to be checked letters to be writtenâmrs wickham mannerss contributions to the discussion mainly consisting of bother let it wait and i wont let you tire yourself

and in result she after a brief exit from the room returned exultantly exclaiming its all right jack here she comesâthe mendings got to wait theres nobody here miss sylvesterâexcept a very very old friend such an old friend that we consider him nobody mr austen lisle mr lisleâmiss sylvester

and austen lisle advancing suddenly halted and stood as though transformed to stone face to face withâpansy annadale

he stood there transfixed astoundedâyet swift as a flash through all over all his bewilderment came like an electric current one thought one warning he must neither by word nor look betray surprise or recognition

it was sheâshe it was no spirit stood before him never was there ghost had dimples no wraith or ghost was ever garbed so daintily neatly sweet vision bright angel that she was she belonged to earthânot yet to heaven

austen lisle felt his great heart his whole being thrilled and filled with a transcending joy that she who stood before him there with downcast eyes the peach bloom deepening in her dimpled cheek and the red lips hiding the teeth that charmed almost as irresistibly as her eyes was spared to life and love

ah yes even though that love were fated to remain mute unspoken for ever and for ever he knew he loved herâthat love had come to him strangely once and for ever

and she standing there with downcast eyes with a strange trembling at her heart in every limb in every nerve seized with a great agitation that she foil certain must betray her ah she recognised him

remember him she had never forgotten him

in that moment sire thought not of the accusing advocate forging against her link by link the chain of damming though mistaken evidence  no she was remembering that summer morning that seemed so jong agoâso many things and such things had transpired since thenâsuch drama such tragedy had been enacted was thinking of his glad song his gay banterâthen of his swift rush to her rescue the contagious courage of his words

but what was his mission now to save her or destroy her

sue waited her fate mute almost like the maiden martyr at the stake in the arena with the lion loosed upon her

so delighted with your music even from a distance i pleaded with my friend and hostess to prevail on you to favour us with more and nearer

a sigh escaped her as from the martyr maiden when in the arena the lion crouched and caressed her feet

swift almost unheeded glances interchanged said on her side my fate is in your hands is it spare or slay and on his spare you ah i would do much to save you

he led her to the piano turned the leaves for her sat as it were entranced listening to the music her fingers wakened from the keys only wanting only wailing to be alone with her to whisper to her words of warning words of hope to tell her that he was on her side believing in herânever never more against her her knight and champion even to the death

and at lastâat last the opportunity came cecilia flitting from the room upon some household matter called a moment to her husband

it was a trifleâmerely a letter from the boy at rugby pleading for a special tip and when that momentous matter had been very briefly settled to the imminently soon satisfaction of the petitioner mrs wickham manners whispered jack how interested they seem in each other  who dear  asked her obtuser half

why austen and miss sylvester didnt you notice he seemed quite struck with her at first i thought they perhaps had met before no dear her husband answered i was thinking of other matters

i knowâi knowâof that man who called just after dinner i wish that he had not called here dont let him come again oh jack she is such a nice girl do you know ive never taken to anyone more spontaneouslyâwouldnt it be splendid for her what castles are you building what matches are you makingâin the air exclaimed her husband my good woman just consider nice girl as she isâwhat do we know of her of her connections of her family herâanything and austen lisleâwith silk waiting for him to ask for a future crown officer a future judge with dozens of women of position interested in him my dear fairy stories are charming but they dont always fit the circumstances of this prosiac world

meantime austen lisle met the challenging pleading wistful gaze and leaning across the piano he whispered oh its you its you you dont know how grateful i am to god ive never known a peaceful hour till now since that day you disappearedâout of the dock

found guilty  she almost wailed guiltyâon the case you laid before them 

ah but i only knew what was supplied to me in black arid white as sworn and sworn again orally before me i never knew that it was you until you faced me across the spiked rail of that felon dock i never lived such bitter hoursâmy duty never was so stern

i knowâi understand she answered they told me how gently you struck what little heart you threw into your task and that it was your last words saved me from the laws dread last penalty

alt you knew thatâyou felt that but if you only knew how when it was all over something seemed to tell me you were innocent that it was all blunder or crime that overshadowed you how i set to work yes analysing everything by later lights scheming out almost to the end a new line of defence for you and then there came the appalling news ofâyou understand and when that blow fell on me they thought that it had killed me 

he hushed his voice at the sound of returning footsteps of the gay glad voices only in a whisper he added swiftly but you must be careful that man that liar that perjurer i believeâthat rogue and thief i know âelmer bring has been hereâmay be here again  she repressed her sudden terror as jack and cecilia approached in her ear more swiftly still austen lisle breathed one last whisper can i see you aloneâeven for a few minutes yes she answeredâwondering when and where and how

ere those puzzles had been solved the door opened and she seemed rapt in the music she was playing

it was scarce eleven when austen lisle departed from the house scarcely a minute past when mrs wickham mannerss lady help volunteered to slip out with the letter answering affirmatively that petition from rugby school throwing a wrapper round her shoulders she flitted to the nearest pillarbox and there beside it in the lamplight she facedelmer dring

the man for his part turned as if to fly only terror held him paralysed

itsâits true he whispered horasely the dead can come back ive tried not to believe itâ said to myself that youâand gideon would only come backâin my dreams

and thenâshe gave a gasping cry

he passed his hand across his brow in a wild amaze he drew a deep slow breath

why then there was some wonderful blunder somewhere it was an image of flesh and blood living breathing that stood before himânot a vision come back out of the unseen to appal himâ step by step to drive him on to the brink of the terrible abyss he felt rather than knew to be awaiting himânearer every day every moment nearer

she had not perished no matter what had happenedâhe knew not cared not what the details the inbetween might beâshe had not died there was one stain the less upon his guilty soul to know d for certain to confirm the wild exultant assurance leaping in his heart and make it double sure forward he sprang with outstretched hand to touch her âto feel the contact of her living flesh

and she at the touch as at a reptiles sting drew back her hand brushing with the other the place he had touched

so you got awayâsomehowâand everybody thought you were amongst the others

then one by one details flashed across his brain âpieced one by one together

the house she had left was wickham mannerssâ the house he was waiting to return to austen lisle had left it elmer had crouched in the shadow as he passed him only a few minutes back

the letter pansy had just posted and that his eyes had followed in stupefaction had borne the name wickham manners his exultation gave another wilder leap and swift there flashed across his brain one predominating reflectionânot of thankfulness for that one stain less but a suggestion shaping into a scheme

she was going back into that house wherein they lay he could indicate the room and the position within the room of the safe that held the documents that dammed him to her the girl who had escaped how he neither knew nor cared from the durance to which he had hounded herâto which he again could hound her during his majestys pleasureâ that was the courts decreeânor had his majesty revoked his pleasure

his majestys pleasureâthat was the penalty still awaiting her that was the rod chance had placed in elmers hand to wield in terror over her

the star of hope gleamed bright again within his breast as he beheld ahead of him the means by newer villainies to evade the consequences of villainy already done

he remembered too that will of gideon abbsâ the will that believing pansy dead leaving no relatives he had looked upon as wastepaper jane collins must get possession of that will as she had promised to then he would hold two trump cards in his hand

put one trick at a time

so youre not dead after all he went on still in a vehement undertone what a bit of luckâfor meâand what a blow for jane youre going back to that house

yes pansy murmured  unless you hinder me thems a haven for me there mr dringâtheres safety and kindness there ah youve done me wrong enough even your bitterness towards me for heaven only knows what cause has been assuaged by now youll let me go my wayâyou wont harm me any more

no i wont hinder you pansy he answered unctuously i wont prevent your going back to that house you call your havenânot i i wouldnt be so unreasonable so hardhearted it wouldnt suit my book oh yes pansy my dearâafter all youre just as pretty as everâyou shall go back i want you to go back you can help me wonderfully by going back   

one good turn deserves another pansy you play my gameâill play yours ill hold my tongueâill never breathe a word only a bargain to be valid requires a consideration you maynt know that but thats lawâcommon law and common sense a consideration pansy value received pansy it may be in malt but its the consideration makes the bargain binding what is your consideration answered pansy in a quiet steady tone wondering what particular variety of iniquity was now fructifying in this villains malignant brain

a mere bagatelle my dear the master of that house though he may be kind to youâyou see youre a pretty girlâmen will be men 

he rubbed his hands and chuckled

mr dring try to remember that men neither need me nor are they allâelmer drings

you little spitfire theres some of the vixen left in you yet i was going to say the master of that house your friend is my enemy that man holds two documents which are as dangerous to me pansy as my knowledge of your antecedents is to you do you understand dont you see that that man holds a rod in terrorem over meâjust as i hold one over you  i want you to snatch that rod out of his hand

what do you mean

you know the room he calls his library  you know the little private safe let into the wall those documents arc in that safe ill give you full description of them now you must get at that safeâ somehow you must get hold of the keys and

rob my benefactorsâbetray those who trust me âreturn evil for goodârepay kindness generosity with treachery elmer dringâgod knows that i have suffered much but even my suffering thank god has not so changed me

you see that policeman ive only to beckon himâto say a dozen wordsâand he arrests you as an escaped convict

then beckon him speak your words send me back to endure the penalty of anothers crime â during the pleasure of his majestyâthat perhaps you can do one thing you cannot doâyou cannot make me the reptile that you are

the constable came nearerânearer in passing he glanced inquiringly at the girl with the troubled as well as pretty face talking there by the lamppost with the old man whose back was towards him

but that old man said not even one word as he passed on the contrary he paused there baffled and irresolute until the slow footbeats died away

i know what ill do he said ill follow you back to the houseâill tell wickham manners whom he is harbouringâi will if you wont play my gameâi ll spoil yours defy me if you dare 

she leaned against the pillarbox as though rebooting and elmer dring deeming that she wavered and seeking to follow up his advantage went on i swear i will pansy nowâthink it well over remember what youve gone throughâfancy how youd like to go back to it think of your surroundings nowâthink of those youve escapedâthose that i can send you back to what i ask wont harm youâit wont be a farthing out of his pocket youre not robbing himâyoure only keeping him from being spiteful from crushing me   

you wont then by alls thatâunholy ill crush you i will i swear i will ill go straight to him nowânow rememberâyouve only got to say the wordâyouve only got to promise to stay me if you wont ill denounce you once i enter that door the door of that houseâyour haven âis closed to you for ever 

and then step by step he made his way towards that house whose cosy gleaming windows were the stormbeaten pansys harbour lights pausing now and then to listen to her call looking back for her to beckon him nearing the steps up to its portals he called back through the stillness of the night i swear i will 

then he made as though to ascend the steps and there he halted

the threat had failedâthe bluster had been futile

but never mind there was one more trumpcard left the will of gideon abbs was no wastepaper now he could see wickham manners trueâwould temporise with him pansy in the land of the living if she would not snatch the rod from that mans hands would be herself a very potent rod to wield over the other man

id like to but i mustnt give away the show for her just yet he growled as he retraced his stops i know these fools theyd take her part no no ill send her hackâbut not just yet and not that way  and he returned to the spot where he had left her standing

but she was standing there no longer

rage and frantic terror filled once again his being

pansy he calledâthen again louder and louder yet but no answer came and he looked vainly around for any sign of her

ting the clock on the overmantel chimed the quarter

good heavens hasnt miss sylvester returned mrs wickham manners exclaimed

crossing to the stairhead she called to the servantsâreceiving a negative answer after a little fuming she resumed her book and wickham manners his pipe at last pettishly she closed the volume

this isnt like miss sylvester she said i call it a liberty to remain out without speaking to meâ at this hour

its certainly rather odd said wickham manners knocking out the ashes of his pipe

and so they waited while the minutehand crept slowly down and at last the tiny chime rang out again recording the halfhour

then jack growled i wish to goodness that young person would come backâi want to lock up and get to bed

its too bad said cecilia im quite cross with herâfor giving me occasion to be cross with her anyway wed better send the maids to bed we cannot wait longer

confound it growled the lawyer irresolutely cant understand it its so unlike her i say its just possible that something may have happened to her ill slip on my boots again and take a turn round the square

and donning a cap he went out and strolled along the deserted pavement looking to right and left

presently he returned with a puzzled expression

havent you seen her asked his wife

not the least trace of her ive been to the pillarbox im dashed if i know what to make of it then he laughed a little nervously and jerkily i say cisâit would be rather odd wouldnt it if any of the forebodings of the people who warned us of the danger of taking people without references justified themselves eh  if the paragon young person who arrived so mysteriously from goodness knows where departed mysteriouslyâgoodness knows where 

jack jack dont talk like that you make me feel quite inclined to cry how we should miss herâespecially the children

gad itd be an awful joke only it would be more than a joke if we missed anything else he laughed uncomfortably for though he was naturally by no means prone to suspicion he was a lawyerâwith experiences

the three quartersâmidnightâchimed faster the clockhands seemed to wend their way her room in every room in the house they for her the whole household now seriously perturbed waited and watched for her till the long hours gave way to the small ones

they interrogated the policeconstable on the beat and the mystery deepened when he reported having seen a young lady answering the description of sylvester in conversation with a man whose back was towards him

all through the night mrs wickham manners awoke listening for the knock at the door or the dinging of the bell that never came instead the morning came without any sign or trace of the girl with the gentle voice the gentle face with the clever deft industrious hands

they could scarcely believe that one who had so come amongst them could have left so strange a void in that household that they could so much have missed that gentle presence

they missed nothing else and wickham manners was angry with himself for having voiced such a suggestion and ill at ease he wondered if the case of miss sylvester was to be numbered amongst the mysterious disappearances ever and anon occurring in the midst of londons teeming millions

jane collins was departing her wages had been paid she had corded her boxes as strenuously as though each had been the neck of the master she was leaving

she was going to leave dassborough by the first train after lunch and it was now just after breakfast

her face was whiter than ever with rage at the reflection that all her efforts to get level with her new master had been futile that she had been tricked into perjury by him into swearing hard and fast at pansys trial to the lies he had so cunningly sketched out and this was the rewardâdismissal at a months notice as though she had been a mere housemaid of a few weeks service

true there had been the gratification of sending that hussy of a girl almost to the scaffoldâanyway to prison for lifeâas it turned out she deemed to death but that was beside the bargain she had been fooled that villain downstairs had flung to earth the ladder whereby he had reached his ends

when she remembered the will there in the library bureau she almost wished the hussy of a girl had lived anyway long enough for darrell to be dispossessed but aggravating to the end she had perished just when she might have been of use to jane and so far elmer had sent no news of any heir or nextofkin to her having been discovered

and now a few hours more and she would have left that lone house wherein she for so many years had had her way and would be more powerless than ever to repay the grudge she nursed against man who having used her and her malice to his ends was flinging her aside anxious to be rid of her

there he stood down there on the new trimkept lawn chatting with judex esslin that other tailor who for two pins would swear away her liberty with his mad manic theories just as heâ and sheâhad sworn away pansys

a telegraphlad came hustling towards the gate in his hand a tancoloured envelope from which he read in a shout a name collins

jane flew down just in time to snatch it from the lad ere he had complied with her masters here you are he was given to handling and scanning letters and telegrams whether addressed to himself or others

this time janes glance said no you dont

she wouldnt even open it in his presence instead she waited till she had regained the room hers for so many years for a few hours more then she said will at any risk or cost immediatelyâ elmer

then what had happened had elmer who was so clever at foraging amongst registers tombstones family bibles and so on found that the hussy had some kith and kin still living oh it would be delightful even at the eleventh hour to get quits with that goodlooking vagabond down there with the scornful look in his eyes and the contemptuous curl of his lips

yes he was still down there on the lawn in her pocket she fumbled for that rusty key then she crept down the staircase to the library

good luck the doer was unlocked and that brute of a great dane was crouched within the hall doors regarding that master who seemed the only being not afraid of him and of whom only he was afraid stealthily she crept across towards the bureau deftly slipped the key which she with forethought had oiled into the lock pulled open the drawer

yes it was still there

in a moment she had thrust it within her bodiceâclosed and relocked the drawer she stole from the room and crept softly up the first few stairs scrambled up the rest and scuttling into her room locked herself in for she heard lucifer the great dane with a growl scamper up from belowâhis keen pricked ears catching the sound of even her stealthy footsteps

hallo there she heard the hated voice of the man ceasing to be her master what ails you lucifer whats wrong lad

for answer the big hound only growled sullenly harvey darrell glanced sharply round the room gave here and there a tug at a boxlid or drawerhandle

have any of you meddled with the dog he called to his servants and they answered no

jane collins he shoutedâonceâtwice

then from above there came a snappish well what do you want now

have you been prowling down here i know you hate this hound have you been meddling with him

not iâi hate the beast as i hate the devilâand some other people as for prowling about your houseâthe sooner i prowl out of it the betterâand the best times now

and she called loudly to the kitchenboy to fetch a taxicab for her boxes

in due time it arrived harvey darrell watched her keenly descending the stairs meaning to see her gone without a word but as she passed him she said between closeset teeth good morning master

good morning he said curtly

youve got the place all to yourself now master

yesâfortunately 

for the time being

what do you mean hadnt you better clear without any insolence

insolence and she laughed insolently goodbye masterâfor the present

goodbye collins he said drily my regards to elmer

ill be sure to give em she said with such emphasis that he set to work wondering as he watched her descend the stairs

what was in the wind what was to be her next move what was the hurry

she had timed her departure for three hours later âand for the hundredth time he wondered what had she and elmer dring been whispering that night when he had shadowed them along the lane beside the lone house

he strode into the room he made his den mechanically again tugged at this lid this drawer and thatâparticularly at one drawer of the old bureau

something glistening on the escutcheon of the keyhole caught his eyeâhe touched itâlooked at his moistened fingerâsmelled it

oil he murmured

then swiftly he whipped out his keysâhung open the drawer

the will was gone

stop that woman he shouted down the stairs and through the window then to the great dane lucifer hey boy stop her

and baying furiously the huge hound scrambled up and off at his command

jane collins impedimenta laden flung back the wicket with a gesture of defiance she was shaking the dust of the lone house from her feet just then under compulsionâbefore long perhaps it would be somebody elses turn her heart leaped with the consciousness of what she held concealed close to it

then fell sheer and sudden as a plummetâat the sound of the great danes menacing howlâat the sound of his swift stampeding bound in her wake another moment like a black and white streak he had whirled past her had turned was crouching between her and the cabdoor the handle of which the startled driver had let goâwas growling and snarling with ominous bloodshot eyes displaying menacing fangs within those cavernous red jaws

the trembling jane welcomed even the arrival on the scene of harvey darrell even although he laid an arresting hand upon her shoulder commanding her to stay

what do you mean mind what youre doing  he exclaimed remember im not a slave no not even a servant now 

but youre still one thingâyoure a thief 

a what you brute you coward hereâ driver you heard what he called me just fetch a policeman to hear it too ah heres elmer dring elmer this mans just called me a thief

and is going to search your boxes

hes going to search my boxes what do you think ive stolen mr a vâeh

he knit his brows thunderously then laughed contemptuously and elmer dring who had hurried down to dassborough and who now considered it was his turn to take an innings remarked there must be some mistake surely mrâ ahemâharvey darrell has no intention of a gross interference with the liberty of the subjectâparticularly in the case of his late relatives trusted housekeeper 

mr harvey darrell intends to mind his own business and to brook no interference said the other now jane collins you know what you have stolen 

the woman thus challenged replied with a glance of malignant exultation then with anotherâa telegraphic lookâmet the inquiring gaze of elmer dring who read plainly that his wire had been received and acted on

stolen thats a very ugly word to use cried jane

and in the presence of a solicitor chimed in elmer dring

to say nothing of a third party said jane with a meaning look at the taxidriver who might find it worth his while to keep his ears and eyes open stolen indeed mr harvey darrell a v what have i stolen is it gold or silver that you ripped down wainscots and tore up floors and hearthstones to find

you know what youve stolenâa certain document from a certain drawer of the bureau in there not gold or silver just a bit of paperânot worth a penny jane collins but i want it and you dont move those boxes till its given up

oh ho said jane then to the taxidriver just put that black box on the seat

but harvey darrell promptly placed his foot on the black box which jane collins seemed most anxious to remove and at a look from his master the great dane checked the drivers movement with a significant growl

jane collins guessing the drift of his suspicion began to manifest a feverish anxiety to get that box away

you can keep all the rest she said but i want that one there are someâsome keepsakes in it

ill keep your keepsakes jane unlessâyou give me up that document come come ill do a deal with you ill compound the larceny its only worth its value as wastepaper but ill give you a tenner for it

and elmer dring said unctuously folding his hands what generosity a tenner for a document not worth the paper that its written on you observe jane so valueless that your late respected master could scarce recover it by legal process since de minimis non curat lex which means jane that the law wont trouble its wise head over trifles

harvey darrell ignoring elmer repeated his offer come come a tenner for that paper

and jane inquired with exasperating vacuousness  what paper

you know you old baggageâthe will of gideon abbs its no good to you do you think i shouldnt have destroyed it if it had been of any use to anyoneâbut with pansy dead leaving no relatives its null and void

and youll give me ten pounds for it laughed jane raucously ten pounds for whats worth nothing come along elmer well send the police after my boxes  well be goingâunless he means to set his hound on us hed like to if he dared

she had stepped into the taxicab elmer had followed

drive to the station hotel she said

harvey darrell paused irresolute wondering how much jane collins who had addressed him meaningly as a v really knew feeling uncomfortably conscious that for once he had been perhaps precipitate

ill send the policeman for my boxes said jane keeping up her assumption of anxiety to the last now are you going to let me take that black one you can hold all the rest

you can send for them he said meantime i mean to ransack them

the station  said jane to the taxidriver and she whispered something else to elmer bring whose face lit up as he turned to harvey darrell and in a voice of quiet triumph said good afternoon a v or rather au revoir it would have been a shame to have sold you for ten pounds something not worth the paper that its written onâwith pansy dead but something worth a hundred thousand poundsâwith pansy armadale alive 

pansy armadale alive

darrell standing there irresolute for a while felt a wild thrill at his heart what did elmer mean

was it a piece of empty bluff designed to move him to render up those hostages oh if it were only true

should he speed up the receding taxi and even at that last moment drag the flabby lawyer rogue from where he sat clenching his hands upon his throat until for once the truth was wrenched from him 

not too long he hesitatedâthe taxi turned the bond pansy was deadâelmers words were surely only bluffâthe empty bluff of a baffled beaten man

hi you there he called to the manservant carry these things indoorsâbring me a chisel and a mallet

then for an hour or so he knelt among the litter and debris of janes ravaged boxes turning the contents over and over finding no trace of gideon abbss stolen will but faced with the consciousness that jane had tricked himâand that she and elmer dring were becoming dangerous

meanwhile the precious pair the subjects of his thoughts en route to the railwaystation discussed their plans elmer anxious to be upon the track of pansy suggested they should repair forthwith to london

but jane was firm not to say obdurate at dassborough elmer could put up the banns or give the necessary notice to the registrar at once in a new district residential qualification would be necessary and at the station hotel she took up her quarters and her stand though trains might come and trains might go and elmer might go on for ever

nor would she entrust even her elmer with that will betraying rather a due appreciation of the gentlemans character than of blind and touching confidence in his integrity

when he asked how would the world go on if everyone were as incredulous as you she answered it would have gone much better for you elmer âso many people would not have trusted you and you would not have run so many risks of doing time

elmer quoted sundry proverbs jane replied with others

more haste less speed  quoth he

never put off till tomorrow what can be done today she retorted

marry in haste and repent at leisure  he said  bind safe find  she answered

lente he urged that is make slowly

delays are dangerous said jane

suppose we wait dear jane he suggested until i have tracked down pansy

suppose we dont promptly responded jane conjuring visions of elmer happening on pansy the  and selling secrets to her coming to terms with her possibly taking steps to undo the wrongs that he had done her harbouring once again the designs that she knew he had harboured in gideons lifetime

since the news of her supposed untimely fate a great revulsion of feeling had arisenâpeople were talking especially in the locality of the heroism displayed by the girl in the hour of supreme agony and peril of her resourcefulness selfsacrifice the act and surpassing courage whereby she had saved the little enid the glorious altruism of her last reckless dash back into the flames to save the poor demented creature who had threatened her own life these things they were saying were incompatible with instincts and motives such as had been attributed to her such as an erring human had convicted her of being swayed by

and her erstwhile custodian the father of enid was moving heaven and earth to have justice done even to the memory of the girl who he believed had died after so nobly rescuing his child pansy found to be alive jane collins was haunted by a conviction that his majestys pleasure would speedily take the shape of his majestys pardon even the prospect of turning the tables on harvey darrell hardly reconciled jane to such a turn of fortunes wheel for pansy

later in the clay the ladys stronger will prevailed elmer attended to the registry and notice of the contemplated marriage was forthwith given then elmer bring set to work athinkingâwondering and scheming how to find pansy armadale and this done how to lose jane collins

and thinking out these things he journeyed back to town

all through his work next day austen lisle with impatience longed to get it over when at last at four oclock the court he was addressing rose he hurried back to chambers determined to cut short as possible his consultations and dropping in as was frequently his wont at the wickham mannerses for five oclock tea steal by hook or by crook an interview with pansy

for meantime he had sketched out a course for her to follow she must disclose her identity to those beneath whose roof she lived it would not be hard for her to make a clean breast of her story to a good soul like cecilia with whom at all events her secret would be safe even if she or jack wickham manners felt any scruples about harbouring her as to which austen had few misgivings there was always nannie nepean

come what might with a straight man and a straight woman like jack and cecilia all must be straight and above board

returning to his chambers he scrambled through his consultations had just exchanged his bands for the cravat of ordinary civilisation and herbert had just despatched his junior for a taxi when a familiar step came bounding up the staircaseâand into his room dashed jack wickham manners

austen he cried so deuced glad ive found you here

youre only just in time replied the other another minute and i should have been hustling towards your house to ask cecilia for some tea and probably discuss a rather strange affair with both of you

ive come to discuss a very strange affair with you austen and i bring strange news something mysterious has happened at the house you know miss sylvester the girl we thought so much of who charmed you with her playing

yes yes what of her asked austen in strange agitation

she has gone 

gone when where

andwickham manners answered she left our house last night scarce two minutes after you and none of us has set eyes on her nor has any trace of her been discovered since

last nightâscarce a few minutes after he had left

then austen lisle remembered the crouching form skulking in the shadows by the railings just as he hailed and sprung into a passing taxi remembered the wonder flitting across his brainâwas it the form of elmer dring and why was he skulking there and now events had answered him it had been elmer crouching in those shadows like a ghoul and no matter what his design this he for certain had effected he had lured or frightened pansy armadale away

oh if only he austen had loitered to watch him if that taxi whose appearance he had voted such a lucky chance had not rattled by and borne him clubwardsâif only only if how slight how fitful and how chanceful the winds that waft our destinies like thistledown

but the first step was to tell jack wickham manners who the girl known as miss sylvester was leaving him in turn to tell cecilia so far from this news awakening any spirit of resentment or repulsion all that happened was that their sympathy for pansy intensified and their belief in her innocence was strengthened

the next again to interview the constable upon the beat and make the most of what was left of that casual survey of the man whose back was towards him and by comparing height and appearance and particularly by the constables recollection that the gentleman had white wavy hair falling on to his collar austens own theory was confirmed elmer dring had encountered herâhad scared or taken her away

it was no very difficult task for the eminent solicitor and famous barrister to set all available machinery of investigation in motion but this had to be done very tactfully since they although anxious to avail themselves of scotland yards assistance to trace the young lady known as miss sylvester by no means desired to put scotland yard upon the track of pansy armadale

byandby came news of such a girl having been seen hurrying through a certain square as if fearful of pursuit and of one answering the description wandering later listlessly along the thoroughfares farther off of at a later hour at a more distant point such a girl evidently worn and tired buying a cup of coffee at a stall seeming a lady from the way she asked and expressed her thanks for itâ and presumably straight they said from the way she shrank from the intrusiveness of some who passed remarksâhooligans one wearing a much displaced dresstie another neither cravat nor collar

both stallkeeper and policeman remembered noticing her because they had both definitely advised both said hooligans to leave her alone

so austen lisle picked up clues of her here and there following which he traced her from district to district

later that same night while wickham manners awaited in bryanston square austens return and started up alert at the sound of the doorbell the servant entered and announcedânot mr lisle but  the more unexpected mr elmer dring

you know said wickham manners this sort of thing is quite irregular my clients instructions are very definite and unless you are here to make restitution you ought not to be here at all

im here to pave the way to restitution said elmer dring im here to ask you to hold your handâoh i only such a little while and ill repay every penny that i owe your client with handsome interest events have happened that i never dreamed of only give me just a few days and my position will be alteredâi shall be on velvet

this time elmer dring believed it himselfâsince within the last few hours harvey darrell had waylaid him had bartered with him for the possession of that will for jane collins whom darrell first had approached hadâlest he should with his own hands with violence search her and tear from her the willâ declared that elmer held it

darrell had offered a price for it a big price which it being refused he had doubledâhad trebled when elmer had sworn that pansy was alive âthat he was on his way to meet her

yes elmer dreamed he stood on velvet even if pansy when he found her refused his terms he would make terms with harvey darrell

indeed said wickham manners drily what guarantee have we of thatâexcept your word a form of assurance which you will excuse me remarking my client has not found too reliable

i know i know ive been the victim of circumstances but circumstances have alteredâ peculiarly i am here with a double purpose i want to ask about someone in whom im interested a young lady whos been staying here

ah yes said wickham manners eyeing him keenly what of her

on her everything depends as far as i am concerned  for if i can lay my hands on her i can square your clients claim twice over

wickham manners listening to and watching elmer dring wondered what special variety of fraud or lie was he just then concocting he could understand his wanting to hound down the helpless girl for malicious motives but how the discovery of her could benefit dring he failed to comprehendâ seeing that she could not buy his silence

suppose you leave off talking in parables mr dring he said and suppose you tell me all you know about miss sylvester and how by tracing her you expect to place yourself upon a sound financial basis

elmer for a few moments paused undecided how to begin his story and ere his indecision was at an end the manservant entered and before wickham manners by a sign could silence him had announced austen lisle and at the sound of that name elmer changed his tactics and his mind

austen lisle again austen lisle who knew the girls indentityâwho perhaps was on her track

ill call again tomorrow mr wickham manners he said

then he withdrewâagain to watch and wait there in the shadows of the square watching for austen lisle waiting to shadow him

midnight once moreâand pansy found herself still homeless and weary almost unto death for little recking who and what awaited her she had flitted out of the house that had been her haven of comfort unprepared for any journey scarcely a shilling in her pocket

morning came and found her wanderingânoon and she wandered still and when the noonday sun was sinking faint with hunger as well as weariness she wandered on pausing ever and anon to snatch a little restâthen to escape notice journeying on again not with any settled destination not even with any settled route but on and on knowing neither whither nor whence she journeyed till the dusk deepened into dark and from tower and steeple came longer and longer chimes

and at last under nights starspangled purple robe she stood alone upon the bascule of the tower bridge leaning wearily and worn out upon its parapet watching with dull eyes the myriads of stars move the myriad lights twinkling to right and left below and the big river shrouded deep down there in the dark with the shadows ever and anon of big ships gliding to and from far lands

ah the world for her seemed dark the little light that seemed so very far awayâtoo far to be reachedâthe forces of despair were closing round her were crushing her irresistibly downâdown to there in the dark where the darker shadows flitted

she thought of tantalus for ever mocked with luscious fruits just beyond the reach of his parched lips the while his being was consumed with thirsty fever

what had she done nothing of any harm and since she harmless guiltless was thus to be tortured why not the darkness of swift moments leading to oblivion rather than the darkness of more waitingâmore agony

oblivion  looking up she saw a star ah well worst or best it might be betterâcould it be worse down there thanâwhat remained

and in the wilful blindness of her despair she gave one wailing cry for forgiveness clenched the rail closed her eyes and nerved herself to one mad soring

a hand was laid upon her armâa strong restraining hand albeit its hold was kindly a voice called swiftly pansy stay a strong compelling voice for all its tone was tender and in her heart awoke responsive tender chords

for it was his voice

pansy he whispered you werent thinkingâ werent contemplatingâthat

and he placed around her a sheltering arm within it she nestled close to his heart feeling safer there murmuring no no please godâonly the darkness seemed to gather round me

then she let him lead her from her bridge of sighs her bruised and wounded heart soothed by his gentle words and ways out of the darkness into the light warmth and comfort back from despair to rest and hope back to the haven she had left

and cecilia wickham manners opening wide her door her arms her true englishwomans heart enfolded within them that poor weary trembling dove of the draggled plumage and the wearied pinionsâbut thank heaven unsoiled

when that open hospitable door closed behind austen lisle and the girl he had brought back within it elmer dring deeming he had shadowed well and wisely again approached even at that late hour

it was jack wickham manners himself who faced him on the threshold demanding what he wanted there at that untimely hour

i want to come to terms with you wickham manners

for what

for the possession of those two documents

well then you know the termsârestitution

ive an alternative proposal but the doorstep isnt the place for one professional man to interview another

nor is one am the hour you know my offices and my office hours good night  

lie was about to close the door when the other stepping forward with outstretched hand said no no not yet look here ive tracked that girl back here these are my terms those documents placed in my handsâand mums the word 

leave my doorstep i value your silence no more than your word

then ill speakâill play the devil only a word from me and back she goes

perhaps not remember she is not friendless now now take your foot from off my thresholdâ i am going to close my door

then you defy me she defies me

for answer he was pushed back and would have fallen down the steps but that he clutched the railing

wickham manners dont be a fool i tell you i have information i can sell herâinformation well worth buyingâi can take it elsewhere you dont know what harm i can do her you dont know what she stands to lose nor what she stands to win

his answer was the click of the latch and the thudding of the lock and bolts as the door closed on him for a while he stood there inarticulateâ beside himself in a paroxysm of baffled fury

very well then  he gasped in a spasm at last its warâwar to the knife between me and that quarter never mind theres harvey darrell left curse him i hate him loathe him but he shall play my gameâhe shall win me my revengeâand she shall lose her fortune and her liberty 

yes it was quite like old times judex esslin and elmer dring agreed seated once again visavis in that room at the old houseâthe very room judex reminded elmer in which they for the last time had sat with gideon abbs had each in turn played chess with him on that eventful night the last on which gideon had played any game

and although elmer dring was evidently anxious to change the drift of the conversation judex still kept harping on it persistently as hamlet harped upon the daughter of polonius and harvey darrell seemed to find the doctors vein of reminiscence

i remember esslin was saying how strangely keen the old man was that night didnt elmer remember how indignant the old man was with over the interest due judex never could understand that for mentioning the matter one day to blinders the latter declared with much emphasis that he had paid the old hunks every penny

yes yes elmer was quite prepared to admit that the old mans brain was beginning to wander but he kept his eyes away from harvey darrells keen ones fixed on him steadily yes harvey darrell was clearly in the mood to encourage the doctors vein of reminiscence albeit elmers mood was opposite

that missing dagger with its snakelike hilt hanging there on the wall elmer tried in vain to keep his eyes away from the old mans asseveration that pansy had stolen itâall these details he encouraged esslin to dwell upon loosening the doctor s tongue to further garrulity by means of the whisky bottle

dont be afraid or it doctorâits like our friend elvers jokes wellmatured

knowâi know how times have changed here do you remember elmer how the old man used to dole it out in that wretched little phial holding just three portions as he used to call them â just about as much as one would get for sixpence at a railway barâthe old hunks 

and do you think he believed she had stolen that poniard harvey asked filling the tumbler halfway up with the mellowed soft insidious old spirit that went down so silkily and whose potency was only realised when the drinker rose

believed it it was proof to me he disbelieved itâthe very fact of his saying it i believed it but he didnt that was strange wasnt it when i used to say quite right mr abbs that girls got the klepto taint he used to jeer at me it seems a judgment on him doesnt it he once said pansy was the only honest soul about him and that he used to call her thief because he knew it hurt her so that was his maniaâhurting people

the oldâthat is my respected relativeâdoesnt seem to have been very extensively lamented said harvey darrell in parts ive been in a man like that would have met withâan accidentâat a much earlier age

what parts  asked his listeners simultaneously

but he answered drily oh various parts

it was a pity though that she went so farâif she did go so far said esslin reflectively

if surely not much virtue in that if  said harvey darrell but leaving the if alone let us have the why

and he refilled the doctors glass

well said esslin i had mapped out things very differently for her it was my design to have married her

both his companions eyed him intently

with all her imperfections on her head asked harvey

well yesâi meant to make a study of her men ought to study their wives i should have demonstrated several of my theories i meant to have developed such symptoms of latent aberrations as i suspected diagnosing observing and recording day by day and step by step

i see said harvey you contemplated a sort of mental vivisection how cheerful for the lady of your choice

i daresay she would have found her position irksome at times but then the martyrs of science must net complain of the thorns in their crowns besides he added gideon abbs had five thousand pounds of hers and he reemptied the tumbler harvey had again refilled

its getting late said elmer have you finished all your visits 

ha ha ha laughed esslin somewhat weirdly a strange light glittering in his eyes he wants to get rid of me just as he did the night were talking about my visits dont take me long nowadays patients dont like me i know too much they fight shy of a man who finds them subject to worse things than they call him in for an idiot who wants to be cured for dyspepsia objects to being told hes subject to congenital cerebral paralysis ive lost my most lucrative patient through telling his wife i saw dipsomania in his eye she wanted to pretend he was a pillar of total abstinence one old fool said hed kick me out of the house because i told his attendant to watch him for suicidal monomania

he glanced significantly at his empty glass then at the whisky decanter and harvey darrell making no responsive sign assisted himselfâliberally

after an awkward pause the doctor laughed a long low vacuous laugh with no meaning in itâ only the pretence of much meaning

you fellows want me to clear outâi knowâim a min reader its my business to analyse th mind mos intresting business too bit ghastlyâsometimes youd hardly credit it old elmer there ought to be in a strait jacket but ill clearâits your turn this time elmer to outstay me goo night darrell only remember your late lamented relative he was very meanâif he hadnt been so mean he wouldnt have groped about in the dark to save the electric light and if he hadnt groped in the darkâit mightnt have happened   

i say elmer if wed been wide awake we should have ripped up the floors before darrell came on the scene always used to wonder why the old man was always hammering at a loose plank goo nightâdont trouble to ringâill let mself out 

he lurched out of the room with an idiotic hiccough

mind the stair grinned elmer then to darrell hadnt you better see him out

why should i trouble he knows the way

but he might pitch down that winding flight and break his neck

all the less reason i should trouble guffawed harvey taking another cigarette now elmer whats it all about cut it short 

the possibilities of that staircase seemed to be appreciated by judex esslin who if one may invert the metaphor avoiding the danger of a middle course found safety in hugging the scylla of the banisters except when clutching the charybdis of the handrail

the man who designed this staircase had a decided homicidal tendency he hiccoughed gravely all the servants gone to bed most discourteous method of speeding a parting guest

reaching the lower landing he noticed through the door ajar a glimmering light paused a moment peered in then stealthily he entered scanning the walls particularly the old panelling thinking of the aged miser who had in the old house hugged his hoard

tut the walls now were bright with varnish such of the old woodwork as was left had been very carefully inspected mr harvey darrell had been there

mentally steadying himself by a supreme effort judex esslinon tiptoe toured the room his beady black eyes now gleaming with strange fires scanning every corner every crevice

then of a sudden he replaced his foot upon the hearthstone which had seemed to yieldâever such a trikeâbeneath it

yes it was loose he suppressed a whistle

glancing round the room his eye caught a massive brazen paperknife and in a moment grasping it in both hands he had knelt beside the hearth and noiselessly lifted away the fender

then with a cautious glance at the open door he listened to the hum of the voices upstairs yes they were both still there

with his improvised implement he prised the illset hearthstone which gave and gave and lifted until at last he had grasped it with the fingers of one handâthen of both silently laboriously he lifted it right up on edge when the fires in his eyes doubled trebled blazed up with the reflection of the glimmering japanned tin cases lying there closely packed together cashboxes without a doubt stuffed with treasury notes and bank of england notes

one feverish hand clutched at a box then withdrew and he caught his breath at the clink he had made

patience patience most haste here indeed would mean less speed

thenâharkâhe started at a strange stealthy sound looking up he listenedâthe hum of voices still continued still distant

but that other soundâthat stealthy slither each moment more distinctânearerânearer was coming up not down was at the door the door which movedâswayed inwards 

and then of a sudden one sound gave way to anotherâthe sound of a menacing deepchested growl and there within the room with eyeballs reflecting that glimmering light like mingled blood and fire crouched the great dane with fangs disclosedâready for the spring

so thats your game and thats the state of it

said harvey darrell well fairs fair if i keep you out of one pitfall you must help me out of another where did you say the girl was

i didnt say at all replied elmer cautiously you bet im not going toâjust yet awhile

have you get the will on you

no sold elmer dring it occurred to me it would be more prudent not to bring it esslins a while going outâperhaps hes left the door more likely hes gone to sleep upon the landing said harvey darrell

is more anybody about to see him out

hell be seen out snapped harvey darrell someone will see to that

but suppose he left the door open and anyone come in

someone will see to that also

elmer crossing the room glanced outside the door

ex ubundanle cautela  he said reclosing the door and resuming his seat nowâyes or no

you want too much elmer its your way

its everybodys way some get itâthats the distinction between clever peopleâand others

yes grinned harvey darrell men are mostly beasts of prey or beasts of burden we dont like burdens elmer

we should be asses if we did returned elmer dring but comeâis our bargain on or off

my good man five minutes consideration isnt unreasonable in a matter involving ten thousand pounds

five thousand when i deliver up the willâthe other five when i deliver up the girl

yyes said the other musingly i suppose the cheques had better be separate

there wont be any cheques rejoined elmer firmly it will be notes

a flimsy precaution said harvey but stay elmer suppose i tell you to go to the devil with your will and your informationâsooner or later you will in due courseâbut i am referring to the present matter hows that girl going to prove that will as soon as she comes into the light shes nabbed

and thats what she wont do responded elmer if i deal with her instead of with you shell find some pleasant spot where extradition treaties dont extend then on her behalf an agent who may be elmer dring will prove the will and get in the dibs  i see  the other nodded and so i guess you guess youve got me set

i think so replied elmer dring else you bet i shouldnt have come here alone of course i know whats in your mindâim here alone youre about as void of scruples as they make em a pistolshot in the lone house would scarce be heard outside

the other man met with a quieter quietus elmer dringâeh

yes murmured elmer keeping his eyes away from that wall

sorneone came very quietly behind him with a handled dagger

yes feebly nodded elmer there have been two verdicts as to that you dont suppose you can go behind them

theres nothing sure in lifeâsave death smiled harvey darrell but as you say this matters business this time youve got me treedâthis time elmer i must come down

i knew youd hallo whats that

both men started at the weird sound of a mans shout mingling with the howl of a beast a crashing fall as of a general upheaval and overheaving of furniture

what the devils that faltered elmer dring trembling fearfully in every limb

and harvey darrell answered between puffs of his cigarette it sounds like lucifer

thats it  said elmer gulping down a drink of the raw whisky its that brute of a great daneâ hes gone for somebody hark to that shout help

yes growled harvey darrell it seems as though judex esslin has been prying

what are you going to do

i suppose said darrell i shall have to go down after all to let him out

for now the turmoil was terrific with the shouts and yells and rumbling and tumbling and shattering and clattering and crashing and smashing and shivering and splintering from below the mingled screams of the affrighted servants the opening of doors and banging of doors

harvey darrell followedâat a distanceâby the awakened maids and the ghastly trembling elmer dring made his way down the winding staircase towards the door of the room he termed his den which now from the sounds emanating from it might have been a den of beasts

help help came a voice the voice of judex esslin

then one yet louder crashing fallâand a moaning soundâafter that a strange silence somehow more appalling than the turmoil

by this time harvey darrell leaping the last halfdozen stairs at a bound dashed into the room lucifer lucifer hallo there down boyâ down down come offâto heelâluciferâto heel

he switched on the electric lightâthen recoiled with a groan of horror at the sight

there in the one space cleared within the debris of wrecked furniture lay the man and the huge hound side by side the fangs of the hound set in the mans throat one of the mans hands gripping the massive collar the other thrust within the fangs and that told what had happened

that judex esslin in extremis had plucked from his waistcoat pocket a tiny capsule he had reserved for himselfâin the event of the worst coming to the worst

man and hound were dead the man had died of  induced in part by terror the hound had died of prussic acid

and harvey darrell spurning aside the body of the man knelt by that of the hound and between his set teeth whispered yes ive lost luciferâand with lucifer i know ive lost my luck

his jane had named the dayâwithout any noticeable shyness

elmer she had said dont forgetâits friday at twelve prompt

friday always was my unâi mean lucky day said elmer pacing by her side in the moonlight along the pain by the railway embankmentâhis own appointed trystingplace and hourâit was quiet there youve brought the document jane

you seem to be more concerned about that than anything else jane observed i believe youd have been just as glad if instead of bringing it id sent it

gladderâi mean gladder still when there wont be any bringing or sendingâwhen we shall be always near each other

just so said jane mentally scheming not to let elmer far or often out of sight

and when i asked my dearest jane to meet me by moonlight alone of course the most joyful anticipation wasâherâher turning up but of course business is business and when its combined with pleasure why its good business lets just have a look at the will 

how dyou know ive got it inquired miss collins coyly

you wouldnt be such aâi mean he said choking back his wrath and impatience you would not be so cruel surely i must have the will my dear jane

but why  she asked its safe enough with me

i want to do a deal with it ive fixed a price

with her she asked with jealous suspicion

no no not with herâwith himâwith harvey darrell

what alter the way hes treated youâand me

youve bargained with the man we hate

the more one dislikes the party the better the bargain laughed elmer for instance jane i couldnt drive a hard bargain with you at all

im not so sure said miss collins dubiously whats he going to give for it

a matter ofâfive hundred replied elmer dring hesitatingly and jane answered with decision  then he dont have itâid rather burn it stupid that would suit him just as well five hundred downâand a trifle more when shes handed over to the police he said unable to be fair even with his partner in fraud and villainy

thats better said jane mollified both by the increase and the prospect of pansy going back let me walk next the hedge

for the path now ran close alongside the steep grassy bank that fell on to the line and a black cloud billow had hidden the pale face of the moon

whens he going to part with the stuff she asked

when we part with the document

well then bring him to me and when he hands over the flimsies ill hand over the will

 youd better leave it to me

thats as may be responded jane enigmatically and elmer pressing her arm tenderly cooed surely my jane can trust her betrothed to hold her dowryâfor thats what it will be

it depends on whats holding her betrothed growled jane leave it till after fridayâor let me deal direct with him

come come my dear dear jane my only jane âyou will wont you wheres the paperâdarling

his arms enfolded her with the other hand he grabbed at her jacketpocketâfelt nothing there at the pocket of her dressânot there

jane trust me my dear my pet my darling ah

he felt the crackle of it within her bodice wheedling with his voice pitting his mans strength against her womans he halfcoaxed halfwrested from the folds of her dress then from her struggling hand the will despite her protestations

no no not till i get the brassâlet goâyou brute âyoure hurting my knuckles oh my wrist âyou wretchâgive it back to me

no no he said soothingly be quiet jane âill act fair and squareâi swear i will

back from afar came through the night the long scream of a railway locomotives whistle

give it back to me she persisted clinging tenaciously to his arm

waitâwaitâlet me just look at it he said holding it out of her reach while he scanned it in the moonlight yes its all rightâits the willâthe will steady janeânow dont be absurd

and pushing her away he thrust it into the breastpocket of his coat which he buttoned over it

you thiefâyou swindler but youre not going to best me over this deal ill spoil your game i swear ill put you away 

nearer louder came that whistling scream and white lights yonder through the dark

i tell you if you play me false this deal ill talk âill talk loudâand you know what i can say  yes he was thinking of thatâthinking too how heavily and tenaciously she clung to him literally and metaphorically they stood aloneâabove the line

lie had the will nowâjanes dowry was in his bands joined to jane for lifeâwhat a life i and if he jibbed jane meant speaking outâand she could say such a lot why if jane spoke out he couldnt be in greater peril evengive it me back she cried putting all her strength in one spasmodic effort to tear apart his closelybuttoned coatâyou shallâyou shall

and of a sudden he too put out all his strength âseized her wrists her arms at last her throat throwing all his strength into the fierce struggle elmer she gurgled let goâletâletâah but he beat back her screams with a rain of blows swirled her to right and left exhausting her then as her struggles slackened and ceased he clenched his hold and gripped savagelyâtill she ceased even to moan and sank down in the darkness at his feet just asâanother three hundred yards awayâthe midnight express came gleaming and screeching with a shattering clatteringâthere below

stooping  he lifted her prostrate silent form swung it to and froâflung it from him down the embankmentâwatched it a moment swirl over and over down into the darkâthen he turned away

time to be going he muttered panting hard after his exertions

bide a wee  came a voice

elmer dring started with a gasp of terror

up sailed the moon from out the billowy black bank of cloud and there face to face stood in his path his arch enemy

darrell he whispered uneasily what brings you here 

i came to listen and to watch ive heard and seen more than i expected

youve seen

enough to hang you

but youd have to prove your words i should have something too to say and who could swear whose handâyours or mineâit was i should have a lot to sayâon lots of points there is no one by to contradict my story or prove yours

just so theres no one byâthats why on second thoughts i wont leave you to the hangman âill do his work myself 

and with a tigerish bound the young man threw himself upon the old man

but elmer dring was tough as well as old they fought and struggled long and desperately there in the narrow path beside the hedge and along the bank that ran down to the line hate gave elmer strength once indeed he freed himself from the hold of those leatherysinewed arms and turned to fly but with another panther spring his enemy was on him againâthe two forms panting gasping writhed and twisted

but neither raised any sound save those of strenuous deadly strife had help been near neither would have cared or dared to invoke it

at last elmers knees gave way and he fell beneath the other who crouching worked his knees up on to his breast then grasping with hands the burly neck interlaced his fingers upon it

now elmer gasped for breathâandâmercy

im done dont kill me why not go shares  he gurgled

no  fiercely grated harvey darrell no divisionâi mean to scoop the pool

loosening the grip of one strong sinewy hand he dived it into the breastfold of his coat then withdrew it clutching a glittering something that elmer recognised with a despairing groan he meant with the snakehandled dagger to end his work

a vengeful stroke and it vras all but done elmer had ceased to struggleâeven to groan cains measure had been meted out to cain

then suddenly over the hedge out of the dark twoâthree forms leaped they threw themselves on harvey darrell dragged him off his victim and secured the weltering weapon flashing fierce white dazzling lights full in his eyes

one man bending over elmer bring shouted hold your man hard it seems to me were just too late  then to another hurrying to the scene is this your man sir 

yes answered wickham manners heavens the mans dying what does it mean 

it means said austen lisle who had arrived along with him that revenge and hate have overtaken him ahead of justice this man who has mauled him almost if not quite to death is harvey darrell manners scanned the face within the focus of the bullseyeâto start violently and exclaim darrell may be one of his aliases but i know him best and ive been searching for him by the name of andrew valliston it seems this web of crime is interwoven with another web

and theres another thread exclaimed one of the men from scotland yard who out of curiosity had set his bullseye flash roving round

and down the bank within its quivering focus they saw another form all in a heap a womansâ checked in its downward flight by the telegraph wires beside the line

its jane collins gasped austen lisle in awe when they brought her up the bank and she too is dead

not yet came in fitful gasps iâi wont die till ive said my sayâand got level with that traitor there

aggravating to the last panted elmer dring

all right janeâit doesnt matter vhat you say new im going

to the signalbox where they carried him and jane and dragged the man called harvey darrell they brought from the station a passenger who happened to be a doctor and still more conveniently also a magistrate it was only in the latter capacity he could be of use so far as concerned elmer whose depositions he tookâjane punctuating the gaspedout murdercharge with groans of satisfaction

youve got your dues at last elmer she said i dont care now if it snows id have liked my evidence to have hanged you but the other thief has tricked me of even my revenge

i shall trick you of more of it before i go returned elmer listen all of you it was iâ not pansy armadaleâkilled gideon abbsâwith that very poniard jane gave it me to sell for herâ the old man meant screwing his money out of meâ i came back in the dark and did him to death she knows that  and he pointed to the woman he had tried to murder i buried the weapon in the garden at homecroft he knows that  and he pointed to his murderer

the man holding his pulse with a doctors hand with a magistrates wrote his confession down

dring said austen lisle if you can do little good now youve undone some of your evil work

yes howled jane id sooner hed have settled me outright than told that elmer elmer

before you goâsay goodbye to meâsay it wasnt all a lieâthat youâloved meâif only once upon a timeâif ever such a little 

but his last words had exhausted all his strength âa grey change was coming over the flabbier than ever features

 theâwaâgesâof sinâis death  he gasped faintly slowlyâim paid

covered with a tarpaulin they bore him in one ambulance jane in another to the hospital then out into the night they led andrew valliston handcuffed

not that he resisted

the games up ill go quietly he snarled ive often thought of your words mr wickham manners that i was a bit too smart i couldnt stand the idea of the old hunks money lying rusting id got the pedigree at my fingers ends and once on the other side i soon faked the certificates which way sergeant over the bridge all right âyou neednt grip my arms so tightly i shant give any trouble

as he went up the bridge slope quite docilely he raised his voiceâfor the downtrain was rushing in below throbbing and clattering

hold him  shouted lisle

but the prisoner had swerved stooped tripped up one captor wrenched himself free of another austen lisle with a spring seized his coat in an instant he had wriggled and slipped out of it as a snake sloughs its skin

a shouta leapâhe was over the parapet leaning over it aghast they looked down after him

but the downexpress sent up its volume of smoke and smotherâhiding everythingâwhich was just as well for it would not have been good to see

wickham manners told the judgeâwho told the horne secretary and pansy armadale in lieu of further durance during his majestys pleasure received his gracious pardon for what she had never done

jane collins bereft of not only elmer whom in her way she had loved but of the reflection that the martyrdom of pansy whom she did not love was to cease declared that there was nothing left to live for and followed her betrothed to the grave instead of to the registryâor the dock

there was balm in gilead cecilia wickham manners with sweet womanly soothing calmed and comforted pansy while jack and austen lisle moved heaven and earth including the bench and the cabinet to have justice rendered her then mere was peaceful restful homecraft to retire to with nannie nepeans tears of joy soft and comforting as summer rain with job wattles setting down his barrowload of cuttings at every dozen yards to exclaim lardy miss pansy summers come at last as us knowed it would come all along âdidnt us bingo

and the brindled bulldog whimpered confirmation as he jumped up again to lick the gentle lily hand

then ever and anon there was austen lisle coming down from town with reports from wickham manners to whose hands pansy had committed her affairsâthe proving of the will the setting things in order the sale of the lone house for nothing would have induced pansy again to dwell there

there was much to be remembered much to be forgotten

foremost amongst the things to be forgotten austen pleaded that he had held that brief based though he knew it not on fraud perjury and conspiracy and pansy answered with her eyes as well as her voice that it would be easy to forget all that with so much to remember that was kind true good and tender

and later when the pleasant country air had brought the bloom of homecrofts roses back to her cheeks and months of security and calm had soothed the sorelytried and wounded heart of her austen asked of pansy armadale another question would she let him devote his life to making her bright and joyousâwould she merge her life into his

dear nannie nepean said that it was a shame to take her darling again avay from her why couldnt her boy and girl make their courting longerâso that instead of losing one she could have the twain near her he took the kind sweet face framed in the silver hair in both his hands and replied no no you will not get rid of us so easily nannie dear we mean to make our home as close to yours as can beâso that when we are not at your place you shall be at ours

and they both kissed her

cecilia wickham manners at whose house the breakfast was held declared that quiet as the wedding was it was a pretty oneâthat it couldnt be otherwise with so sweet a bride

then austen lisle took his bride away on a far honeymoon over land and sea and land again that in bright and everchanging scenes and climes aided by his loving sheltering care she might  live down the ordeal of anguish the dark sad days for ever gone and the dread chain that link by link was forged and interlinkedâhappily only to be in heavens good time brokenlink by link
