nellie brown or the jealous wife detter thomas  novel
in the town of n resided h montgomery a graduate of the columbia college washington d c he was prepossessing in appearance easy manners a social companion by ardent study he became one of the first lawyers of virginia he seldom indulged in ornamentations at the bar he was practical logical and stern when aroused with the lash of sarcasm by his opponents it was then resolves fired his breast and the gleen of battle lit up his countenance he never was known to retreat in the struggles for right ever advancing with the shield of truth and with the sword of justice cut his way through the ranks of his enemies and invariably disarranged their plans defeated their aims and won laurels of victory if oratory means the power to present thoughts to hold an audience to win favorable decisions for clients he was indeed an orator his ripe scholarship concise and pointed arguments caused his fame to spread far  and wide he kindled the fire of enthusiasm wherever he touched the public mind he selected the purest ores of truth and the brightest gems of thought he never engaged the enemy without being thoroughly equipped for the fight he knew no fears nothing swerved him from duty honest and frank with his clients on all matters pertaining to business

it is replied mr b and much longer than i intended to have stayed

come in and rest yourself poor queen looks as though she was tryed

we have come thirtyfive miles from the village since seven oclock what time of day is it

go nan in the diningroom and see what time it is

nan a little negro girl obeyed the order and returned with a grin she said missus de big hand ob de clock is up and the little one am crossways

plague take you you little blackskin i have a great mind to pull your ears for the life of me i can not learn that little negress anything

curse them i have found them to be more trouble than profit to gratify you i will come in a few moments i have something rich to tell you

the widow laughed and at the same time she stroked back her jetblack hair showing a set of teeth white as pearls

nan 

yes missus

go and tell bill to put queen in the barn and feed her well

nan shot away like an arrow and returned in a few minutes

missus cant find him

where did you look for him

in de orchard missus

i do not know what to think of that little wretch she knows as well as i do that bill is chopping wood in the bottom go this moment down to the bottom and tell bill to come here immediately you little simpleton

nan went off at a snails gait

you nan

marm

if you dont hasten ill skin you when you return

yes missus

in a few moments bill the servant man came up and said i declar here am massa ben and gave vent to one of those hearty laughs the african is so noted for one would have supposed that his whole frame would have fallen to pieces before he closed his mouth

take queen bill to the barn and feed her well said the widow do walk out on the piazza mr b it is much pleasanter she scated will you take a glass of wine cider or icewater

thank you ill take a glass of water

go nan and get a tumbler of icewater

nan returned holding the glass in her hand

how dare you bring water in your little black hand to a gentleman

deed missus i could not find a tray

where did you look for it

in the wardrobe missus

do hear that little imp

mr b at the same time shaking hsi sides laughing at nan and her mistress

be off you little idiot

the widow and mr b then drew their chairs up side by side

do tell me mr b the news of the village is sally jenkins married

i think not

no i am rather inclined to think she is too fickleminded you know josh barnes is dead in love with her and indeed he is a clever fellow i am inclined to think he is too good for her

you know women are strange beings and few can account for their choice taste and notions

you are quite complimentary thank you kindly mr b laughed if i did not know you so well i would take you to task said the widow with a happy smile on her countenance you have rather a strange idea of women

not by any means i am their friend i have received but little gratitude in return i advocated your cause today

pray explain to me in what way mr b

frank clifton at the village is desperately in love with you

ha ha ejaculated the widow her face flushed as she gave vent to her feelings

i told him that you were worthy of any gentlemans esteem and hoped that he would succeed like most men i suppose he feels a delicacy in urging claims of matrimony

while they were conversing a neighboring woman mrs h living near by thinking that mr b remained longer than usual made an excuse went to the house and asked for the loan of a book

the widow entered the sitting room returned and presented mrs h with the desired book

i am always pleased to accomodate my neighbors but mrs h invariably makes it a business to come to my house when i have company she is indeed an inquisitive and a talkative woman i have not been in her house since the death of my husband if she was capable of taking a hint she would not come here excuse me for interrupting your conversation do give me the history of this gentleman who has become smitten with me is he handsome accomplished and of good origin you know i wish no other as a suitor nor would i wed with a man that did not possess these qualities

you are hard to please

that is just my sentiments i am ready whenever i meet a gentleman whom i know possesses those qualifications and believe that he will fulfill the duties of a companion

perhaps you will not meet with so good an opportunity soon said mr b as to qualifications he is an excellent business man and has an education suitable for his position he is strictly honest and reliable i am satisfied in my own mind that he is worthy to accept the heart and hand of any accomplished lady

the widow shrugged her plump round shoulders and remarked with a smile that will do as far as it goes you know my dear husband was a gentleman by birth and education how much do you suppose him to be worth

it is said that he is worth thirty or forty thousand dollars

that would be a handsome little fortune for one who is not extravagant or wasteful

i should think it would

do bring him down i have a curiosity to see him

the remark caused mr b to smile

i promised him an introduction to you i thought it advisable to ascertain whether it would be agreeable to you

if he is goodlooking perhaps chance may favor him you know that i am a woman possessing a noble and generous heart i have been raised tenderly and kindly and to marry a man that was not truly my equal would render me unhappy for life

i am aware madam that you are deserving a worthy companion i have no desire to select a choice for you i merely delivered my message and expressed my opinion mr jacobs is the gentleman

thank you i have heard of the gentleman and from reports i would suppose that the fair sex have no charm for him and that he was a stranger to the sensation of love having neither taste nor desire for the association of ladies

there is a time in the history of mens lives that radical changes occur old ideas decay and new ones take their place i once read of a nobleman who never entered the society of ladies he shunned them on all occasions the door of his affections seemed to have been forever closed against them while strolling out for a mornings walk he accidentally met a peasant girl returning from market she had sold her little produce and was homeward bound he inquired her name and residence and in three weeks from that date she was his happy bride what do you think of that

i suppose love has no eyes is deaf to criticism and blind to the smiles and frowns of the world

she made him a happy companion though plucked from natures gardenâa raw flower with the hand of affection he planted it in richer soil she grew wise and twined around his affections like the vine round the towering oak the storms nor the ills of life marred not their happiness their bark sailed calmly upon the ocean of time as they drifted on to the great ocean of eternity

the evening is far advanced i must be off hoping that you may be able soon to decide for yourself

your company is so agreeable i regret much your leaving

bill had queen at the door in readiness she was as restless as a leaf in the summers breeze she stood pawing the ground and champing her bit eager to bound like a deer to her coltish home

mr b mounted

kiss nellie and the babes for me said the widow goodbye goodbye

queen leaped off like a hare and soon neared the old farm on which she was raised as she came in sight of her mates grazing in the meadow she neighed peter mr bs hostler caught the sound and hastened to open the gate

how do you do peter how are you getting along

how do massa i is well and am glad to see you sar

how is your missus peter

she is well sar but in bad humor

what is the matter with her peter

don no sar dat boy ob missus h dat libes on the road above de widows been here sar wid a note

can it be possible that wretched woman has written an untruthful letter to my wife

leaving his sable groom he started for the house the dog seeing his master gave him a welcome bark this brought little maggie and willie to the door they cried at the top fo their voices ma here comes pa they gave a leap and each was in his arms he kissed them with a fathers love he thought strange of his wife not coming to greet him

where is your ma willie

in the bedroom pa shes been kying pa

he entered the hall sue the housemaid got a glimpse of him

fore the lord dars massa ben cried sue

how have you been sue said mr b

tank you massa i is well

how is your mistress

sue glanced her eyes toward the bedroom shook her head and whispered in his ear trouble here massa sure as i is born

mr bs countenance in an instant looked depressed he hastened to the chamberdoor and rushed in

how do you do dear nellie

i have no further use for you sir said mrs b your presence is disgusting in my sight how foolish have i been to love a wretch like you i had rather be an inmate of the almshouse than to live under your roof release me from this prison i have loved you with a womans pure love you sir have blasted and withered my earthly hopes

what possesses you nellie what notion has entered your brain

i sir have in my possession a note of your conduct written to me by a woman of truth and veracity  of your conduct at the windows you sir have been there since noon today your actions there were unbecoming a gentleman three weeks today you have been absent and to think you came within a mile of home and remained there all day

the fires of jealousy long smothered was kindled on teh altar of her heart

you are the last woman that should accuse me thus and one that has long been your confidential friend said mr b had i known that you entertained the slightest suspicion of my fidelity and the widows chastity i never would have entered her door

i am satisfied sir said mrs bthat you are as guilty of misconduct as arnold was of treason you deserve a felons fate i left a home of comfort ease and happiness to become bone of your bone flesh of your flesh see your gratitude what justifiable excuse can you offerâwhat evidence can you produceâto exonerate you from a charge so unjustifiable and unbecoming the dignify of a gentleman none sir

you speak as one whose reason is dethroned

better that you hide your guilty face than to attempt to enter a plea of innocence your actions for the last six months have been suspicious to me you had more business at the village during the six months past than for three years prior your excuse was that you were compelled to attend the lodge an excellent excuseindeed to shield you from suspicion

nellie have you got through said mr b i am mortified at your actions you accuse me of that which i am not guilty of the widow is as pure as a newborn babe she loves you with a sisters love how could you listen to that wicked womans lies the widow told me when she came for the loan of a book it was only an excuse to excite you and to create mischief she envies you your happiness and the society of your friends her object is to destroy your peace and to blast those cherished hopes you have so long nourished

have you yet to learn that women are envious and jealous of each others success and would condescend to use the most artful intrigues to accomplish their wicked designs i am the same man in principle honor and sincerity today as i was when i led you to the bridal altar time nor the varied changes of business matters have not caused my love to grow languid or cold towards you you are the idol of my heart mrs h alone is responsible for your unhappiness i am truly sorry to think that you are so credulous as to give countenance to her reports my kindness to the widow has been of pure friendship knowing that she was a lone woman thrown upon the world without an earthly prop to lean upon her bosom companion taken from her and consigned to the narrow limits of the grave i felt towards her as you once did deeply interested in her welfare i supposed then you were free from the passion of jealousy

you sir appear to be a good judge of human nature you seem to understand the dispositions of women to a charm and their imperfections men with you are all angels your explanations have not removed my suspicions nor established a proof of your innocence do you remember sir the first sabbath in last month at the village church the widow accompanied us by your invitation i was convinced from that very hour of your guilt during the service at the chapel i perceived that you were becoming attached to her your mind was not the least interested in the excellent discourse delivered by the pastor on that occasion you seated yourself on the upper side of the widow instead of taking your seat between us and for the life of you you could not keep your eyes off her she was your only attraction i was not the only one that noticed your actions on that occasion and still you profess to love me such love is mockery your pretension of love to me is hypocritical you cannot induce me to believe any such stuff i am no child to be fed on pap you sir are as deep as the sea thanks to mrs h i have got on your track  i shall trace you to your den i shall leave nostone unturned until i fully establish your guilt or innocence an outrage against womans honor to be thus treated and sacrificed men are worse than satan desired them to he what woman unincumbered with man would listen to their flattery or allow herself to be drawn into their netâ knowingwhat i do of the torments none would leave a home however humble to become the drudge and slave of man life has no charms for me no none if it were not for those dear babes i would take a leap into eternity and bury my sorrows and cares in the silent tomb speak not to me

mr b turned away with tears rolling down his checks and a heart burdened with sorrow

mrs b called to sue her negress servant sue go immediately and tell peter to come to my room

yes missusbefore sue left she exclaimed for de lord sake missus what am de trouble wid you an massa ben i declar missus i is like one in de troubled sea i had visions night after night and i have prayed to de lord to show dem to me so i could know dem i hab wept dis day like a weeping willow missus i did want to come into de room to see you i see you so full ob trouble i did want to talk wid you i as been in de same trouble missus i declar to de lord if i didnt want to be dead and in de grave i prayed to my blessed lord night and day to take de trouble away and gib me the victory over my enemies de lord did answer my feeble prayers and my troubles went like a short summers day hab fate in de lord missus he will make de crooked way straight and the hilly lebel i know dese men bar watching for de lord sake dont tell massa ben i say anyting i spect dis trouble long time dat widow is more cunning as de serpent i believe massa ben loves her

what makes you think so said mrs b have you seen any familiarity between them

well missus one day i pass de parlor door i see massa ben sitting on de sofa close by de side ob de widow he get up just as i look in de door de widow look at me den at massa ben i see mischief in her eye

where was i sue when this happened

you had gone up to de orchard missus

why did you not tell me sue about it

well missus de lord say blessed am the peacemakers dats de reason missus i tought it best to say noting it is very strange sue that you kept it from me

missus de lord said de sins of de vicked shall find dem out bress de lord it has come true i know it and prayed for de lord to show you dese tings dat you might see dem wid your eyes see how good de lord am he am de same god dat delivered daniel out off de lions den trust in him missus and he deliber you out of dis trouble bress his holy name

yes missus if i had de wings ob a dove i would by in de kingdom dis hour den dis poor body and soul be ebber free from sins sorrow and death

sue would you leave me in this hour of my affliction you talk about heaven as though you had been there death is a terror sue to the purest of earths saints dont talk so silly about matters so serious i promised myself to make mrs h a visit and ascertain the facts relative to this affair

dat am de place to go missus i be bound dat you find out dar all massa bens tricks i lub you both as my own dear childen dat woman will tell you de hole truth my poor heart bleeds for you i tink massa ben act so bad

go and tell peter to saddle bet i have delayed it much longer than i intended

sue delivered the message and in a few minutes bet was at the door mrs b leaped upon her back and said  sue take good care of the children in my absence

yes missus

goodbye sue

de lord bress you

i had like to forget if your master should return in my absence you need not tell him where i have gone

missus nebber i is too smart for dat

bet seemed honored to assist her mistress on her mission she was as playful as a cat and as innocent as a lamb she was not long in bringing her mistress to the gate of mrs hs residence mrs h seeing mrs b hastened to open the gate and exclaimed  dear me how do you do i am delighted to see you i have news that may be of interest to you do alight and walk in or would you prefer sitting under our old favorite oak

i prefer being seated here as it is much cooler said mrs b

ill bring you a chair make your pony fast to the fence or shall i take her to the barn she is gentle as a kitten

indeed she looks cunning i would like much to own her what a splendid head and form she reminds me so much of a favorite pony my husband bought me a year ago unfortunately he died will you allow me to take your hat and shawl

thank you

i am so pleased to see you can you not remain over evening

i should be pleased to do so if it was in my power you know that i have two little children and they compel me to be home at night

is it not strange to see the unhappiness in families resulting from the imprudence of women and the depravity of men

indeed it is that is my mission here today

i assure you i feel interested in your behalf knowing that you have been treated shamefully i scarcely know what to think of such conduct i would leave a man who would treat me as your husband has treated you befpre the setting of the sun i would drop him like a hotiron it ought to be me instead of you i would make him know the strength of the law i saw your husband ride up to the widows about noon today his horse was put in the barn and he remained there until dusk knowing at the same time that he had been absent from you for three weeks i thought it rather a strange proceeding i made it my business to go over to the house and ask the loan of a book for an excuse to satisfy myself they were seated together as loving as two doves as i turned the corner i took them by surprise they seemed confused the widow arose from her chair and looked as silly as a child of course i did not let on to her that i noticed their embarrassment i simply asked for the book your husband sat speechless and for the life of him he could not look me in the face are not women silly creatures to allow themselves to be made the dupes of men

i have long esteemed the widow as a lady worthy of my confidence said mrs b but it is well said that human nature is frail she is the last one that i thought would be guilty of destroying my happiness for several months past i felt inclined to think something was wrong my husband has seemed indifferent to me and has not treated me as kindly as in former days at the same time i thought perhaps business matters caused him to act thus

i know of him making her handsome presents did he ever tell you

yes he told me that he gave her a shawl i thought nothing of it she showed it to me i regarded it as pure friendship

i dont think that is all he gave her i saw her have a splendid parasol that could not have cost less than twentyfive dollars you are aware that she never visits me or i might have ascertained the price of it i am unaware of the reason why she dont visit me i suppose she is stuck up like many others and thinks herself better than anyone else to tell the truth i have had my opinion of her for a long time she is a snake in the grass i would not trust her with a husband of mine out of my sight kate henderson troubles were similar to your own her husband gallanted mary sheppard to the last party at the village and left her at home to slave she came over and asked me my opinion i knew that he thought more of mary s than he did of his wife kate i have seen henderson and mary evening after evening walking out while his wife was drudging at home finally he treated her so bad that she asked me what she had better do i told her the sooner she got rid of him the better it would be for her he had scarcely the second shirt to his back jack blue would marry her tomorrow if she would obtain a bill and advance her money to fee her counsellor this he told me out of his own mouth she is the biggest dunce of a woman i ever knew of she says she cannot give him up poor simpleton did you ever hear of such nonsense she partly agreed to marrry blue at one time provided she could obtain a bill he gave her several handsome presents to my knowledge he is indeed a model of perfection and would make her a happy companion she is industrious as an ant and as nice a little housekeeper as you will find anywhere i truly sympathise with her you know that she fears outside talk that is all folly for a woman to allow herself to be imposed upon mr blue is a man of means and would give her anything in the world if she would obtain a bill and accept his offer of marriage he fell in love with her at a party given mrs dalton last fall since then they have been the best of friends i suppose you are acquainted with martha lovejoy

slightly i have seen her at several parties given in the neighborhood she is a fine looking woman is she married

she was but by my assistance she obtained a bill william lovejoy was a good provider for her but for her life she could not love him

that seems to be a strange course to pursue i should think that a woman would be competent of knowing whether she loved a man or not before she married him

the match was made by her parents much against her will said mrs h you know it is hard for a woman to be really happy under such circumstances she is to be married in two months from today

pray to who

to henry lockwood

indeed how long have they been acquainted

he was her first beau and was engaged to him before she married mr lovejoy at that time they were both young and foolish they fell out about some trifles as young people often do without any real cause old coals you know will kindle

do you think he will make her a good companion

i do he is a gentleman in every sense of the term he is intelligent and has an amiable disposition at the same time she is resolute and determined many of her friends advised her not to leave lovejoy she consulted me i gave her my opinion in a few words i told her if you are not happy seek your own happiness she is a woman of strong mind she has courage and the grit when her cape was tried she had much to contend against public opinion was against her to a great degree i stuck to her and so did lockwood he is well deserving of her for he worked faithfully to free her from william lovejoy she loved lockwood and regretted much that she had not married him instead of lovejoy i am an advocate of womens rights and if i see them imposed upon like a faithful sentinel i invariably give warning you perhaps thought it bold in me for addressing you that note

not so said mrs b i am under many obligations to you for the interest you have manifested in my behalf

you see i have a splendid view from my door and can see every one that visits the widows house i have been watching them a long time

they were sitting like two lovers

yes and your husband looked as sheepish as a wolf he never so much as looked up they were excited and confused which induced me to telegraph to you

thank you kindly

i would not have missed it for the world is the widow on good terms with you

she is

what a wretched woman she must be she is as full of deception as an egg is of meat

what do you think is the best course for me to pursue

there is but one effectual remedy domestic troubles are like an aching tooth the only hope i see to secure you from future difficulties and unhappiness is to obtain bill i have been divorced three times and would demand it again tomorrow if necessary i never will condescend to lick the hand that smites me nor love a man who does not respect me

mrs b smiled and said did you not find it difficult in obtaining so many bills

no i never applied twice in the same state i invariably made it a rule wherever my lot fell to procure the influence of the most influential gentlemen of the county and never failed to succeed in gaining their confidence and assistance it is true i was rather good looking which may have produced an effect and she laughed heartily

if you succeeded on the merits of your good looks i will stand a slim show

ho ho ho i never have seen the day that i was as goodlooking as you are now

thank you for your compliment

not at all you know men are just silly enough to assist any goodlooking woman  many of them will spend their last dime if a woman but smiles at them a woman that is as goodlooking as yourself is never without admirers

thank you what do you think it would cost me for counsel fees

dear me ask col m he is an excellent counsellor  he is a great admirer of the society of ladies i know of his having obtained several bills for ladies he would not accept a dime from them for his services

he if very generous  i would like very much to make his acquaintance

he left just three weeks today for warrenton springs  his health being poor i think its likely he will remain there during the season

i have become so thoroughly disgusted with ben that i hate him

i know the intense hatred of a woman when she turns against a man who has wronged her

if i really thought that i could obtain a bill i would apply at the next term of court

in my mind there is not the slightest doubt that you will succeed whenever i take a dislike to a man i never cease to agitate the matter i keep the pot aboiling i am a good fireman and make things terrible hot for them when necessity requires it in one of my difficulties with my second husband i entertained such a disgust for him that i was really meaner to him than i should have been i found that without war i could not gain my freedom i finally excited him to such a pitch that he slapped me that was just what i wanted in order to secure a bill a woman can do more hurt with her tongue than a man can with his physical strength it will not be amiss to relate some few facts touching the case i am satisfied that i can drum up several more witnesses outside of myself that widow is a wolf in sheeps clothing and welldeserves to be made an example of do you suppose that she is aware that you are on her track

not that i know of i am confident she does not

did you stop as you came up

i did not

shell think it strange of you passing without stopping i think it will be to your interest to keep on good terms with her until we get our plans i detest the sight of her

i have learned to stoop to conquer my enemies and never fail to come out victorious my advice to you is to call on her when you return and act as though nothing had happened it will afford us a better field to operate in and we may glean more reliable information by working cautiously are you acquainted with polly hopkins

i am not

she is one of the best workers in matters of this kind that i know of

is she reliable

she is the most confidential old creature i ever met with she is the best fortuneteller in the state we had her employed in martha lovejoys case had it not been for her i think we would have been defeated martha had the poorest excuse of a lawyer to defend her i ever saw it would take a clap of thunder to arouse his intellectâif he had anyâand a broadax to sharpen his ideas a pettifogger is the worst curse a community ever was afflicted with and the poorest specimen of humanity

and pray who was her counsel

g b bowers

he is a stranger here is he not

flo has been here the last six months he is from alexandria where he practiced until driven out by hunger i was told he never gained a single case during his practice there he is a perfect windbag and makes great pretensions until he gets his fees you then have to be continually urging him up in my opinion he is better adapted for a servant we would have lost the case had we relied upon his judgment and abilities through my advice martha employed judge s

is he a good lawyer

he is one of the best in the state he is an able counsellor and adviser the only objection that i have to him is he appears to be slow and tedious i judge this from his conversation most men speak three words to his one

mrs b smiled and said  perhaps he believes in the teachings of the bible  think twice before you speak once 

ha ha ha you are something of a theologian ho never flatters his clients he is candid and frank which adds greatly to his success

what do you think of peter logan

my opinion of him is he would not only sell his clients but rob the dead did you know alfred kraft

i have heard of him

he lived thirtyfive miles from fairfax court house on what is called the  old road logan was his counsel for many years he was taken down suddenly with the intermittent fever for a few days his case appeared hopeful finally he got worse and gave up all hopes of recovering as did his friends  he appointed logan as his administrator no security was demanded of him for the faithful discharge of his duty kraft had implicit confidence in logan mr krafts wife died one year to the very day he was buried they left four little children the oldest not over nine years of age logan robbed those poor little orphans of every dollar and is now living in ease and luxury while those little ones are provided for by kind friends that is his history

he surely must be a miserable wretch ah how can he die in peace guilty of a crime so heinous and black

it is true old squire givens and him are said to be partners guilty or not guilty if you are brought before old givens court he will fine you as sure as you stand before him a fine and costs is his rule of justice he applies it in all cases if possible he has hoarded up riches by fleecing the poor but thank god there is a higher court at whose bar the world shall be judged the king and the peasant are equals there

i must be going said mrs b

the sun was now gliding down behind the western hills and tinged the peaks of the lofty mountains with its golden rays as it passed away

when shall i expect you again

in two weeks

aunt polly will be on hand today two weeks if we start in after the widow we will make things warm for her

does aunt polly know measked mrs b

i think not answered mrs h she has been residing in alexandria most of her time she lived on union street no 

oh i have heard of her notoriety i must really go as it is getting late

i will lead your pony up

thank you i have taught her to wait upon herself

she called bet at the same time holding out her hand bet came up and licked her mistress hand like a poodle

what a knowing creature she is she looks as cunning as a little childexclaimed mrs h

i have taken great pains to educate her she is very intelligent and has a lamblike disposition

the babies can go under her she will step over them as carefully as a person

she mounted

i hope your next visit will be agreeable and profitable

i hope so

do stop at the widows as you pass

for your gratification i will do so

i had rather you would use policy

goodbye goodbye

now whatever you do continued mrs h accept of no compromises ask no questions and give none be a woman let us show to the lords of creation that we intend to defend our rights to the last and remember agitate we will make a good case of it if luck attends us we will bring you out  right side up with care 

mrs b left bet speeded off in an easy gallop and soon halted at the widows gate

the widow seeing her exclaimed why nellie is that you where have you been

up the road on business replied mrs b

you mean thing did you pass my house without stopping

i was somewhat in a hurry

tell me how my children and your husband are

thank you they are well

dear me how i would like to see those little darlings do get down nellie and kiss mo you are the meanest thing that i ever saw i would not think of passing your house more than i would to fly without calling do come in nellie i have something new to tell you

as she alighted the widow embraced kissed her and gave her a playful slap

i have a great mind to give you a good whipping you naughty thing

l jacobs

nellie do tell me what yon think of him

nellie dont you think him oldmaidish i have heard of him but have not had the pleasure of seeing him to my knowledge i know nothing of his disposition

men of his style and character are a scarce commodity in this market you had better strike the iron while it is hot

the widow shook her sides and roared with laughter

do you really think so nellie

i do

nellie i know you are a good judge of human nature if you really think so ill set my cap for him

do so i must really be off

if you will go kiss me goodbye and be sure to kiss the babies for me and give my love to mr b

main road july th

mrs brownâmuch to my mortification and surprise i have been informed that you and others are in league to vilify and traduce my character without the slightest justification from our long acquaintance and the friendly relations we have sustained to each other this alone should have induced you to act justly and honorably toward me why did you not speak of this like a frank woman yesterday when you were here no you concealed your hatred how could you be so treacherous and deceptive i am truly proud i have no remorse of conscience i have lived above suspicion and i have never given you the slightest cause to treat me so unbecoming a lady a pure heart fosters not the poisonous reptile of revenge frankness is a virtue amd conceals not deception you have acted unwisely and imprudent unbecoming a woman of your standing and education i consider those who condescend to sloop so low far beneath my notice duty alone prompts me to speak in my own defence bring my accusers face to face and i will silence them like maria antoinette her persecutors led her as a lamb to the slaughter sacrificed her upon the altar of hate a purer woman the sun never shone upon am i the victim of a base conspiracy selected to be sacrificed upon the bloody altar of revenge do i inherit it no no i demand a fair and honorable investigation remember that virtue is a jewel a character ungalvanized is of far more value than gold and silver how true the friendship of earth is but a name it has become merchandise sold in the marketplace to the highest bidder how could you be so unfeeling and unjust to one who has ever been your true and faithful friend there is a day coming when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed the pure and the just shall receive justice at the hands of that judge who shall judge the world at his righteous bar there the wicked shall cease from troubling and the weary shall ever be at rest widow

nellie do you intend to destroy my happiness and bring me to the grave in sorrow i have possessed the patience of job i still entertain for you a husbands love time can never blot you from my memory though you have treated me harsh and wrongfully

i sir scorn your love and detest your sympathy for myself and those cherished babes if i thought for a moment that they possessed a single trait of the man who is their father i would bind them fast with the cords of death and with joy close their eyes forever upon the scenes of this world of wretchedness notwithstanding they are the apples of my eye and the jewels of my heart you have doomed me forever to sorrow and affliction i feel like one that has no earthly hope far better would it have been for me had l never hearkened to the treacherous deception of man death truly would be a welcome messenger to me i would welcome his stern decree

nellie oh  that i could induce you no longer to be the slave of jealousy and suspicion free yourself from that tyrant it knows no bounds it has no sympathy with its crimson hand it has slain thousands of victims i trust you will see your error and repent walk in the highways uninhabited by suspicious characters then it is you will be happy in time and eternity would the wise and the good be the victims of jealousy hate and revenge no  no  never  jealousy discriminates not between its friends and its foes ever give me a heart pure from the curse clothe yourself with those noble principles that make woman the beauty of creation if you will but hearken to those instructions the sunshine of peace will again dawn upon your pathway the present and the future will again be joyous to you he wise and cease forever to be the dupe of jealousy

reader we shall leave mr and mrs b for the present and return to mrs h and her friend

chapter ii

lawrence do you intend going to the village asked mrs h

yes said lawrence i shall start soon

call on aunt polly williams and ask her to come down i want to see her on particular business

what in the world do you want with the old humbug of a fortuneteller

dont talk so simple will you do as i have requested it is a little out of your way and if you deliver the message she will be here inside of an hour it is but a short distance to her place from the road

yes i will tell her at the same time i want but little to do with her kind

lawrence delivered his message the old soothsayer started and in a short time she knocked at the door of mrs hs dwelling the door was opened by the landlady who said dear me aunt polly i am delighted to see you i have a good job for you and if yon arrange your plans right you can make money out of it

yes that is just what i am after said aunt polly i am the woman to secure it if opportunity permits tell me who the parties are and if you think they will stand bleeding

mrs b and her husband are at dagger points all about this neighbor of mine the widow she has caused mr b to neglect his wife and children he is much devoted to the widow i put mrs b on his track you know that i am a good hand to catch such fellows mrs b wants to gather sufficient evidence in order to obtain a bill she is to be here tomorrow i recommended you to her very highly she wishes to secure your services in this affair she has the means if not a friend unknown to her has offered to assist her if required this gentleman is desperately in love with her but she knows it not indeed we are very fortunate to got lovers for our clients

i will play my part to perfection you can rely on that replied aunt polly what do you think she will really stand to get this matter under her control we can operate more successfully for her than any other parties

she has implicit confidence in me i have been the main spring in opening up the affair i informed her of the pretended friendship of the widow and the faithlessness of her companion i caught him nicely i am satisfied to get this whole matter in a nutshell i think she will give one hundred dollars at the same time if she flinches do not refuse fifty

i will propose to her one hundred dollars and you must express your surprise at the reasonableness of the charge individually for fear that she might think wo were equally interested in making it a speculation when do you expect her tomorrow

yes everything will be in readiness l think it will be a capital idea to bring martha love joy over with you you are aware that she has been in the same fix and is an excellent talker

that is a good proposition and i think it will have its effect said aunt polly i am a little in a hurry i cannot stay long so goodbye

dont fail to be on hand tomorrow at the appointed timeremarked mrs h

mrs b according to promise made the necessary preparations to revisit mrs h the following day she started the next day and to avoid passing the widows she concluded to walk she ordered sue to take good care of the children bade sue goodbye and started across the lower meadow strange emotions filled her throbbing breast half an hours walk brought her to the door of mrs h she knocked and was received cordially

kiss me darlingexclaimed mrs h i am delighted to see you you look like one heartbroken how have you been getting along since you were here

the storm still rages replied mrs b

i expected it and have been thinking of you ever since you left walk into the sittingroom they entered mrs b allow me to introduce you to my lady friends mrs martha lovejoy and mrs hopkinswho were anxiously waiting her arrival

they received the introduction very cheerfully and seemed highly gratified mrs b looked at aunt polly with surprise she looked more like a visitor from the land of pandemonium than a a human being

i suppose mrs hopkins that you are aware of my mission here todayasked mrs b

you look like one in great distress of mind said aunt polly i have no doubt that you are the subject of sorrow and disconsolation

it is just this i wish to know if i am wronged by my companion and the woman who professes to be my devoted friend i wish you to tell me who the parties are that seek my destruction and designate them definitely i also wish to know your price

well dear child you know it requires a deal of time energy and shrewdness to get this matter in shape i shall charge you one hundred dollars

that is more than i can afford replied mrs b

this is a delicate matter and should be handled with kid gloves added mrs h with a bright smile on her countenance she then remarked to mrs b that she had news of interest to relate to her

i suppose those present are cognizant of it asked mrs b

yes we are confidants i should apologize to you for being so inconsiderate or hasty as you may think however i have a duty to perform there is a friend of mine and wellwisher of yours and i do not hesitate in saying that he loves youâbut for he world he would not have it made public he is an intimate acquaintance of your husband he is desirous to advance your interests in this matter and will give any amount to assist you in your difficulties

mrs bs face flushed and anger seemed to have taken possession of her soul she asked are not these strange proceedings who do you take me to be i came not here to seek lovers but friends and in search of simple justice

i hope dear madam that i have not offended you regard me as your friend and not your foe i know that the sentiments you have expressed are just and right at the same time friends are often necessary to enable us to succeed in accomplishing our desires in life

i am truly aware of that friendship is one thing and love is another when you speak of love that produces a horror in my bosom i ask not for the love of any man if i have a friend who will render me assistance without obligating myself to him it would he accepted but i must first know that he is a gentleman of principle who is the gentleman

he is indeed a gentleman of the first class and if you should succeed in obtaining a bill and would accept his offer you would never he in want of a dollar nor the comforts of life the longest day you live is it not so martha

yes indeed i almost begrudge her the chance to become the wife of such a splendid man he is a perfect gentleman i have known him for the last four years there are girls in this neighborhood who would give their two eyes to get him i dont know but what i would try to shuffle off my old man if i thought i could induce him to make me the offer notwithstanding i have no fault to find with my companionâhe treats me like a baby at the same time you know money is what induces us to love

ladies i have heard patiently your advice and thank you kindly for the interest you have manifested in my behalf said mrs b to offer me a friend who is perhaps an entire stranger into my confidence and affections and relate to him my private affairs is more than i can condescend to do however honestly disposed he may he what would my friends think of me for pursuing such a course would they not forsake me yes and leave me a total wreck i should feel more than condemned to act thus imprudent i love my children with a mothers love i have a character to sustain and trust i may never bring disgrace upon myself and children do inform me who this gentleman is and what has induced him to make me those liberal propositions i think it not only a bold act but indeed a rash one

j oldham is the man replied mrs h

can it be truei never could be more surprised he is the last man that i would have dreamed of exclaimed mrs b

it is nothing to have a gentleman friend in these times and it is becoming fashionable

it is very strange that he should again fall in love with me

then he is not a stranger to you

no he is not he is the first man that i ever loved in days gone by when my heart knew no sorrows no anguish no pain but i am truly surprised to know after the lapse of so many years that he loves me still i cannot realize it tobe true i have known him since i was a schoolgirl we have often played together in the morn of life

allow me to inform you that i have a confidential letter from him for you which i will hand you to read said mrs h she drew the letter from her pocket and presented it to mrs b who glanced over it and strange to say tears which had not flown since the death of a beloved brother stole down her cheeks she struggled to conceal her feelings but in vain she said can it be true

the letter mid thusâ centreville aug d

mrs brown dear madamâi hope you will pardon iny boldness and perhaps in your judgment imprudent course the esteem i have long entertained for you alone induced me to address you this letterâhoping you will not condemn me for the liberty i have taken in writing you these lines we are all creatures of circumstances and few there are who have not erred in life i know you to be a lady of high mental culture and refined feelings you have long been in my thoughts by day and dreams by night but i will not dwell upon the past i am satisfied you merit far better treatment and a more congenial companion duty prompts me to offer you aid and my influence i feel deeply interested in your behalf having known you from childhood then you were as cheerful as a lark in autumn time has not obliterated you from my memory though our acquaintance has not been renewed for many years how true the world is the great theatre and the sons and daughters of man the actors life has its joys and its woes and but few of us are free from sorrow and the ills that attend the journey of life it is the love of god that sweetens our sorrows and enables us to bid defiance to lifes transitory and bitter trials what man possessed of a soul or a spark of dignity could treat you so i am not deceived in the man who claims you for his wife he is unworthy of so noble a woman and is far from being your equal socially or in point of education remember i am still your friend and hesitate not to make known to me your wants hope is truly the anchor of the soul and enables many to keep their heads above the surging billows of despair i trust that a brighter future awaits you the true test of friends is to be judged by their acts give me a friend who is ready and willing to rescue me from the whirlpool of adversity and the wheel of misfortune under which so many have been crushed too oft we have the pretended smiles of some who hesitate not to obstruct our pathway i fear not an open foe deliver me from foes in disguise they are dangerous my purse is open to you in conclusion i have faith in your integrity and have thrown myself entirely upon your mercy i wish you to destroy this letter carry this matter to the graveâ a secret i shall be more than happy to advance your interests socially and pecuniarily

yours affectionately joe oldham

mrs b after glancing over the above letter seemed to be shocked as by electricity in a few moments she exclaimed who would have believed it love truly is like a stream ever running on and on to the great ocean of affection its course is hard to change

mrs h smiled martha lovejoy laughed heartily and said love is a giant to contend against he takes his subjects captive at his will and binds them as with chains

what do you think of things now inquired mrs h

i dare not say she replied with a faint smile upon her countenance

aunt polly raised up her spectacles and remarked its time our work had commenced

i consider the price very exorbitant as l said before said mrs b

i refer you to martha lovejoy sho was in the same fix as yourself she is present and can speak for herself

i am indeed indebted to you aunt polly and mrs h for my success in obtaining a bill said martha had it not been for your influence i would still be the slave of my former husband had i not been young and foolish neer would i have been caught in such a trap its true we are all liable to be deceived that marriage was the great error of my life

we often choose those for our bosom friends whom nature nor heaven never designed continued mrs h

truly said mrs b no mortal has experienced lit more sensibly than myself i am miserable brought on by the frailty and deception of the man whom i have been so silly and foolish as to love and cherish i would give the world to be released from him i have fully made up my mind to die rather than to live with him i would sutler myself to be banished to some distant isle in the sea uninhabited by the children of men

i truly sympathize with you said aunt polly

it is a horrible condition to be in

mi will give you fifty dollars twentyfive i will pay you in hand the remainder ill pay at some future time

i will accept your offer on one condition

pray what is the condition

i have no desire to chose for you a friend and a lover it is for your benefit alone i speak of him knowing that you can find no truer friend in all virginia remember well he is no short stock no bobtail aristocracy he is of the first families of this country and strictly a gentleman no woman in your condition should for a moment hesitate to accept the offer

i have every reason to believe he is all you represent him to be i have known him many years and once loved him as my own life time has blunted that love you must remember those things cannot be consummated in a day it behoves me to act prudent and cautious one step in the wrong direction would perhaps blast my success forever

 that is true child but ventures make merchants without some risk there is little to be gained

indeed if i were in your situation i would take such chances every day in the week and care but little as to what outsiders would say said martha lovejoy i have never known it to fail a woman who demands her rights secures ten friends to one enemy you know in such cases right or wrong women have the sympathy it will never do for you to cringe or yield to public opinion we are so constituted we can live down whatever may come against us if we aim to do so you must remember that society will not clothe nor feed us for instance look at mrs woodland she moved in the first society she was the idol of the rich surrounded with every comfort that one could wish to enjoy she applied and obtained a bill and in six days after she married george appleton the news spread like wildfire her name was on every tongue but like a match it soon died out she had the grit although not justified in leaving woodland

dear me said mrs h i am astonished mrs b you certainly cannot realize the position you are placed in it is an old saying and a true one that drowning men will catch at straws but you scorn determined not to seize the bark floating upon the sea of life which has come to your rescue you are blind to your own interest a woman who has been treated wrongly and abused it is indeed folly for you to let this offer pass it is not uncommon in this country for a woman to be engaged to another before they obtain a bill i tell you you must prepare yourself for every emergency and stop your cars to what babblers may say make up your mind thoroughly to seek your own happiness regardless of the praise or condemnation of others martha lovejoy like yourself hesitated i urged her up ami on until she became as fearless as a lion take courage and be a woman after my own heart go forward and you shall come out victorious make up your mind decide today you may have a thousand offers but never one like oldhams no never your disposition and his would match to a charm

 ladies said mrs b i claim to be a woman having some judgment and experience it is a true saying chickens should not be counted before they arc hatched if i was free to act i would be better able to decide to commit myself would subject me to ridicule and slander secrets you know are very hard to keep and especially where the parties are not equally interested we do not always know our friends from our enemies wo often have friends in disguise many have been sold at the hands of those they regarded their bosom friends and it is common for parties equally guilty to turn states evidence secrets are difficult for women to keep a person cannot be too cautious were i too accept mr oldhams proposition my husband has his friends and hirelings stationed on every highway and every social gathering in the neighborhood and should the matter leak out it would be a powerful weapon in the hands of my enemies and if defeated would leave a stain upon my character that could not be erased nature is frail at best i have no desire to fall a sacrifice at the hands of my enemies you must admit the risk is an adventurous one

mrs b we should not become alarmed of danger when there is none urged aunt polly if you will here agree to correspond with mr oldham will accept your offer this is the proposition i offer to you i accept the twentyfive dollars which is no money for a job of this kind

it would be easy for me to answer his letter but other considerations are to be looked at in the mean time

ho ho that is a matter strictly between yourselves added mrs h

aunt pol iy requested the ladies to take their seats around the table she then drew a greasy pack of cards from her pocket and drew down her spectacles remarking these never lie to me she cut them and held them for mrs b to draw which she did with a trembling hand and laid them cautiously upon the table aunt polly turned them face upwards and laid them in a row with an excited laugh she exclaimed we have got them we have got them  martha lovejoy clapped her hands and said i knew it i knew it 

thats so cried mrs h

madam said aunt polly you can see for yourself here is your husband and the widow side by side here is the house located according to those outside cards on the main line which denotes the main road that runs directly past her dwelling you see the window and the shedporch that covers the front and here is the hall running directly through the house in it you see the wretched man and woman holding a consultation this is your renegade husband and this pointing to a card is your pretended friend the widow

i am fully satisfied of their guilt nowreplied mrs b

nothing could be plainer if you continue to live with brown you deserve to be discarded by society said mrs h

i hope madam that you are now fully convinced that aunt polly is no humbugexclaimed martha lovejoy

i would not live with such a man he will never never mend his ways said aunt polly i have only to say in conclusion take the counsel of a friend and accept the offer made you by mr oldham

it is a matter that requires consideration said mrs b

you seem determined to be doubtful of success said mrs h

your case is as clear as the noonday sun a woman never had a better case to carry into court all depends entirely upon an able counsellor

i should dislike very much to obligate myself without being confident of fulfilling my pledge i prefer not to accept any favor from mr oldham at present at the same time i feel truly grateful to him his kindness i shall not forget

she paid aunt polly twentyfive dollars in hand and said ladies the day is far advanced and i must hurry home

be careful and not commit yourself on your arrival home said mrs h we must teach men that they cannot destroy a womans happiness and restore it when they think proper to blarney or as they call it to humor us if we expect to retain the respect due our sex we must teach them an impressive lesson let them know our rights are sacred and that our feelings are not to be tampered with he who violates the marriage vows should be branded with the mark of cain on his forehead allow not public sentiment to deter you from the right pay no attention to it you now have it in your power to release yourself from the tyrant and if you dont do it it is your own fault martha lovejoy married in three weeks from the day she was divorced and is to day the happiest woman in this section of the country is it not so martha

it is indeed said martha you should  embrace this opportunity i would make an example of the widow and him i would dissect them as a physician would a corpse i would teach them the fearful consequences of deception and guilt indeed i would wool her head for her she deserves to he skinned alive

you can depend on it said mrs b that i will do my duty to bring them to justice goodbye goodbye they all kissed her when shall we meet again i shall endeavor to have an interview with you before the trial

i should be most happy to hear how you are getting along said mrs h

we have accomplished much today said aunt polly

mrs b laughed

mrs h remarked after mrs b had left did you notice her countenance i am satisfied we made a favorable impression upon her mind in favor of mr oldham

she is oldhams property said martha there is no doubt of it did you notice her when you handed her the letter

 indeed i did

and pray what a change added aunt polly we worked her up beautifully

you know that she felt embarrassed under the circumstances and seriously objected to the proposition we advocated oldhams claims like philadelphia lawyers and made her present condition deplorable in the extreme wo did it to a charm said mrs h

aunt polly laughed and said you are the best attorney in the state you never fail to convict a prisoner guilty or innocent and clear your client

mrs h smiled and said i consider it a compliment

you are deserving it and indeed i should hate much to have you after me

ha ha  ejaculated mrs h knowing you as well as i do i would let up on you to a degree if you were the prisoner and i were employed to prosecute you

i would not trust you replied martha

we have secured her said mrs h they seldom outwit me you can rely on that i will make oldham pay for it i never work without compensation

do you think she will muster courage to leave brown asked aunt polly i am inclined to believe she loves him still

if she continues to live with him it will be because she is defeated in the bill i painted things to her in livid colors and indeed made things appear twice as bad as they were i hate the widow anyway i think but little of the widow and mrs bs husband they put on considerable airs with me at josh browns we were invited there to dinner they treated me very coolly and thought me beneath their notice and unworthy of their society i am determined to get even with them

i have long thought the widow stuck up said martha i have been to several parties where she was and had to receive a new introduction to her each time we have now got the drop on her and we will put her through a course of sprouts before we are done

she is nothing but an upstart said auut polly i knew her long before her husband died he was as fine a man as ever walked in shoeleather she led him a dogs life and rendered him unhappy she was continually flirting around with tom dick and harry she knows me as well as either of you we have past and repast but she never spoke to me in her life when we get the thumbscrews on her well make her know who we are and bring her down to a buttonhole lower shell not carry such a high head

the beauty of it is said aunt polly we have not only got her under our control but we are bound to make money out of the affair mrs b readily consented to pay fifty dollars and i am satisfied that oldham when he hears of the progress we have made in his behalf will not hesitate to give us a hundred dollars to commence with he loves mrs b as dearly as a baby loves milk love has no price we will make him pay

money is what we are after when do you expect him inquired aunt polly

i look for him tomorrow said mrs h i shall give him to understand it requires money to carry this affair through and without it little can be accomplished

he will not hesitate to pay any price you may ask him said martha he is liberal and has the means do you think she will answer his letter

i wish i was as sure of getting a thousand dollars as i am that she will answer it said mrs h at the same time i give her credit for not committing herself to us

readers we must here leave aunt polly mrs h and martha for the present and return to mrs b she seemed highly gratified with her visit she returned and entered her once happy home sue and the children welcomed her she embraced and kissed the children and shook hands with sue

missus said sue i almost gibe you up do tell me how tings isi want to know so bad

ah sue things are in a deplorable condition you have no idea nor a mind capable of comprehending the magnitude of the wrongs i have been subjected to your mastor ben is a wretched man has he asked for me during my absence

yes missus he did i tell him don no he say he suppose you gone on some foolish errand

where is he sue

i speck he is at de barn talkin wid dat peter

he and massa ben hub been talkin ever since he come from wash jacksons and dat peter tell him ebery ting he knows

i am aware of that sue i never entertained a favorable opinion of him from the first time i saw him i know that he leans with his master during the conversation mr b walked in and remarked how do you do nellie

speak not to me i have lost all respect for you i know enough of you to hate you in your grave from what i have learned this day replied mrs b

nellie do you mean to torment me unto death

yes and after death if i could you are a dissembler a knave and a villain i have solved the problem of your crime and am prepared at any time to prove your guilt your deeds of darkness i shall not be long in bringing to light you are devoid of dignity and have violated a right i hold as sacred as my life your soul is blackened with crime sin and vice you have desecrated every principle of right satan has a bill of sale of your wicked soul my fond hopes cherished love and blissful anticipations are withered forever my heart is made wicked oh that i could offer to god a prayer in your behalf that would be acceptable for your sins it is too late forever too late those who stand upon the everlasting principles of eternal justice are immovable the storms of persecution and the whirlwinds of slander shall harm them not they shall walk thro the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil but the guilty fleeth when none pursueth 

nellie you have become a maniac you are insane from whom have you gleaned your information

you apeak as one who was educated in the school of superstition and misplaced confidenceâ these principles with you are predominant your reason is dethroned bring forward those evil geniuses i will confront a regiment of them and prove every assertion to be as false as lucifer you are the subject of witchcraft you are treading in the path leading to perdition if you continue you are ruined every hope of happiness is gone those individuals are the mothers of falsehoods and like satan they go about seeking whom they may devour l they are the disciples of sedition malice hate and contempt you have not hesitated madam in wounding your devoted female companion a wound deep and sore made with the weapon of slander and reproach a wound i fear you can never heal your advisers are leading you to shame degradation and disgrace be wise and prudent i stand innocent i defy the world to convict me you are determined to agitate this matter until your name will be heralded from city to city and from village to village your character will become food for the vultures of society you are deaf to truth and blind to reason i possess every virtue that characterizes manhood dignity and morality with these weapons l am prepared to engage the foe i entertain no fears truth crushed to earth will rise again justice is doomed never to die mark you madam from this hour i have no compromises to offer if you intend applying for a billâthe sooner the better i will there meet you and my accusers face to face i shall shake their castles and fabrications to atoms thousands of innocent victims have been tortured upon the rack of slander i fear not its horrors they have thrashed me thoroughly with the rod of persecution my heart is made to bleed at every pore they cannot drive me to despair nor will i ask for protection or shelter under the emblems of compromise no never i have long been silent your plans of strategem are too thinly covered to be concealed i am sorry to say that i have become satisfied that all is not gold that glitters  i have admonished you to hearken to the voice of reason and to be guided by truth and love i have listened to you sir said mrs b you never fail to make an able defence like aram who was tried before a british court for his life you are competent to plead your own innocence i shall believe it only when it is proven aram plead for his life his eloquence held the court spellbound tears stood in almost every eye yet he failed to establish his innocence he died a felons death for the crime he had committed i have positively decided to apply for a bill at all hazards at the next setting of the court there is no further use in discussing this matter you have brought it upon yourself i shall likewise sue for the custody of the children and my third of the property

it is not uncommon for married women to become infatuated with lovers on the outside replied mr b

i desire you to explain yourself i will not allow you nor any one else to question my chastity without producing facts to bear them out you are the first and should be the last to insinuate anything against ray character sir take care that i dont make you eat your words as low as you are in the scale of degradation i supposed you to bo more manly what do you know of me sir i defy you to bring aught against me i am a lady in the strictest sense of the term

do not women err i am sorry to say they are blind to their own faults when a woman becomes dissatisfied with her companion she will pick any flaw or use any pretence to justify her in leaving him i have humored you like a spoiled child

i wish to hear no more from you i know enough of men to hate them the longest day i live do you think sir i would ever become the dupe of another man you have taught me a lessonâ one that will certainly last me to the grave to think you have acused me of loving another man is it not strange that this has just entered your imaginationnone but a corrupt and malignant heart like yours would harbor such thoughts without the slightest provocation well well she said with a shrug of her shoulders and a toss of her head

i have not been delicate in expressing what i believe to be true time may change or confirm my belief i shall live however let the results be what they may i admit such things try the souls of men and sink many forever in the gulf of despair never to rise again i rely solely upon the justice of that god who reads the secrets of all hearts 

oh  yes  you have become very pious it is a great pity that you did not think of him ere this if so you would be happy instead of miserable you will see that your widow will be made an example of in this community satan desires no better disciples than you and that falsehearted woman i trust that the god of heaven may have compassion on your soul i wish to have nothing more to say to you sir on the subject

mr b had in his possession the letter that mrs h presented to mrs b from mr oldham but she knew it not

we shall now leave mr and mrs b for the present and return to mrs h and mr oldham

according to promise mr oldham called upon mrs h he knocked at the door mrs h hastened to open it

dear me joe is that you i am pleased to see you

he was soon seated in a plain but neat sittingroom

i expect martha here every moment i suppose you would like to know how we succeeded during our first meeting with reference to you we accomplished a great deal in a short time she was really the hardest subject that i ever met with âin reference to your proposition otherwise things worked to a charm i am satisfied that she felt embarrassed and disliked to commit herself to us who were almost entire strangers to her when i spoke of you i saw there was a change in her countenance i conversed with her uninterruptedly for full three hours you know that i season things high i made her believe that she was the worst treated woman in virginia i plead nobly in your behalf and pointed her to a future fraught with happiness joy and peace if she would only consent to become your bosom companion

how did she seem to take it

to tell you the truth joe she was completely speechless for sometime she struggled hard to conceal her feelings to one unacquainted with human nature she might have deceived them in that particular but i am too old and have been too longin the business the fountain of love long chilled by the cold winds of life gushed up warm in her soul when i spoke of you i have not the slightest doubt that you will have the game not that she told me so i judge it from her appearance

do you think that she really loves me asked mr oldham

yes dearly the consummation of the entire affair is only a question of time

has she made arrangements to secure a bill

bless you we have been arranging plans so as to enable her to succeed

during the conversation martha stepped in

how do you do martha said mrs h

she bowed very politely martha returned the compliment mrs h further said do be seated martha we have a deal of work to accomplish yet i suppose that you are aware that i drafted aunt polly to aid me in the work martha also volunteered to assist us i do not claim the victory so far won for both of them were equally interested in the work and they are the parties to be employed in an enterprise of this kind they are also close observers and are not slow in carrying any weak points that may be presented they are good planners and sharp trappers

what are their charges for services rendered in this matter

aunt polly you know gains her livelihood by taking such jobs i told her that she should be well rewarded mrs gave aunt polly twentyfive dollars in hand which is only a drop in the bucket towards accomplishing the work before us here is martha of course i expect to compensate her

indeed mr oldham said martha you may think yourself one of the lucky ones we have put a beautiful feather in your cap she spoke with the ease and grace of a countess mr oldham smiled and replied thank you kindly i feel greatly indebted tq you ladies

mrs b is a charming woman continued martha she has every qualification to make a worthy companion she is generous kind and loving

do you really believe that i can win her affections asked mr oldham

ask me if the wind ever blows or if the sea ever runs dry rejoined martha

mr oldham laughed heartily and said i judge by that that you are sure of my success i am sir i am satisfied that she loves you dearly i would not be surprised to hear that she had already written to you

mr oldham laughed and drew the letter from his pocket

we never fail to succeed what did i tell you said mrs h to martha mr oldham have faith and much will be accomplished

mr oldham here read the letter from mrs b browns farm august d

dear mr oldhamâi am happy to inform you that i received your kind and welcome letter through the kindness of your esteemed friend mrs h i feel under ten thousand obligations to you for your generous offer and the interest you have manifested in my behalf i am pleased to know that i still have a place in your affections notwithstanding that years have intervened you have not blotted me from your memory you say that you love me as of yore i must acknowledge that your unexpected letter has made a lasting impression upon my mind you feared that your offer to assist me would be rejected and your letter to me made public i assure you it is so full of love friendship and sympathy no one possessing a spark of humanity could discard it i hesitate not in saying i have long been the subject of cruel and harsh treatment

i have ever been a kind and dutiful wife to brown i am compelled to make the bold attempt to free myself from the deceiver i may receive public censure but after all i alone am to be the judge of my happiness and not others i have borne with him until nature revolted and patience rebelled my love for him has turned to hate and every feeling of kindness is obliterated by his wicked deeds and acts to me i cannot think of living longer with such a monster no never i would rather be the wife of the humblest peasant on earth if i knew him to be just honorable and upright what is ease wealth or affluence without peace and confidence a palace to me indeed would be a prison if happiness did not dwell there i have been sacrificed by the man i loved oh how frail is human nature and how liable to err at any unguarded moment he has fallen deep in the whirlpool of vice and crime what has been his gratitude to me deception hypocrisy and guilt i regret much the course i am compelled to pursue when i think of my dear babes it brings tears to my eyes and fills my heart with grief but am i the only one that has been forced to take shelter under the wings of love extended to them by others whose hearts are warm and generous no we are so singularly constituted that women cannot be happy without an object to love i have long felt as if i had no earthly friend nor hope of future bliss in your letters to me give me still further encouragement to bear up under my affliction and sorrows and may i still look forward to the day of sunshine and happiness which i trust will burst through the sombre clouds of despair my affections are chilled now is the winter of my discontent when all should be joy and peace i shall be happy to correspond with you from time to time we must be cautious i am already accused of loving another and however pure and friendly your correspondence may be if made public would be injurious to both your friend mrs h is a true woman and i never shall forget her kindness

yours sincerely nellie brown

p sâwrite soon

every word that fell from his lips as he read the letter seemed to be food for their craving appetite

well well exclaimed mrs h i can scarcely believe it is from mrs b perhaps some one is trying to steal a inarch on us

i am sure it is from her said martha let me see the handwriting

oldham presented her the letter

i have seen the handwriting and am satisfied it is hers

dont you think we have accomplished wonders asked mrs h

you deserve great credit and have been far more successful than i anticipated replied mr oldham

i thank you for the compliment said mrs h smiling

we are trumps and are fully competent to open a school added martha laughing

i am sure we are competent to teach we would get many pupils said mrs h  few understand human nature so thoroughly as to arrange matters of this kind successfully domestic teaching is much needed as there is a deal of dissatisfaction among married folks it is a science not easily acquired

 few appreciate its worth martha continued human nature is hard to fathom mr oldham what does the widow think of things about this time

did you not hear that she wrote mrs b a stinging letter said mrs h for the soul of me i cannot imagine who posted her mrs b said she was satisfied that her husband had acquainted her of the fact mr oldham i am not deceived in the man

he will wish that he never had been born far better would it have been for him that a millstone was tied around his neck and that he should be cast into the deep said martha

when he reads his fearful doom as if written with the finger of the living god he will tremble and seek shelter he is a wretch undone said mrs h

i would like to be his jackcatch i would crack his neck as i would a pipestem he is unworthy to live and unfit to die said mr oldham

he then asked the question 

do you think it advisable for me to keep up the correspondence with mrs b

i do said mrs h you now have matters in your own hands and if you dont control them it will be your own fault it is an old saying and a ture one procrastination is the thief of time you deserve to be complimented for your labors

said mr oldham i will give you an order on mr peterson the merchant at centreville for four hundred dollars retain one hundred for your own services and present mrs b with the remainder 

the following is a copy of the order warrington turnpike aug d

mr peterson sirâplease pay to the bearer the sum of four hundred dollars and charge the same to my account joe oldham

mrs h thanked him kindly and said this is more than i expected to receive at this stage of the proceedings however you shall not be disappointed in our undertaking so far things have worked beautiful

that is all right said mr oldham i leave matters entirely in your charge i trust mrs b will not delay in having the papers tiled for a bill and if she is defeated i am a ruined man my entire hopes are centred upon her

i am sure she will apply at the october term of court and before christmas day she will be yours said martha

you will then consider yourself one of the happiest men in the state of virginia you will not only be her bosom companion but you will also have to assume the responsibility of a father she has two children and i have not the slightest doubt they will be assigned to her by the court said mrs h

it would afford me great pleasure to become their tutor and provider i am partially fond of children said mr oldham no man need be ashamed of them they are well behaved and have excellent manners i would give the world if they were mine mr b will struggle hard to retain them he loves them dearly at the same time i think him incompetent to raise them properly

he is a man of no refinement having but a meagre education at best he has been more successful in business than most men of his stamp said mr oldham

you know it is said a fool for luckremarked mrs h with a laugh

what do you think mr b is really worth

i should judge him now to be worth twenty thousand dollars replied mr oldham

indeed i have heard of late that he has made rather reckless speculations if he is worth that amount mrs b will have a handsome little sum they cannot keep her out of her third if she gets justice said mrs h

she will get every dollar of it if she employs a good counsellerâone that cannot be bribed said martha

i know pettifoggers in this state that would rob the grave of a deceased friend said mrs h

reader we must now leave mrs h for the present and again return to mrs b

sue

sue obeyed and peter shortly after entered his mistress sittingroom

nofing missus

now peter tell me the truth

yes missus

no missus

the letter was from lawyer higgins and was as follows fairfax village aug th

dear madamâi acknowledge the receipt of your letter at the hands of your servant peter and after a careful perusal of it i have become satisfied provided you can prove the facts you can obtain a bill if so your case is a plain one your papers requires to be filed and your witnesses produced upon the day of trial you desire to know what i will charge you to prosecute your case i never take a case of that kind for less than three hundred dollars but as i have been acquainted with you and your family for a number of years and believing you to be a lady in the strictest sense of the term i will obligate myself to secure you a bill for two hundred dollarsâa hundred dollars in hand and the balance when i take the stand to prosecute your case you can forward me the money by mail or hand then i will proceed you are aware that i shall have to give thirty days notice through the columns of some journal in accordance with the laws of the state i shall await your answer

yours respectfully james higgins atty

mrs b after reading the counsels letter was puzzled to know where to get the money to pay the fees she hesitated to make a demand on mr oldham notwithstanding he had offered to assist her in a few hours mrs h knocked at her door she opened it and said is it possiblo this is you walk in and take a seat 

i have but a few moments to stop said mrs h having heard that your husband was absent i concluded to call down and see you i would not have him see me here for the world

mrs b smiled and said i will protect you i have got him pretty well cowed down

do tell me how you have been getting along since our last interview  i have made things warm for him you may depend after all i pity him he is so humble

pity indeed  he deserves a good thrashing i am a little inclined to believe that you still love him

no at the same time it is not unnatural for us to possess humane feelings for those with whom we have been so long identified

my time is short as i come on business have you employed your counsel

i have just received a letter from lawyer higgins relative to the case and have just finished reading it

what does he think of it

he stated in his letter to me that if i could sustain the charges there would be no difficulty in obtaining a bill

what are his charges

two hundred dollars for the life of me i dont know where i can raise the money as i have none of my own i hate to write to mr oldham for it i have no doubt it would come forth

you need not write him a single line for money i have three hundred dollars in my possession that he authorized me to pay over to you

tis truly a godsend l am under a thousand obligations to you and the giver it would have been impossible for me to have raised the amount otherwise i have made up my mind fully never to ask brown for a single dollar while breath warms my body

i dont think you will ever have any need as long as mr oldham is your friend

tomorrow morning i will forward lawyer higgins his entire fee and authorize him to make arrangements for the trial

higgins is a good lawyer at the same time h montgomery would have been my choice i would not be surprised if mr b employed him against you

i will chance higgins as i have obligated my self i wish you to secure all the evidence you can to enable us to succeed i have misplaced the letter you gave me from mr oldham i have turned the house upside down and i cannot find it

i trust it has not fallen into the hands of your husband if so it will ruin us

no i am satisfied he has not got it if he had it he would have spoken about it it would be too good a thing for him to keep i may come across it when i least expect

i would like very much to have a consultation with you before the trial comes off likewise so would martha and aunt polly they feel deeply interested in your behalf

i shall endeavor to call at your house today two weeks or perhaps sooner

i shall look for you without fail mr oldham will be delighted when he reads your notice for a bill he is already crazy about you

mrs b laughed and said  i am glad to hear that somebody thinks well of me

and if you should need more money all you have to do is to name it he has plenty of it by the way i forgot to tell you i saw the widow in her front yard as i passed

did she speak to you

speak to me indeed the look she gave me was terrible in the extreme i judge she begins to think i am not the fool she took me for i will be a terror to her before i get through

she begins to realize her condition i guess she wishes she had been more prudent

i think so

do yon intend to remain here until the trial is over

i do not intend to move a peg my renegade husband and the widow wouldnt want a better thing if i should leave they would feel highly gratified to get rid of me so easy he has his bed and i have mine sue cooks his meals i have not sat at the table with him for three weeks past the children and myself eat in the little parlor adjoining the bedroom

i judge that he begins to think that you are in earnest keep him at his distance and have as little to say to him as possible push the matter right through replied mrs h

there shall be no delay on my part i assure you i also requested lawyer higgins to retain for me and the children onethird of the property dear me mr oldham is abundantly able to take care of you and the children we have spoken to him already about themhe was delighted at the idea to become their adopted father

that may be all right but let every man that is able take care of his own children mr b is fully able and why not provide for them

that is true they will be under your care after the trial

i dont know the court may not assign them to me

nonsense they would no more think of giving them in his charge than they would to strangers you have not the slightest idea of the feeling against him he has no friends his name is on every tongue and none speak well of him you are indeed blessed above thousands to have such a friend as mr oldham at this time it looks as if providence had ordered it does it not

indeed it does and were it not for him i dont know what i should do

now dear tell me if you succeed in obtaining a bill do you intend marrying him

mrs b laughed and said nothing short of matrimony will satisfy him he has been very kind to me

ha ha i tell you he is the man for you i suppose your present companion would have duckfits if he knew it

it is a matter that should be kept strictly private

the widow will use her endeavors to exonerate herself and to defeat us if possible she has brought her ducks to a fine market i believe she would assassinate me if she dare she is getting desperate

i dont fear her

i tell you she is not only revengeful but she is indeed a dangerous woman

i have always thought so

i have a great deal to say in a short space of time as i must be hurrying off what disposition will you make of poor sue in case you obtain a bill sue is my individual property and i would almost leave one of my children as to leave her she has long been my faithful servant and adviser in these trying times she is worthy of my consideration and care i have become satisfied that negroes like other races know their friends and appreciate them i have used my endeavors to secure the confidence of peter but without effect

how is that

when i first came on the farm i took a dislike to him i must say without a justifiable cause i treated him indifferently he seems never to have forgotten it he would be of considerable service to me if it were not for the dislike which i think he entertains for me he sticks to his master like a leech

i find it is better to use everybody right however humble in circumstances there are times when they can be of use it is better to have their confidence friendship influence and esteem than their dislike my mother had an old negro woman who nursed me we called her aunt debby the children loved her as they did their mother not withstanding she used to switch us whenever she felt like it dear me i must be off

whats your hurry

i have stayed longer than i anticipated goodbye goodbye

they kissed each other and parted after mrs h had left mrs b rushed into the kitchen to inform sue of her success

missus did you get de money dey say one bird in de hand is wort two in de bush

yes sue here it is

wall wall dat am de fact i so glad we are all right now missus

yes sue in the morning i shall forward two hundred of it to lawyer higgins if you see old bob pass tell him i want to see him i shall get him to take the money as he is going to the village

missus do you tink dat darkey can be lied on

yes sue he is very trustworthy and knows how to keep matters intrusted in him 

missus remakred sue are you gwine to write

no sue replied mrs b the money is all that is required to commence the suit

well if you can depend on dat fellow bob it is all right

many take old bob to be a fool but those who will but him for one will get cheated he is a good old negro but has his queer ways and it is not every one that can get along with him

dat am de truft he am mighty stubborn sometimes

sue i expect you are a little prejudiced against old bob becuase he dont spark you

ha ha for de heben sake hear dat missus do you tink i would hab dat darkey no missus i am too highstrung for dat

mrs b roared with laughter the following morning bbo passed and halted  the road leading to the main road from his masters farm ran directly through mr bs plantation sue hailed him he went to the kitchendoor and inquired whar your mistruss

she am in de bedroom replied sue

sue then informed mrs b who came to the door and said good morning robert

sarvant missus

bob i wish you to deliver this package to lawyer higgins at the village be careful not lose it

yes missus i be sure not to do dat

robert if you attend to it properly i may be induced to give you sue for a wife

robert opened his mouth and laughed until the tears ran down his sable checks in torrents and exclaimed to sue gal you is mine as sure as dis darkey am alibe

glong darkey who does you tuck me to be you tink i is some common darkey to hab de likes ob you said sue

the following day robert returned and presented mrs b with a note enclosed in an envelop from lawyer higgins it read as follows fairfax aug  th

mrs brown madamâi avail myself of the present opportunity to inform you that i received two hundred dollars the entire fee please accept this as an acknowledgment for the same i will send a notice tomorrow morning to the alexandria gazette for publication your case will perhaps be among the first on the docket notify your witnesses of the fact i will drop you a few lines informing you what day it will come up entertain no fears i shall do the best i can for you i remain yours respectfully james higgins

a short time before the trial mrs b dreamed she saw her brother and mother who had been dead many years her brother entered her room first her mother following and lastly came in aunt polly hopkins martha lovejoy and mrs h her mother and brother were clothed in shrouds as white as snow the last named three were dressed in robes as black as jet they huddled themselves together in the north corner of the room and looked vicious in the extreme mrs bs mother appeared not to notice them she bent over the bed and kissed her daughter and stroked back her hair with a hand as cold as ice she turned to her son and said what has possessed these evil spirits to congregate here as she spoke thus all of them hung their heads he pointed to them with the finger of death and said i t is they who seek the destruction of my sister and are conspiring to drag her to that region of misery and desolation polly was standing nearest to them that spirit said he would destroy us in the twinkling of an eye if it was not for the guardian angel of heaven then said the spirit of mrs bs mother oh what wretched beings they must be how dreadful is sin it is a terrible curse as she spoke all of them veiled their faces and said come let us depart from this the day is breaking aunt polly threw up her veil as she passed outlier eyes looked like balls of fire she gave them a terrible look then there appeared an angel who said to the spirits of mrs b and her son your time is up the two spirits then looked wistfully upon mrs b her mother again kissed her with her cold lips of death this awoke her she found it to be only a dream but it left a serious impression on her mind she then thought of the story sue told her about the spirits

mr b during his absence saw in one of the daily papers his wifes advertisement for a bill he immediately addressed a letter to h montgomery to defend the suit which was readily accepted

winchester va august st

mr brown dear sirâi take this method to inform you that i have received yours dated aug th in reply to the same i should be more than happy to act as your counsel my fee is two hundred and fifty dollars your word for the amount is sufficient have your witnesses in readiness to appear at the october term

yours respectfully h montgomery

mr b returned home on the following day and interrogated his wife in reference to her applying for a bill

sir your breath is spent in vain retorted mrs b i told you from the first i intended to secure a final separation from you and i intend to be as good as my word

are you sure you will succeed in obtaining a bill

yes sir without the slightest difficulty you have committed manslaughter upon your own domestic and social happiness you are looked upon with contempt by all lovers of society you have shown your hand and i have called you to an account

madamhe replied you are very sanguine of success be careful that you dont slip up on it i have fully made up my mind to defend against you and your tutors i have thus declared my intention thought it may be cowardice on my part nevertheless i have a character to sustain and he who has not the moral courage to defend his honor when assailed and pursued by the bloodhounds of society deserves to be drummed out of a christian community and stamped with the brand of cowardice marshal your legions for the conflict like the ancient shepherd i have only the sling of justice and the stone of truth to contend against my enemies and with a welldirected aim i may be enabled to deal them a deathblow i am ready for the conflict at any moment i entertain no fears and believe i shall achieve a noble victory in belief of my character i shall endeavor to leave their mangled bodies upon the field of conflict as a warning to all peacedisturbers and calumniators

the following letter was received by mrs b from a lady friend alexandria august th dear nellie  in scanning over one of our daily papers much to my surprise and mortification i saw a notice of your application for a bill of divorce what in the world has induced you to pursue such a course i fear that you have been hasty and unthoughtful it would be far better for you to cover your companions faults with the veil of charity than to make your domestic affairs public to the outside world who of us are without faults such proceedings are not only injurious to yourself but has its effect upon society remember your position the circle in which you associate and the example you should set as a pattern for your children no two joined together in the sacred bonds of wedlock were ever known to be perfect and each with an observing eye can detect faults in the other do endeavor to settle your difficulties between yourselves if so you will choke off public slander which invariably attends such cases i ad monish you as a friend he that controlleth his his own temper and household is greater than he that taketh a cittybe wise and prudent the calumniators of society are only waiting to satisfy their craving appetites none are exempt from the trials and afflications of life they attend us from the cradle to the tomb have you thought of the many dangers that attend a lone woman through life on the right and on the left gins and snares are set to entrap her the strongest of women have fallen a prey to the fowler i trust you will give this letter due consideration before you advance further this advice is from one that loves you as a sister

yours affectionately maris a dangerfield

yours affectionately nellie brown

according to promise mrs b went on the day appointed for the meeting to the house of mrs h on arriving there she found all present except her intended mr joe oldham aunt polly martha and mrs h gave her a cordial welcome

dear me child said aunt polly how have you been i havent seen you since our first meeting i have heard of your progress through mrs h and martha i was pleased to hear that you are still on the warpath

i have been quite well i thank you though i have had many trials since i last saw you i am fully determined to carry it throughâsink or swim perish or survive replied mrs b

i admire your pluck the time is not far distant when you will receive your just reward and come out as gold tried in the fireâa free and independent woman

she would make a good soldier said martha laughing

thank you for the compliment said mrs b

during the conversation mr oldham entered the party seemed delighted to greet and welcome him he threw his arms around mrs b and kissed her she blushed but soon became apparently easy

how have you been nellie i have long wanted to see you said mr oldham

mrs b with a pleasant smile answered  i have been well but have had a sea of troubles since i was here last and if it was not for poor sue i think i would have sank under them

sue has been your comforter

yes she has stuck to me like a mother

i supposed that you were having a tough time of it

poor thing she is to be pitied i know what such troubles are i have been married myself five times said aunt polly

mrs b laughed excessively and said you are an old hand at the bellows then

yes i can blow and strike at the same time

this remark set them all laughing

you never failed to secure a bill from your husbands when they failed to comply with their obligations

i have long made it an established rule to quit them then and there i was not particular as to a bill in some cases i have taken leg bail instead of a bill you know child the world is wide and in it is plenty of room i have never employed a lawyer to my knowledge nor do i think i ever shall there never has been a law during the history of my life to compel a woman to live with a man that she did not love

thats pretty good aunt polly i think the women ought to subscribe for a modal for you we had better now proceed to business as the time is short and i have a considerable distance to go nellie what counsel have you employedasked mr oldham

lawyer higgins  are you acquainted with him

by reputation i have seen him once or twice and have heard that he is a good counsellor 

he is at the same time i told mrs b i preferred h montgomery he is a pealer said mrs h

i think it would have been better to make sure work of it by employing him however it is too late now it is time that we should prepare for the coming conflict and have our witnesses in readiness how many witnesses can we musterasked mr oldham

myself martha and aunt polly are all i know of at present returned mrs h

two is as good as a thousand if they can establish the facts connected with the case

l think i am in possession of those facts

my evidence will go a good way towards convicting him said martha

if i dont convict him i will scare him terribly depend on it i have heard enough of the gentleman to hang an ordinary man if made known i shall not hesitate to tell all i have heard responded aunt polly

we have got much the best of him i never engage in jobs of this kind unless i have the advantage and the longest end of the rope

i am sure we can succeed if the witnesses will hang together on the main points it is likely the widow will be introduced as a witness against us i have heard that he has one or two others i have not learned who they are like a drowning man he will catch at anything to save himself replied mrs b

his witnesses will do him but little good if he knows what is best for him he would never enter the court house door said mrs h

i dont really believe that he will defend the suit responded martha

he never will give it up without a struggle for victory the least said about this matter the better i am willing to advance whatever money that is required to carry the case through consider it a success remarked mr oldham

indeed you may replied mrs h

if we dont succeed said aunt polly i will lose my head

ha  ha 

we cannot fail

mrs h and mrs b i wish to have a private interview with you for a few moments said mr oldham

certainly they replied excusing themselves to aunt polly and martha and entered the diningroom

nellie remarked mr oldham perhaps this will be the last time that we shall be enabled to see each other before the trial comes off i think it likely that you may need more money and for fear that we may not meet soon i present you with five one hundred dollar bills

dear me this is intruding on good nature answered mrs b

mrs h gave her a nudge with her arm to silence her

not at all

he also gave mrs h three fifty dollar bills to divide with martha and aunt polly they thanked him kindly he kissed mrs b goodbye and requested her to write to him soon

after mr oldham had left mrs h said he has the biggest heart of any little man i ever saw

she then asked aunt polly and martha what do you think he gave us

i have no idea replied aunt polly

i am sure i have not said martha

he gave mrs b five one hundred dollar bills and also three fifty dollar bills to me to divide among the three of us

ha  ha  he is a gentleman and he shall be rewarded said aunt polly

is it a fact asked martha i am a little astonished at his liberality though i knew that he was generous as i said before love has no price and well may he love a woman like you mrs b

mrs b smiled and said i have become accustomed to your flattery

indeed it is true said mrs h if i was as handsome as yourself i would play the men a merry string

she knows that she is handsome without telling her added aunt polly

i must be off said mrs b

what is your hurry will you not stay to tea inquired mrs h

thank you i have to walk and it is better that i should start early

why did you not ride bet

to tell you the truth i had no desire to see my friend the widow if i rode i would be compelled to pass her house

i would give myself little trouble about her i could ride over her and not speak to her

mrs h laughed and said thats like you martha

friends said mrs b you have been exceedingly kind to me and i am better prepared to reward you than i thought i would be will one hundred dollars more satisfy you

oh dear me dont rob yourself replied mrs h

tell her to accept the hundred dollars aunt polly said to martha in an undertone

mrs b bid them goodbye and desired to hear from them at the earliest opportunity

if that woman is defeated in getting a bill oldham will kill you remarked martha to mrs h

pray what will he do with youasked mrs h

i come in for an equal share but have had little to say at this gathering i pity her and would be delighted to see her succeed but to tell you the truth i dont think that she has any better show to obtain a bill than i have to be queen of england said martha

business is business said aunt polly we make our living by it we should have no sympathy it is our duty to seize our victims whereever we can find them and have no scruples money is what we are after

mrs h laughed and said your head is clear aunt polly

the afterpart is what i dreadâthat is being brought into court those lawyers are very personating and impudent replied martha

if you get paid for it why complain you must learn not to care or fear even satan courage is what you need said aunt polly

readers we will now return to mrs b she arrived home apparently gratified with her prospects she told sue of her success and the amount she had received from mr oldham and charged her to keep it a secret

missus did you get de money

mrs b drew from her pocket the bills and said sue there it is i intend after the suit to buy you a handsome present

tank you missus you am fixed am you gwine to marry dat gentleman

sue that is a question to answerwith a shrug of her shoulders how would you like to have him for your master

during the conversation mr b came in walked to the sittingroom and seated himself on the sofa mrs b passed to and fro in the room several times he taking little or no notice of her at last she inquired i have one question to ask you sir

what is that

do you intend to oppose me in obtaining a bill

madam i am done discussing the matter you seek invariably to drag me into a controversy i told you i would defend my character as long as there was an enemy who assailed it and i tell you again for the last time until we meet face to face in teh court house i will never allow myself to be taken a prisoner by those friends of yours without making a good fight

you will be sick of it mark my words if you knew what was best for you you would leave the state and never show your face in it again that is your opinion i am one of those who never run nor am i easily scared

mr b intended making a visit to his old home at richmond to see his parents and to remain there until the lime for the trial to come off he prepared himself for the journey and ordered sue to have breakfast early and pete to pack his valise and have queen saddled also a horse for himself as he wished peter to accompany him to the village

yes sar

yes sar

he and his master parted

the following morning about eight oclock the widow rode into town on horseback accompanied by mr nye two hours later aunt polly mrs h and martha also arrived seated in an oxwagon just as the names of the witnesses wore called they had scarcely time to arrange their toilets by this time the other witnesses were already in court which was crowded to its utmost capacity it was not long before aunt polly entered the court house her disciples following her they were the centre of attraction

after the examination of the witnesses lawyer higgins closed his case on behalf of his client as follows may it please the court and you gentlemen of the juryâthis case is one of vast interest and importance it involves the liberty the peace and the happiness of my client mrs b the law as i understand it is to protect the weak against the encroachments of the strong society morality and virtue needs to be fostered and protected he who destroys virtue wounds society and deserves to be punished to the full extent of the law woman is a weak vessel and should be shielded against the attacks of men who disregard the marriage vowâ who violate its rights with impunity and trample under foot those whom they have sworn before heavens altar to cherish and protect if justice is the right of the weak in common with the strong it is the duty of this court to act unbiassed and to give justice to whom it is due i shall gentlemen of the jury for the sati sfaction of this court convince you of the guilt of mr b who might have been a pattern of society and a congenial companion but like many others he has suffered himself to be drawn into the net of vice and the snares of crime the widow i have no doubt was once the idol of society at an unguarded moment she yielded to the temptor and thus brought disgrace to her own door i sympathise for her and hope she is not beyond redemption we are creatures of circumstances and are liable to err at the same time i am not here to defend her nor to excite sympathy in her behalfshe is a woman but gentlemen it would be far better for the peace and tranquility of society if persons like her were transported beyond the boundaries of enlightened civilization i have every reason to believe according to the evidence that she is a dangerous woman who hesitates not to corrupt the pure and the good mr b has brought dishonor to his home the evidence introduced here is truthful and reliable the circumstances surrounding the case would leave little if any doubt in the mind of the jurors that mr b is thrice guilty many have been convicted upon circumstantial evidence but the evidence introduced here gentlemen of the jury is prima facieâthe chain of evidence given by martha mrs hopkins and mrs h is a unit his visits day after day at the widows house is sufficient itself to satisfy this court that there was something rotten in denmark but gentlemen of the jury there is another fact that i wish to impress upon your minds though it may not be considered evidence according to our law at the same time it has its bearing and shows clearly that mr bs conduct has long been suspected that is the various reports degrading as they may be have again and again been sounded in the ears of mrs hopkins and the lady who was formerly known as mrs martha lovejoy derogatory to the character of mr b gentlemen of the jury look upon the lovely face of mrs b and if you are judges of human nature you can see innocence beaming from her countenance and say with meâpity in the extreme that a lady of her education refinement and  disposition is thus sacrificed by the man who claims to be her benefactor he is beyond the reach of hope and mercy and has forfeited every claim upon this good and virtuous woman she sits here clothed in spotless garments of purity the marriage contract though a civil contract and a mutual obligation the relationship between man and wife should hold them in the bonds of affection as long as each faithfully complied with the duties attached to the sacred rites i have no doubt the learned counsel for the defence will soar aloft upon the wings of imagination and will undoubtedly enchant you with his eloquent oratory aiming to impeach the credibility of the witnesses for the plaintiff the law of holy writ denounces fornication as a heinous sin and the law of our common country has long been a terror to those who violate the marriage vow it is your duty gentlemen of the jury to come to the rescue of virtue and to sustain morality sin is sweeping through our land like a tornado threatening to demolish the great temple of society and to sweep to the bosom of destruction the weak and the timid everywhere we see the effects of sin and its fearful results let us not as watchmen upon the walls of society close our eyes to these facts but unite as one man in cherishing its growth and progress we have wives and many of us are raising children for what i trust not for vice crime and disgrace no  no  god forbid for the good of societyâmay they ever be its ornaments and ths priceless jewels of our hearts gentlemen of the jury i have said sufficient i trust including the evidence to induce you if free fron prejudice to render a just decision for mrs b she is a wronged woman upon your decision gentlemen of the jury depends her future there is a higher court whose judge is a judge of all living and before whose august bar the world shall sooner or later stand to be judged for deeds committed on this earth think of it gentlemen of the jury consign her not to a grave of despair nor a valley of gloom sustain a feeble woman in her rights in conclusion we have had but one witness introduced against us mr nye what if you please is his evidence he tells the court that on or about july th or august st he had business at mrs hs house as he neared her house he tells you he heard strange voices there his curiosity became so great that he crept stealthily around the house and stole quietly into her kitchen as only a thief would do to pry into matters that did not concern him he tells you here that he did not see the faces of the parties but heard the name of mrs b mentioned in connection with mr oldham does this evidence establish the guilt of mrs b do you not remember gentlemen of the jury of reading an account of a murder in new york city in  on the th day of august this murder occured in a front room on the first floor a citizen happened at the time the difficulty occured to be passing he saw the murderer plunge his dagger deep into the heart of his victim his evidence was ruled out on the ground that he saw the tragedy through a glass window now gentlemen of the jury if the evidence was ruled outâthe witness in the case seeing it in the broad sunlight of dayi ask should not the evidence of mr nye be discarded who saw not the parties at all according to his evidence any of us are liable to be convicted of crimes that transgressors may commit if they have a voice similar to ours i judge he can designate every resident of virginia at the dead hour of night by their voices if we are defeated i shall look forward to the day when virtue shall receive its just reward and men of pure hearts and clean hands will not hesitate to shield woman against the cunning deception of man give us a society untainted with corruption and courts that hesitate not to punish crime gentlemen of the jury if you entertain respect for the defendant you must not allow it to fetter your verdict nor deter justice act impartially if so the great temple of our society will not fall but will stand a lasting monument until this great nation has passed away will you assist me in defending society and the pure from the devices of the wicked let this court make an example of all such men as brown i ask simple justice for the good of society it is your duty your right and your sworn obligation to give justice to whom it is due she is as innocent and as pure from intrigue as an angel of light and as free from deception as a bird that drifts in the summer breeze the evidence against her is no evidence at all give her hope of future bliss and deliver her from the dark and cheerless depths of gloom and despair and may she realize by your impartial decision the radiant sunlight of joy hope and happiness i now leave this case with you gentlemen of the jury knowing you to be the advocates of justice the defenders of virtue and the friends of good society you can but free her from him who has blasted her every hope and paralyzed her affections to you mr brown i would say oh that some invisible power some angel of light would dart from the realms of everlasting day and warn you of your wicked condition

after mrs bs counsel had concluded lawyer montgomery began his defence for the defendant mr b which was as follows may it please the court and you gentlemen of the juryâi have listened attentively to the learned counsel lor the plaintiff mr higgins he has failed to argue the case from any standpoint i am the sworn sentinel of justice it is my duty to guard well every outlet of society as well as its avenues i shall this day hew to the line let the chips fly in whose face they may i shall aim to throw behind their fortifications of falsehood the red hot shot of truth and to force the enemy if possible to open combat i am ready for a fair fight i will seek to take no undue advantages i shall argue the law upon its merits law is as old as god and stood between adam and his maker when the creature violated it justice demanded a propitiation the learned counsellor has endeavored to create and excite sympathy in behalf of plaintiff mrs b law is stern and inflexible it has no sympathy and he or she who violates its rights incurs its wrath if my client is guilty of the crime alleged against him he deserves its punishment i agree with the learned counsellor in one particular that society is the great temple of our social and domestic happiness and the pure worship at its sacred shrine knock out its stupendous pillars and desecrate its sacred altars and that hour the sun of morality progress and literature sets forever on this nation this party gentlemen of the jury is a base band of conspirators combined together to make war upon society and if possible to poison its pure streams and overturn its mighty pillars but gentlemen justice is swift on their heels i see guilt pictured deep in their countenances it is a great mystery to me that aunt polly as she is called cannot see it she has four eyes being one of the conspirators of course she cannot see it i shall scourge them to the quick with the lash of truth and the rod of justice i will show this court who these women are and their veracity for truth

you could have lit a candle in their faces at this moment mr montgomery continued gentlemen of the juryâyou have heard the evidence of aunt polly the great soothsayer martha lovejoy and mrs h the evidence of mrs h is the strongest link in the chain and what is it she saw mr b and the widow sitting side by side on an open porch at noonday i ask the court is it a crime for a lady and a gentleman to sit side by side if there is any law touching this point i know it not if there is i would prefer taking up my abode among heathensâbehind the bright and glorious sun of civilization but she comes into the court and says that things looked very suspicious to the like of her i have no doubt it does she is as corrupt and as base as ever any woman was like the samaritan woman whom our saviour interrogated at the well she has had many husbands and the one she now has is not her lawful husband what is the evidence of mrs martha lovejoy she comes into court with a long and increditable story and what does it amount to she says that she has heard so and so and saw mr b at the widows house on several occasions when asked what she sawâshe saw nothing that is pretty evidence to he introduced into our courts to convict parties of unimpeachable character what is her character she is the vilest of the vileâroaming from house to house seeking whom she may devour she is one of those disciples who believe that a woman has the right to set aside the marriage vows at any time and become the wife of another she is not to be believed on oath the last but not the least is this aunt polly she is the chief of sinners and the archfiend of despair she tells you what she has heardâshe says she saw nothing who can fathom the depths of her crimesâthe deception and artfulness she is capable of exerting the states prison has long been robbed of its victim it should have been her residence for the good and peace of society she has also had her complement of husbands and is a terror wherever she can make a raid upon the innocent and virtuous

at this point lawyer montgomery asked that aunt polly be called to the stand to answer questions he proposed to ask her

the court assented and ordered her to take the stand

aunt polly

sir

are you acquainted with j oldham

slightly

do you not know of a certain sum being offered for the separation of mr and mrs b by that individual

she paused

remember you are sworn to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth answer this question

i did hear mr oldham say that he sympathized with mrs b

that is not the question i want to know if you were not present when a certain sum of money was offered for the separation of mr and mrs b

i heard mrs h say that she expected to get some money cannot recollect whether she named the parties or not

you appear to be very hard to make understand did you not receive twentyfive dollars from mrs b for services rendered

aunt polly was struck dumb

answer the question

mrs h gave me that amount

what did she give it to you for

a present sir

gentlemen of the jury you can see clearly that the truth is yet to be told this woman is a liar by instinct and education she is a terrible wretch to contend with i will prove her before i get through to be the mother of falsehood she had rather lie on six months credit than to tell the truth for cash she says mrs h gave her the money as a present for the satisfaction of the court i wish to recall horace nye on the stand again

the judge called mr nye to the stand

mr nye please make your statement again to the court what you know about this matter and answer any questions the counsellor may ask you said the judge

mr nye then made the following statement i called at the house of mrs h according to the best of my knowledge on business on or about the latter part of july or the first of august as i neared the house i heard several strange voices in the settingroom after listening a few moments i became interested in the conversation i left the front and crept quietly along to the kitchen which is on the south side to get a better opportunity of hearing the kitchen door was ajar there was no light in the kitchen i entered and secreted myself behind the door leading to the sittingroom i heard mr oldham ask aunt polly   do you think mrs b loves me she told him yes he then asked if she thought they would be successful in aiding her to obtain a bill she said there was not the least doubt of it

mr higgins asked the witness what was his business there

objected to by lawyer montgomery

objection sustained by the court

mr nye proceeded  i heard mr oldham say that ho loved her as dearly as his own life and that money was no object if they could only secure her a bill

lawyer montgomery then proceeded with his argument as follows gentlemen of the jury â there is the secret mrs b wept like a child these are characters brought here to swear away a mans reputation and destroy his domestic peace and happiness money gentlemen and an outside lover are the causes of mrs bs unhappiness now gentlemen of the jury i will prove the fact more satisfactory before i get through it is not uncommon for women however good to become corrupted when thrown in contact with such characters as martha lovejoy aunt polly and mrs h those loopholes through which women leap must be closed âthe marriage rights protected and honored those peacedisturbers should be made to know that they will not be tolerated nor shall they as long as i have a voice corrupt society the evidence of mr nye alone should be sufficient to satisfy you of the falsehoods of these three demons in human shape mr nyes character for veracity and truth is unimpeachable those sharks who prey upon the community should be shunned as vipers they are as corrupt as the angels of darkness it should be stamped upon their foreheads with letters of living light that all may read beware of those vampires of society those messengers of despair

mr montgomery here requested that mrs h should be put again on the witness stand to answer a few questions

the court granted the request and ordered mrs h to come forward which she did

mrs h are you not acquainted with mr oldham

great heavensshe exclaimed and rushed for the door

the officer intercepted her

you leper of society i have long heard of your notoriety and the deception you have long practised on the community you are putrified and smell in the nostrils of society you are a beautiful subject to set in judgment upon others go  as did naman of old wash and be healed of your malady answer the question

mr higgins counsel for the plaintiff objected the judge overruled the objection

mrs h replied in a trembling voice yes sir

did you not take the contract to separate mr and mrs b for a certain sum of money

she fell to the floor as if shot with a rifle ball

mr higgins raise said her to her feet

i will aim to throw the harpoon of truth still deeper in this wretch of misery

they tried to resuscitate her

let her be said mr montgomery i trust she has received a deathwound already i will call the other conspiratorâmartha lovejoy excuse me madam as i am not acquainted with your other title since you have been divorced

sir

are you not acquainted with mr oldham

slightly sir

do you not know of a certain sum having been paid to mrs h in hand for the separation of mr b and his wife remember ananias and sapphire who fell dead at the feet of the prophet for lying answer the question

i cannot say i do

was you not present when mr oldham paid the money

i did not see the money paid

did you not receive a portion of the sum

she paused and answered mrs h paid me a bill she owed me

for what

mr higgins objected to this

the judge sustained him

i have the biggest set of perjurers to contend with today that ever entered a court house

gentlemen of the juryâit is an evident truth that the testimony given by those parties is anything but creditable they have come into court with lies upon their iips and revenge in their hearts they have come to strip my client of every earthly hope take from a man his bosom companion and his offspringâyou take his all and leave him a total wreck upon lifes troubled ocean without a compass or a rudder to steer his frail bark gentlemen of the jury cypher this case down to yourselves it is then you will bo better able to render a just decision against the conspirators who have banded to undermine the foundations of society and to swear away the character of that worthy widow and to blast her hopes of future happiness her earthly all has been stricken down by the hand of death i ask you gentlemen of the jury shall she leave this court covered with disgrace or in spotless robes of chastity and purity as in the past could her companion speak from the tomb he would tell you that she is a christian and that her persecutors receive their mission from the fiend who made war upon the saints of heaven and were hurled over its battlements and confined in some unknown place in gods universe i take back a part of that gentlemen of the jury aunt polly and her craft know his whereabouts i will soon submit this ease to you for your serious consideration trusting from the evidence and its credibility that you will be able to render a fair and impartial decision gentlemen of the jury you have heard the evidence for the plaintiff and the defendant it is for you to determine the guilt or the innocence of my client but for the satisfaction of this court i will show you the depravity of a woman who is said to be a lady a virtuous and a prudent woman i will now gentlemen read you a letter that she had not the slightest idea was in the possession of her husband

mrs b exclaimed i am a ruined woman

pie read the letter the court resounded with applause this letter was from mr oldham to mrs b their first correspondence he then continued this is the great secret which has caused this domestic war i ask you gentlemen of the jury is it not an outrage i wish that mr oldham was hero present i would give him the severest scathing that ever man had he is a miserable wretch a fiend of despair and deserves to be quartered alive it is not uncommon for women when they become infatuated with others to seize any pretext to justify them in their guilt and deceptions lot us throw up an impregnable bulwark to protect the just from the machinations of the corrupt this involves the marriage rite also the character of a gentleman that has stood heretofore unimpeachable in society and whom i believe to be perfectly innocent of the charges preferred against him today let him go forth from this court clothed with all the dignity of manhood and with no blot upon his character this case remember gentleman involves the happiness of mr b and a rite we hold sacred the marriage rite whether a divine or a civil contract is binding on those who assume its obligations it is sanctioned by heaven they who violate its rights are not the friends of society it is the foundation of happiness to those who honor it it is the agency of virtue and morality it raises woman to that level for which god created her i appeal to you gentlemen of the jury and ask when the ties that bind man and wife together are riven by the influence of such characters as aunt polly martha lovejoy and mrs h whose occupation it is to corrupt society and to ensnare the innocent in their gins of vice where is the remedy to protect society and to shield the good against the attacks of the wicked it should be found here it is for you and every wellwisher to build up an impregnable wall around society so high that the wolves may not ascend it and inscribe upon its stupendous pillars in characters bright and vivid that all may read it none but the good dwell here wedlock is the sun that lights up our moral sky and points us to future greatness and grandeur as a nation christianity will lose its virtue and power the night of heathenism will have spread its gloomy mantle over the radiant skies of our fond hopes and cherished institutions as long gentlemen of the jury as reason keeps her throne and i have a voice i will ever defend the just against the attacks of the unjust heaven grant that i may ever prove to be the friend and advocate of truth men and women may disguise it and crush it to the earth it will rise again in its strength and beauty why gentlemen of the jury because god is its divine author thousands have become martyrs because they dared to utter it they rejoiced to die in its defence i believe when time and eternity shall shake hands âwhen the mighty nations of earth are entombed in the greatsepulchre of timeâwhen earth and sea shall give up their deadâjustice and truth will be heavens brightest attributes let us as christians fear god and obey his teachings i have detained the court longer than i expected hoping that you will bear with me a few moments longer i wish now to address my remarks to aunt polly and her wicked disciples aunt polly  the silvery hairs of your head denote that you have lived nearly your allotted days you are fast ripening for the grave and must soon become an inhabitant of the spirit world you should be the last one engaged in so wicked a scheme you are gliding down the hill of life you are standing upon the very verge of eternity your life has been spent in vice and crime i fear satan has already secured a bill of sale of your wicked soul oh that god in his mercy may save you from that death that never dies soek favor today of god do you not know god abhors the slanderer the liar the backbiter and the enemies of morality he will visit them not in mercy but in wrath those who seek to destroy the happiness of their followbeings are as much to be dreaded as the angels of night well may tears course down your cheeks i trust they are signs of repentance heaven pity you mrs h you are a wicked and malicious woman the recording angel of heaven blushes to record your sins you are as wily as a fox your depth of crime is hard to fathom you are as treacherous as a serpent and as destructive as a wild beast well may you blush and hang your guilty head you have lost every trait that characterizes and adorns woman as the loveliest of creation love purity and goodness are a strangers to you you have not one redeeming trait of character who shall enter the kingdom of heaven  she that hath clean hands and a pure heart you have wronged this just widow today and have sought to cover her with shame and disgrace you have wounded her soul you have sought by stratagem and device to tear asunder man and wife but i have implicit confidence in the integrity of this jury to protect her and him from the pit which you aunt polly and martha have dug for them the time has come that a fearful example should be made of such pests and renegades as you have proven yourselves to be i hope gentlemen of the jury you may never again be called upon to witness such a vile combination of corruptionists and perjurers as have presented themselves here today i leave you mrs h in the hands of a just god martha you are young in years but old in crime you might have been an ornament to society and exerted a good influence in behalf of the community your very nature is sinful and wicked you are in the wrong path your associates are of the most desperate character they are as destructive as the lion of the forest oh that i could induce you to forsake sin and become a useful member of society flee from it sin kills beyond the tomb i trust you may reform and become the associate of christians if i forget to defend the holy institutions bequeathed to us by the blessed saviour and his devoted followers let my right hand forget its cunning we see the works of god and his power and glory in the starry sky we see it in every blade of grass we behold it in the great deep may we as a nation favored of god keep his holy commandments and reverence the marriage vow i admit here are causes which may justify separation for instance god the giver of our moral law has declared in holy writ that adultery should be the only cause for a divorce other causes may in extreme cases justify a separation none of which operate in the present ease persons often marry others who are not their equals and who cannot be raised to their grade of intelligence such persons are placed in an unpleasant position this alone should not justify a divorce though mortifying to those who are connected with such persons incompatibility of temper is another evil that causes much unhappiness many other causes i could name gentlemen of the jury if time would permit let us reverence the god of our forefathers ho who directed the pilgrim fathers in the days of darkness and despair he nerved their souls when oppressed by british rule when the sword disease and hunger swept them down the god of nations hovered around them their bloody footprints were left in the snow as an evidence of devotion to freedom and religious institutions by his divine aid they triumphed gloriously allow me to thank the court for its indulgence i now gentlemen of the jury leave the case with you lor your consideration believing you think as i do that it is a conspiracy formed for the overthrow of the great fabric of morality and to crush the fond hopes and aspirations of the souls of those who cherish it

at the closing of mr montgomerys argument judge johnson charged the jury as follows  gentlemen of the juryâthis case is one that involves the interest of each of the parties to this suit i regret much the unhappy results growing out of it the marriage rite is a sacred one and should be preserved inviolate we are told in sacred writ those that god joined together let no man put asunderthey become man and wife under those sacred vows by their choice they preferred their case to be tried by you gentlemen of the jury which is rather unusual but it relieves me from the unpleasant duty of rendering a decission lot me here say to you gentlemen of the jury firstâdivest yourselves of all personal prejudices if there should be any against either of the parties present secondâtake into consideration the character of the witnesses here introduced for and against the parties interested in this suit and their character for truth and veracity thirdlyâexamine carefully the weight and bearing of said testimony given fourthlyâ make a close analyzation of the facts and of the correspondence of mrs b and mr oldham if then in your judgment you believe mr browa the defendant to be guilty of the charges it is for you to render a fair and impartial decision in favor of mrs b if there should be any doubts on your minds the defendant should have the benefit of said doubts

and if mr b is not guilty be should be honorably exonerated from the chrgaes the marriage rite must be respected and the laws of our common country enforced to protect the weak against the encroachments of the strong

the judge then handed the letter to the foreman of the jury the jurors retired and after being out an hour and a half brought in a verdict of not guilty which was received by the spectators with loud applause

the judge then admonished them to bury the hatchet of domestic strife and return to the embraces of each other mrs b advanced to her husband and threw her arms around his neck and kissed him with tears rolling down her cheeks the scene was truly indescribable tears stood in every eye and silence reigned throughout this was an impressive lesson to them they pledged themselves mutually that death alone should sever them from each other

the judge then addressed aunt polly martha lovejoy and mrs h as follows i pity these unfortunate women who have taken pleasure in degrading themselves and have sought to rob a virtuous lady of her character the god of heaven has promised to be a husband to the widow his guarding angel has stood near her in this her hour of trial and affliction aunt polly mrs h and martha lovejoy have sought for gold to blast the hope of the just and to destroy the happiness of others which gold nor silver cannot purchase i have been on the bench for twenty years i never witnessed such characters introduced in court i regret much that an example cannot be made of such persons who is more to be feared than the slanderer who is more dangerous to society gods revenge will visit them you are guilty of a the most  heinous crime which is in the calendar murder excepted your education has been neglected you have become hardened in sin i trust in god you never will enter this room while i occupy this bench

the house resounded with applause they stood trembling like prisoners condemed to death

the judge continued if had the power i would consign them to a prison that should be built and dedicated to slanderers and liars no one is secure from their attacks every city town and village is infested with such persons they are a disgrace to any community they are enemies to god and man who of us here have been exempt from the spleen of the calumniator and our names heralded from house to house heaven is surely the only place exempt from the wicked there the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are forever at rest your verdict gentlemen of the jury gives me great satisfaction and i trust the public generally will be benefited by it had these geniuses succeeded in their plans so well arranged and conseived the whole neighborhood would have been endangered every man and woman who felt the least aggrieved would apply for a bill disregarding the holy rite of matrimony we have established a precedent that heaven sanctions i am proud to say lawyer montgomery has lifted high the banner of morality today he has done his duty and done it well if other counsellors would follow his example we would soon have a far better state of tilings for a paltry sum of money lawyers would divorce the church of christ although purchased with his precious blood leave the court you vile wretches said the judge to aunt polly and her disciples

they were hooted out of the court followed by an excited crowd  many ladies gathered around the widow and mrs b mr bs friends congratulated him mrs b approached the widow and fell upon her knees with tears coursing down her cheeks and said will you forgive me i have wronged truly my best and truest female companion

the widow kissed her and said nellie i love you still

they left the courthouse together mrs b leaning upon her husbands arm weeping as though her heart would break

so ends the great divorce case of virginia

in conclusion we have yet left many persons like mrs h aunt polly and martha lovejoy whose chief delight is to meddle with everybodys business and sow the seeds of discord

jane gray was the daughter of a wealthy physician of new orleans she possessed all the requirements of a finished education she was handsome and charming she swayed a magical influence over her associates she moved in the first circles of society she made many friendsânone had less enemies she was left an orphan at the tender age of one year and three months her fathers brother adopted her they spared neither money nor pains to educate her her father left her a handsome fortune at his death jane knew but little concerning her mother she often heard mrs james gray remark what a beautiful girl her sister louisa was how unfortunate it was she had been kidnapped jane never would haveknown that she had a sister if it was not for the information derived from mrs gray she had many admirers gentlemen of refinement and wealth sought to capture her noble heart these offers she declined through the course of social events she made the acquaintance of a mr zevoe a cuban planter he was by no means prepossessing or attractive but he was reported to be worth two millions of dollars

he was not long in securing her consent to unite with him in the sacred bonds of matrimony her adopted father and mother were not well pleased with her choice but offered no serious objections they regretted it much because their blood had been kept pure so many generations with but a slight mixture of african blood coursing through janes veins of which fact she was ignorant should now be corrupted with spanish mixture however they were married on the twentysixth day of september shortly after they obtained passage on the old ship sea monster which was advertised to sail on the first day of october for cuba they made every preparation that was necessary for the voyage on the morning of the first of october at halfpast eight oclock according to arrangement a carriage was at the door of the residence the morning was indeed lovely and seemed to be the omen of happiness and joy to bride and groom the two parlors were crowded with her friends and acquaintances who came to bid her farewell many who could not gain access rushed to the steamer to await their coming

it was indeed a day long to be remembered women wept strong men with warm hearts could not conceal their tears the bride and the groom entered the coach accompanied by her adopted parents the driver was not long in whirling them to the landing where were congregated a host of her friends who crowded aboard of the steamer to bid her an affectionate farewell the captain in the course of thirty minutes gave orders to notify the guests to go ashore which they did many with tears coursing down their cheeks the signal was then given to cast off the moorings jane rushed on deck to gaze upon her friends ashore by the time the steamer was drifting out in the deep and heading for the ocean jane zevoe was so much affected she could scarcely wave her handkerchief as a token of farewell jane lost sight of her friends in the distance she then cast her weary eyes upon the stately domes and edifices of her native city she looked eagerly upon them until they faded from her view in the glorious sunlight of an autumn day strange emotions filled her soul as the ocean widened the space between her and the home of her childhood she retired to her stateroom to reflect upon the scenes and pleassures of the past

she wept long and bitterly her husband tried to soothe her grief by telling her to cast her all on him to her he would be a father and a husband

nothing worthy of note transpired during the voyage on the fifth day of october the gallant ship cast anchor in the harbor of havana at halfpast eight oclock in the morning mr and mrs zevoe went ashore and ordered breakfast and a suite of rooms at the planters hotel here they remained recruiting themselves from the effects of their late voyage hero she was the centre of attraction and received many calls from the nobility of cuba she received the blessings of many who hoped that the radiant sunbeams of happiness and joy would shine brightly around her pathway

on the twelfth day of october her husband procured a carriage they left early on that morning for his plantation which was sixteen miles from the city of havana they arrived safe at four oclock at their country mansion which was not at all prepossessing to the bride for its architecture rachel the negro servant after shaking hands with her master received a slight introduction to her new mistress whom she escorted to the parlor which looked cheerless and ancient to mrs zevoe the only furniture that it contained was a half dozen canebottom chairs an old dingy desk a settee a rocking chair and a plain old fashioned bureau the floor was not robed with purple carpet but was dressed with plain common matting jane made herself as cheerful as circumstances would permit she felt as though her brightest and happiest days had passed mr zevoe after settling with the driver and arranging outside matters entered the parlor

he saw at a glance that she was neither cheerful nor happy he engaged in conversation with her in regard to his future plans and prospects while they were conversing rachel was busying herself preparing for supper when the repast was ready she notified mr and mrs zevoe they entered the diningroom which exhibited neither taste nor style she partook of the supper which did not suit her palate or appetite after supper she concluded to take an observation of the rooms in the dwelling rachel being delighted with her appearance offered to escort her which offer was accepted they were not long in exploring the premises she was more disappointed than she had been previously they contained nothing worthy of note she told rachel she felt greatly disappointed in the appearance of things but requested rachel not to speak of it to her master she returned to the parlor unable to disguise her feelings

he again renewed the conversation and asked her how she liked the appearance of things she smiled but not cheerfully and said i suppose it will do

he then told her that he intended to furnish the house complete and had left his order in new york which he expected would arrive in thirty days she thought it very strange that he did not have the house furnished previous to their arrival he offered some slight excuse the clock chimed ten and they retired to bed they arose next morning at eight and breakfasted after which they took a morning walk the air was pure invigorating and fragrant with the odor of flowers the sun was just climbing the eastern horizon spreading its golden rays over natures favored landscape the birds were pouring forth their melodies all nature seemed to lend its beauties and loveliness to welcome jane zevoe yet she was not happy she told her husband of a strange dream she had during the night about her long lost sister she saw her and conversed with her he asked her under what circumstances she left

i only know what i learned from my adopted parents concerning louisa said jane  she was playing with some children in the neighborhood she was not more than six or seven years of age at the time and was induced to follow a man under the promise of presenting her with candy and toys she has never been seen from that day to this they say they advertised for her in every paper in the state and offered large rewards for her recovery that is all i know about it i would give the world with all its wealth to see her they tell me she is the striking likeness of my father

my dear i sympathize with you a sisters love is incomprehensible to one like myself i have not a relative living on earth but i will use my endeavors to assist you to recover her i have a slave on this plantation that anybody would take to be you not knowing that she had african blood in her veins

ah indeed said mrs zevoe i am sure she is not a relative of mine for my family are of pure saxon blood nevertheless i would like to see her

by this time they had returned to the house he excused himself and left to attend to some business on the plantation mrs zevoe entered into conversation with rachel and asked have you ever seen a colored woman on the plantation that your master says resembles me so much

i have she resembles you slightly

where did you come from rachelasked mrs zevoe

i came from new orleans

is it possible says mrs zevoe that you come from my native state tell me who you belonged to there 

i was owned when quite small by a man named william jackson his property was attached for debt myself and mother including other slaves were sold at public auction in new orleans a doctor gray purchased me to take care of a little girl called jane whose mother and an older sister the doctor sold because she displeased him he took a fancy to little jane and concluded to raise and educate her

did you ever see the woman and child he sold

no madam they wre sold before i went to live with the doctor

how old do you think  the girl was when she was sold

i have heard others say she was between six and seven 

how old was this child jane when you went to nurse her

she was just able to toddle around a chair indeed i often felt sorry for the dear little creature although i took great care of it it ate and slept with me

how long did you live with the doctor

nine months

why did you leave him

he died during the nine months his brother was left executor of the doctors estate they concluded to adopt little jane as their own child the doctors brother was opposed to holding slaves he sold me to a minister who promised to take good care of me i went to live with him his wifes health was very poor they concluded to take a trip to cuba to improve her health we arrived here safe i waited upon her day and night by constant care and attention a change took place for the better and in six months she finally recovered for my faithful attention to her they promised never to part with me after remaining here eight months they concluded again to return to louisiana the day before they left i was notified by a gentleman that i was his individual property this i could not believe i rushed into the sittingroom where my mistress was and asked her if such were the facts she replied rachel our moans are about exhausted mr cook was compelled to dispose of you to raise funds as he did not wish to send home for more means i think rachel you have a good master in mr zevoe and a comfortable home so you must endeavor to make yourself contented tears coursed down my cheeks as those words fell from her lips

i long entertained the hope of returning home with them

indeed they treated you very mean but you must put your trust in god his blessings and his mercies he bestows upon the just and the good his vengeance and his wrath shall visit the unjust i shall do all in my power to make matters pleasant for you during my stay

rachel thanked her kindly

the following morning mrs zevoe and rachel prepared themselves to call and see louisa rachel remarked before leaving the house mr zevoe would not like it as he notified me to have no communication with her whatever and i have not seen her but once since i have been here

what does she do rachel

i dont think she does anything more than take care of her house and children when they are at home

is not her children with her

no madam mr zevoe wrote from new orleans before he started to have the children moved to the lower plantation which orders were complied with

who is the father of her children

rachel smiled and said indeed i could not say

whether it pleases or displeases mr zevoe we shall call to see her what is the distance from here to the house

three miles

it will be a pleasant walk for us

they started and by halfpast nine oclock stood in front of a neat cabin covered with honeysuckles

they knocked the door was opened by a woman who was fairer than her master prepossessing in her appearance and affable rachel remarked to louise i wish to introduce you to our new mistress mrs zevoe

here stood the handmaid of slavery and the queen of refinement louisa acknowledged her superiority with a polite bow mrs zevoe saw at a glance a striking resemblence between louisa and her fathers portrait which hung in the parlors of her adopted parents they entered into conversation during which mrs zevoe asked louisa where she was from she answered i was born in the city of new orleans

when did you leave there

i suppose it is now about eighteen years

under what circumstances did you leave

my mother and i were sold to a planter in texas by the name of cravan he promised not to separate us after living with him one year he sold me to a man by the name of hood whom i must say had neither principle nor honor i declared i would not live with him he sold me to mrs zevoe the father of your husband

how long have you been here

nearly ten years

are you married

i am not although the mother of three children

pray tell me who is the father of your children louisa hesitated a few moments and said it is not for me to say you will know perhaps if you remain on the plantation

mrs zevoe could scarcely suppress her love and affection for louisa she believed her to be her longlost sister she asked i suppose you have some knowledge of your mother

i have i often see her tall form and her cheerful countenance in my mind

was she handsome

she was not but she had one of the sweetest dispositions that a woman was ever blessed with

what was her complexion

she was a browncopper color with long wavy hair and good features

had she any other children besides yourself

she had a baby called jane of which i have a faint recollection

louisa and rachel both noticed that mrs zevoe labored under great mental embarrassment which she was endeavoring to overcome louisa and rachel were intelligent and might be regarded as judges of human nature they knew not what wrought upon her feelings unless she believed that mr zevoe was the father of louisas children

louisa said mrs zevoe i pity your condition

here again her feelings showed signs of distress

i may be of service to you if i can possibly better your condition i shall use my best endeavors to do so

she bade her goodbye and promised to see her at an early day she was convinced louisa was her sister and that rachel had watched over her when a little infant but she revealed the secret to neither of them she remarked to rachel on their return i want you to tell me confidentially what you think of mr zevoe i have in a degree lost confidence in the man i believe he gambles my reasons for thinking so isâhe sat up two nights on our voyage and came in to the stateroom several times to get sums of money besides i have detected him in several stories

if i can speak with you confidentially i will post you a little replied rachel

you can place implicit confidence in me i will never divulge a word of it

i am sorry for you i know him well he is not the man to make you happy i am expecting every day to see every thing on this plantation attacked for debt myself included

can it be possible

yes it is mortgaged for every dollar it is worth

oh heavens what silly creatures women are to be duped by such men but say nothing i will endeavor by stratagem to secure your freedom do you believe he left his orders in new york for furniture to be shipped

rachel shook her head and said you dont know the man

i have made up my mind firmly to make my stay here but short has he anything

he has a small plantation south of hero which i believe is not mortgaged the overseer claims it in order to keep off his creditors it is said to be worth thirty or forty thousand dollars

if such is the fact i shall try to revenge myself upon him

when they returned home mr zevoe was there he had been absent nearly the entire day mrs zevoe approached him affectionately and kissed him he said dear jane i could not live without your presence

i am happy to know that you love me and love me dearly replied mrs zevoe

have you been taking a walk

i called to see your white slave

i am surprised at your thinking that she is white

he continued the conversation by asking her what she thought of louisa

mrs zevoe carelessly remarked i think she would make me a good waitingmaid with her and rachel i think i could run this establishment and make myself contented i have one request to make of you

what is it my dear

i want you to make me out a bill of sale in my own name for louisa and rachel making them my own individual property mr zevoe laughed and said that is just what i intended doing

louisa has three children has she not

he seemed for a moment silent after recovering himself he replied she has

who is the father of her children

that is a matter i have not troubled myself to ascertain we are glad to have our property increase it pays good interest on the money invested

mrs zevoe smiled and said you will not think i am at all inquisitive it is a matter that interests me but little

tomorrow iwill get lawyer wilson to draw up the papers he will be in the neighborhood and he promised to make me a call before returning

accordingly the lawyer arrived the following morning mr zevoe was not in at the time the madam and him entered into conversation she informed him what she desired him to do lawyer wilson asked her if she had the consent of her husband and if he would sign the papers mrs zevoe said he would he then said it will be a capital thing for you i have been his attorney for years

how does his business matters stand

they are not in a healthy condition i shall advise him also to make over the lower plantation to you

i hope you will i think you have influence enough with him to affect it

during the conversation mr zevoe made his appearance and expressed himself highly gratified to see lawyer wilson after conversing a few moments he told the counsellor what he desired him to do in reference to rachel and louisa

it is a wise act upon your part

the lawyer asked him to step outside he wished to have a private conversation with him they walked out and had quite a consultation his attorney said your affairs are in a critical condition tho mortgage on your property will be due in a few dalys i am satisfied you are not in a condition to meet it if so you had better give your wife a deed also of the lower plantation

you are aware that my overseer mr lamar has a deed of that property

i am satisfied he will cancel it if agreeable to you

perfectly

where is he

he left here a short time since for havana on business he will not return for several days

i will see him in the city and have a talk with him about it

they then returned to the house and took the names of louisa and rachel and their ages

the documents will be prepared day after to morrow you must sign them and i will have them recorded said lawyer wilson

i shall be in town in a day or two and will call at your office

after dining the lawyer bade them good day the following day he met mr lamar in the streets of havana and spoke to him on the subject he said he was perfectly willing to resign his claims to the plantation notwithstanding mr zevoe owed him some twelve hundred dollars yet he had confidence that mr zevoe would pay every dollar lawyer wilson took him to the recorders office to cancel his claim with the understanding that mr zevoe would give him his note with an endorser for the amount the lawyer gave him his word that it would be done and made out the papers turning the estate together with louisa and her children and rachel over to mrs zevoe

the second day following mr zevoe arrived in the city the documents were signed and recorded

mr zevoe told lawyer wilson that his wife wished him to call out and see her in the course of a few days he said he would go and bring the documents with him owing to a pressure of business he was detained he wrote her a letter congratulating her on her successâtelling her he would call and see her as soon as an opportunity would afford she wrote a reply asking him to make out free papers for rachel and louisa and her chi idren and to bring them when he came but not to divulge it to any living soul

mr zevoe was absent some days before returning during this time mrs zevoe again called upon louisa and said louisa the lost is found

what have you lost and found

i lost a beloved sister years ago

she threw her arms around her neck embraced and kissed her and said you are my beloved sister

oh heavens exclaimed louisa can it be that this is my dear sister jane

mrs zevoe was overcome and could not utter a sentence when she recovered she said this is jane oh  how i have longed to see you but much to my surprise and shame i find you the victim of slavery and the concubine of your own master who regards you and your children as chattels what a cursed institution slavery is how damning is its effects it fetters the intellect and robs virtue of its purest jewel it brings shame and disgrace to the door of many a woman who would be an ornament to society were it not for the cursed sin though a womans skin be black her soul can be as pure as the purest saxon i have been reared in the lap of luxury i am the favored child of fortune

can you not redeem me from this life of shame and degradation asked louisa

i will free you and your children at all hazards they again embraced each other and wept jane said you shall be as free as the air that blows i desire you to keep this a secret to the grave do not reveal that i am the daughter of a negro woman or the sister of a slave it would blast my hopes forever in this life it would leave a stain upon me that never could be wiped out you know the prejudices that are entertained against persons in whose veins course the slightest mixture of african blood i have moved jin the first circles of society and have been the guest of the wealthiest families of my state i was educated to believe i was of the purest saxon blood how humiliating it would be to me to be rejected and scorned because of my origin i myself entertain no prejudices against caste and acknowledge god to be the common father of the human family but louisa be cheerful i will be your benefactor

she bade louisa goodbye and requested her to call and bring the children to the house on the following thursday she then left for home when she arrived rachel told her that lawyer wilson had called and left a package for her and that he regretted her absence

i should have liked so much to have seen him said mrs zevoe

she took a seat and opened the package it contained the documents making rachel louisa and her children and the lower plantation her individual property she felt much delighted but did not mention it to rachel mr zevoe returned from havana the following morning he did not find mrs zevoe as cheerful as he expected he told her what be had done in making her the sole owner of certain property she thanked him and asked if the plantation on which they lived was free from debt he said it was

 i heard in havana that your home plantation was mortgaged for every dollar it was worth said mrs zevoe

nonsense you know there are persons in this world who attend to everybodys business but their own such characters my dear envy you your wealth

little did he think that she knew the depth of his purse and the amount of his liabilities he supposed he had a young woman that would give herself more concern about social pleasures than business matters but such was not the case mr

zevoe after they had quite a chat asked her if she would not loan him fifteen hundred dollars as he had a speculation in view which would pay him well for the amount invested

you are aware that you have already used some twentyfive hundred dollars of my money

i am i will have a check from new york in a few days for ten thousand dollars then i will return you the amount

as you are expecting it in a few days you had better not make any investment until you receive it

mrs zevoe winked at rachel and smiled mr zevoe left the house mrs zevoe laughed and remarked to rachel i judge he takes me to be an unsophisticated wife

i think so too

rachel you will see a change here on thursday next

do you intend leaving us so soon

you will know when the time comes

rachel was totally ignorant of what mrs zevoe had in contemplation or of the relationship existing between louisa and mrs zevoe

i trust you will never leave me here said rachel

keep a good heart be hopeful god works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform that is true i have been a believer in his goodness and his mercy for a number of years

still trust in him said mrs zevoe

mr zevoe returned to the house but did not v seem to be in very good humor

nothing special transpired until thursday morning when louisa arrived with her children mr zevoe was the first person louisa met when she approached the house he remarked how do you do louisa i suppose you have called to make your mistress a visit

she smiled he then spoke to her in a tone not audible rachel was busying herself about the kitchen yet she had an eye on her master and louisa mr z requested her to go in the kitchen and take a seat and he would notify her mistress of her arrival he walked into the parlor and told mrs zevoe that her maid had come

 who she asked

louisa and her brats

ask her to walk in the parlor

on her entering the parlor neither jane nor louisa betrayed any signs of friendship mrs

zevoe remarked to louisa are those your children

yes replied louisa

they are fine and healthy looking

mr zevoe sat without taking any part in the conversation it was the first time that mrs zevoe had seen louisas children after learning the names of the children she took little eddy by the hand and said in an excited tone mr zevoe i have the painful duty of introducing you to your own childrens they are bone of your bone flesh of your flesh

he started from his seat saying madam i deny the charge

mrs zevoe pointing to little eddy said  that child alone is sufficient evidence to convict you of the charge in any court he is indeed a photograph of the man who disowns his own children that a king would be proud of

your brain madam must be diseased

louisa upon this issue is hinged your freedom and future happiness i ask you a question today that i never asked you before are not these children charles zevoes louisa hung her head and blushed

i wish you to tell me the whole truth said mrs zevoe

louisa in a tremulous voice said  they are

mr zevoe rushed towards louisa like a madman jane stepped between them as fearless as a roman soldier and defied him to lay his hands upon her at the peril of his life and exclaimed  i have sworn this day in the presence of high heaven never to live with you again i have decreed my own divorce she sir was as pure as the fleeting snow until you robbed her of chastity and liberty if you possessed a spark of manhood you would love her and honor her children you regard her as your inferior because a a tinge of african blood courses through her veins she is too noble a creature to be your slave or your wife

under that roof slavery and freedom met hope and despair joy and sorrow each struggled to defend freedoms claims jane armed with the weapons of justice and truth struck slavery a terrible blow her soul was inflamed her feelings aroused and her pride wounded to find her sister the subject of slavery

jane continued it is to her sir you owe your love and affection she has borne you three lovely children

louisa was much affected rachel stood by with tears in her eyes mr zevoe remained silent his very soul wrung with bitterness she took louisa by the hand and led her affectionately to where he was seated

charles zevoe i ask you todayâwill you not accept of louisa to be your wedded wife my name is no longer jane zevoe but jane gray

he spoke not a sentence mrs zevoe said louisa by power in me invested i install you mistress of this castle here are papers securing to you and your children freedom i will also make you a deed to the lower plantation i will secure lawyer wilson to see that you are protected in your liberty and property god forbid i should reap the benefits of that which justly belongs to you and your children be careful and do not allow yourself to be swindled out of the property i shall deed to you i stand here today as a minister of justice and the advocate of human rights i ask you charles zevoe in the presence of high heaven will you not take louisa to he your wife treat her as a companion not as a slave your silence i suppose gives consent

she then placed her hand in his lifting her eyes heavenward offered a fervent and devout prayer and pronounced them man and wife she kissed each of them and blessed the children she then said to louisa i wish to speak withyou privately

they entered the adjoining room she said tomorrow morning i shall bid you farewell  neither could subdue their feelings

dear sister said louisa do you intend to leave me what will become of me

i am ever your sister in the bonds of affection you must write me oftenâunder an assumed name i expect a carriage to arrive here every moment if it arrives we shall be off tomorrow morning bright and early

do you intend to take rachel with you

yes poor thing i could not think of leaving her behind she will be the only recompense i will have for the twentyfive hundred dollars that mr zevoe used of my money i have her free papers in my possession and will give them to her when we arrive in new orleans

on her return to the room she said charles zevoe i freely forgive you for the injuries i received at your hands i will hot expose you my parting request is to treat louisa as becomes a husband educate your children and respect her i will wear the weeds of mourning for you when i return to that home where the sunshine of gladness joy and peace over shed its effulgent rays no night of gloom or sadness entered its chambers if you are asked for i will tell my friends i have buried you in the sea of forgetfulness however unpleasant it may be circumstances compel me to pursue this course however sacred the bonds of matrimony may be regarded i look upon it as being a civil contract between the parties and when either wilfully and knowingly violate its duties i hold it to be the duty of the injured party to seek redress there is no law temporal or divine that can compel a woman or a man to live with those who are repugnant to them it behooves every individual to seek happiness regardless of the smiles and frowns of the world personal pride induce many to eke out a miserable existence who have married persons not adapted to them in feeling or diposition i this day decree my own divorce whether censured or sustained by public sentimentâi caro not honesty virtue truth and diligence cling together and hang around the neck of memory

can it be that you had discarded my affections deceived and betrayed my confidence asked mr zevoe

i look not to the fleeting shadows of time but to eternity where the secrets of all hearts shall  be revealed if i have done good i shall be the recipient of the mercies of a just god if wrong even in this case i shall receive his condemnation conscience sir like a thorn is ever pricking the soul of the wicked warning them to repent it is the faithful sentinel of god i wish you not to entertain the slightest hopes of me i am dead to youâ dead forever i intend again to launch this frail bark upon the ocean of chance never i hope to be captured by a pirate in disguise 

do you consider me to be a pirate asked he i do one of the deepest dye

what have i robbed you of

of my good name and my happiness

mr zevoe stood like a prisoner condemned without hope

shall crime guilt and in outlive justice truth and righteousness no never my soul was sick within me when i entered this castle it bore the signs of misery distress and unhappiness i have sir one request to ask of you will you treat louisa as your bosom companion

about seven oclock p m the coach arrived they intended starting early the following morning miss jane and rachel prepared themselves for the trip rachel was greatly overjoyed when miss jane informed her that she intended taking her to new orleans she charged rachel on her arrival home never tp speak of the circumstances if she did to say charles zevoe was dead rachel promised to do as requested mr zevoe and rachel are still ignorant of the i relationship of jane to louisa

nothing occurred during the evening after supper the new bride and her children occupied the room of the late mrs zevoe miss gray and rachel slept together strange to say she arose with a complexion as fair as ever after sleeping with a negro woman they bade louisa an affectionate farewell and kissed the children mr zevoe was so much enraged that he left the house before breakfast and did not return

the parting scene was truly affecting jane promised louisa faithfully she would write on her arrival at new orleans they stepped into the carriage and bade mr zevoe and his plantation a final adieu

i once lived in the district of columbia near the national capital i bad a friend who resided in bladensburg about six miles from the city of washington named william savoy he was a white nigger i had occasion to go to baltimore i concluded to make my friend a visit as bladensburg lay directly on the turnpike about this time the stage coaches were transmogrified into railroad cars and horses manufactured into steam engines that you know added greatly to their speed in accordance with my plans i visited my friend william he was delighted to see me and made me agreeably welcome notwithstanding he was much whiter than myself he cooked for himself opposite to him lived a white family from whom he bought milk the morning after i arrived the rain poured down in torrents he asked me to go over and get some milk while he prepared breakfast which i did i knocked at the milkladys door hastily having a desire to get shelter from the rain she opened the door i presented my milk pitcher she received it with one hand and closed the door in my face of course i said nothing i had learned even in that dark age of the world that many whites disliked the niggerâsome for one thing some for another in most cases because of his color

next morning my friend william went over for milk he knocked and was invited in he stayed so long i finally went to look for him i knocked at the door the landlady opened it and there sat william at the breakfast table with the white folks the lady ordered me around to the kitchen door which i readily obeyed after reflecting i said well well the whiter the nigger the bettor he is and the nearer he is a mani began to think how fortunate he was to have white blood in his veins although he was not entirely free from suspicion the negro as usual stuck out in his hair it would not require a microscope to detect it one would have to understand negro physiology well to notice it the landlady asked my friend where i was from he told her from washington she asked him if i was a free negro to carry the joke out he told her that i belonged to his father

the next day the landlady called me over and cordially invited me in which i thought very strange from the previous reception i had received this i found out was on account of my belonging to williams father she asked me many questions among others if his father was wealthy i answered in the affirmative she then asked me what he was why said i he is a man no she said i dont mean that is he an americanl said madam he is part moligascar part english part french and part irishwhy dear me said she how can that bewell said i madam it takes a good many ingredients to make a man thats so said she it has been whispered around here that he had negro blood in him no madam said i i am glad to hear it said she i can stand anything but that he is a nice gentleman is he not of course i said yes without reflecting that he was a nigger

i concluded to be half white was an advantage and i desired to get amalgamated if possible i asked my friend where that family was from he said new york we had a hearty laugh over it

the next morning i parted with him and did not betray his secret which added greatly to his success i started on my journey about noon the same day i rode up to a hotel for dinner kept by one henry weston he was seated on the porch i asked him if i could get dinner and have my horse fed certainly he replied and he called the hostler to take care of my horse i saw at a glance that he was a gentleman

the servantwoman was not long in preparing dinner as there were several others waiting in a few minutes the dinnerbell rang i did not rush in with the others he came out and told me to walk in the diningroom and get dinner i entered and found a table spread with the very best to sustain the innerman after dinner he passed cigars around myself not excluded

i was wonderfully struck at receiving such treatment i then asked him for my bill not a cent said he well well said i to myself how is this i thanked him kindly he ordered my horse to be brought up and in a little while the hostler had him at the door i put a dollar in his hand he thanked me a dozen times i then had the curiosity to know where this gentleman was raised he told me in maryland i bade him good day and started off

the next house i made was about dark i saw a man unhitching a horse from a buggy i spoke to him as politely as i knew how and he did not even as much as look at me i asked him if i could get supper and shelter for my horse for the night he said very grumly take him to the barnâ give him a gallon of oats and go around to the kitchen and ask my wife for supper his order i obeyed of course i attributed the indifference with which he treated me owing to my not being half white i then determined if possible to get amalgamated thinking it would be of great advantage to me i entered the kitchen spoke to the lady and told her that i wished supper she scarcely grunted when i spoke to her and while preparing the supper she seemed to eye me with jealousy i felt very uncomfortably situated the supper was soon prepared and placed upon a table which looked as though it had neither water or soap applied to it for a year

by the time i got through supper her husband came in he asked me where i was from and where i was going during all this time the landlady had not spoken a half dozen words to me i told him that i was from washington and on my way to baltimore i then asked him a few questions which he answered very readily his wife asked me if there were many negroes in washington i told her there were a good many she remarked where she came from there were very few and they were the biggest thieves that ever lived i asked her where she was from she said the state of indiana

i concluded that the treatment i had received was not owing to my being black but it was on account of those thieving negroes in indiana i then said madam there are exceptions all negroes are not alike she replied i never saw one that was worth his salt or had the energy and enterprise to conduct any business except one and he soon played himself outi asked her how that was she said he was a middling fair scholar lived in good style and dressed well consequently the whites decided not to patronize himi said madam it is difficult for colored men to succeed in business especially in communities where they have nigger on the brain unless he is humble in the extreme and has a grin for everybody with many he must forget that he is a man to succeedshe said i dont think it if negroes behave themselves they will be sustained i said madam that rule dont always work did this man of whom you just speak misbehave was he disposed to be discourteous to his friends and patrons she said no he did not but some thought he was inclined to feel rather pompous for this reason they declined to patronize him where i came from you know if one gets down on a nigger they all go against him i told her it was very different where i came from if a colored man was honest and upright he invariably found friends who were willing to aid and assist him in business after all i concluded that she did not understand as much about the ingredients the negro is composed of as the milkwoman at bladensburg

feeling rather uncomfortable i expressed a wish to retire i was shown to a loft over the kitchen and had to ascend it by a ladder it looked more like a chickenroost than anything else i could compare it to the bed contained about as much straw as would make a hens nest without sheets or pillows of course i slept a little during the night and studied how i should get even for the treatment i had received i decided to get up early in the morning which i did taking with me from the bed one of the best blankets put it under my saddle and gave my horse all the oats he could eat i then ate all that i could possibly contain

this was the only redress i could get i paid my bill and by three oclock that afternoon arrived in baltimore city and was again free from those perplexities so common to colored men and i trust that if they are yet living they have a better opinion of negro honesty should they again come in contact with negroes i hope they will treat them better

we are perhaps justified in speaking of the great achievement of the ageâthe pacific railroadâits undertaking and completionâthe adverse and trying circumstances its success is due to exgovernor stanford ââ hopkins charles crocker combined with the united efforts of many people of the pacific coast and the congress of the united states many regarded the project to be an impossibility those noble fathers of the enterprise despaired not though often pressed to extremes for means perplexed with difficulties on every side they went forward making the hilly ways level and the rough smooth they split the rugged mountains lifted the watery valleys and opened a highway that had been closed since creations morn until victory crowned their success the iron horse can be seen darting to and fro with lightning speed defying the mountain giantsto check its onward coarse a wonderful enterprise glorious results will emanate from the bands that hold california and the atlantic states in their iron grasp the emigration induced by quick transportation to this coast will be of great advantage to california she must seek to hold her own against eastern trade and cope in every pursuit of industry her agricultural lands her new and rising manufactories her hardy and enterprising citizens unite to make her still the queen of the states in this union

barbers are a fine set of fellows they never condescend to speak disparagingly of each other they are all finished workmen and have received the tonsorial diploma some of them are a little selfish and claim to do better work than any one else and of course they know it all because they have had a better opportunity of receiving a finished education than some others consistently they are better than others and are ready to condemn their efforts but do but little themselves

we shall not attempt to give a graphic description of the place it is a neat little burg situated in a beautiful and fertile valley and is the capital of idaho territory it contains many permanent buildings including neat and handsome cottages it being a central point it has many advantages over its sister towns it contains a population ranging from nine to twelve hundred inhabitants many of its citizens are afflicted with the terrible disease of negrophobia the very air seems to be pregnated with this disease a respectable colored man can scarcely get accommodations at any of the hotels or restaurants i was compelled on my way from idaho city to silver city to lay over from five pm until two am the following morning a few moments before the stage started for silver city i was invited by a swarthy but generouslooking spaniard to take a cigar we started down the street the most of the saloons at this unseasonable hour being closed my companion saw a light in a saloon kept by mr j old we entered and called for what wo wanted the polite and accommodating mr old bent over the counter and said in a low tone of voice better i cannot accommodate you i regarded it as a polite insult and walked out he was the last man i expected that would treat me thus had i approached him with my bat in my hand trembling like a quarry slave i have no doubt this proud saxon would have accommodated me i have seen many like mr old come to naught and who would gladly accept a favor though extended by a negro i have lived in mountain towns where the lowest and basest females white and colored could be served with meals if a respectable colored man desired a meal the landlord would politely invite him to be seated in the kitchen i ever have and ever will take issue against any such treatment in my travels wherever i have met gentlemen they have always treated me as a man and not as a tiling the rough usages and insults that colored men receive invariably come from that class of whites who have little to recommend them outside of a white skin were i to say that there are no good feeling men in boise city i would be doing an injustice to many i appreciate my friends i never can condescend to lick the hand that smites me nor respect the man that insults me

the white man still clings to his prejudices against the colored race it is difficult for a negro to hire a pew in a church where the while christian worships however respectable he may be they never crowd you in cars if they notice your skin is dark none are considered ladies or gentlemen through whose veins flow african blood such are the prejudices and education of many americans i remember when traveling between this city and sacramento colored people however genteel were compelled to share the deck with the horned cattle a colored man travelling by stage was compelled to wait until every passenger was aboard if there was no room inside he was ordered to the top or in the boot as live baggage how often the negro has been hunted down in the broad sunlight of day assassinated and murdered and the assassin permitted to go unpunished because his victim was as powerless as he was innocent having ing no rights a white was compelled to respect even in the free state of california strong was the prevailing element we have lived to see a higher state of civilization and rejoice in its progress we love the land that gave us birth and all we ask of the white man is to give us an even chance in the great race of life if you need a man to perform labor and the negro is competent and trustworthy give him work dont deny him his bread because he has a dark skin give him the same wages you give the white man we are natives of the soil we were with you when the cornerstone of this republic was laid we claim your consideration and aid close not against us the door of industry help us to rise from the pit of degradation help us to go forward in the pathway that leads to grandeur and greatness our race have given their lifeblood in every struggle this country has had and have fallen side by side with the saxon white men conquer your prejudices

in the county of anne arundel resided an old negro who had laid down the shovel and the hoe he belonged to samuel hell a large planter his name was joe he said his legs refused to discharge their duty consequently he could not walk he was left in charge of the negro quarters his comrades became suspicious of his sincerity with reference to his lameness they concluded to see if there was any virtue in his logs

the negroes on the adjoining plantation gave a party as was customary among plantation negroes every saturday evening joe was among the invited guests he said you know id like to go dar childens but i cant walk two of his associates agreed to pack him by turns he readily accepted their generous proposition they went out and held a consultation after a while they finally agreed upon a plan that an individual should be placed at the graveyard oh their return to act the ghost they went to the entertainment and packed uncle joe when the exercises of the evening closed they shouldered uncle joe and started for home joe seemed highly delighted with the evenings pleasure pete just before coming to the graveyard offered to relieve jack of his burden he was an athletic negro joe readily agreed to be transferred to petes care as they came up to the corner of the graveyard the wouldbe ghost raised up pete as though frightened out of his wits threw uncle joe on the ground hard enough to kill an ordinary negro and ran at the top of his speed leaving poor joe at the mercy of the ghost but joe soon sprang to his feet and made the best time on record he passed his companions when they arrived home he was comfortably seated at the fire they asked him how it was that he made such good time ah childens couldnt lay down dar wid dat gost looking me in de eyes
