all are but parts of one stupendous whole whose body nature is and god the soul that changed through all and yet in all the same great in the earth as in the ethereal frame warms in the sun refreshes in the breeze glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees lives through all life extends through all extent

pope

the verses just quoted were recited in a spirited and earnest tone by the younger of two men who were enjoying a cool and refreshing evening walk in the environment of the amershams plantation this burst of eloquent poetry was drawn forth by a magnificent scene worthy the brush of raphael or michaelangelo which presented itself to the view of the two men as they stood on an eminence overlooking the town of p no sound fell upon the ear even the merry little crickets had ceased for a while their monotonous music the workmen had laid down their tools and the clang of machinery was hushed

extending as far as the eye could reach were delightful canefields robed in their vernal beauty presenting in the distance a most picturesque appearance there were to be seen innumerable tropical trees whose rich foliage blending harmoniously formed a complete sea of verdure enhancing the already charming scene the landscape below was dotted here and there with houses of all sizes and descriptions standing in the midst of smiling vegetation several schooners and sloops were riding at anchor in the harbor below while out on the sea fishermens cables glided gaily along in the west the rosecolored tints that the sun had left behind kept the eyes spellbound and the mind wondering whether the finger of some fairy queen had not produced the rich beauty of the illuminated sky the sapphire ocean wore an aspect that baffles description as the multicolored hues of the radiant skies gilded its surface

forming a stately background to this enchanting view was a rugged chain of mountains whose azure hue fascinated the eye while a number of tall slender palm trees on their lower heights contributed to the general beauty of the scene

yes excellent by jove exclaimed the elder man taking the sweetsmelling virginian cigar from his mouth it must have been such a scene as this which inspired dr faber to write and oh what then must thou be like eternal loveliness 

soon the two men turned to retrace their steps homewards

oscar lindsay for that was the name of the elder gentleman was about forty years of ageâa tall and stately man he possessed a wellformed head upon which grew a luxuriant mass of hair slightly silvered here and there his prominent brow was traversed with lines of thought and under his shady eyebrows shone out two brilliant orbs that captivated all upon whom they alighted and seemed to pierce the very soul the nose was slightly hooked and set off the thoughtful and cleanshaven face to good advantage the corners of the lips betrayed a somewhat cynical tendency he had a walkingcane in his hand with which he playfully knocked off the blossoms of several wild plants that bordered the road

lindsay was an eminent lawyer highly esteemed in the community in which he lived his companion was a young man of not more than twentythree like lindsay he possessed a splendid head whose classic shape argued intellectual worth his forehad was as high as it was broad and his merry eyes indicating a joyous disposition sparkled with the brilliancy of youth a wellformed roman nose blended harmoniously with delicately formed lips slightly curved over which fell a handsome mustache his prominent masculine chin was closely shaven and strongly marked by a dimple his complexion was rather dark but argued vigorous health in short hugh highfield was a very handsome man he was the only son of the late cecil highfield of the island of trinidad he had studied at codrington college barbados and had gone to spend a few months with his friend lindsay who had also been a sincere friend of his father

would you mind going through the amershams estate enquired lindsay of his companion when they were about a halfmile distant from home it may be somewhat further but you will be amply repaid for the delay by the pleasure you will experience in having a look at the works of the plantation there remain still the relics of the barbarous cattlemill which has had to bow and retire before the advent of the superior machinery that has been the result of a later invention in addition to other curiosities which i am sure will interest you

certainly replied the other these curiosities are always of interest and you can afford me no greater pleasure my dear lindsay than to point out some of those links which constitute part of the chain of progressive development i do not think you ought to term the cattlemill barbarous it met the exigencies of the times and was as useful in the good old days as your colossal machinery is today do you despise the stoneaxe because it has been succeeded by wrought steel ah ungrateful beings that we are

never mind my dear boy returned lindsay with a smile at the same time patting hugh on the shoulder i never meant to reflect on the memory of our simian ancestors i forgot that the intellect must operate in conformity with its stage of development andâ

away with your balderdash man now i see your ironical drift you mean once more to fire your unrelenting shafts at the theory of evolution but you may depend upon it that your arrows will meet the fate of acestes when he would strike the stars

ha ha ha laughed the lawyer and the cigar which was almost spent fell from his lips to the ground

what are we coming to when parsons are believing in the gospel of darwin and wallace

after having spent a short time in visiting the works of the amcrshams plantation they continued their journey homeward where soon afterward they were discussing the merits of tea and toast

there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy

elmsdale cottage was one of those stately buildings on which the eye delights to gaze and furnished a most welcome scene for esthetic minds it was situated on a very healthy and airy spot in the suburbs of the town at the eastern side of the building there was a balcony which gave an excellent view of the environment from that point one could see in the distance rich emerald fields of lime trees gently waving to and fro as the sweet zephyrs played among their foliage

far away the lofty chimney of the cordelia estate poured out volumes of thick black smoke and the gigantic arms of the old windmill afforded some pleasure to the eyes as the fans were whirled around by the strong winds that usually prevailed about that hilly quarter

around elmsdale cottage there were tastily planted numbers of cactus and oleander trees with lime trees interspersed these all formed a fence which was not altogether devoid of a certain picturesqueness the lawn was extensive and beautifully laid out with sod while in the centre of the grounds was a large basin in which a colony of goldfish darted to and fro in the pellucid water water liliesâbeautiful in their rich luxurianceâcovered the entire surface of the pond

there was an elaborate fountain rising about six to eight feet above the basin and out of the gaping mouth of a hideous lions head issued continually streams of water which fell upon flower beds that rivalled those of the most elegant english homes

not far distant from the fountain and near the border of the grounds was a pond that contained some young turtles very near to this spot stood a large tamarind tree that had braved the storms of perhaps a couple of centuries it afforded an excellent shade and was a special resort of the inmates of elmsdale during the distressingly hot days a little menagerie was kept under the balcony where were birds of every hue in cagesâfrom the interesting little humming bird to the troublesome macawâand where the wooddoves plaintive cooing mingled with the weird unearthly sound of the horned owl there was jack the monkey with his amusing antics and begging gestures as his visitors tantalized him with a morsel of bread and polly seated upon the housetop was none the less anxious to make herself observed as she reiterated in intelligible tones her last lesson there were rabbits running up and down in their neat and wellkept cages and even the amusing little squirrel was not absent from tills extensive collection suffice it to say it would be difficult to mention all the pets of this miniature zoo of elmsdale which amused in no small degree its visitors

water lemons and convolvulus vine thickly entwined upon specially constructed arbours ran up the pillars that sustained the buildings and reached out to the sides of the balcony the odor from the lovely jasmine that surrounded the cottage filled the outer asmosphere and perfumed the interior of the house the happy owner of this mansion was a mulatto but he showed few of the facial characteristics of his ethiopian parentage

he had a lofty forehead wellformed nose and splendidly chiselled chin he was the natural son of percy woodhouse a rich proprietor

the old sire was one of those extreme radicals who were wont to be masters of their own opinions he sprang from a respectable devon family and had received his early training at a london boardingschool whence he went to oxford to study theology after he had worn the sacerdotal robes for some time he was troubled with doubts raised by the profound problems of natural and revealed religion and at length found himself no longer able to remain identified with the church his parents endeavoured to convince their son of his grave error arguments were useless the prodigal would not return and when those whom he loved best united to persecute him for his apostasy he took to flight turned his steps westward and found a home in the island of montserrat

here woodhouse worked hard until he became one of the potent sugar princes of the west indies and accumulated considerable wealth he was attracted by the eldest daughter of one of his slaves and secured for her a better education than usually fell to the lot of such girls in those days of terror this attachment proved unfortunate percy woodhouse the exclergyman was not proof against one of the worst of social crimes that prevailed then and the sable mollie saunders fell a victim to the passions of her benefactor

burleigh woodhouse the present proprietor of elmsdale was the offspring of this illicit union after several years of concubinage the elder woodhouse repaired the wrong by marrying mollie burleigh received a thorough education on the continent when his father died he inherited five or six of the most flourishing plantations in the island together with over seventy thousand pounds sterling

it was a fine evening when burleighâwho was sitting in a lounging chair on the balcony of his princely dwelling enjoying the rich odour of jasmine and geranium which rose upon the windâheard a tap at the door the servant ushered in two gentlemen with whom the reader is already acquainted

hello sultan ejaculated lindsay in excellent spirits after his usual manner enjoying yourself amidst the flowers i suppose

yes old fellow was the reply nothing better

a splendid panacea for much of the ill that flesh is heir to

very true chimed in young highfield i am myself passionately fond of flowers they have taught me many beautiful lessons and their sweet fragrance has often in combination with music lulled my spirit to sleep when overwhelmed with deep sorrow

at this moment mrs woodhouse appeared on the scene after the usual civilities had teen passed she took a seat on a sofa near her husband and joined in the general conversation she was a swarthy woman of dignified appearance her features were delicate and refined her eyes black and velvety and as she laughed and displayed a set of pearly white teeth one would have remarked that it was such countenances the ancient greeks and romans loved to give to their godesses her language was perfect and her accent not local having evidently teen acquired on the conti nent

well gentlemen she said i sincerely hope nothing will intervene to prevent your honouring us with your presence at the ball

we certainly trust not answered lindsay since i should like to give my young guest an idea of what a ball at elmsdale is like

i should indeed enjoy being present said hugh since lindsay informs me that it is expected to eclipse all previous records

yes put in mrs woodhouse my husband you know adheres to his old motto dum vivimus vivamms and very rightly believes that the shining shekel does no good when hoarded up in dusky coffers we hope to give you something to think of with pleasure in connection with your visit to our little island

i am most gratified to find that you are among those who indulge in a legitimate enjoyment of the good things of life i am sure that if god intended us to be anchorites he wrould have fashioned this world after another sort i am myself a great believer in the beneficence of god and his purpose in all his creation to secure the happiness of his creatures when my heart is overburdened by the weight of pressing circumstances i always find wonderful relief in the sweet melody of the birds around or in the rich music of the wanton winds in the fragrance of the lily that perfumes the vale or in the gay murmuring of some little brook

an amusing and interesting teteatete continued for some time when lindsay suggested that the company should take a walk through the grounds all chimed in with the suggestion and a full halfhour was pleasantly spent amidst the most charming scenes while fair cynthia looked down with her most bewitching smiles

when the party separated the town clock struck the hour of nine

as lindsay and hugh strolled onward the former remarked it is an unseasonable hour to make further calls but i should like to introduce you to one of my warm friends whose generosity i am sure will excuse the lateness of our visit

hugh consented tc the proposal he was young and youthful minds are always ready for adventure

furthermore hugh highfield was at any time ready to part company with his butler or paley for what he called a stroll on any night this seems strange for a student in divinity but the blood courses warmly in youthful veins and the spirit of adventure will not even be subdued by theology or grave philosophy

lindsay and liugh had now reached the bottom of a hill and were wending their way through a narrow pass that opened into the main road of one of young woodhouses plantations hughs eyes fell in an instant on a small rude hut covered with some wild grass

does any human being live there he inquired of his companion

certainly and we are going there replied lindsay with a smile

what friend of yours can be content to make a home of such a miserable hovel youre only joking

no im not we shall see presently

they discovered on nearer approach that the door of this primitive home was closed it was indeed a miserablelooking place the hut was built of sticks plastered with mud the covering consisted of cane trashâa material that is used mostly by west indian labourers who are not in a position to buy shingles or corrugated iron from innumerable crevices the moonlight streamed in

the intruders peeped in through one of the gaping apertures of the room and saw seated at a shabbylooking table an old negro who perhaps might have been about sixtyfive or seventy years of age there was something impressive about his features which were rendered venerable by the long flowing white beard that fell down upon his bosom upon the table before him was a transparent basin of water over which he bent his hoary head and muttered something in the form of a prayer he paused for some moments then in a clear tone murmured some one disturbs my path

what in the name of heaven can this infernal nonsense mean is this what you have brought me here for oscar

before lindsay had time to reply hugh with the intrepidity and daring of youth was in the act of forcing an entrance

be quiet man cautioned lindsay under his breath

this is the renowned professor zac wait a moment and you shall hear his divinations

hugh desisted from his rash attempt at intruding into the sanctum of the professor and was about to make a remark when in an intelligible and eloquent tone the professor surprised them with the following burst of oratory when black clouds cover the sun at midday then the sorrows of elmsdale shall begin and when the white dove no longer sits upon the wall then the dark lantern will shine to drag the fox from his hole the bones from the earth and give back honour and virtue to elmsdale

shades of cicero you scarce could surpass that most excellent orator whispered highfield ironically

the mans a monomaniac or has gone stark mad

nevertheless he must have some amount of intelligence as is clearly shown by his speech

if he is mad there is clearly method is his madness

whence did he receive his education

oh he received the first principles of elementary education from his benevolent master old woodhouse to whom he was always much attached and has always since possessed an ardent desire for knowledge though he sometimes exhibits an eccentricity akin to madness

he is much respected by his class and is considered an oracle

and despite this craving for knowledge do you mean to say that he still retains the superstitious beliefs in the worship of demonsâand in obiismâ peculiar to his race

ah there you make a mistake my good hugh and you are indeed singular to be candid there is no worship of obi in what you saw the old magus perform from time immemorial men of all races have tried to arrogate to themselves a certain superhuman power of peering into the future and the unknown and their various modes of divination are classified under a variety of names the ancient greeks romans arabs and even the anglosaxons resorted to several of these superstitious methods for advice in love war commerce and domestic affairs it would be futile to try to enumerate these mystic arts but i can name for you a few of the scientific terms used in that connection

there is the science of astrologyâalmost exploded though still tenaciously clung to by the followers of islamânecromancy axinomancy botonomancy of the greeks bellomancy of the arabs crystallomancy hydronomancy and so on i believe the last form is that adopted by the professor for unveiling the future

here it is generally believed that sorcery is peculiarly a negro art and the unfortunate darky has often to hang down his head at the charge of being a representative of a race peculiarly noted for its superstitions

hugh bent his head dreamily and mused awhile after the very interesting information supplied by his friend then suddenly collecting himself he asked but why does the black man still cherish persistently his superstitious nonsense when there is hardly a remnant left among europeans

i am not at all certain of that roger bacon albertus magnus and pope sylvester were certainly europeans and do we not find the seed which they sowed taking deeper root every day amongst us i am sanguine that when educationâi mean true educationâshall have raised fully the human mind and intellect the fallacies of superstition will be abandoned

perhaps soâtime will tell

by this time the professor had risen from his seat and advancing toward the door he repeated the same words with which he had before astonished the unwelcome eavesdroppers in a moment he was face to face with the buckras as he designated his erstwhile masters

and is that you mahs ossie ejaculated the sage

yes professor it is i who have come to pay you a short visit

very well sir glad to see you will you come in and take a seat in the mansion

the professors eyes sparkled with immense delight as he turned to hugh and greeted him with a cordial how d ye do the young student was surprised to hear the old man speak of his miserable hovel as being a mansion and this confirmed his opinion that he was a monomaniac

what have you been prophesying today zac

asked lindsay of the professor

oh serious things mahs ossieâshaking his head at the same time with a melancholy air i see there is something grave going to happen to mahs burleigh and there will be a big stir at elmsdale before long

will you not enlighten me dear zac as to the time when this is to happen so that x may be present to rescue my friend

i cannot assist you so far my light is a little dim but murderâred bloody murderâis at hand

hugh who had all the while remained silent now chimed in well my dear professor since you are such a prophet will you tell me whether i shall be successful in my profession sir i intend to be a parson

a parson sir

yes certainly sir

why you will be most successful i see it in your eyes you will preach few sermons of your own and bury many dead and you know the price of putting a piece of playedout clay under the ground is splendid in these hard times

i am surprised at you you are a strange one indeed i dont want you to tell me about my mercenary gains in the church i want to know if i will win many souls

then sir you had better turn back competition will be too much for you

no i shall not turn back from the plough professor one of my principal aims will be to establish institutions propagating christianity and inculcating the principles of virtue and happiness in every home

ah my good mr parson and how many churches will you build

as many as are necessary

and how many shops for the sale of strong drink

why you are raving professor rum shops are not in my line

certainly sir i heard you say that you wanted to get up institutions for making people happy and i assure you sir that though i read my bible often and hear peggy and nancy sing psalms every night i never remember the church door till i get down half of allans old tom why its then i feel happy and ready to sing for joy and off i go to the nearest house of worship to join in the  be joyful 

these ludicrous remarks from old zac quite seized the young student and he turned away with a curious smile playing on his face he felt now more than ever that the professor did not possess mens sana in corpore sano meanwhile lindsay who was always ready to humour a joke broke forth

by all means professor i see no harm in one grog shop among the churches

give me five mahs ossie said zac his face lit up with joy youre just the man for me i always knew you to sympathize with a poor man you know what he needs to keep body as well as soul

let us leave the old crank oscar urged hugh turning to the lawyer

the old crank suddenly reiterated the professor

you come to intrude upon me and then call me a crank to boot you fancy yourself a king of the world because youre going to build your churches but i am just as much a man as you there look then turning he said come here my poor pompey addressing his dog

immediately a large fiercelooking dog which was lying a few yards off with his snout buried in the earth came bounding to his feet wagging his tail the professor gently patted the dog

my faithful friend said he you are intelligent enough to wear a wig and gown but your bark is too honest to make you famous in them

why you have come in for your share lindsay

said hugh turning toward the man of law who was laughing with all his might

we have been well entertained during our visit my dear zac said lindsay to the professor but we must now leave you

well mahs ossie the best of friends must part as the monkey said when he lost his tail goodbye and he clutched the lawyers hands with enthusiasm then casting a spiteful glance at hugh he thundered vociferously for your rudeness sir i hope you may bury few wornout carcasses and preach your own sermons

o professor zac said hugh trying to suppress a laugh you need not be angry with me i never meant to offend you i am awfully sorry i have aroused your anger and i beg your forgiveness

i am always ready to forgive a man and especially a parson i absolve you and wish you success in your undertaking

then goodbye professor

goodbye parson i hope we will meet again as better friends then turning toward lindsay zac uttered in a clear solemn and deliberate tone remember the prophecy of elmsdale

twine the young glowing wreath but pour not your spirit in the song which through the skies deep azure floats along like summers quickening breath

the ground is hollow in the path of mirth o far too daring seems the joy of earth so darkly pressed and girded in by death

mrs hemans

elmsdale cottage buzzed like a beehive

it was the evening of the ball and everything had been arranged in grand style for the occasion the servants in uniform flitted about like fireflies carriages with their gay occupants appeared in rapid succession the grand hall of elmsdale was lighted with numerous candelabra the rays of which fell on the rich attire of the guests which was displayed with royal grace tasty decorations were to be seen on every side the dainty fingers of mrs woodhouse had woven flowers into garlands with a dexterity which commanded the attention and admiration of all crowds of loiterers and curious sightseers gathered around elmsdale to hear what they were frequently treated toâthe sweet mellifluous and soulstirring music discoursed by a noted string band from a neighboring colony

woodhouse was in the gayest of moods induced no doubt by the copious draughts of champagne that he had been imbibing since the dawn of the memorable day

the elite of society was well represented at the gathering and there were present members of the liberal professions the hon lodric gordon the commissioner was the first to claim the hand of the hostess of elmsdale for a waltz and indeed so gracefully did she dance that there were many applicants afterward for the hand of the charming hostess but the request of most of the dancers was declined mc intyre a relative of woodhouse was among the disappointed ones and he retired sullenly to a corner

highfield was lucky enough to secure mrs woodhouses hand when he courteously sued for it pie was by no means a dancer but his partners brillancy hid his defects

it was midnight and in the refreshment room where the lights were burning low and the tables groaning under the weight of delicious viands sat oscar lindsay and his friend woodhouse engaged in an interesting conversation and discussing the merits of a bottle of dawsons whiskey

by all thats good and great ejaculated lindsay i forgot to give you the joke of our adventures with professor zac some evenings ago and of the original reception he extended to poor hugh

oh you mean zac my best man my faithful and sincere servant interrupted woodhouse with enthusiasm he is somewhat strange and fitful at times but he is a good and clever old chap and means no harm to any one

how can he mean no harm when he literally cursed hugh and would not be appeased until an ample apology had been made

poor eccentric harmless fool said lindsay as he lay back in his chair and laughed outright

but we found him prophesying some fatal things in connection with elmsdale and you are naturally not excluded

ahâpshaw pshaw

and a suggestion was made to have another draught of the exciting beverage

and what did the old madcap say enquired woodhouse laughlingly is jove going to thunder his heaviest bolts upon my unoffending head

mrs woodhouse had entered the room in search of her husband she overheard the last words that fell from his lips for they had been spoken with great emphasis she cast an enquiring or rather a suspicious glance at lindsay then at her husband woodhouse as if to relieve her of her embarrassment spoke

my darling zac has been prophesying something unpleasant of our home which i have just heard

oh what is it burleigh tell meâdo not hesitate i begin already to dread zac has many times foretold things that happened in every detail

and the frail woman stood and trembled from head to foot

alas  this is quite womanlike my sweet your poor sex will ever believe the greatest improbabilities

 god preserve us prayed the excited woman bending on her knees burleigh burleigh i have of late been dreaming some most frightful dreams you may call me superstitious but i have a curious foreboding of ill

hence the melancholic air you sometimes assume

i did not for a moment think you noticed anything strange in my appearance but since i have betrayed myself i must confess to you that my dreams have created in me a very nervous fear

my poor darling said woodhouse casting an eye of tender concern toward his wife i hope your spirits will soon regain their usual buoyancy in fact if your melancholia be not drowned in tonights merriment then i shall seek a more efficacious antidote for you

what do you think oscar

lindsay who had sat pensive overhearing the conversation spoke with a sympathetic ring in his voice

i am sorry but i must justly claim to myself a thousand anathemas for having introduced the serpents fangs amongst the roses and you too are certainly not free from blame woodhouse since you know the superstitious tendencies of your wife

at that moment a little boy entered the room he might have been about six years of age and his features gave one the impression that he would develop into a handsome and intelligent man

come here carl called mrs woodhouse for it was none other than her own child who had come to find out if mothers skirt had been monopolized by any intruder

have you missed mother she asked clasping her child in her arms and smothering with kisses

oh yes i have but i guessed you were somewhere with father

and if i were to die what would you do

i think i would die too was the reply

and suppose father died put in woodhouse would you miss him

do not speak so dear father you are strong and not going to die now god would not take such a dear father from mother and me so soon and before i become a man

the tender expression of the child produced a spontaneous flow of sympathy between woodhouse and his wife they eyed each other warmly and their hearts were overflowing with love for a moment they concentrated their gaze upon the link that seemed to bind them closer and closer and thought that in him they possessed a veritable jewel

lindsay had joined the dancing party and was flitting away gaily with maud fairley the beautiful daughter of the rev mr fairley to whom as mrs grundy delighted to say the lawyer had been paying his attention hugh had immensely enjoyed himself in whirling around several handsome and fashionable young ladies and having now retired to the corner where mc intyre sat opened up a conversation

well mr mc intyre said he what do you think of this display grand isnt it

yes replied mc intyre burleigh has won the palm this time for his nonsensical display there is no doubt that he spends his money lavishly there is no doubt too that a fool and his money soon part and his case will be another illustration of this truism i am really at a loss to imagine why my cousin will go to such extremes by the byeâi congratulate you on your success mr highfield in gaining so nice a partner in the dance

this little remark was made in a somewhat taunting tone but hugh paid little attention to it

your cousin he observed is a socialist of the most advanced type and finds enjoyment for himself by securing enjoyment for others this is a praiseworthy feature of his disposition and speaks volumes for the excellence of his mind

i do not see any excellence there i see stupidity all through and am not afraid to say it if i had my cousins wealth i am sure i would know how to spend it without bringing the world to gaze upon me as some curious feature of a pleasureshow

hugh was struck by these uncharitable remarks coming from the lips of so near a relative of woodhouse

he could read insincerity and deceit in the mans eyes and in the tone of his voice the company of mc intyre now proved extremely distasteful to him and he quitted his side a deep feeling of abhorrence rising in his breast

not long after that mc intyre himself arose he was going out of the room when he was met by woodhouse

hope you have been enjoying yourself cousin george said woodhouse his eyes beaming with pleasure as he patted his cousin on the shoulder

i have my good burleigh been enjoying myself to such an extent that i am afraid i have intruded too much on the limits of nature i feel unwell and must retire for the benefit of my health

so saying mc intyre strolled onward but burleigh held him back and told him he would be happy to place at his disposal the contents of his medicine chest which was kept downstairs no eye fell on the two as they went out neither edith woodhouse nor her child was present to see the lithe form of the beloved husband and father speed down on an errand of loveâthat of administering to the suffering of anotherâand wherever they were at this moment little did they dream that they would never again behold in this life the breathing frame of him in whom all their affection was centered

next morning the following sensational paragraph appeared in the columns of the leading paper of the island a terrible blow had fallen on elmsdale the princely home of our wellknown and respected townsman burleigh woodhouse has been suddenly thrown into mourning there was a brilliant ball at elmsdale cottage last night at which gathered most of the leaders of society and while they were in the height of enjoyment mr

woodhouse seems to have met his death by some means which is yet to be explained there are however evidences which point to the probability of suicide and seem to preclude the idea of foul play the revolver that performed the deadly act of blowing out the brains was found beside the body

mr woodhouse seemed to be at the zenith of his prosperity and his name has been one of the most honored and respected in the community it has been asserted that domestic troubles were at the bottom of the tragedy we shall be able to give our readers further details later on the inquest will be held at  a m today

hugh was walking through the garden that surrounded lindsays residence when he heard the newsboy at the gate calling out in an unusually stentorian voice for some one to take the paper for mr lindsay hugh quickly advanced and took the closed sheet from the boy remarking at the same time youre very early this morning jimmy hows that

oh sir replied the boy all the early birds had to get up earlier from dere nest dis morning de suicide sirâde suicide

suicide hello  who has done such a foolish thing

enquired hugh as he opened the paper with nervous hands

the boy had not time to reply before hughs eyes fell upon the conspicuous american heading which contained the account of the tragedy

good lord deliver us was the exclamation that fell from his lips can this be possible how will oscar receive this terrible bit of news hugh stood for some time as if transfixed to the earth beads of perspiration standing on his face although the morning was as cool as it could possibly beâin the tropics in the middle of june

he could not continue to read the account and with his legs trembling nervously and scarcely able to support him he went upstairs to impart the news to lindsay the latter was lying in bed

sad news oscar said hugh with tremulous lips and although he was fond of fun and always ready to crack a jokeâoften at the expense of truthâit was evident that his demeanour on this occasion savoured of anything else but fun his eyes looked sad and the pallor that fell on his cheeks told that something serious had occurred

in a moment lindsay was in possession of the fact of the tragedy and the emotion and poignant sorrow that immediately unnerved him can be better explained than described

suicide cried he frantically who ever said suicide why i would rather believe that the moon is made of green cheese than to harbour for a moment the thought that burleigh woodhouse committed suicide he was too noble and christian a man to have so precipitatedly ushered himself into the presence of his creator but how is it possible that it is only now i hear of this through the newspaper confound that coxcomb burton since he remained for some time after we left it is natural that he must know all about this calamity he might have passed this way and given us the information

lindsay was subject to occasional fits of temper and he stamped his feet and bit his lips while a piteous expression clouded his face

compose yourself my dear lindsay begged hugh who was himself much pained the thing is already done and there is no use crying over spilt milk i myself am of the opinion that woodhouse has been murdered we must therefore turn our attention toward unravelling the mystery and affording the helpless widow our assistance

ah i told you zacs divining powers were not to be despised he surely predicted this thing and although you laughed at him for his predictions the awful reality that now faces us must invest them with some importance i certainly thought the man a raving fool but now another problem presents itself for a careful solution verily the philosophy of human existence is both mysterious and complex

the conversation continued some moments longer during which the friends commented on the curious statement of the newspaper that is that the evidence which pointed to the conclusion that suicide was committed were sufficiently strong to preclude the idea of foul play

they could not understand what this evidence could be and began to conjecture fanciful things again the paper was stupid to talk about domestic troubles

were not the deceased and his wife the best of friends to the last woodhouse was rich and did not want money so they thought this statement was nothing more than the imagination of some alarming reporter

a servant at the door just then announced that some one wished to see mr lindsay a description was asked of the person and it answered to that of professor zac

the old soothsayer was cordially invited to enter and await lindsay in his study the professor gazed ardently at the cases of dusty volumes which perhaps had never been handled since the day they first adorned the library there were bookcases made of rosewood and mahogany which contained a beautiful collection of works on science theology law and medicine the curious professor could not withstand the temptation of handling the volumes bent as he was upon cramming in his brain all that it could possibly take in within the space of a few minutes he did not remain long in this pleasant diversion for lindsay soon appeared on the scene with hugh at his heels

the old man looked much out of sorts at the interruption but tried to put the best face upon it he greeted the gentlemen with a very polite how d ye do then shaking his head mournfully he began well mahs ossie old massa is gone forever

before the last words died from his lips a river of tears gushed from his eyes the reservoir of pentup emotion burst with violent force and zac sobbed as bitterly as a child when his grief had somewhat subsided he said continuing his report it was just a quarter past two in the morning and a little after you and mr highfield took home miss maud that we missed mahs burleigh and could not find him anywhere about the house the missis began to be very troubled about him and sent the servants with lanterns to search around the house and the garden i did my best and bawled out as much as i could but poor old massa could not hear we were just giving up the search as a bad job when tommy blackburn tumbled on something under a lime tree and as he looked carefully with his lantern what do you think he saw but the dead body of the dear old massa steeped in blood and with a revolver close by he bawled aloud and everybody went to see what had happened

madame also went and when she saw what it was she gave such a scream as i never before heard i tell you sirs i am now sixtynine years six months and two days in this sinful life and may god keep me from ever hearing such a sound again the echo is even now in my ears and makes me feel most miserable the poor creature fell down senseless upon her husbands corpse we took her up carried her to the house and placed her in a bed where the little boy was sleeping

of course there wasnt any more dancingâeverything was topsyturvey i went to call mr mc intyre to set things in order he complained of a bad headache and said it was through feeling ill that he had to leave the ballroom but as it was such a serious matter he must go out

did he show any emotion when you imparted the sad intelligence to him interrupted hugh

oh yes sir the poor chap bawled like a bull although i did not see any water from his eyes he was very kind and for the first time since i knew him he offered me a glass of brandy and soda yes he gave me brandy and soda this morning i was cold sirs and i tell you i swallowed it with pleasure but tell me why you want to know if mr mc intyre looked sad

oh nothing much zac

and hugh shook his head as if some important thoughts were passing through his brain

did any one say he heard the report of the pistol

he continued

not a soul sir was the reply followed by a muttered ah you are young but you have an old head on your shoulders

neither lindsay nor hugh heard the last expression of the professor and though they implored him to repeat it he refused to do so continuing his sorrowful tale thus when mr mc intyre arrived at elmsdale he began to put everything straight before the police came he examined the corpse and found in a pocket old massas will and another letter which he opened and read

the two gentlemen were astonished at this statement they eyed each other keenly and there were some strange associations at work within their minds

a few moments having elapsed hugh broke the silence with the following query is it not a contravention of the laws of the colony to have so much to do with a corpse before the coroners investigation

i should think so exclaimed lindsay with an air of concern matters are wearing a curious appearance and the newspaper comment can somewhat be accounted for did mr mc intyre read the will

no he merely looked at it then put it back where he found it

and the letter

oh i saw him read that and tommy blackburn and i were there at the time

so the inquest will be at nine oclock you say

yes sir

lindsay took out his watch and looked at it it said halfpast seven

come on hugh he cried it will take us a full halfhour to get over to elmsdale

at this moment hugh was making some notes in his pocketbook which although he did not appreciate it at the time subsequently proved to be of great value

in a short time lindsay hugh and the professor were on their way to elmsdale at jehu speed

scorn me not in mine extreme of misery

siege of valencia

 christ is there no remedy must my husbands name be thus wronged and my honour be thrown in the dust by the vile insinuations of some plotting monster

i cannot bear it no never let me die  god and be delivered from this heinous outrage

edith woodhouse was raving and she drew about her a number of sympathetic hearts as she poured forth the above words in her delirium dr fane the medical officer of the district had been summoned to her his care was unremitting and his professional skill was taxed to the utmost to preserve life in the unfortunate patient whose nerves were strained to the utmost tension he had administered sedative mixtures and a draught which had given her a couple of hours sleep but now like a lion at bay mrs woodhouse rose with dishevelled locks and bloodshot eyes the doctor tried to compose her but with little effect he grew alarmed at the probability of dementia and tears began to flow from his eyes mrs woodhouse however soon convinced him that she was not mad

miss fairley and her father the rev mr fairley entered the apartment and their presence had a soothing effect upon herâshe became surprisingly calm and composed

so my dear maud you have come to see the poor outcast she said looking into mauds eyes with tearstained face i the outcast who have been branded with calumnies as black as hell itself still possess the friendship of a pure soul like you

oh my dear edith how can you fancy yourself an outcast your life has been too exemplary to be affected by any base accusations made against you compose yourself and believe that whoever has placed this bitter cup to your lips will receive his deserts at the hands of heaven none who know you would believe that you were unfaithful to your husband

do you really think so maud asked the unfortunate woman who clutched at this flimsy straw of hope to establish some peace within her bosom and she buried her head in her hands and wept aloud

mauds heart was ready to burst with mingled pity and love mr fairley and the doctor were deeply moved at the scene but said nothing

mc intyre entered the room and after interchanging civilities with those present took a seat near mrs

woodhouse

do not be so distressed poor dear creature he pleaded it is the lords will that this sore trial should come upon you acquit yourself like a woman and be strong cast your burden upon the lord for he careth for thee i am certain that burleigh did not destroy himself in his sound mind he must have sustained some injury which temporarily deranged him and impelled him to commit the awful deed take hope my dear edith that you will be sure to meet him again in that beautiful land where partings are no more and where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest 

thank you for your comforting words george but tell me nothing about my husbands committing suicide âthat is out of the question i shall never believe such a thing he was murderedâyes murdered by some foul being who for his own ends has also bruited it abroad that i have been unfaithful

unfaithful why that could never be no intimation of that has as yet reached my ears

strange have you not observed that this mornings paper had no hesitation in libelling my character in unmistakable words i am sure you read the papers

i have not yet had time to glance in the columns of a newspaper so much have i been engaged with your affairs

i thank you george for your kindness if i have spoken harshly i am sure you will attribute this to the unhappy state of my mind

poor dear cousin my heart yearns for you i fully realize that in your excited condition you are not accountable for any impolite expressions that may fall from your lips may you have the support of him who is the father of the fatherless and the judge of the widow in this your terrible trial

mc intyre turned to leave the room when he saw old zac approaching him with the words a servant wants to see you sir

where is he enquired mc intyre

not my business sir so i didnt take the liberty to enquire

mc intyre did not stop to reply but ran downstairs as fast as his legs could carry him muttering as he went damn it all this fuss could have been avoided with a little more discretion but i have some splendid cards to play yet

at the door a cab was drawn up on the box of which sat a burlylooking coachman just in the act of drawing out his pipe to enjoy a pleasant whiff a goodlooking face which bore the marks of tender youth and a high degree of intelligence peeped out anxiously from between the curtains

oh is it you asked mc intyre as his eyes fell upon the gentleman why i thought you were abroad he continued in an undertone advancing meanwhile toward the vehicle

no not yet abroad i am however going straight off with my impedimenta i have a full quarter of an hour to spare it is now a quarter past eight the steamer leaves at halfpast and as our arrangements have been so hurried i came this wray to learn if there are any further instructions and also to wish you goodbye and to thank you once more for your kindness to me

nothing more than we have spoken of you will be looked out for at melbourne and when you land you must enquire for the house of webster  cheeseman

i have already replied to their private telegram and have said that you will positively sail this morning

then according to arrangements i shall expect to enter upon my duties immediately

as a matter of course my boy and according to my recommendation i predict a speedy promotion for you in addition to the five hundred dollars already presented to you i shall add twenty moreâand here is the money whatever your necessities may be they will be well attended to by my brother on your arrival

how can i thank you sufficiently mr mc intyre

i hope to repay you some day for the extraordinary interest you have taken in me

dont say a word dear heineman im much older than youâin fact you are but a mere boy to meâ but i have a special fondness for you the fact that a youth like you is so far away from home causes me to entertain for you a kind of paternal sympathy

heineman then parted from his benefactor and the cab laden with the baggage pursued its course to the pier

my lack of foresight has cost me very dear mused mc intyre as he retraced his steps toward the house

nevertheless i must continue to be jesuiticalâthe end justifies the means one cannot launch on any great enterprise without making sacrifice

one or two words of the conversation that had been carried on between heineman and mc intyre had been heard by lindsay and hugh who had seated themselves at a window overlooking the street after their recent arrival a venetian blind had hidden them from outside view but gave them the advantage of what was taking place in the street

that youth has been duped said highfield im positive of that

why do you think so enquired lindsay who despite his eminence as a lawyer was not as farseeing as his companion

mc intyres benevolence could never reach that standard if he were not playing some extraordinary game my experience of his character as obtained in a very recent conversation proves conclusively that he is not what he seems i tell you lindsay i have an unconquerable repugnance for that man

it was not long afterward that mc intyre came in contact with lindsay and hugh

so you have heard of the awful tragedy gentlemen 

yes mr mc intyre was the laconic reply

and what do you think of it

i firmly believe sir ejaculated hugh with great emphasis that a barefaced murder has been perpetrated and that by no stranger either probably some trusted person did the foul deed i am further convinced that the revolver found near the dead man is as innocent of the crime as are these fingers

you are quite singular in your belief mr highfield replied mc intyre

yes sir as sure as that i am alive and that there is an avenging god above the redhanded villain will one day pay the penalty of his monstrous crime

it is my sincere desire that that may be so ere long said mc intyre

mrs woodhouse was much better when lindsay and hugh entered her apartments she was relating to the rev mr pairley the premonitory signs by which she had been warned of the approach of some very grave event she told how for several days a bird had been perched on a beam in the house and after having engaged the attention of all the inmates of elmsdale had mysteriously disappeared no one having seen when it took its flight she also recounted the frightful dreams that had for some time been disturbing her rest

at this the countenance of the clergyman grew serious and his thoughts went back to the dreams of joseph and the mysterious visions of daniel he realized at once that humanity under the theocracy with its mysterious phenomena was identical with humanity under the christian dispensation and he began to think that what he had been denouncing from the pulpit as ignorant superstition and the natural outcome of fallacies of the brain as john stuart mill would say had an impregnable foundation in holy writ

this is really an interesting study said he and your sad circumstance mrs woodhouse has given rise to new ideas in my mind i am convinced that god still continues to make dreams a medium of communication to his people but there are no daniels to give the interpretations and prepare us to receive our goodâ or badâfortune

at tills the eyes of all present were simultaneously turned on zac who was standing like a statue in the middle of the room with his mouth wide open listening attentively to the clergyman and drinking in every word that fell from his lips

but there is a daniel or rather a samuel in our midst interrupted hugh i mean the venerable zac whom i heard with my own ears foretelling the calamities of elmsdale

yes indeed there is something inexplicable in connection with this old man remarked mrs woodhouse feebly and he really possesses some prophetic gifts

he has a remarkable appearance said the man of the cloth but so far as i am led to understand from certain members of my church his light is associated with the black art or something diabolical and i have had occasion to speak to him on the subject more than once

at this juncture some one intimated that the coroner had arrived mrs woodhouse was sitting in a melancholy mood and her thoughts appeared to be far away but at this important announcement she sprang up wildly rushed upon mauds neck and then dropped down unconscious

all hands present found something to do toward helping to retore her she was carefully and tenderly laid on a couch and the doctor placed maud to watch over her the rest of the party except zac returned to the study

the faithful servant would not leave the room under any consideration he watched with anxious eyes the throbbing breast of his mistress and as she lay in her tranquil beauty with eyelids closely shut and the stamp of inexpressible sorrow imprinted upon her face he thought of the terrors of death and sent a prayer up to the throne of grace that his beloved mistress might be spared a little longer

all all look up with reverential awe at crimes that scape or triumph oer the law while truth worth wisdom they decry

nothing is sacred now but villainy

forgiveness to the injured does belong but they neer pardon who have done the wrong

nine of the principal men of the town were selected for the jury at the inquest and the hon patrick chalmers presided as coroner dr fane gave evidence as follows i was summoned from my house by sergeant hollingsworth to view the body of the deceased at about a quarter to four this morning i found the body steeped in blood with a revolverâthe probable instrument of destructionâin close proximity a bullet had pierced the frontal lobe of the skull pentrating the right cerebral hemisphere of the brain and making its exit near the occiput death i believe must have occurred instantly i believe the deceased committed suicide while in a state of temporary insanity

several witnesses were examined from whose statements was elicted the fact that woodhouse had been apparently buoyant and gay throughout the evening preceding his death and that there was nothing to create the impression that anything of a serious nature rested on his mind the jurors seemed puzzled reference was made to the paragraph that appeared in the chronicle of that morning relative to the tragedy and the coroner felt desirous to know from what source the paper had gathered certain important details which could not have been in possession of the general public

acting upon this suggestion the jury searched the corpse and among other things woodhouses will was found in an inner pocket also the letter that zac had testified to having seen mc intyre reading the coroner looked grave as he ran his eyes over this letter and handed it to the foreman of the jury with a request that he should read it to his confreres it was addressed to the wife of the deceased and ran as follows depraved wretch my life is a blank and though i have often drowned the thoughts of my cursed lot in the lethean springs of poisonous distillers yet can i no longer bear lifes stings and arrows since your infidelity has now reached an irrepressible and horrible stage edithâmy once loved edithâwhom i adored with a transcendent love now that you are converted into a veritable messalina i hate and despise you

burleigh

when the letter was read the assembly seemed stricken as if with catalepsy mrs woodhouse was leaning on mc intyres arm while maud applied to her nostrils a vinaigrette she had recovered somewhat and dr fane had advised her to attend the inquest so that if necessary her evidence might be taken all eyes were now turned upon her and even hisses were levelled at her she treated them with dignified scorn which only intensified the contempt that was fomenting against her

a sad expression came over the face of mr fairley

there were tears streaming from his daughters eyes but she continued in her work of love mc intyre seemed stung by some venomous reptile and with an air of offended pride withdrew his arm but his place was immediately taken by hugh who cast a stern and severe look at the man whom he disliked so much and called him to his teeth an inhuman dog

the letter the letter let me have a glance at it

cried lindsay in a tone of deep excitement

it was ordered to be handed to him and as he looked at the writing his visage changed immediately he became ashen pale and from his trembling hands the paper slipped upon the ground maud took it up and before she could look at it mrs woodhouse suddenly seized it

yes it is my husbands writing she exclaimed vehemently is this a vision am i in dreamland yes it is my husbands own writing o merciful god

and she fell to the ground senseless the doctor was immediately in attendance

a voice burst from the crowd hypocrite she is only shamming

how complex indeed are the elements that constitute our nature and how our impulses are marvelously stirred to action often in diametrically opposite directions within the space of a few minutes according to the circumstances by which they are around a few moments before there was a wave of indignation against the woman who had dared thus to offend society and now as she lay cold and senseless upon the ground undergoing the penalty of her suspected unfaithfulness there was deep pity for her and curses and execration for the inhuman wretch who dared to strike such a foul blow at such a moment it was afterward ascertained that mc intyre was the offender and the coroner sternly rebuked him

this was the third time that mrs woodhouse had swooned within the space of a few hours dr fane expressed the opinion that her illness had become quite serious and he ordered that she should be immediately removed to her apartments

the inquest continued zac gave his evidence in much the same strain that he had done before lindsay then moved forward and said it is obvious from the evidence we have heard that the chronicle had some authority whereon to found the comments produced this morning in its columns in the absence of further evidence we must necessarily arrive at the same conclusion but the question narrows itself to this whence did the chronicle get the knowledge of certain private matters which are not the property of the public and which they could never have known and how was this distinguished journal in a position to solve this knotty problem of murder or suicide there is a great mystery connected with the matter which in my opinion gentlemen ought certainly to be cleared up

very good mr lindsay said the coroner and jury with one acocrd

the coroner put the following questions to mc intyre did you mr mc intyre examine the body of the deceased and therefrom extract certain documents

i did overhaul the body sir but extracted no documents

professor zac advanced with rapid strides saying do not hide it

but before he could go further he was instructed by the coroner to sit down until he was required

you said then mr mc intyre you did not interfere with anything on the dead body

well erâer sir iâiâi did see some papers that dropped from the coat pocket but i immediately put them back knowing that i would not be justified in removing anything until the body was handed over to the crown

you did not read any of them did you

of course not and even if i was disposed to do so i had no time at my disposal

can you give me any idea of how the reporter came into possession of certain very confidential details in connection with the domestic affairs of elmsdale

i am strictly of opinion that they must have leaked out through some servant as is generally the case the letter read awhile ago was discovered unsealed i regret much that i went beyond my province in touching the papers but i must again impress upon you gentlemen that i did not probe into the contents of this remarkable letter

old zac now came forward at the coroners request

he began mr mc intyre said he never read the letter but he did open it and read it in the presence of myself and tommy blackburn ill swear to it sir then waxing warm he thundered forth clenching his fist with violence youre a liar george mc intyre and may the curse of ananias fall upon you may the leprosy of naaman cleave to your tongue and before you meet with the death of judas may you be halfeaten by worms like herod only let me have a chance to do you the goodness of twisting the rope for your neck you prince of hellâyou child of beelzebub the curse of god is upon you and your seed forever

while the old negro poured forth his anathemas the coroner endeavored to stop him but found it impossible to do so

mc intyreâin fact the whole assemblyâwas struck by the vituperations which were hurled at him but he gathered courage to speak

it is unnecessary said he to convince you that i am ignorant of the malicious charge made against me by this old man i am positive that none of you gentlemen who know my reputation and who have listened to the vile ravings of a man who has long borne the reputation of being stark mad and a creature of questionable morality would for a moment regard his evidence as more valuable than mine he has wilfully lied against me and endeavoured to permanently injure my character

at the conclusion of his evidence mc intyre came out the victor none could look at those large mild grey eyes of his winch adapted themselves to all circumstances and not see in them honest indignation mingled with the apparent straightforwardness that innocence always imparts

one of the jurors suggested that the evidence of blackburn should be taken this individual had not been summoned in time and had gone to his work in a distant part of the country whence he would not return for a fortnight after a brief deliberation it was decided unnecessary to adjourn the enquiry to obtain the evidence of a person who in all probability could not be relied upon for his veracity the jurors were ultimately satisfied that no information concerning the private matters of the deceased and his wife had reached the public through mc intyre

the enquiry was adjourned for a couple of hours and on its resumption the editor of the chronicle was called upon to give evidence he was a tiny old man whose head was covered with a wealth of silver locks falling profusely on his neck his features were wrinkled and under a pair of pebble glasses twinkled two brilliant orbs which told that their owner was blessed with a high degree of intellectual power

mr perkins began the coroner youre responsible for the report that appeared in your paper this morning concerning the death of burleigh woodhouse of elmsdale and as the reporter who obtained the news might be able to throw some light on the mystery that now engages our attention it is your duty to let us know who he is

the editor took off his glasses wiped them and replaced them on his nose then looking the coroner straight in the face he said the article in question was unfortunately not subedited by me before its publication i did not happen to see it until a copy of the chronicle was handed to me at my house this morning when i arrived at my office i naturally enquired who was the author as i was much concerned about the sad passing of my lamented friend

none of the reporters could account for its authorship

i therefore examined the original manuscript and found it was in the handwriting of robert heineman a lad of estimable worth who hails from england and recently identified himself with the chronicle he is an adventurous and harebrained youth of eccentric habits and quick impulses and bent on making his fortune by leaps and bounds i was therefore not surprised when he announced to me at my home this morning that he had a few minutes before received an unexpected appointment somewhere in australia and that he would leave by the steamer that sails today i advised the boy against the step but he refused to hear me i have since discovered that he has carried out his intention and left by the muriel a p and o liner

at what time daily does the chronicle usually appear mr perkins

usually at  a m but this morning a little earlier

now are you of opinion that heineman is directly or indirectly connected with the tragedy

certainly not sir he is a gentleman in every sense of the word and would spurn to be an accessory to anything that bears the nature of crime i agree with mr mc intyre that it is a probability that the news reached him through some one intimately connected with elmsdale

after some other questions had been asked and a few other witnesses examined including two female servants and a groom from whom nothing of an important nature was elicitedâthe jurors unanimously returned a verdict of death by suicide

the coroner in the course of his summing up said this enquiry is one in which some very curious elements are involved there is not the slightest doubt that woodhouses death is of a mysterious nature from the doctors evidence and from the disclosures made by the papers found on the dead body i think the idea of foul play is out of the question with regard to the newspaper reportâthat has been cleared up by mr perkins who leaves us to conclude that young heineman late of the chronicle staff was the author of it and that his information was supplied by some unknown meddlesome person who had access to the documents discovered on the body it is therefore evident that woodhouse goaded by domestic troubles became insane and in this condition committed suicide

i deem it necessary to hand these documentsâthe will of the deceased and this letterâto his attorney mr

lindsay who will no doubt care safely for them

hugh and lindsay when the inquest was ended became engaged in a deep and earnest conversation

i am not at all satisfied with the turn the enquiry has taken remarked lindsay there is a great deal yet to be unravelled i will not believe that burleigh committed suicide nor am i of opinion that his wife has been unfaithful to him and yet that letterâthat startling letter undoubtedly written by himselfâterrifies me i am greatly perplexed and know not what to say

take my word for it oscar george mc intyre is closely connected with this tragedy i do not like that mans actions and i can almost read guilt written on his brow

nonsense hugh he may be a villain but he surely would not take his cousins life to secure his wealth

that would be too dreadful to contemplate and moreover up to the present i do not see anything that directly fastens suspicion on him

ah my dear friend you are much older than i am but my experience of mankind is somewhat extensive and my impressions are not easily shaken the schemes of a villain are beyond conception and the foul tactics he employs to perpetrate his dark deeds often affect probity and unsullied innocence

that is so lindsay agreed toying with a manuscript of his dead friend which he had found in woodhouses library that morning and if this man has any connection with burleighs death as you seem to think he should bo hanged a thousand times were it possible

little did lindsay imagine that in the roll of paper that he held in his hand he possessed an invaluable key to the elmsdale mysteryâa fairy wand whose magic touch would change the whole obscurity surrounding the death of burleigh woodhouse

blow blow thou winter windl thou are not so unkind as mans ingratitude

thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude

shakespeare

a few months after the death of woodhouse there was a general change at elmsdale the property passed into the hands of mc intyre who to the entire satisfaction of the authorities was proven to be the sole beneficiary of the will there was the proverbial nine days talk and then the matter quieted down

there were some who considered that mr woodhouse was a thorough demon for having cruelly disinherited his unoffending son even though he might have thought it right to make his wife suffer but there were others who thought he was perfectly justified in leaving his fortune to his next of kin and bequeathing nothing to the child who inheriting the taint of vice would ultimately use his legacy for evil ends

by a few persons mc intyre was still regarded with distrust and suspicion and among these hi success did not tend to promote the least familiarity but outside of this circle he was received with open arms for since fortune had specially favoured him with her choicest smiles why should not his friendship be considered a desirable thing he played billiards with gentlemen of unimpeachable character into whose society at one time he never aspired to enter and with the greatest sangfroid and air of chivalry offered his arm to ladies who before had contemned him no longer did the characteristic tranquility and soberness of elmsdale impress the passerby for it was now converted into an epicurean haunt where drinking and vice ran riot

nevertheless although mc intyre was a true child of epicurus he was not a fool but a man of some method and laboured earnestly to keep his estates in prime order he never ran into more debts than he was able to pay and this was considered a marvel and departure from the regular course of such debauchees

night after night the revels of elmsdale sounded far and wide it was a peculiar and noticeable fact that mc intyre was never seen to enter a certain room within elmsdale house this particular room was kept locked some people thought it was a sort of ali baba cave where he kept his treasures but the servants held a belief that it was the haunt of some demon with whom mc intyre was closely connected and thus holding it in superstitious awe they never ventured to approach it if they could possibly avoid it

it was christmas eve the shades of night were rapidly falling and loud peals of thunder accompanied by fearful flashes of lightning were heard from the west it was evident that a storm was approaching

a slight rain began to fall and gradually increased until it poured down in torrents as night advanced the blackness became intense the wind howled dreadfully among the branches of the tropical trees bending to the earth the tall slender cocoanut palms yet above the terrible and confused music of the storm rose the stentorian voices of young men who were gathered at elmsdale to drink to the health of their convivial host who was celebrating his fortieth birthday

while these bacchanalian orgies were transpiring within outside under the friendly branches of a towering ceiba tree stood a frail female figure draped in black holding by the hand her only child they were evidently listening to the hubbub of voices that came from within the mansion neither the blackness of the night nor the violence of the storm impressed them the rain beat their forms and the lightning flashed into their faces yet no thought of the danger of their position occurred to them

i the unfortunate castaway said the woman and she sent forth an hysterical laugh that thrilled the soul

reader pray that never may such a sound fall upon your ears it was so full of untold sadness and ringing with scorn

cold and shivering this weeping niobe pressed in her arms the child who now seemed anxious for the storm to cease and when she had whispered to him a few words pregnant with maternal tenderness she continued to give vent to her emotions

her friends had almost all forsaken her and the thought of this filled her cup of sorrow to the brim

where were the friends who once shared the joys of this poor woman like migratory birds they had flown

oh if there were only some one to whom i could look to defend my cause she sobbed bitterly

i will fight to the end for you mother said the child with emotion

you are yet so young my child and i shall be under the cold earth before you are big enough to fight my battle

i shall be a big man soon mother god will let me live i know he is good and hears the prayers of little children and i will wait patiently until the time comes for me to fight your battle it is i who must do it

little did the child imagine that these words were prophetic

your fate and mine are in the hands of a good providence and whether you or another be the instrument selected by god returned the woman i have strong hope that i shall live to see my desire upon mine enemy

i shall pray mother that i may have the privilege of finding out the man who killed my father and brought you to this condition o god look down upon thy child and help him to make his mother happy

the distressed mother found a ray of pleasure steal into her heart as she thought of the earnestness with which the boy sent up his petition to heaven in her behalf and in her heart of hearts she prayed too that the almighty would look down in his mercy and spare her darling

the storm abated streams of light began to pour from the windows of neighboring houses which had been temporarily closed on account of the rain and edith woodhouse the disinherited widow stole from her shelter with her boy whose hands she firmly grasped and without a moments further delay they wended their way toward a miserable little dwelling in which they had found refuge since being driven from the luxuries and comforts of their beautiful home

as mrs woodhouse and her child entered the house a kindly voice greeted them it was that of an old woman on whose brow were traced the wrinkles of threescoreandten summers she had had the honor to have been burleigh woodhouses nurse and her hospitable roof was voluntarily placed at the disposal of his deposed widow

ah you unruly runaways where has you bin all this time asked the old dame with a smile on her lips i sure you been exposed to the wind and rain you are shivering so much dont waste a moment tek off those wet clothes immediately my dear and get into something dry why poor little mass carl you seem to have a hard time look how the chiles teeth chattering

while mrs woodhouse and carl have retired to change their wet clothing and kindhearted old candace is busying herself about lighting a fire to prepare as quickly as possible two cups of invigorating ginger tea we will give the reader a description of the modest home of this hospitable old creature

it consisted of two small rooms used respectively as hall and bedroom and an adjoining gallery served the purpose of kitchen and pantry the floor of the hall was scrupulously clean and the entire furniture consisted chiefly of two strawseated chairs a rocker and an old couch while a rickety mahogany table situated in a corner of the room testified also to the cleanly habits of the inmate

the building however showed the ravages of time in spite of the frequent attempts of industrious hands to repair it by nailing pieces of tin over the gaping apertures or stuffing rags into the crevices branches of bay leaves and pretty flowers smiled from every corner of the cot and formed a beautiful arch over the doorway there stood in the gallery a table covered with a white cloth and laden with tempting and appetizing viands the stuffed roasted pig grinned menacingly in an ocean of rich gravy boiled and roasted chicken a squarecut piece of cheese and a pan loaf a dish of soused pork and several kinds of vegetables made up the menu

the reader would naturally imagine that these preparations were intended for the entertainment of some expected guests for whom every provision had been made to tempt their dainty palates certainly this in a sense would be correct the only difference being that the expected guests were certain disembodied beings who by her class are designated jumbies and who in accordance with traditional customs assemble on christmas eve to make merry at the feasts that are usually prepared for them marvelous powers are ascribed to these mysterious spirits who are in a position to affect for good or evil the condition of mankind according to the believers in this curious myth so candace had done her part to entertain her visitors in right good order even though she could ill afford the expense

mrs woodhouse and little carl appeared much revived by the change of clothing and the warm ginger tea

now tell me my dear said old candace to mrs

woodhouse when they were both seated how you spend de afternoon wah you bin and who you see

we have been to the churchyard replied mrs

woodhouse and we whiled away the hours in the labor of love that pleases us so muchâthat is to say clearing away the wild weeds which overrun the restingplace of our dear departed one and ohâwhat a beautiful lesson did we learn this afternoon the lilies which we despaired of have now bloomed sweetly so will our darling bloom on the resurrection morning when the angel shall wake him from his slumber

i tart you had gone to tak with the dead you must not go dere to grieve so my child you must leave off your sotrow and de lord will lighten your burden and after de night de morning will soon come dat shall give gladness to your po heart

gladness ah my poor candace when shall that be and edith drew from her bosom a miniature photograph of her dead husband and kissed it with much tenderness

dear mistress remember what is the message tomarrah marning is bringing us all fancy you is hearing the angel singing the glad song of joy and telling you to cast your cares away

mrs woodhouse was about to reply when she was interrupted by the intrusion of old zac who had come to spend a halfhour with his beloved mistress and to administer some words of consolation before retiring to sleep

well candace he commenced when he had respectfully saluted his mistress and had taken a comfortable seat whats all the news today i hope you are taking care of the missis

o go away you old devil does you fancy you only one loves missis and can take care of her you always come annoy me bout you nonsense

never mind old gal dont insult me like that said the professor kindly you just give me a grog im sure there is something good in the house tonight

afterward we will knock old story there is something i want to talk to you about

the old dame happy at the thought of joining in some interesting gossip quickly rose from her seat and entered the gallery zac followed and in a few minutes he was sitting at the table with candace and testing the virtues of some very old rum a smile lighted up the face of mrs woodhouse as she mused on the oddities of the old people and their attachment and devotion to her

now candace said zac adjusting his pipe and preparing to have a good smoke i think we shall have to seek out some egypt to send the young saviour of elmsdale to before he gets into the hands of herod

i dont understand you man speak plain a little laming is a bad ting foo niggars like you good old massa couldnt ha do a wusser ting dan foo get you eddication

well ill tell you plainly what i mean old zac explained pleased at the reference to his superior knowledge i have had a hint that that vagabond george mc intyre is up to some of his tricks and he is trying to get rid of that poor little boy who is so dear to his mothers heart it would be very sad for the little fellow to part from his mother but he must for the good of them both

do you mean dat dat beast want to kill de chile too he not satisfy wid de blood he already shed

but tell me zac how you know de intention of dis devil 

you know i do not go through the world with my eyes shut old lady but to the point ill tell you how i see through the villains plot last night about halfpast eleven oclock i was passing by elmsdale and when i arrived at the gate i saw a person coming from the yard i stopped back awhile and hid myself when i heard george mc intyre close the gate whispering at the same time to the person do your best man remember it is five hundred bright canaries i said something is up you know i dont trust that rascal because i will never lose sight of the fact that it was no other but him who murdered mahs burleigh no matter what judge jury or any earthly man may say to the contrary well to go on i followed at a distance and what was my surprise when after half an hours walk i saw the form before me go into fish alleyâthe nastiest place in the town i marked the house in which he went and in the morning when i went back i found it was dick rays house

dicky ray interrupted candace much alarmed

my god the worst wretch that god make upon the face of dis earth but go on zac dis story is very serious

i put my brains to work and today i went to feel dicks pulse i sent for some of allans old tom and when dick had swallowed a plenty he spoke unadvisedly with his lips

upon these last words zac laid a great stress and candace once more reproved him for using big words at which he laughed haughtily and remarked but im talking scripture you big dunce why not read the sacred volume well thenâto talk so that you can understandâdick ray vomited many more words than i expected he told me that he had not seen mc intyre for some time he joined with me that he was nasty fellow and said that he was of opinion that mahs burleigh was murdered by him to get his wealth and that the right heir of elmsdale would if he lives come in for his property well you cant see through the thing as i can but im sure you have enough brains to see whats what

when zac had finished he looked intently at candace to observe the impression that his words had produced

the old woman nodded her head and sighed then ended by dropping a tear and exclaiming de lord be praised we will save de chile

she had not the privilege that zac had had of obtaining a smattering of education but she was naturally endowed with a vast amount of common sense strengthened by the wide experience that her many years brought her and so zacs narrative seriously perplexed her and caused her to think deeply after having carefully weighed the subject she could not but arrive at the conclusion that mc intyre had contemplated the destruction of the harmless child and in perpetrating his wicked designs had employed the services of the most renowned brigand available

these circumstances were related to mrs woodhouse the same night she actually broke dowm although the wary zac had brought into operation all the philosophy that a buoyant optimism could devise in order to console her at last the brokenhearted mother yielded to a suggestion made by zac to put carl under the care of mr highfield who it was agreed would give him every possible attention

from the first day that he formed the acquaintance of the woodhouse family hugh had been esteemed as a friend and in his intercourse with them exhibited every mark of sincere friendship which did not terminate with the sad change of circumstances this resolution was however subject to the sanction of lindsay in whom all had the greatest confidence

hugh would be off to trinidad in a month and there should be no time lost in fixing matters up so it was arranged that as soon as practicable there should be a general conference on the subject

come ye disconsolate whereer ye languish come at gods altar fervently kneel here bring your wounded hearts here tell your anguishâ earth has no sorrow that heavn cannot heal

christmas day dawned it was one of those lovely mornings when all nature in the tropics smiles sweetly and lends the most charming aspect to things both animate and inanimate the air was cool and balmy and the tints of light glorious in the eastern sky a beautiful picture presented itself there one could observe banks of clouds of exquisite loveliness ever changing in form and color every bush and flower was bedecked with rare beauty which seemed to be specially imparted to them on that december morning and as the radiant sun rose majestically above these clouds they appeared to extend gracefully their fronds and petals to receive sols gentle kiss

bright and happy faces came and went along the streets and blithe hearts poured out merry greetings

the night before had been spent in jovial nonsense and merriment welltodo citizens indulged in whiskey and soda and argued vociferously as the liquor inflamed their brains middleclass folk enjoyed themselves as best they could some went to hear mass at st patricks whale the more mischievous played fantastic tricks to tile great discomfort of their friends and neighbors several families found themselves barred up in their houses and it was only after much trouble and expense that they were set at liberty fruit trees of all kinds were stripped of their fruit even the tallness of the cocoanut tree did not deter the rash poachers from indulging in their little joke and carrying off several bunches of cocoanuts

when the morning dawned merchants and shopkeepers felt a little irritated when they discovered their signboards removed from their proper places old maids complained that they were unable to find the whereabouts of their stepladders and many proprietors with a suppressed laugh and a cry of mischievous rascals replaced their gates which they were fortunate enough to find only some yards away from where they should have been

divine service was held at all the churches at eleven oclock in the morning and a large congregation assembled to thank the almighty for his mercies in sparing them to join in the pleasures of another christmastide to swell the strains of hark the herald angels sing and hear the ministers eloquent presentation of the lessons that the day brought with it

peace on earth good will to men mans redemption a reality eden is restored to the fallen sons of adam

on this day of days there was however among the vast congregation gathered in st marys church a heart overwhelmed with a sorrow that knew no bounds

it was that of edith woodhouse there in that sacred edifice at whose altar she had often knelt and obtained strength to bear her troubles when everything else proved ineffective she now found herself growing more and more miserable the tremulous peals of the organ as they swelled to the rich volumes of a soulstirring fortissimo or faded away in the sweet cadence of a pathetic pianissimo had no charm for her these were lostâentirely engulfed in the sad memories that the associations of the day had revived there was no more a loving husband to take his seat by her side and join in the chorus of joy that was ascending to heaven

the affectionate glance that greeted her when the moment arrived for approaching the lords table had gone forever a stranger took possession of their seat in the church and in the world alone with a helpless orphan under the ban of a terrible ostracism she had not even the wherewithal to supply any part of the customary good cheer which the poorest at this time provided for feasting and merrymaking

the poor woman in her widows weeds bent her head upon her breast and wept the rev mr fairley appeared touched to the heart as his eyes stole upon her now and then during his discourse edith remained in the church with her child until all others had gone out and as she rose and directed her steps toward the door a voice greeted her the rev mr fairley wishes to see you maam

said the sacristan quickening his steps and advancing toward the mother and child

he is yet in the vestry i suppose

no maam he has gone on to the rectory and desires you to follow

i will do so come on my heart

and she took carl by the hand and followed

gathered in the ministers drawingroom were lindsay hugh mrs fairley and her daugher maud they were of course no strangers to mrs woodhouse they were the only friends she had left in that circle and she felt at home among them but when her eyes alighted on the form of mc intyre coming in with the rev mr fairley all the bitterness that was pent up within her breast revealed itself in the frown that knit her brows

mc intyre approached with an air of gallantry and extreme politeness he shook hands with mrs fairley and maud and made a very polite bow to the others

mr fairley and he then retired for some time and engaged in an earnest conversation not long afterward mrs woodhouse was invited to the clergymans study to talk over some private and confidential matters the audience seemed astonished and anticipated something unusual

you certainly do not desire me to face mr mc intyre in any affair whatever my dear mr fairley

protested mrs woodhouse if this be so i shall be placed in the awkward position of having to refuse your request

the minister smiled sweetly

why is this edith is your hate made of such implacable stuff that you cannot be amenable to reason of any sort

then you contemplate a reasoning of some sort

if it be with my archenemy i must again strenuously decline to take any part whatever in it

do you forget that it is christmas day and the heart takes holiday from cherishing personal dislikes and shuts out all thoughts of wrongs

not such as i have suffered sir

oh be not so obdurate my child persuaded the minister i promise that you need have little to say to mr mc intyre and you will do me an immense favour if you will attend

mrs woodhouse cast a glance at lindsay and hugh and in their faces she read assent to the proposal while what harm can reach yu when we are here to protect seemed to speak from their eyes then rising from her seat she accompanied her pastor into his study carl followed unobserved by hermc intyre was sitting with his legs crossed and a newspaper in his hand as mrs woodhouse appeared he assumed the dignity of a turkish pasha mr fairley beckoned the lady to a chair and as he glanced around him his eyes fell upon carl

you are not wanted here my little man said he to the child will you retire until your mother is through 

excuse me sir sharply responded carl wherever my mother is there will i be do you forget that i am her protector and the only one she has in the world

mr fairley looked his admiration of the spirit the child displayed

there can be no harm in his remaining since he will learn nothing to his detriment nor get any harm

and so he did not longer resist carls desire

after directing his attention to mrs woodhouse he said mr mc intyre is desirous of showing some sympathy toward your child and has suggested making arrangements for his education with mr kuhner the principal of the high school here if you will only give your consent he assures me that he has been much concerned about carls progress and although the boy has been shut out of his fathers will he considers it his duty as a christian to help him on and bury all previous feuds mr mc intyre desires to approach you on this allimportant subject feeling sure that the chord which christendom strikes today is vibrating as powerfully in your heart as in that of any other earnest disciple of christ and will lead you to forgive and forget hatred malice and all uncharitableness meanwhile you will be securing the proper training of your boy now what do you say to this

mrs woodhouse curled her lips and her eyes sparkled with indignation

do you deem me such a sycophant mr fairley that you did not anticipate my emphatic refusal in this matter by influencing me to face this man with the view of accepting his proffered baits or to bring about any reconciliation between us i cannot hesitate in saying candidly that although you have hitherto extended your sympathy to me you tacitly conclude that i am guilty of the black charges of which i have been accused by this scoundrel and his set for who but a vile and degraded wretchâlost to every sense of honourâ would consent to receive any favours from the man who has ruined her life dragged her reputation in the dust and not content with this seeks further to satiate his thirst for blood

do not be angry i had no intention of offending and if i have acted in any way unwisely i did so in the interest of your childs education in my capacity as an apostle of peace i certainly would not shirk my responsibility as a mediator

i am surprised to hear mrs woodhouse speak in such vengeful terms against me i bear her no malice and shall only attribute her remarks which are so pregnant with rancour to the rashness incident to womans nature i have done you nothing but good madame

it was no fault of mine that i became your husbands heir and my sense of manhood coupled with an innate and uncontrollable desire to be generous has prompted me to make the offer that i have through our beloved pastor as a first step toward bettering your own condition and that of your fatherless child and adding to your general comfort believe me it will relieve the burden with which i am afflicted by my too sensitive and kindly nature if you will permit me to feel that i have done something toward ameliorating your present condition

george mc intyre the honey of your words can never conceal the adders poison that stains your lips

do you think to charm me now no you need some rarer music leave me and my child to live in that peace which our unsullied consciences afford us as for your part your doom is sealed according to the words of him who said vengeance is mine and who clothes the lily of the valley and protects the fatherless and widow mr fairley will you take your bible and read for mr mc intyres instruction from the seventeenth chapter of jeremiah eleventh verse

the clergyman took the bible and read  as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and at his end shall be a fool

that constitutes an unpleasant insinuation but as far as i am concerned it is quite irrelevant for i have not got riches unlawfully you labour under a wrong impression and your words do not affect me but a truce to all this i beg your forgiveness for my harsh dealings with you my conduct was justifiable according to my sense of right and if i once spurned you it was because my prejudice prompted me so to do i too have my shortcomings and as i look more closely into my own heart i find with intense regret that i have been often uncharitable toward you madam i ask once more your forgiveness

the strong stern man seemed metamorphosed into a lamb and knelt before the frail woman and implored her pardon

are you so barefaced as to come to the castout adulteress the pretending hypocrite to sue for pardon

has your morality grown so feeble that it now bends to recognise a polluted wretch like me strange sir âstrange indeed

yes for the tempted needs more sympathy than the tempter

and as these words escaped mc intyres lips he fixed his eyes upon the pastor

then a moments quiet ensued during which time a fierce fire shone in the dark eyes of mrs woodhouse before she burst forth with vehemence what do you mean by those words mr mc intyre

your clergyman may explain if he chooses was the laconic reply

so you dare to insult my mother interrupted carl who clearly perceived the approaching storm

confound you boy do not vex me retorted mc intyre in exasperation i shall not fail to give you your deserts if you assume the man with me

he turned to go after bidding mr fairley goodbye but before he reached the door carl impetuously threw a ruler at his head which sent mc intyre reeling on the floor with streams of blood flowing from a gaping wound mr fairley had never before found himself in such a quandary while exercising his sacred function as an advocate of peace with nervous lips he ordered his buggy in which mc intyre was placed and driven hurriedly home to elmsdale

whether of open war or covert guile we now debate who can advise may speak

milton

it was a dark and misty night when two muffled forms were seen advancing towards elmsdale the clock had just struck twelve and a policeman had taken up his beat in the vicinity of this palatial residence but despite the apparent vigilance of this custodian of the peace the two forms quietly effected an entrance within the precincts of elmsdale they were conducted by mc intyreâwho had evidently been awaiting themâinto a cosy apartment where a small lamp placed upon a table burned dimly upon a shelf stood a tiny clock whose weird ticking fell monotonously upon the ear and three chairs placed together in a corner and overrun with cobwebs gave one the idea that this apartment was certainly not frequented except at rare intervals

sit down by boys said mc intyre when he had lighted a cigar and was himself duly seated i have signally failed in my attempt my cock wont crow and i will have to try some other stratagem to get the little scamp and his mother within my grasp now dick what do you say

fifty guineas more and i will suggest a better plan whispered dick ray his face ablaze with enthusiasm

what is it enquired mc intyre

only promise that you will add the sum asked and we are your humble servants

very well dick ill promise to give you fifty guineas more in addition to the handsome sum already agreed upon let me have your plan without delay i know you can be trustedâand you have already given ample evidence of your originality

excuse me sir i am not disclosing the plot that dick and i have arranged as you might be somewhat nervous and overanxious put in the individual who had hitherto kept his peace we will pledge you our word upon the honour of gentlemen that we will perform our duties to your entire satisfaction what say you

your plans might involve me and get me in a serious mess hence i should like to know what you are about before you begin to work

you might hamper our movements put in hawkie

oh balderdash said mc intyre with impatience

my aim is to put that little monkey where he ought to be and it does not matter what means are adopted ârifleshot cyanide of potassium or whatever you choose do you see this hawkie and he took off his hat and exposed a wound at the back of his head

the little urchin has given me this mark and do you think i could imagine any death too hard for him to die but you must be quick with your plans as i have been made to understand that mother and son sail shortly for trinidad

oh we are aware of that dont fear mr mc intyre your prize is worth fighting for and we shant disappoint you

but i implore you once more to let me into your secret

never thundered hawkie almost annoyed and dick ray joined in the refusal by looking his accomplice in the face and giving him a negative shake of the head

very well my jolly boys i leave the matter entirely in your hands agreed mc intyre handing over the sum demanded when shall i get news again from you

he asked

when the thing is done and you get the evidence

matters having been thus arranged mc intyre accompanied his companions to the gate and they congratulating themselves that they had happily escaped the vigilance of the policeâwho was still monotonously pacing up and down the streetâretired to their respective homes

hawkie was a monster of herculean form with perfectly developed muscles his face was broad and of a low type and his retreating forehead high cheekbones large dilating nostrils and thick lips presented a most repulsive appearance his eyes flamed in their sockets and seemed ready to fall out and yet it is an incredible fact that there were times when they wore a mild appearance especially when not distorted by the effects of alcohol his voice was deep and powerful and often brought into requisition to awe illbehaved children into swallowing nauseous potions or to run off to the village school he was a terror in the community in which he lived and nobody dared disobey his order or incur his displeasure for fear that irrespective of any consideration whatever his brawny arm might send his victim to measure his length on the ground his crimes were numerous and the prison had often been his home yet this man with the seeming characteristics of the brute of the lower creation had been known to weep profusely over his mothers grave to give his last penny to a famishing beggar and to almost sacrifice his life to save a man who had once been his inveterate foe

curious medley of the genus homo indeed was richard fullerton alias jack the butcher alias hercules alias hawkie and this brings us to the conclusion that no matter how low a being may sink in moral degradation there is yet something divine within him though it be warped and suppressed by the contamination of evil environment and choked by the vicious passions and impulses of his lower nature

dick ray hawkies companion in crime was a tall sinewy fellow who possessed fairly wellchiseled features he had received his education in the three rs at a public school and had progressed favorably in them when a boy he had been designed to fill a decent vocation in life but being of a degenerate turn of mind he was led away by evil companions and subsequently broke his mothers heart he thereupon stifled the voice of conscience and commenced a life of unmentionable infamy the rector of the parish could not influence him by his forcible arguments grounded on the scriptures

dick read tom paine and the translations of voltaire and similar infidel authors and he agreed with them that the things of this life are sufficient in themselves to employ our undivided attention without groping in the dark for what does not concern us he wanted to be happy here and leave the hereafter until he got into it before fixing his plans for eternity so he fell into the life of a noted brigand he had shutthis ears to the cry of the defenseless traveller had set his heart against the widow and the orphan and wore on his brow the eternal stamp of cain

in south america where he began his nefarious profession the blood of many innocent victims cried out from the ground against him it was recorded of him on the most unmistakable authority that he poisoned a benevolent uncle of his to secure four hundred and eighty dollars and sold his own daughter to be another acquisition to the harem of a wellknown debauchee

unlike his accomplice he was not susceptible to the emotions that pain or suffering induce his heart was like a piece of granite within him and no deed could be too infamous for him to undertake so long as it carried with it the anticipation of pecuniary gain

his life was gentle and the elements so mixd in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this is a man

shakespeare

mamma said carl to his mother one afternoon when they were sitting together in the churchyard near the last restingplace of their beloved dead do you know that i love you more than i can tell

but all nice children love their parents especially when they are kind and loving why therefore do you say this to me my sweet

my love is not like that of other boys and girls it is more than theirs i am happy that i am the son of such a noble mother as you are and since you spurned that villain who wanted to give me schooling at his expense i feel that i could die for you mamma when you were talking to that man i remembered the sad story of poor virginia and her father which papa often told me and i now confess that if you had consented to take anything from george mc intyre for me this knife i now show you should have been pressed against my heart and my fathers spirit would have driven it in deep

mrs woodhouse read in the childs face a fixed determination and whether from joy or sorrow at this startling demonstration she trembled with emotion buried her head in her hands and wept

carl was an impulsive child full of vivacity with eyes that sparkled with precocious intelligence he was extremely adventurous and wild and could hardly be kept indoors for a single momentâalways up to some mischief as his father used to say but he was kind and generous with a heart always ready to deny itself for others often did he divide his lunch among his poorer schoolfellows and go without himself he could not bear to see an advantage taken of another and on one occasion he nearly got the life knocked out of him by a much bigger boy whom he had attacked on behalf of a smaller schoolmate at home he was trained at his mothers knees in all the sublimer teachings of the bibleâteachings that he arduously labored to put into practice his deep reverence for christ was admirable he loved to read the story of the crucifixion at which he would weep bitterly and there was not a single day that he omitted to read the sermon on the mount which so influenced him that whenever he was about to do anything of the rectitude of which he was uncertain he would ask himself would my lord have done this and act according to the answer that conscience supplied carl had never taken much interest in arithmetic but delighted in history and classical knowledge and his father encouraging his hobbies had taken pains to fill his youthful brain with the rich legends of ancient rome the story of the valor of classic greece and the departed chivalry of france and spain and the boy with open mouth and rapt attention would hear burleigh woodhouse tell of romulus and remus and of horatius at the bridge while the extraordinary deeds of sparta kept his spellbound and his very soul would become aflame with interest as he listened to the tale of surly diogenes and alexander or to the ludicrous exploits of don quixote and his valet sancho panza

woodhouse who was somewhat of a psychologist had done all within his power to educate his sons character and naturally employed such materials as would tend to produce the best results he taught him to ride with the ease and grace of a knighterrant and no boy for miles around of carls age and size could surpass him in the art of swimming

although woodhouse was born with a silver spoon in his mouth as the expression goes he had not been without some trials in his early youth but by dint of courage resolution and a proper sense of rectitude he laboured to overcome them though in many cases they loomed dark and high from his own experience he taught his boy some valuable lessons had thoroughly inculcated in him the spirit of courage and perseverance and had caused to be engraved on the childs heart the bright motto nil despercmdum buddhist philosophy in a measure teaches this and sakya muni enjoins his followers to believe that to attain nirvanaâ the state of sublime forgetfulnessâit is necessary to scale the mountain of difficulties constantly menacing them and arresting their onward progress

as little carls mind developed under such healthy and loving influences his character gradually shone forth in the brightest colors at the public school not far from where his mother lived which he attended he had won a place of favour among the other boys

one day he was induced by a harebrained impulse to take a cricket ball on which the master had placed his veto from a table drawer in the schoolroom in order to revive the excellent game of cricket which had been summarily stopped through the ill conduct of some naughty boys mr parker the schoolmaster was a strict diciplinarian and was extremely annoyed when he returned from luncheon to find that his orders had been disobeyed

who removed this ball from where i placed it

was the stern query the boys all trembled in their shoes and a chorus of voices pointed out jeremiah jacob as being the offender this unfortunate boy was perfectly innocent but his name and nature were repulsive to his schoolmates he was the bete noir of the school and was selected as the scapegoat to bear the others punishments he now remonstrated and protested his innocence but to no avail the masters authority must be maintained a thick cane customarily used in cases of graver offence was soon in evidence and two of the biggest boys were called upon to hold the offender

just as jeremiah jacob was seized by the two burly boys who were exulting over their prey carl entered and having been informed why jeremiah was about to undergo such stern punishment he gave a look of evident displeasure at his schoolfellows and bursting into passionate tears he sobbed i took the ball from your drawer mr parker and i cannot see jacob whipped for what i did

mr parker brought down the uplifted rod a momentary smile beamed on his face but it was quickly followed by a dark cloud of indignation he ordered the unfortunate jeremiah to be released commended carl for his honesty and sense of justice which recommended him to pardon and administered a severe thrashing to the wicked boys who had stooped to involve themselves in such an unmanly plot

through grief and through danger through sin and through shame

moore

poor weak woman who will pity thee when thine unwary feet are caught in the meshes of thine own frail humanity even though remorse haunts thy better self and thou strugglest to reform thou art only too harshly dealt with by the pharisaical prejudices of silly conventionalism thy crime becomes unpardonable in the eyes of thine accusers who would banish thee without the gates and level at thee impious execrations unmindful of the voice of conscience that sternly rebukes them for the dark stains which desecrate their own lives but which lie hidden beneath the thick veil of hypocrisy unheedful of the master masters echoing word he that is without sin among you let him cast the first stone and so relegated under the ban of a hideous conventionalism to an atmosphere where the sunshine of human sympathy penetrates not thy moral sensibility becomes warped thy selfrespect decays thy love becomes hate thy once refined tastes resolve themslves into brutal abandonmnt thou at last fallest headlong into the pit of complete destruction alas heartless men that ye would so cruelly deal with the lost sheep whom the saviour loves and so ardently seeks to bring home to his fold

mrs woodhouse felt her position acutely when she realized that those whom she once considered her faithful friends and in whom she had placed the greatest confidence had entirely forsaken her of course there were a few exceptions among them lindsay and his clerical companion clung tenaciously to the deposed creature their experience and human philosophy had ripened to the conclusion that she was entirely innocent of the charges brought against her the whole affair seemed dark but they were determined to clear away the mysterious clouds and convince the world that she had been the victim of trickery and duplicity unparalleled

mr fairley the pastor seemed to have caught the general contagion for although he had been most gracious at first he now began to assume a somewhat unpleasant attitude toward mrs woodhouse his wife also became distant and it was only the affectionate and kindlydisposed maud who could not under any circumstances be led to entertain an ill thought against her friend or believe for a moment that she was guilty

she openly expressed her opinion that nothing but a startling revelation from heaven would convince her to the contrary

hugh gladly undertook to take carl under his care and promised that he would leave no stone unturned to secure his education of this mrs woodhouse felt perfectly certain and moreover had every confidence that when once her sons lot was cast in with such an amiable character as hugh there need be no doubt as to his general welfare in the future

after due deliberation she determined also to leave the uncongenial atmosphere where her life was gradually decaying and try to recuperate her health and strength in some fresh field where the sunshine of a genuine smile would light the dark corners of her heart or the kindly words of unprejudiced souls reanimate the dying embers of hope within her she would accompany carl to trinidad where he was to stay with bis kind guardian and still continue to drink in the only happiness earth afforded namely to watch carefully her childs moral and intellectual progress

one evening as she and maud were sitting at the rickety table under candaces roof the latter remarked sadly and with much feeling i cannot tell you how much i regret your approaching departure my dear edith i cannot however but hope it will be for your benefit in every way we have been such good friends for such a long time that i do loathe to part with you

ah my darling my misfortunes are great i have drunk of the waters of meribah my people have cruelly despised me and i am counted as a thing of nought amongst them maud you love me i know such love can never perish it is not inspired by mammon it is divine and cannot die it is born of heaven and comes down on earth to illumine the souls of men it will still link us together although the clay may be separated when we are divested of the frail tabernacle which hampers us now so much and then as pure and ethereal spirits we shall live and love in the presence of our father which is in heaven

maud sighed deeply

do not be sorrowful my dear continued mrs

woodhouse i have a prophetic feeling which convinces me that we shall meet again in the flesh though miles of water may divide us for many years

god grant it whispered maud with overwhelming emotion

at this moment the professors voice was heard and as he approached mrs woodhouse got up from her seat and went toward the door

what news she enquired as soon as the old man had respectfully greeted her

very good news mistressânever had such good news in all my life i had to take a good grog on the strength of it

and zac laughed with all his might

what is it zac do not keep me in suspense any longer

well mistress i only feel a little disappointed that i did not get all i expected but i got enough to last me for some time and

oh to the point zac interrupted maud who had been led to believe that the professor had come in for some good fortune

ah miss maud youre there well im glad i am going to give you the nice little news that mr

george mc intyre esquire of elmsdale was horsewhipped and almost kicked to death

by whom when praise be to the lord

were the expressions in one chorus from maud mrs

woodhouse and old candace

by the young parson ejeculated zac in a ringing tone

mrs woodhouse looked surprised but mauds colour changed and she trembled like a leaf this did not escape mrs woodhouses quick perception candace enjoyed the news and looked forward with delight to further details

so me little parson hab blood den well dis man is de real debil when de angel of de lord hab to come and administer judgment upon he

go on zac commanded mrs woodhouse

the old man continued i did never believe mr highfield had so much pluck

this afternoon mc intyre and he met on the sims road

mr hugh asked him for some explanation about something which i could not hear for i was a little distance away from them mc intyre was very rude and answered the gentleman as if he was a nobody but mr

highfield showed him that he was somebody when he gave his six fine lashes with the head of his horsewhip

the brute twisted like the serpent he is and when he tried to defend himself mr hugh gave him a few cuffs threw him down and then kicked him all about i was waiting to see him give him a last one to roll him down the precipice of the narrow road and finish with him but the bloomin parson in the man must have remembered that the quality of mercy is not strained andâby all that is good and greatâi didnt get all i wanted however i am satisfied that mr george mc intyre went away swearing vengeance against the wicked parson

and where were you when this happened zac

hidden away in some bushes and neither of them knew that they were watched by mortal eyes

i wonder what can be the reason of this unfortunate conflict said mrs woodhouse i am certain that something serious underlies this which perhaps we shall soon hear about  zac how you exult over your enemy that is not a christian spirit i assure you that i dislike the man but i own your narrative makes me feel for him

do you mistress then earth is no place for you you are too much of an angel to live among people who cant get the old adam out of them but i have to be away to see mr fairley before it gets later i shall soon return to assist you in your packing and to give you a hand in whatever else you have to do you know the schooner will sail tomorrow morning positively

captain dalmetty told me so

very well my dear old zac fondly replied mrs

woodhouse

then she turned moving toward the bedroom with maud when zac softly touched her hand she halted the old man assuming a sacrastic air whispered something in her ear and soon afterwards she went on to join her companion

then zac made his exit

the two friendsâmrs woodhouse and maud fairleyâwere bending over various pieces of clothing scattered here and there upon the floor and out of the chaotic jumble endeavouring to put things in order when carl entered he had been about the garden all the afternoon chasing the little gay butterflies on gilded wings and flitting about with the busy bees trying to imprison them as they buried themselves in the calices of wild flowers as twilight approached he had secured a dozen or so of the fireflies perfectly satisfied with his rambles he now came in to nestle in his mothers arms and to learn the lessons of love that he delighted to hear fall from her lips

good evening miss maud said he approaching the lady and extending his little hand

maud took the proffered delicate hand in hers and pressed it gently while she bent and kissed the child

mrs woodhouse then drew her boy to her arms and in her turn smothered him tenderly with kisses

now dear maud she said you will please hand me that silk dress while i shall place at the bottom of my trunk also that cream satin they shall never again cover my back but must become a feast for moths

the dresses of which she spoke were extremely costly and had been made by the most renowned dressmaker of the town in them at the zenith of her prosperity she had shone like a queen and now that her sun had been clouded she resolved to condemn these possessions to eternal disuse

and where are you going to put this likeness

queried carl taking up a picture of his mother and father taken together i will keep it and wear it next to my heart so that i can always look at the face of my dear father

no my boy you shall have this instead

and his mother took up a small medallion containing a miniature portrait of her late husband and attaching it to a bit of ribbon hungit around the childs neck and carefully adjusted it under his shirt

carl smiled approvingly and gracefully thanked his mother

shall i put this in now enquired maud laying her hand upon a ball dress of white satin trimmed with fine chiffon and lace

certainly my dear it must take its place with the rest at the bottom of my trunk it was the last gift i received from burleigh and i well remember now the beaming smile that lingered on his face the day when he brought it to me and told me i was expected to eclipse everybody else in the ballroom as he had spared no pains to secure good materials and had ordered madame dore to exhibit her finest artistic taste in the work which she evidently had done ah me this dress will ever remind me of that fatal ball and of the darkest days of my life fold it neatly maud and put it here ah but waitâyou had better place this coat in first it is that in which he approached the altar with me and i deem it a most precious relic

an hour and a half elapsed and the packing was done

maud was tired after all the tedious work of readjustment and of consigning to the flames such things as were thought to be of no further use and which time had swollen into prodigious heaps she now sat down upon the bed and mrs woodhouse bending over the small table that stood in the room with her head resting on her elbow seemed wrapped in deep meditation

the shrill voice of candace however aroused her

the good gentleman is outside mistress announced the old dame

mrs woodhouse knew at once who were her visitors and rising quickly went out to receive them

maud followed and in a few seconds found herself face to face with the only man she loved who greeted her with a warmth that lent colour to the rumours current about the town

mrs woodhouse was very pleased to see her friends and soon a general conversation began touching the occurrence of the afternoon of which zac had brought the information the causes which led up to the incident could not be ascertained from either lindsay or hugh the laconic explanation that hugh gave was simple i have been vilified by that infamous rogue mc intyre and have given him his deserts

whatever else there might have been lay buried in his breast

slave to no sect who takes no private road but looks through nature up to natures god

pope

good night parson said the professor as the minister extended his hand toward him a genial smile resting on his face mr fairley was evidently in the best of moods and seemed for once to curb his prejudice against the noted parson whom he considered an emissary of the devil and who was in his opinion engaged in sowing tares among the wheat in his field of toil

this unexpected change in the clergymans demeanor impressed seriously the wily and experienced ethiopian and he immediately resolved to adopt a certain line of tactics to cope with the requirements of the situation

you know your latin and greek mr parson

thought he and can tell me what street theon most frequented and what was the colour of his favorite tunic how julius caesar escaped drowning when he swam the tiber how many stars are in gods firmament and what kind of people live in them and such like learned stuff but i have my senses and i use them well i study the great book of nature all men and things are leaves i turn them over carefully and with greater observation than you take with the thing you call learning i pile experience upon experience till i get a solid mountain of knowledge which is more substantial than your airbubbles the labour of men like me cut out the road on which you walk easily ah mr parson you may fry me for a fool but you will lose all your fat

i am happy to see you looking so well zac said mr fairley but may i ask if your soul is as healthy as your body seems to be

thank you sir thank you sir for the interest you take in me i am sorry that it is not for times are bad and leather is scarce and zac with a grave and solemn countenance held up one of his boots to the ministers gaze

i mean your inward soul your spirit the energy which inspires your actions

spirit sir i am not inspired by any at all for i will swear that i have not tasted anything strong today

dont be a jackass you will make me lose my temper sir

i never intended to be one sir nor have i any wish to enter your society i accept your valuable advice as the fruit of your experience and will not be a jackass

a truce to your insolence old man now come be a rational being and answer the question i shall put to you do not spoil your wit by making it obnoxious

were you not baptised

i do not know sir for certain

why did not your parents have you christened in your infancy zac you astonish me

i have heard that they did

did you not say that you did not know

i did

and why did you lie

i did not lieâi told the truth my people told me i was christened this is a matter of faith i can believe them as well as not but i only know what i am myself conscious of and cannot rely on what i have heard

where were you born

on a silk cotton bed

i mean what country gave you birth

my mother gave me birth

where did you live when you came into the world

i believe it was in a house

well if ever there was a madman you are one

tell me my man in what country your mother gave birth to you

in jamaica sir

in what year were you born

leap year sir

i dont mean the kind of yearâi mean the time

i cannot say remember nothing about that

youre asking me questions which i cannot answer

how do all sane persons know their ages

they can do as they please that is nothing to me

i speak that alone which i know

do you know that you are not respecting your minister by your rudeness  david says touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm 

yes sir but david spoke of the man whom god sent and not those who heard the wrong call david meant the men who sacrificed their happiness to make men better and walked with publicans and sinners im sure the wise old man didnt mean those avho borrow the parsons robe to make themselves rich and live in luxury no he was inspired and do you not think he knew what sort of being it was who should reign in the new kingdomâa man so poor that he had to catch a fish to find in its mouth the money wherewith to pay the tax of caesars government

oh zac you are becoming intolerable and blasphemous it seems to me that you have some animus against me if so i must decline having any further conversation with you and postpone the inquiry i intended to make

i am not against you sir but i must say what i think i am from the brave zulu race with no mixture

i fear no man if i did how could i worship the great being to whom alone all homage is due and of whom you white men have taught me such beautiful things

though you think i look like a monkey in this black skin i dont care a jot look here sir i think it much better to have a black skin than black tricks my appearance will some day change into the brightness of the stars of the morning according to the blessed book but where will those ugly tricks which your race have been practising for so many hundred years bring you ah my godâinto utter darkness i know the traditions of our great zulu people and i know their nature they are mild constant full of noble courage and affection but stormy as hell when they riseâexcuse me parsonâso the old man gets hot sometimes

i didnt mean to blaspheme though time is going

let me hear what you have to say

as the last words fell from zacs lips his countenance which had hitherto been as strong and fierce as if set in marble now completely changed and a pleasant smile played about his mouth this was induced by a certain consciousness that he had disappointed the minister who had underrated his abilities and whose chagrin was now evident by his frowning lips and wrinkled brow

it was but too true that mr fairley had eagerly desired to have a friendly teteatâte with zac on a matter in which he was interested and zac by intuition realized this the wily clergyman into whose vocabulary the word beaten did not seem to have entered now made a bold attempt by putting the question

there is a rumor that mr mc intyre has been waylaid and beaten by mr highfield my informant said that you knew all about the matter is the affair reported correctly or not

glory be to god correct sir as correct as moriah

then i am disappointed in mr highfield it is certainly not in accordance with the spirit of his profession as a minister of the gospel to resort to such scandalous methods of adjusting matters he might have waited wellâahâsince he has not found it beneath his dignity to blackguard himself in that way i may as well believe mrs woodhouse accompanies mr

highfield you say remarkable

rev mr fairley had necessarily to stop short his conversation with zac as george mc intyre knocked at the study door

very well come in mr mc intyre was his greeting then turning to the professor he continued i am quite finished with you zac you may go now

thank you sir good evening

as zac came towards the door his gaze fell upon mc intyre who would have preferred to have been a mile away rather than meet once more the withering gaze of those condemning eyes w thich seemed to shoot fire at him

as zac retraced his steps homeward he mused well well there is something at the bottom of all this you never see smoke without fire he may as well believe what remarkable that mistress should leave with mr highfield why the wise parson betrays himself to simple foolish zac and mores the pity he doesnt know it pooh pooh by moses and the lambâmore treachery heaped on o heaven pour down the thunders on that son of belial that prince of hell that accursed and uncircumcised dog

one gaze againâone long last gaze adieu fair france to thee

the breeze comes forth she is alone on the unconscious sea

mary queen of scots

parting  what a sad reality is this what anguish of soul and sorrow inexpressible overwhelms us at the thought of being severed perhaps forever from those loving hearts with which we have always associated and with whom our very lives seem to be linked by the conditions surrounding our early youth and cemented by the sweet affection which the hand of time has rendered wellnigh indissoluble it is then that the floodgates of human sympathy burst asunder with the might of a current of emotion indescribable wild terrific venting itself in a torrent of tears that pour down blanched and saddened cheeks and as we raise our pinions to fly toward the distant haven where may be found conditions more congenial to our temporal advancement we look back sadly and reverently upon the spot we once called home then everything seems to grow more attractive and lovely and as these things stand out in pathetic silence seeming to bid eternal farewell we turn away the lingering glance utter a silent prayer muse philosophically upon the unstability of human existence then cast our burdens upon the kind providence that directs the course of our destiny

edith woodhouse felt all of these emotions as she stood upon the pier with her little son by her side ready to embark on board the schooner alice while lindsay maud zac and candace were prominent among the small circle of friends who had gathered to say goodbye they were anxiously awaiting hugh who did not however keep them long in suspense for he soon appeared walking at a rapid pace toward the party with a smile upon his face he saluted them and then turning toward his friend lindsay he said with a contemptuous laugh you know what i have left behind me oscar its all over now ilorii soit qwi mat y pense you will of course apprise me of developments and of how my friends bruises get on

indeed i will nor shall i cease to think of you in the connection by which you have avenged your honor

mrs woodhouse who was in a deep and earnest conversation with candace and zac looked up with astonishment as lindsays last words fell upon her ears

zac seemed also much concerned but surpressed his emotions

there was little time left for many words the boatman had unfastened his boat from the pier and in a hoarse stentorian voice was announcing his eagerness to be away condace fell upon carls neck and kissed him eagerly

i will neber see you again my own chile but may de blessing of de lard res upon you and bring you back to you country safe again only how me heart bleed my my dis is what mars burleigh wife and chile come to  its better i didnt live to see dis

the affectionate old creature was frantic with grief and she wrung her hands in wild despair zacs emotion was not less and as mrs woodhouse pressed his hands and sobbed goodbye zac may god bless you till we meet againâif not on earth in heaven the old mans tears trickled dowfi profusely and fell on his luxuriant grey beard when his grief permitted him to speak he said should you at any time want your old servant only send for him mistress

maud and oscar although touched to the core still endeavored to restrain their emotions and the sadness that marked their farewell to their friends was so deeply engraven on mrs woodhouses memory that neither time nor circumstance ever effaced the sorrow of that parting

soon the gallant alice was hoisting her anchor and lifting her sails aloft as the merry voices of the sailors rang out in some of their favorite ditties and blended with the creaking of the ships tacklings and the whirr of the heavy anchor as it gradually rose from the sea

captain dalrymple was a jolly fellow a trustworthy seaman and a navigator of exceptional ability he enjoyed the confidence of all who travelled with him and his kindly disposition had rendered him extremely popular one of the first things he did when the alice was under weigh was to pay special attention to mrs

woodhouse andcarl he offered them his own stateroom but mrs woodhouse preferred to remain on deck so the good captain handed over to her his doghouse while carl and highfield were provided with excellent berths

as the vessel distanced the shore mrs woodhouse strained her eyes looking at the various familiar objects that were fast disappearing from view carl retired to rest after having been a trifle seasick and hugh was lying meditating in his birth alone therefore silent and sad the melancholy widow sat brooding over her past and speculating on the future which loomed ominous and dark

things went on tolerably well for the first day and a half but on coming under the lee of the french island of guadaloupe a dead calm stopped the progress of the ship it was monotonous to linger there the captain and crew became impatient as the ship rolled to and fro like an imprisoned monster in the throes of unutterable agony the expansive limitless unfathomable ocean seemed majestic in its tranquil and mysterious stillness asâcontrasted with its severer moods when with appalling fury the breakers rise mountain high and bear upon their foaming crests the helpless trembling bark that staggers to and fro at the mercy of their wild caprice

carl did not however seem much troubled about the monotony he was preoccupied watching mother carys chicks swarm around the vessel and as the gay little birds picked up the crumbs which he continually threw to them he became more and more delighted mrs

woodhouse sat upon the deck with her bible on her lap listening to the flapping of the sails and the noise of the booms while the alice tacked here and there anxious to catch a breeze hugh was whiling away the hours conversing on nautical matters with the genial experienced captain twilight came and went and the moon began to look down solemnly upon the restless bark on the bosom of the vast deep a melancholy shade passed over the face of mrs woodhouse and she seemed enrapt in grave thought captain dalrymple spoke kindly to her and did his best to dispel any unpleasant sensation that she might be experiencing

what ails you mrs woodhouse asked hugh coming toward her you seem rather sad this evening

i cannot help being sad mr highfield i have very gloomy forebodings of impending evil i do not know why such a feeling has crept over me and entirely dampened my spirit but i am almost positive that something is going to happen to us before long do you remember how i explained to you my feeling a little previous to my husbands death there is now a recurrence of this feeling it seems to me as if i have a natural unaccountable instinct within me which always warns me of misfortune

god forbid that any further calamities should happen to rou than those which have already embittered your life you must not give way to these sad apprehensions that make you so unhappy we are under the merciful care of a kind providence who will not fail to protect us have you not firmly clung to him who by his mystic voice charmed the roaring billows into gentle sleep then do not despair though the waters rage his voice will yet wdiisper to the troubled element peace be still cast your burden upon the most high and he will bring you out of the night of sorrow to look upon the mom of radiant joy

raising her mournful eyes the widow answered you are very kind and good mr highfield and i shall always feel myself indebted to you for the consolation that you have given me from the treasurehouse of gods holy word

it is my duty as a man to extend to you my protection which i will certainly not fail to do and it is my mission to dispense to you the comfort which our holy religion offers be of good cheer you will soon learn to forget your misfortune and as your boy advances in life he will restore your smiles and labor to supply your every want

thank you thank you mr highfield heaven will repay your goodness

a slight breeze struck the water and caused a sudden stir while the alice relieved awhile from the charm which had kept her spellbound moved steadily on a dark cloud crept over the face of the moon and the mate sang out to captain dalrymple

see signs of a fierce battle tonight sir

yes tom i agreeâwe are going to have some weather keep your eyes out whats that a sail

the mate took the telescope and looking through it descried on the horizon a sail coming toward them

yes sir he replied appears to be a sailing boat

must be bound for montserrat

itll have a hard time i guess squall ahead boys

mrs woodhouse you had better retire at once dont get sprinkled

edith at once turned into her quarters drawing carl with her highfield was too adventurous to be alarmed at an approaching squall so he remained on deck eager to tender his assistance to the crew in case they needed it a few minutes and the ship was riding majestically on a fastflowing sea and quickening her onward pace

stand fast to those halliards shouted the captain

lower your flying jib off there heave to

these orders were echoed by the mate and borne to the farthest limit the squall did not last so long as was expected however it contrived to give the alice a march on of a few knots then everything became once more as calm and serene as possible

it was now about eleven oclock and all had long since retired to sleep except the captain and a sailor who stood at the helm the sail which they had espied bore down upon them until they could see that it was an ordinary sailing boat in a shorter time than they imagined the boat was within speaking distance of the ship and captain dalrymple shouted out in a friendly voice where are you bound to

just a minute capn and youll understand returned a rough voice

and before the captain had time to collect his thoughts two ruffians wearing long beards threw themselves from the boat and rushed on the deck of the vessel the more bulky of the two seized the captain and had him thoroughly gagged while the other did the same to the unfortunate mate at the helm both of the ruffians held revolvers over their victims who were almost dead with fright

now capn said the big fellow you neednt be afraidâif you will only do what we want first of all do not resist keep your dând self quiet and only let us know w there that queen of sheba isâi mean that woman you call woodhouse stonehouse or the devil knows what kind of house if you do so you are free if not youre a dead man

the captain attempted to resist but it was of no use he was too firmly manacled he gasped for breath and tried to bawl out but this he found impossible he delayed betraying the whereabouts of the unfortunate woman whom the villains were determined to kidnap thinking that some one might turn up to his assistance

but no every soul on the ship was indulging in quiet sleep even the next hand who was to take the rudder at the stroke of eight bells was also w tooing morpheus as ardently as any other it was a tall slim fellow who secured the mate and bound him to the wheel of the rudder the poor fellow struggled with all the strength of his being but in vain

the captain with a heavy sigh directed the attention of the ruffians toward the doghouse where slept soundly carl and his mother for the child did not leave her that night after having been threatened with a loaded revolver the captain was bound to the mainmast as a punishment for his reluctance and the trouble he had given

the unfortunate woman and her son were dragged from their restingplace by these cruel men who lowered the ships boat placed their victims in it then got in themselves and rowed toward their boat which had drifted some distance away all this had been done in an exceedingly short time

when shortly after the morning soon broke the boat with the pirates was nowhere to be seen

you will not throw me overboard will you have you no pity for a frail womans tears ah heavens

what have i done that thy harsh judgment should thus pursue me i do not know you good menâi have never seen your faces before but i know that you have hearts throbbing within you which will not permit you to wantonly destroy the life of a woman who has never done you harm think for a moment of your mothers

do you not remember their love to you if you do you will i am sure think a thousand times before you drown me has no womans gentle hands lingered caressingly on your brow when you had a fever or when your hard days work made you tired and you went to her suffering from a headache if you were ill my womanly instincts would impel me to watch over you and tend youâif you had no one else to do it for you

oh think of this and spare me

no use talking my lady the thing must be done and if the old nick stands at the door you must spend your night down there said the thin sinewy rogue pointing to the fearful expansive ocean over which the boat was swiftly gliding

will you be so hard only spare me and i will be your slave

mamma said carl what do you say i would rather see you die than be this wicked mans slave

dont be afraid i am not afraid to die does not christ remain with us in death as well as in life

these spirited words of carl imbued mrs woodhouse with a sense of fearlessness as far as she herself was concerned death was no terror to her but she wanted to save her child from the terrible and untimely end that threatened him now that she had ample evidence that with heroic courage worthy of any son of demetrius and with stern christian fortitude he was perfectly prepared to face death she felt satisfied and awaited the inevitable

you wont stay long to give much more of your impertinence was the brutal comment so you may amuse yourself as much as you like for the short space of time you have left

the burly pirate who had all this time kept silent now spoke

look here dick we will not throw the woman overboard but we will send her adrift in the boat we took from the schooner i tell you man her words have pierced my heart and i couldnt bear to see her die under my eyes after all that pleading

oh man dont make a baby of yourself

never mind dick what i say must be done

the heartless dick had to submit to the desire of his companion who was none other than our acquaintance hawkie and agreed that mrs woodhouse should be placed in the schooners boat and turned adrift she wept bitterly and imprinted a long loving kiss on her childs lips

oh carlâmy darling carlâwhat illstarred mortals are we since it is thus that we must part may god be merciful to us and may the saviour guide our souls into his eternal presence my child my childâ adieu until we meet in a lovelier world

she again clasped the boy in her arms and kissed him tenderly dick ray brusquely parted them and deprived mrs woodhouse of a massive gold ring on which her initials were beautifully engraved then placing his hand upon the frail woman he bade her prepare for her fate the small boat was put out and in it she was placed with six loaves of bread and a bottle of water this merciful provision was made at the suggestion of hawkie

under the soft glowing light of the moon the little craft unmanned sat upon the crest of the waters with its solitary passenger who awaited patiently her awful doom as the boat glided on toward its unknown destination the woman strained her eyes to catch a last glimpse of her child but ah the crisis of her grief was reached when she saw poor carls tender body cast out into the sea by the hands of the foul villain dick ray

nature could endure no more and edith woodhouse sank senseless to the bottom of the boat

be still thou seabird with thy clanging cry my spirit sickens as thy wings sweep by

mrs hemans

a good breeze sprang up and the alice drifted considerably out of her course when watch came to relieve the mate at the helm he was staggered at the scene that met his eyesâthe mysterious situation of the captain and his mate the first thing the sailor did was to release them after which he was soon put in possession of the terrible incidents of the past night

the description of the pirates was given but there was no clue that might lead to identification

the whole ship was startled at the ill news of the kidnapping of mrs woodhouse and her son highfield was at first frantic with rage then suddenly became calm and began to weep like a child he could do nothing to remedy the evil

they are good enough to die poor creatures said captain dalrymple better they than i because i am weighed down with iniquity i tell you sir i myself narrowly escaped being choked to death or having a bullet sent through my brain by one or other of the villains

no other unusual incidents happened during the continued voyage of the alice the captain according to his accustomed habit kept under the lee of the lovely chain of islands that rose one after the other out of the caribbean waters a voyage of five days and a half brought the seafarers to their destination

it was with intense relief that the passengers and crew of the alice hailed the first glimpses of spires and the beaming grey hills that appeared to their view as the schooner neared the harbor of port of spain

our voyage has been a most adventurous one said hugh to the captain as he stood before the mirror in his stateroom adjusting his neckcloth

yes certainly sir and such a one as i should not like to see again i am an old salt and have fought many battles with fiercer seas than you experienced during this voyage but i have never had my spirit cowed or my blood thrilled as they were by the voice of that poor woman whom those beasts of hell kidnapped for reasons i cannot guess poor creaturesâthink of their carcasses having been eaten by fishes i dont know sir but i have a mind there is something very nasty at the bottom of this thing and i fancy we are going to make some discovery sooner or later you see sir the scamps wanted nothing else but the woman and her son they never looked for any valuables aboard the ship i would rather they had broken into my chest and taken all i had than to have taken away those poor people i believe sir the rogues had a special object in view

the captain laid great stress upon the last words making a wistful movement of the head and pointing gravely with the index finger of his right hand

hugh did not reply but earnestly looked into the captains stern countenance on which were printed the indelible marks of deep experience and worldly knowledge he was wrapt in deep thought as a result of which he unceremoniously turned away from the captain with newtonian absentmindedness knitted his brow and snapped his fingers captain dalrymple was astonished and he left off buttoning his waistcoat to watch the peculiar movements that hugh was exhibiting as he noticed drops of perspiration profusely pouring down the young mans face he could not but fancy that he had discovered some important link in the curious concatenation of the kidnapping affair

the harbourmaster soon arrived so that there was no time to enter into further conversation the whole ship was astir from stem to stern those who were engaged in getting up their baggage were now rushing forward to answer the formal questions put to them by the revenue officer

it did not take captain dalrymple much time to settle his business with the officer who returned to the shore in his little skiff

hugh was among the first of the passengers to place his feet once more on his dear native isle and he breathed a sigh of relief as he found himself seated in the train puffing a cigar and once more holding in his hand a copy of the port of spain gazette he was on his way home to st joseph and as each scene once more familiarised itself to his ardent gaze he could not help giving utterance to spasmodic ejaculations nor could he refrain from quoting scotts lines breathes there a man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said this is my own my native land

that night as he sat down to tea with his only brother and a few intimate friends who had come to welcome him he appeared absorbed in deep meditation despite his repeated efforts to make himself jovial to his friends his usual buoyancy of spirit was lacking and he failed to produce the brilliant flashes of wit and humor which his companions delighted to listen to he naturally put the best forward and did all in his power to create the impression that nothing extraordinary occupied his thoughts he flattered himself that he had scored a victory in the art of dissembling and took comfort therefrom but he was mistaken his genius in endeavoring to present the spurious for the genuine utterly failed and all present felt satisfied that the pleasant and witty hugh had some secret absorbing his mind his ordination as deacon took place shortly after his arrival and he was sent as curate under rev

mr drayton of st patrick parish there he proved a valuable and energetic assistant displaying in his contact with his parishioners noble christian virtues and manly straightforwardness which endeared him to all in no small degree

his ready smile a parents warmth expressed their welfare pleased him and their cares distressed to them his heart his love his griefs were given but all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven

several years after his elevation to the priesthood canon highfield was sent to a remote district in the country to take up the cure of the parish of st

michaels the place was neglected and both energy and physical activity were necessary to bring it up to a proper standard

the canon was one of those who believed that the salvation of mens souls is certainly of greater moment than meaningless controversies over forms of creeds or ceremonies he sought out the people of all denominations and carried the sunshine of the gospel into their hearts and homes catholic or protestant it mattered little to him his mission was to reveal to his brethren christ and the scheme of salvation much of the nimbus that surrounded christianity he considered was born of conceit and selfishness which tended more to foster disunity than to promote the bonds of holy brotherhood this fundamental principle he never lost sight of and ever carried into his daily ministrations he kept a school for the purpose of imparting sound knowledge to the youths around and the fruit his efforts bore from year to year was incalculable

it was a lovely afternoonâwhen the western sky was radiant with a splendor indescribable reflecting its brilliant rainbow hues upon the verdant hills and temporarily gilding the windowpanes of clustered houses in goldâthat rev canon highfield more bent to raise the wretched than to rise bestrode his favorite pony an iron grey of imposing beauty and proceeded toward the remote district of x the ride was a pleasant one now uphill now downdale through forests of theobroma cacao relieved here and there by open savannahs where horses mules and donkeys grazed lazily on luxuriant plots of grass or by silvery rills echoing their monotonous murmurs as they flowed steadily along on their everlasting course

a distant noise fell upon the clergymans ear he stopped to listen and charlie the pony also felt interested as he pricked his ears and awaited his masters directions

this way charlie said the parson turning the horses head in the direction from which the sound appeared to come

canon highfield was soon gazing at a scene of which he had often heard but never before witnessed it was a celebration in memory of the death of a prominent individual usually called the eighthday wake

a throng of people was assembled about a dingy hovel which one would hardly have believed to have been the residence of a spaniard who owned over nine hundred and twenty acres of cocoa plantation which broke him a splendid annual revenue around this queer apology for a house there were in evidence the vendors of cakes fruits and sweetmeats the indiscriminate distribution of the coarsest rum which was quaffed in large quantities caused the brain of many to burn with frenzy and elicited from them gestures and antics that seemed to argue in favor of darwins theory of the simian origin of mankind an old woman sat upon a stone a few yards from the hut smoking a dirty clay pipe while a few gay damsels danced around with all the characteristic hilarity of unhampered youth

the noise and hubbub were almost unbearable and the clergyman felt a sickening sensation creep over him as the air which was charged with the unpleasant odour of rum and tobacco saluted his olfactory organs

he passed into the house where he observed a welllighted room wherein burned innumerable tapers the principal object of attraction was an improvised altar on which were several images and floral decorations

upon a bed that stood near and which presented a very clean and tidy appearance was laid a crucifix with lighted tapers surrounding it while by the bedside knelt a beautiful girl of about fourteen summers reading prayers from a missal she held in her hand

the intruding clergyman could not help admiring the girl whom he thought worthy in every way of her noble ancestry the sisters of the sun who existed in the era of the peruvian incas

rita for such was the name of the maiden did not appear in any way disturbed by the appearance of the english parson for she soon rose from her kneeling posture and struck up in a melodious voice a hymn in spanish those who were present took up the strain and soon the jarring and confusing notes that fell upon the ear made one think of bedlam

it was indeed a pleasant relief when this babel ceased and the calm impassioned sweet voice of rita alone rang out enchantingly on the air her superb tones commanded the attention of all present the hymn she sang was as follows o mi dios que a los apostoles das la paz siempre dichosa tu resurrection gloriosa anunciandoles asi haz que me alma resucite conti go a la eterna vida y dame esa paz querida que solo se encuentra en ti 

el mundo no la conoce

el mundo mas bien encierra turbacion discordia guerra odios envidiar y rencor

a ti pues vengo a pedirla que la diste a tantos otros haz que siempre con nosotros se la paz del seãor

she ceased her song and a solemn silence ensued

her hymn had inspired a thoroughly religious sentiment among the audience which was augmented as the girl recited in a clear and sympathetic tone the paternoster in her own tongue the devotion ended for the time being the people began to withdraw from the room rita turned apologetically to the canon a smile beaming on her countenance

buenas noches padre said she

buenas noches hijita replied the canon

you have come to pay us a visit sir continued rita we love you good padre as much as we do our own and we bid you welcome bien venito padre

bien venito

thank you senorita for your kind welcome i feared that i had intruded but i now feel that i was fortunately mistaken

no no how can you intrude upon us though you do not pray to the good virgin as we do and to all the blessed saints in heaven you teach us of the great father who made all menâof his holy son who died to redeem all i once heard you preach when i was staying in your parish at the house of a good old friend and i came home and cried because father barrett told us that all who were not catholics were damned i felt so miserable to think that a man who spoke such nice things should go to hell but carlito read to me from his bible and made me change my opinion according to gods word

i am glad you have changed your opinion hijita

who is this person that has been so good as to enlighten you on such important matters

carlito senor padreâcarlito whom my father used to call hijo de la mar and whom i love more than any one else on earth

and what is his real name

carlito de la mar only

where is he now i should like to find him you prize so much

he will be soon here he went out a few moments ago i am sure you will love him dear padreâhe is kind and brave and good and as handsome as can be

as she finished the subject of the conversation between the loquacious maiden and the canon entered the apartment he gave a smile and a gentle bow to the stranger then advancing toward rita he stood by her side and whispered in her ear rita retired a moment and when she returned she found carlito and the canon engaged in an interesting conversation

so you said your father died lately and you arc left an orphan in the world

these were the enquiring words addressed to carlito which fell upon ritas ears as she reappeared

si senor chimed in rita he has no motherâ she died many years agoâand my father took him

so we grew up together as children and found all the happiness this earth can give in each others company

my father used to tell me that carlito has a strange historyâshe smiled gailyâbut he never told me what it was and i never insisted upon knowing i am quite happy with what i know about my carlito and i fear that i may become unhappy by any further knowledge they say that all women are curious but i stamp down my curiosity that i may not run any dangerous risk of loving carlito less that would be like losing my life im sure if i found any serious flaw in him i would die there is an old man in the village who knows as much of him as my father did

he is an old sailor named francisco verde but i have never asked him anything about the dear boy because i know my father would have been angry

carlito blushed deeply as his fair companion spoke so freely and flatteringly about him to the genial minister there was no doubt that he had a historyâand a very romantic one tooâbut time had effaced many memories and there had only lingered some dim impression of early trouble which had gradually lost its importance through the association of happier circumstances

this carlito was a lad of fifteenâstately handsome and refinedâwho spoke little but thought much and in keeping with his natural taciturnity he often chid rita for her continual prattling although he loved her ardently

the canon was delighted with his new friends he was in the best of moods and spoke to them lovingly so that he at once made inroads on their hearts inviting a respectful familiarity and dispensing with the obsequiousness so often demanded by those who wear the cloth there was a wonderful inexplicable and mysterious affection that spontaneously seemed to spring up between carlito and himselfâa feeling for which neither could account and which each felt would be productive of good fruit

filled therefore with joy and satisfaction the good canon took his leave promising to return as soon as opportunity offered

still doomed in sad suspense to bear the hope that keeps alive despair

canon highfield had many things to think of when he reached his home the array of thoughts that had occupied him as he rode slowly by moonlight toward the rectory was somewhat interrupted by the good news that the mail had arrived a day before it was expected and that a heap of letters and newspapers on the study table were awaiting his perusal his correspondence from the island of x soon engaged his attention it was a land where he had made sterling friends a land which he entertained a mixed recollection of joy and sorrow a land where the sympathies of his kindly nature had been for the first time ardently aroused in support of the cause of the widow and orphan

ever since his holiday trip to that lovely isle hugh highfield had been kept cun courant with the general condition of affairs there and each mail that brought him news caused his face to lighten with joy or darken with sorrow according to the kind of information that he received he took up from the table a letter which he saw to be in the handwriting of his friend and quondam host oscar lindsay it read as follows the grove island of xâ th march â

my dear highfield your last brought with it its accustomed pleasure and the news you gave about yourself is highly gratifying maud and i are looking towards the day when you may seek repose from your arduous labors at our home and hearth in this dear little island where nature unfolds her loveliness to enchant the soul where the rich skies in their azure beauty still await your genius to transfer them to canvas where the moonbeams seem to kiss more lovingly the things of earth and where the air is laden with the fragrance of jasmine and lilies which used so much to delight you and stirred your poetic soul with ardour

things in general continue in much the same way except that i am the father of another bouncing baby boy which brings up the sum total to four

i know it will give you pain to hear of the death of old candace

it is a wonder she lived so long after her unexpected shock i think i mentioned in a previous letter that she had a paralytic stroke after hearing of the fate of mrs woodhouse and her son

from that moment she never rose from her sick bed until the hand of death kindly removed her from the stage the poor soul lived lovingly and died happily my wifeâwho by the way is a real sister of mercyâwas unremitting in her attention to the invalid

the deceased always spoke of carl and his mother and hoped they were safely at rest kind dear soul

professor zac still continues in his mysterious vocation and though everything points to the conclusion that his mistress and her child have long ago been embosomed in the sea he never thinks of losing hope but continually repeats the sad expression which so startled you in your first intercourse with him when the white dove no longer sits upon the wall the dark lantern will shine to draw the fox from his hole the bones from the earth and give back virtue and order to elmsdale curious old chap isnt he instead of diminishing his wit seems to grow daily he has access to my law books and is studying for the bar he says

i have never met with a negro of such an extraordinary and varied personalityâbuffoon wit philosopher all in one his craving for knowledge has not ceased one whit

mc intyre is in the zenith of prosperity his health occasionally is disturbed by insomnia he wields the scepter of his power furiously

there is hardly anything left to interest you so i must bid you adieu

warmest regards from better half and little ones

yours sincerely oscar

as canon highfield finished the missive and replaced it on the table he propped his head with both hands and appeared to think deeply he sighed for some moments tears stole down his cheeks soon afterward he turned to the rest of his correspondence but there was nothing to interest him as had oscar lindsays letter the clock had just announced that it was past midnight and high time for all honest folks to be in bed so he left off toying with the newspapers before him and retired to rest

hugh highfield tossed wearily upon his bed and could not sleep for his mind was filled with anxious thoughts about his former friends the news which lindsays letter brought was of very great interest and carried him back to the good old days when he enjoyed old zacs flow of wit listened to candaces funny expressions and admired her kind and sympathetic acts for although he was so far removed from them he had always felt the keenest interest in them

so the old crank still believes his prophecy will come true he mused well i never but there is a curious coincidence between the news of zacs persistent belief in the restitution of young woodhouse and his mother and what has been weighing upon my mind since my return from that fetish scene it is possible that the boy may have been rescued from a watery grave but how can it be captain marry at may create a schriften in his romance but such things do not happen in real life it is almost incredible nevertheless i shall interest myself and make further enquiries did not the girl say his name is carlito well this is but the graceful diminutive that the castilian language would give to the english name carl she said he has a strange history and that her father used to affix the words de la mar to the name i know mar is spanish means sea and de la are the preposition and the article equivalent to of the the interpretation of the whole name would therefore be carl of the sea there is naturally some connection between the boy and the sea his complexion seems to be darker than that of the child i know and that scar across the face puzzles me but it is possible that the effects of a warmer climate might produce a slight change in the cuticle and the mark may have been the result of an accident

fool i was not to have discovered this key before i shall seek out the mystery at once ill call upon the man verde as soon as i get an opportunity and see what information he can give me

having thus thought out his plans the worthy cleric fell asleep

leave me j thou comest between my heart and heaven

i would be still in voiceless prayer to diel why must our souls thus love and then be riven

return the parting wakes mine agony

oh yet awhile delay

mrs hemans

silent sad pensively musing over some sorrow which lay deep in her heart sat rita under the branches of an immortelle tree a few yards from her home as the soft light of evening fell upon her dark brown face she appeared like some charming princess of the arabian nights mourning over the cruel fate of her enchanted lover then as if she could no longer control the current of thought that was passing through her mind she spoke audibly oh i shall die if he leaves me he is all that i have upon earth now that my poor father is dead and what shall i do if he holds to what he has said oh will not my love keep him from what his high mind urges him to do we can live and love together and spend our young days happily because i have enough wealth for us both but he says he must go out in the wide wojld to become wise it is francisco verde who has filled his mind with his foolish tales i wish i had never known him and that he had never taught us to read about don quixote and his valet sancho panza for it is only since carlito has got so intimate with him that he has wanted to leave me he has been so noble and loving and now with one sudden blow he breaks my heart oh i see i see too lateâhe never truly loved me or he could not be so unkind

yes darling i love you dearly how can it be otherwise my own sister whispered a voice behind her

rita looked back half ashamed and annoyed with herself for having betrayed her feelings and her bright eyes filled with passion fell upon carlito

 carlito i have been very weak but forgive me

she cried i cannot help thinking that you do not love me since you have made up your mind to leave me alone in the world

carlito felt a torrent of emotion swelling within him and he knelt down and imprinted a kiss upon the soft velvety lips of the maiden

take this and believe that i love you still as dearly as ever although i must leave you darling for your own good you are rich and will get some one to marry you i am too poor and must go out to seek my fortune and gain wisdom i am tired listening to the history of old spain and have no more pleasure in hearing of don quixote and dulcinea del tobosa or of boabdil y los moros i want to be a wise and good man and i cannot be if i remain here always

 cruel cruel cruel carlito i never thought you were so cruel and rita sobbed bitterly

nay not cruel you will soon forget your sorrow at our parting and when you become yourself again you will regret you were so unwise as to cling so much to a poor orphan like me who has not a penny in the world

do not speak so to me if it is my riches from which you run then i shall part with all and become poor like you so that you may never leave me

do you really mean this my rita

as god reigns above she spoke reverently slowly deliberately and called upon heaven to register the oath at this moment continued she i would destroy my fathers will it is in my power to do so since i have it in my possession

but you are his nearest of kin and his fortune would still be yours

then i would give up all claims for your sake

as these words carlito looked tenderly into her eyes and read there the sincerity of the words that thrilled his soul the feelings that overpowered him were such as he had never experienced before he had been accustomed to look on rita as a sister a playmate a friend but now those tear dimmed eyes whose electric influence suddenly transfixed him to the spot where he stood those last words spoken by the tender girl with so much earnestness and sincerity that brow now darkened by unmistakable marks of bitter sorrow all inspired him with an ardent devouring flaming passion

the fond sister was to him changed into a peerless queen of extraordinary beauty demanding his homage and romeo could not have felt deeper emotion when he entered the presence of his beloved juliet than did he at that moment

my loving rita he said passionately how could i have been so cruel as to taunut you so much and he pressed her to his breast and kissed her fevered brow tenderly and passionately rita i shall never love any one else as i love you and though we cannot marry now as we are both too young i shall give you this token to show you that i mean what i say it has never left my neck since it was placed there and now i shall put it on yours

he took the medallion containing a miniature portrait from his neck and placed it around ritas

and now my sweet he went on since i have promised you myself you know that i will keep my word but i must leave you for some time in order to secure a broader education which will make meânay both of usâhappier than we are i shall always come to see you as i shall not be far away and when we are both old enough to marry we can do so this will i am sure satisfy you wont it darling

if i know i shall always see you she innocently replied i shall not be so unhappy

then let me tell you what will make you feel better do you remember the night of the wake when the english parson came to see us and spoke so kindly to us

yes was the eager reply

well when you left us alone he offered to take me home with him and teach me all that i should like to know and i thought that was the happiest moment of my life of course i said i should be glad to go and he promised to come and see me again you must not be angry with me for not telling you this before i met the good man today at senor verdes and i have told him that la vieja matilda has given me permission to go to him

and when will you leave here carlito

as soon as i can i know you will see after my things and get them ready for me i will depend upon you

i will begin to do so at once your grey suit is looking very soiled and needs washing so i must ask la vieja to do this i myself will starch and iron your shirts so that you will look clean and nice when you go to the big people you have no money but i will get some for you so that you can buy whatever you like

i thank you very much rita for your kindness in offering me money but i shall not want any just now

i have a few shillings saved to buy some books and this is all i need i will trust mr highfield to give me all that i require i dont care about spending money on myself

whether it was the independence of carlitos character or his fear that he might put rita to some trouble to secure money for him this deponent sayeth not but he strenuously refused to accept a single farthing and was prepared to enter his new home with the small earnings he had accumulated by the labor of his own hands

la vieja matilda to whom reference was made in the course of conversation between carlito and rita was some distance off while the young people were conversing engaged in picking brushwood to keep a brisk fire under the pot of sancoche which was simmering on the fire she was an old dame of over sixty who hailed from the spanish main and had not lost the characteristics of the indian race to which she belonged her complexion was of a deep tan color her face was broad and her forehead extremely flat there was scarcely a streak of gray in the coarse black hair and to the casual observer she would have appeared twenty years younger than she really was it was she who had the charge of rita for it was the special desire of old jos  sancoche is a soup composed of various kinds of meats and vegetables cooked together and seasoned with pepper and herbs

cedeno that this should bo so she vas very much attached to her charge and would indulge her in every whim and caprice

carlito came in for a good share of her affection and she would never do anything to render unhappy the handsome pleasantfaced negrito to whom her compadre was so much attached the goodhearted creature was reluctant to part with the boy but she could never allay the ambition for learning which was devouring him and before which all other considerations were as nought she therefore with much regret permitted him to pursue his plans unmolested

poor rita had some difficulty in dispersing the unhappy thoughts that crowded upon her as she realized too truly that she would soon be severed from the darling of her heart and that she would be compelled to drag out the time drearily and wearily until he should return

during the few remaining days that carlito spent in the company of rita he had a greater insight into the depths of a womans love than he had ever thought of

all of the latent strength of a love that was in every respect genuine and flawless was now called forth by the stern exigencies that every moment seemed to make upon ritas heart it came with all its eloquence of pleading its infinite solicitude its sacrifices and complete selfimmolation in the interest of the being in whom that love was centred

carlito felt this keenly and in his heart he called heaven to witness his oath that as long as rita cedeno lived he would marry no other whether he became a croesus or remained in his poverty

but how should prospero be living and be here

canon highfield did not hesitate to seek out that important individual known as francisco verde it was not a difficult task however because the old salt was known to everybody for miles around

the canon introduced to a lean man with a face revealing strong masculinity and a frame lithe and sinewy showing the marks of great physical activity and indexing the spirit of adventurous daring a large bushy mustache partly concealed his thinly compressed lips and a closelycropped beard covered a broad square chin his eyes were mild and of a bluish cast and his mouth well formed his hair was of silvery grey and judging from his appearance he might have been from seventy to eighty years old he spoke the spanish language fluently and could also express himself very freely in english he seemed to possess an ordinary amount of education which with the infinite store of experience he had gathered from his travels placed him far above his neighbors in intelligence

francisco verde was indeed no fool but a man of excellent sense who could be relied upon for advice

he was a native of peruâa halfcaste the child of an indian mother and a portuguese fatherâand was quite familiar with the history and traditions of the mysterious aborigines of that romantic country he had been twice around the world through perils and dangers innumerable and could relate wonderful narratives of his experience with which he never hesitated to amuse the inquisitive listener as his bright eyes lighted up his shaggy wrinkled face tanned by the fierce suns of many lands

canon highfield rather liked his host and was much entertained with his brilliant conversation

can you give me any information about the boy carlito de la mar whom i met recently at the house of his late guardian jose cedeno enquired the canon

there are very few youths reared under like conditions who exhibit such intelligence as i found in him

i too am of that opinion replied don francisco

the boy has some excellent parts and genius which will make him of note in the world some day i take a great deal of interest in him since it was i who picked him up halfdead from exhaustion one night about eight years ago when we were on a return vbyage from martinique where we had just discharged a cargo of cattle

here the canon could not withstand the wave of emotion that swept over him he might have faintedâ so great was the nervous shock which don franciscos narrative produced on him at this stageâhad he not resorted to the use of his vinagrette which he customarily carried with him after a moment the clergyman regained his equilibrium and francisco continued his story

if we had not come upon this poor struggling form so soon he would surely have perished we found him clinging to a piece of board which must have formed at one time the seat of a boat i presume he must have fallen overboard from a boat we espied crossing us as captain of the vessel i ordered the boat to be lowered and the boy taken aboard he could not have been very long in the water the sea was as calm as a pond when we saw him were it otherwise i am sure he would not have been alive today don jose cedeno was on board at the time the poor child became completely unconscious a few moments after he was taken on deck and with a heart filled with goodness and pity my poor friend cedeno endeavoured with us to restore him to consciousness but to no purpose we however after hard work managed to place him on the way to recovery jose cedeno with my consent adopted him as his foster son he had much trouble with him as he remained in a state of semiidiocy for a long period until the aid of a clever french specialist in nervous diseases was requisitioned when the invalid began to improve and has made rapid progress ever since nobody ever mentioned this incident to him

the fact is you are the only living soul here in possession of this strange storyâexcept myself

was it you who gave him the name carlito that seems spanish doesnt it enquired the canon after francisco had stopped in his narrative

don jose called him so the word carl was the only name he could make out on his clothes the surname having almost disappeared and so this christian name was converted into the spanish carlito 

i see i see muttered the canon shaking his head

are you able to account for the scar which i observe across his forehead

yes this was caused by the knife of the clever french surgeon dr raoul angeron whom i saw trepanning the childs skull with my own eyes it was a horrifying sight yet from the cold selfreliant manner in which the doctor went to work i took hope and my spirit was buoyed up i can hardly tell you how i pitied the poor unfortunate child in his suffering

i am sure don francisco that dr angeron deserves credit for his brilliant operation in overcoming a disease in the treatment of which science has yet made such little progress we have some hope that when our medical men shall be able to locate definitely and manipulate freely the tissues of the brain and nervous system our lunatic asylums will have to be converted into some other institutions you see it takes time to do everything science progresses slowly and so we must be content to develop gradually until we reach the goal of perfection by sheer force of our experience

in the physical world we are all schoolboysâbe the branch what it mayâand are all struggling toward the everlasting but like the mirage it seems still to evade us as we approach the great medical profession contains many intricate problems which must be solved by man for the alleviation of the suffering of his brother man and increase his happiness

that has always been my opinion sir although i cannot put it in such words as you have done

at this moment footsteps were heard on the pavement outside and francisco rose to welcome his visitor it was carlito who had come to pay his usual visit to his friend he was surprised to find the clergyman present and expressed great pleasure at the unexpected meeting

canon highfield showed no hesitation in expressing his desire to take carlito home to his own home and educate him with the other scholars of his grammar school old francisco willingly acquiesced seeing that it would be a step of which the lad would no doubt gladly avail himself to secure his muchdesired ambition the sanction of doha matilda luces having been obtained it was agreed that carlito should be lodged under the care of the canon

as the canon bade goodbye to his amiable host and left his presence many were the thoughts that crowded on don franciscos mind he wondered over the divine elements in mans nature which give birth to love and sympathy and goodness and he concluded the world would be a thousand times better if those who have been favored with the special smile of fortune would yield to the eloquent voice of charity and stretch the helping hand to rescue from ignorance vice and irreligion their poor brother struggling in the black darkness of despair

similar thoughts connected themselves with other strange ones that were passing through the canons mind his heart was overflowing with joy as he retraced his path homeward it was indeed a reality that he had made a startling discoveryânamely that carl woodhouse whom he thought long ago to be dead was certainly alive and well and above all soon to be under his own care

reader can you imagine the good mans joy it was indescribable no words can portray its depth it was for him another lazarusâresuscitated when he reached the rectory the words which fell from his lips were a portion of old zacs prophecy the dark lantern shall shine and give back honor and virtue to elmsdale

when carlito arrived home that night he imparted to rita the news of the conference of the afternoon and resolutely reiterated his intention to leave his old home

naturally the canon did not neglect to communicate the good news to his friend lindsay with the special request that it should be kept secret at least for the time being

onward onward may we press through the path of duty virtue is true happiness excellence true beauty

minds are of celestial birth make we then a heaven of earth

carlito de la mar installed into his new home began to experience the exquisite pleasures created by the surroundings of a healthier atmosphere an utterly new life dawned upon him and he appreciated in no small degree the opportunities of progress that were now afforded him pie certainly had not thrown away his time when in the wooded heights of his late home amidst a variegated display of floral magnificence he read les fleurs de dieu seeing in each bud that burst forth the hand of a loving tender faith in each fruit that gradually developed from the parent plant a creative and sublime power above the comprehension of poor mortals and he acquired the wisdom and knowledge inseparable from the careful contemplation of mystic nature

now that he had for a time ceased to give his undivided attention to flora and fauna and to concentrate his intellectual faculties upon the study of classical literature he could look back with pleasant recollections upon the happy days spent under silvan shades when in absolute innocence he had collected much of philosophy that would prove useful to him in after life the rapid strides that he made in his studies were remarkable and canon highfield considered him a prodigy

each morning saw him rise with the crowing of the cock with book in hand on his way to some sequestered spot where he diligently poured over his lessons and the last thing he did at night was to place his books containing the lessons for the next day under his pillow in accordance with a superstitious custom in which most schoolboys have faith

carlitos intellectual advancement did not fail to impress his schoolmates and with one exception they admired him and respected his marked abilities the canons attachment grew stronger each day the good clergyman however never mentioned the extraordinary circumstances connected with the history of his charge

he had even steadfastly withheld them from his brother who was in other matters his chosen confidante and this latter gentleman had learned to look upon carlito as one of those earnest students whose peculiar abilities had recommended them to hughs benevolence

for this he commended the canon and always showed some attention to carlito although in so doing he felt that he was making some sacrifice in stepping down from his social rung

two years and six months had elapsed and carlito found himself fully competent to translate perfectly ciceros de senectute and virgils eclogues and though he had some hard work over passages in bacons novum organum he always came out victorious in the end he took great delight in translating telemaqueâarchbishop fenelons remarkable production which most schoolboys knowâand his passionate love for the french language led him to dive deep into tribolet and to gather some of the delicacies from les miserables and quatrevingttreize

one night after he and his guardian had returned from a long and tedious ride during which they had experienced much discomfort the canon persuaded him to retire without reading as he needed immediate rest

carlito of course consented to do this and meant to keep his word but after having reached his apartment and undressed he recollected that there was a problem that he had to work out for the next day and he thought there would be no harm if he spent just a short time in solving it but he was unable to concentrate his mind he drew from a coat pocket a letter which he began to read pensively it was written in spanish and ran thus my dear cablito i know you never loved me or you could not treat me so you have been so long away and only twice i have heard from you and have never seen you once though you promised when you were leaving that i would often see you i shall surely die if you continue to treat me so heartlessly and would prefer to do so because no sad thoughts will make me miserable in the grave

i remain your own true rita

this simple yet soultouching letter from his first love quite upset carlito and one by one a series of ideas piled themselves up in his mind when first he came to the parsonage the image of rita lingered on his memory for some time during which he had dreamt beautiful dreams and even anticipated a happy future when she and he would be as one never to part till death in fact he had given place in his breast to all those ecstacies which are born of deep affection but alas time and mental occupation tended to produce a lukewarm feeling and he had gradually ceased to think of the spanish maiden with the same thoughts as he had been wont to in the first flush of his attachment

he had often to chide himself for his neglect in not writing to her but consoled himself with the thought that rita would attribute this to the great lack of postal facilities this indeed was in a certain sense true but if he had exerted himself he would have found the means of communication as he leaned over the table where a shaded lamp burned dimly with his left hand supporting his forehead he mused silently

after all i could not really have loved poor rita who above all mortals deserves my warmest and deepest affection it was but the momentary vibration of a chord in my sensitive nature when she so ardently appealed to my affection that caused me to cast myself unreservedly at her feet if not why then do not those sensations which i experienced at that nevertobeforgotten moment still abide they say that youthful love is strong and irresistible

much enforced it shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again

but time and circumstance have quenched the ardent flame which has been shortlived because the material from which it was kindled was not genuine i own i possess yet a sort of love for the fair creature but it is in no way different from that which i felt when we were innocent children together the tidal wave had swept vehemently over my heart but the waters now have receded to find their level and things remain in their normal and undisturbed condition but how unkind am i how unkind towards the girl who would have sacrificed so much for my sake i cannot be less than a man of honor and integrity and though the heavens fall i will respect my vowâi will not forsake her

once again he turned to his studies but his thoughts continued to wander and he pushed the books from him

two days afterward as he was strolling amongst the flowers in the garden surrounding the rectory intensely enjoying the cool and invigorating morning air he suddenly and unexpectedly came upon a young lady whom he had often met and conversed with he was surprised for he was certainly not aware of her presence at the rectory nevertheless his slight perturbation did not prevent his lifting his hat with the usual display of easy grace and chivalry that was characteristic of him the stranger was a girl of about his own age she was tall and handsome with captivating blue eyes a commanding forehead a roman nose and full curved lips though an octaroon and the greatgranddaughter of a slave she might have passed for white her hair fell in golden clusters upon her swanlike neck still further enhancing her beauty her voice had in it a musical ring which impressed those who heard it carlito could not help being struck by her charms from the moment of his first intercourse with her

i am indeed pleased to see sappho paying her respects to flora was carlitos greeting

i am rather flattered by your remark senor de la mar though i delight in paying homage to flora i can certainly lay no claims to the mantle of sappho

your good sense and womanly modesty certainly guard you from sounding your own trumpet but your poetic genius with which i have the good fortune to be acquainted and which has been most prominent in your latest production has my dear miss highfield somewhat of sapphos melting pathos

the young girl smiled bewitchingly then said ah me were i conscious that my poetic abilities could soar to such lofty heights as those of the tenth muse in view of the generally acknowledged axiom that history repeats itself i should soon begin to grow anxious for fear lest i be unattended with the calamities which befell my fair prototype

but who would dare to be the phaon that would thwart thy love and cause thee to take the fatal leap

rest assured there can be no phaon who could possibly resist your charms

you are certainly very complimentary this morning senor de la mar but i shall not be intoxicated by your chivalrous remarks i shall attribute them to a praiseworthy element of your natureâthe desire to please but aside from this i shall be spending some months here with uncle hugh and shall have a literary companion in you and one in whom i may rely for valuable assistance in learning the language of the immortal dante i have not made as much progress as i should like but with you to help me i shall soon be able to satisfy my ardent desire to study the literature of romantic italy the centre of latin civilization i want to follow minutely the history of her famous painters sculptors and poets and to gather from her own treasurehouse the rich harvest that i earnestly seek furthermore i have an uncontrollable desire to read leo africanus

does the moor interest you miss highfield interrupted carlito

certainly his is a most entertaining history

a gleam of pleasure fell over carlitos countenance and he remarked i am glad to know that you can look away from self and lend your thoughts awhile to your darker brothers and sisters i always had an idea that you were free from the prejudice of the mulatto and this has been greatly confirmed since you have with all the energy of your poetic soul so sweetly sung of the loves of andromeda and perseus but stay miss high held do you really mean to remain so long with us

im sure your presence will be the means of making things look much livelier at the parsonage what pleases me most however is that you will add fresh impetus to my desire to study

oh i shall be pleased my dear mr de la mar if my stay here in any way enhances your pleasure

twas gold instructed cruel hearts in treacherys more pernicious arts

anon say hello melvilleâlook at that stupid bookworm

he isns fit to be alive if he should isolate himself from the rest of mankind i fancy he would feel quite happy in that condition

yes cyril thats a fact and i confess i hate him and were i to follow the dictates of my own mind at this moment id punch him through

the last words of the speaker were uttered with much emphasis and his eyes sparkled with indignation as he advanced toward the spot where carlito de la mar lay reclining on the ground engaged in translating one of the carmina of horace

you dog he thundered i will make you answer for your impertinent allusion to me which came to my ears much sooner than you expected

bertie melville look before you leap coolly replied carlito laying down his text book on the sod or you will have reason to regret your bitter words how are you metamorphosed from smiling pleasant bertie to a lions whelp impertinent to you i cannot understand the mystery i did not think my nature rendered me capable of offending the humblest of gods creatures much less one whom i have always recognised as among the most intimate of my schoolmates

i want none of your hypocritical palavering come to the scratch at once did you not say that i was a lowborn scullion and unworthy the love of mary highfield

ohâhow could you believe such a thing even though my brain were converted into a temporary whirlpool my tongue could never have taken such liberties

you are a liarâand you know that you are lying

dont indulge in such harsh epithets bertie only let me know who is the author of this falsehood

i have no right to say and further i am bound to secrecy i suppose this will save you the trouble of further protestations

and he handed to carlito a dirty piece of paper on which the words lowborn scullion unworthy of

could be made outâthe other portion not being legible

isnt this your own handwriting vociferated bertie

it is replied carlito in a moderate yet impressive tone but

he had not finished his reply when cyril who was listening to the altercation a few paces apart drawing near said something to bertie sotto voce and patted him on the shoulder but the latter in a paroxysm of rage tore himself away and like an infuriated tiger made for carlito inflicting a severe blow upon his head with a stick he held in his hand carlito made no resistance not even raising his hand against his foe

bertie took advantage of his passivity and inflicted another blow which sent poor carlito reeling on the ground bathed in blood

but the blow had only stunned carlito and when he again opened his eyes it was to see his assailant standing over him and gazing at him with that triumphant air with which a cat looks upon its trembling prey before destroying it but there was in bertie a certain change of feeling which seemed brought about by the effect of carlitos pitiful eyes as they rested upon him

it might have been either fear or shame for he turned to fly when however he had got a few paces from the scene where he had wrought such havoc he found himself suddenly grasped by cyril

what does this mean let me go cyril must i exclaim like satan w thich way i fly is hell 

no you fool have you allowed fear to take all the starch out of your collar lets out of this mopes sight and i will explain why i held you

carlito picked up the piece of paper which had fallen upon the ground while the two retired out of his sight and hearing then cyril began you did it in a masterly manner bertie and deserve all possible credit

did i replied bertie trustingly but then why did you lay hold of me when i was leaving the scene

i am beginning to feel a kind of remorse you know it may seem unmanly to you nevertheless tis true

i never thought you had so much of the woman in you my reason for stopping you in your flight was to hand you this which i saw fall from your pocket

so saying he handed bertie an official communication which the latter had taken from the post office that morning for his father dr sidney melville the medical officer of the district bertie fully knew the consequences which the loss of this very important document would have entailed and he therefore thanked cyril exceedingly in another moment he unceremoniously withdrew from cyril and started homeward as fast as his legs could carry him

meanwhile the unfortunate carlito had gained sufficient strength to stand on his feet whereupon he was soon rejoined by cyril who had only reappeared when he was certain that bertie was out of sight

what an awful and lamentable thing has happened my dear carlito he croaked assuming an air of the sincerest sympathy that vagabond bertie melville should be made to suffer for his outrage on a poor unoffending youth like you x did my best to capture him after he had wounded you but i suppose he escaped by reason of his superior strength nevertheless be sure that nemesis is at hand and will overtake the villain

carlito looked up at cyril with that calmness and suavity of expression on his features which can only characterize a lofty elevated and dispassionate soul

never mind cyril said he i cannot allow you to call my friend a villain in your anxiety to espouse my cause i must protest against such a word being used in connection with bertie melville there is a vital screw loose somewhere and when it is adjusted we shall meet again as better friends than before

maybeâor rather i hope so i shall be very sorry indeed if your misadventure prevents you from attending the examination we feel certain that you will win the prize for that essay on the french revolution the examiner mr bridgewater has promised as a gift to the winner a splendid silver watch besides the prize of fifty dollars this was told to bertie by miss highfield so it is no longer a secret bertie and i intend to wrangle for the second prize which is as you know a mere begatelle as compared with the first

why do you think i will be the successful competitor the chances are not equal you and bertie are mulattoes and closer to that intellectual race which has evolved most of the arts and sciences of which civilization boasts today you would therefore be quite illogical with the evidences of hereditary superiority before you to suppose that a poor embryo like me could rival you

but we have measured your abilities with ours and we have found ourselves considerably wanting

then perhaps the defect is in the proper application to your studies and the want of due concentration of your powers

i follow the wise and patent theory of evolution and the results of natural selection which have obtained among white people for so long and it does seem phenomenal to me that there are so many fullblooded negroes who granted the same privileges are able to surpass in intellect so many of the whites

well said carlito with a smile i suppose these may be the exceptional reversions to some far off progenitors as travellers tell us that in some portions of the dark continent there are evidences of a high order of civilization having existed at one time

the cause may lie somewhere else because it is a recognized fact that the average unmixed negro given the same chance can successfully compete with the average white man even james anthony froude admits this

but the white race has been struggling through mists of doubt and fear of hope and dismay of failure and trial until they have been repaid with the bright smiles of a radiant day but we have the difference of a sudden transition from darkness to resplendent light and while we must admit the advantages of this we are without the impregnable foundations reared in the progress of gradual development

it would nevertheless argue well in your favor that even though this be taken into consideration yet the craniological difference between the pure blacks and the pure whites is not greater it shows you are equal as a man and a brother though you be more distant from the caucasian than i happen to be and your ability to make the proper use of your privileges is manifest

cyril had for good reasons adduced these arguments though he felt inwardly the insincerity of them at heart he was prejudiced against his darker brethren and would rather have seen carlito dead a thousand times than to have considered him his equal but he had some important cards to play and it would be to his benefit he thought to impress carlito with his magnanimous and philanthropic sentiment

cyril was carlitos senior by a couple of years and though he evinced a most crafty and subtle disposition he was far below young de la mar in intellectual capacity born of fairly wealthy parents he had been placed under the careful tuition of canon highfield when he was twelve he had always pretended to be on excellent terms with carlito and was often to be seen in his company this attachment however seemed somewhat spurious to carlito when on one occasion he recognized with deep regret the utter selfishness that cyril exhibited in a matter that considerably affected him

the kind and forgiving heart of carlito soon learned to forget the circumstance and the accustomed friendship was unhappily resumed it was therefore without the slightest doubt on his mind of the sincerity of cyrils sympathy for him that carlito rebuked him for another unkind remark which he made concerning bertie

cyril said carlito i seek no revenge for the wrongs i have innocently suffered i do not court adrastias patronage in this lamentable affray i would not be a timon who brooding over the unkindness of his race can only find amidst the haunts of savage brutes an unction for his misfortunes nay not so cyril we must not be too pessimistic and choleric

there is something good after all in humanity life is not all thorns there are roses too the thorns sometimes cause dreadful harm but if the roses be cared for and nurtured they will always fill the atmosphere with their delicious perfume though i must exclaim et tu brute i again repeat that i shall see bertie melville repent of his outrage upon me yet he will be sorry for it one day i tell you though he has not asked it i shall forgive him this day before god i do

having said this carlito bade cyril goodbye and each took his respective road homeward

fleecy locks and black complexion do not forfeit natures claim skins may differ but affection dwells in white and black the same

cowper

when carlito had reached a distance of about fifteen yards from the rectory he observed to his great dismay that blood was still oozing from the wound a trifle above the temple and his efforts to staunch the flow were without effect what could he do he did not wish to alarm the inmates of the rectory nor did he desire that there should be any discovery of the accident as this would necessarily lead to further complications which would ultimately result in berties getting a rough handling from his austere father he endeavoured to obtain a remedy to stop the flow of blood it was half past six oclock and he considered could he succeed in this he would reach home in the twilight and avoid detection

he noticed a birds nest almost hidden among the branches of a tree above him it did not appear to be tenanted and he thought of obtaining some of the soft down that enters into the buildingmaterial of birds nests and apply to the wound

it never rains but it pours said he delightfully and starting on his way to set his thoughts in operation he put his hand in his pocket where he discovered a very small phial containing laudanum

there was some difficulty in climbing the tree but carlito ultimately succeeded in reaching the nest a possibility that at first did not enter his mind now dawned upon him and he felt disappointed as he saw in the tiny receptacle three small tropical birds wrapped in balmy slumber

i will not disturb you said he poor little things you will not suffer inconvenience at my hands

he heard a rustling and it appeared as if some one had spoken but having listened carefully and finding no further evidence of the presence of any other person he concluded that it was the rustling of the wing among the branches when he reached the ground he took out of his pocket a silk pocket handkerchief and with the words necessitas non legem habet tore off a bit which he saturated with the laudanum and placed on the wound with the other portion he bound his head

he had succeeded in almost reaching his quarters when he was suddenly met by miss highfield he came wellnigh fainting when he saw her eyes resting steadily upon him though his hat had been carefully placed over the bandage it occurred to him that the prying gaze of the young girl had observed something unusual when in a tone faltering with emotion she said i see you have sustained some injury mr de la mar

i have met with an accident miss highfield but it is of no great importance and i hope to be soon all right

he wished to evade his fair enquirer and was proceeding onward when she suddenly electrified him with the words i know a part already and you would do well if you were to make a clean breast of it and give me the history of your adventures which have resulted so disastrously to yourself i saw you when you climbed the apple tree and from my hiding place watched all your movements i heard your tender manly expression when you refused to disturb the little birds in their cosy nest and my heart became filled with emotion at your tendernessâthis evidence of your humanity i felt for you i must confess mr de la mar and i preceded you home and prepared to do my best to alleviate your suffering only let me know how you came by your wound

carlito was struck at the peculiar candour of the young girl and though he would much rather have kept the affray of the afternoon to himself he could not help satisfying her curiosityâon the condition that she should not reveal the secret he told her of the unexpected attack which bertie had made upon him how her name had been associated with the matter how he had refused to deviate from the principles that underlie sincere friendship although berties conduct was so reprehensible how he refused to give blow for blow

miss highfield had always entertained a high opinion of carlitos moral character but the incident of the afternoon had raised him to the standard of a hero in her estimation she promised to keep the secret of the story that she had heard and though she thought deeply she made no comments whatever

mary highfield had now been six weeks at the rectory and in her frequent intercourse with carlito she had often deviated from the narrow and convential code that society prescribes for the upper classes she had recognized his extraordinary talents and a great friendship had sprung up between them but miss highfield being of a naturally proud and haughty disposition had always about her a certain somethingâ call it dignity or what you willâwhich regulated wisely the admiration which genius so strongly called forth and so an unwholesome relationship was thereby prevented

carlito for his part had always before his minds eye the status in society where providence had placed him ofttimes he was compelled to condemn himself for unfaithfulness to his first love ritaâto whom he had so faithfully pledged his wordâwhen he permitted his thoughts to linger lovingly upon mary highfield who with all the fascinating graces of excellent womanhood at times captivated him he strove nevertheless to cure himself of this madness whenever miss highfield would honor him with her presence and the occasions were frequent or exhibit her unusual attachment to him he would demolish the magnificent aircastles that presented themselves to him one by one by musing thus i could never be so absurd as to imagine that miss highfield could love me she could never lavish that sweet passion upon meâthe poor charity boy whose only claim to her slightest notice lies in his being favored by her generous and noble uncle who has introduced him into a circle which he had not even hoped to enter my color is another insurmountable barrier

no no the casket cannot please and the priceless gem which it may contain must therefore be deemed worthless i cannot be the dark othello who wins this fair desdemona

miss highfield did all in her power to administer to carlitos sufferings and her dainty hands seemed to have produced marvellous effects whenever they rested upon his brow luckily the canon had been absent for the last two days and was not expected to return for four more it was a young clergyman who had lately left codrington college that had relieved him of his dutiesâboth in the church and schoolâduring his absence it was therefore expected that carlito would be all right before the return of the canon the staid housemaid was bought over and was on her peril charged to say nothing about carlitos indisposition

though she had grumbled much at the extra amount of labor it entailed upon her to convey his meals up to his room she consented to carry out miss highfields request as that would secure for her a good many more tips besides she had a care for her little granddaughters who could not afford to lose the presents of worn skirts and pretty petticoats which miss highfield had been in the habit of giving them

carlitos wounds soon began to heal and in the space of a couple of days caused him but little pain a slight fever however lingered which was combated with febrifuges and other remedies three days after the attack upon him he was able to sleep to his entire satisfactionâa luxury which he had not enjoyed since the encounter

it would have done ones heart good to see the noble lad resting peacefully though he was almost black his features were not at all those of the characteristic ethiopian he partook of the beautiful ebony complexion of his mother and the commanding and captivating features of his father his brow was lofty but upon it still lingered some signs of the suffering which he had experienced in earlier days the marks of the surgeons knife could not be mistaken his finelyshaped head argued a welldeveloped brain well arched brows shaded glowing and penetrating eyes his nose was not aquiline but was large and refined and thoroughly in proportion with the rest of his face the lips were not thin yet it could not be said that they were of the ethiopian type in them there was perhaps a harmonious blending of the forms peculiar to his progenitors while a slight curve in the under lip enhanced its beauty of expression love affection and nobleness were unmistakably indicated there as he lay dreaming his face illumined with a gentle smile he would have furnished an excellent model for a sculpture in jet and even michaelangelo might have been happy to add to his laurels by a time representation of such a picture

in the regions of dreamland he saw his friend miss highfield weeping over him her tears were dropping fast while she tenderly wiped his brow with a lace handkerchief she had altogether lost that haughtiness that had characterized her and was transformed into the most ardent of lovers she knelt over and pressed her rosy lips on his as she whispered how i do love thee my carlito never never shall i cease to love thee noble boy

to the dreamers fancy it seemed that the emotions of her heart were excited by some powerful passion that flamed high within her and seemed to consume her while upon her face was revealed what she felt within

he knew that this was love and he felt translated into a region of happiness where all was poetry and love where roses smiled and blossomed under their feet

in his ecstacy he laughed triumphantly and subsequently awoke to find with all the horror of disappointment that he had but been dreaming it was like a sudden transition from the grotto of calypso to dantes inferno his face had been all this while turned to the wall and as he looked in the opposite direction he saw miss highfield calmly standing over him much the same as he had seen her in his dream as his eyes rested upon her she turned with a graceful air and left the apartment strange thoughts now took possession of his mind

there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy he murmured those abstruse questions which have been exercising some of the ablest minds for several generations may some day be exposed to the light when an advanced philosophy shall open the invaluable treasurehouse explore its hidden secrets and classify its vast treasures thereby increasing the power and happiness of men and mitigating their sufferings can it be possible that mary highfield loves me o heavens can it be possible

then alas we shall both be martyrs

come to these arms and meet in this embrace i the vows you never will return receive and take at least the love you will not give

cyril having once begun his nefarious mischiefmaking could not easily desist he very ingeniously led poor bertie to believe that mary highfield had been carrying on frequent flirtations with carlito de la mar and indeed these tales were so plausibly told that the least credulous person would have taken them as plain unvarnished truths he nevertheless sought miss highfields company whenever it was possible and even had the audacity to speak to her of his love she however rejected his overtures with a hauteur as stern as it was scornful this did not deter him from the main object which he kept continually before himâ to persevere until she should favor him with her heart and hand it was not that he really cared for her but as in the case of midas it was goldâthe allruling powerful motiveâthat had caused him to fix his thoughts in that direction

mary highfield was wealthy and this was enough to make the target worth hitting at any cost she was the only daughter of john babcock highfield proprietor who had been one of the sugar lords of the west indies and who was considered to be the possessor of about seventyfive thousand pounds in cash and landed property there were those who said that her fathers estates were heavily mortgaged but nobody knew for certain mrs grundy was always busy and none need bother with her tattlings his younger and only brother hugh was much attached to him and had for the most part obtained his education at his own expense mary was at an early age placed under the most careful tutors and at the end of her sixteenth year could boast of a firstclass education in which poetry and art were not the least of her attainments

she was peculiarly fond of literature and it was to satisfy her desire for a companion in the study of languages and tire fine arts that she consented to remain the guest of her uncle for although she often went to the parsonage she had never remained there more than a few days bertie and she were first cousinsâmrs

melville and mrs john highfield being two sisters who had always lived on the closest terms of friendship

their children had always been together and the happy hours of childhood were spent in each others company

bertie evinced a passionate fondness for mary but though she loved him as a relative she could not consent to his frequent pleadings that she would one day become his wife whenever bertie introduced the subject mary evaded it or turned to something quite different nevertheless the lad did not despair and sought by every means available to make some cleft in that obdurate granite heart of hers but woeful ballads piteous sighs and promises fraught with the sweetest affection were found utterly useless

the reader can therefore imagine what was bertie melvilles chagrin when he understood that there was a dangerous rival in the field in the person of young de la mar whom he had always believed to be the sincerest of friends since cyril had pitted him against him he actually hated carlito as much as he had loved him

 alls fair in love and war is an old saying he thought and if carlito can believe in it and be treacherous enough to allow such sentiments to influence him to my detriment i see no reason why i should ever think him worthy of myâor any other honorable gentlemansâregard

dr melville whose practice was somewhat limited certainly was not rich and he looked forward with much anticipation toward a closer relationship between mary highfield and his son which would place his own exchequer upon a surer foundation as well as enhancing berties prospects

it was the day after canon highfields return that mary for the first time during many days took an evening stroll and found herself in the churchyard a few steps from the rectory she had not been long there when she saw her cousin bertie coming toward her with an expression of much concern upon his face

she sat down upon a small bench under a cluster of palm trees and awaited him after the usual greetings were passed and some remarks made about the weather and a few other trifling matters bertie assuming an air of gravity spoke in a faltering voice

mary you have often told me that you cannot give me your heart hut only during the last few days has the terrible reality dawned upon me that you are in earnest you have been the bright star to which i have always looked with unfathomable hope all my thoughts have been centered upon you you have been the idol set up in my heart which i adored with feelings of intense homage all my aspirations my ambition

mj struggles have sprung into restless action from the allpreponderating desire to have you as my own  had ventured to hope that my frequent appeals would one day procure your consent but alas it seems now more hopeless since you have come down from your lofty pedestal to bestow your affections upon one who will disgrace your ancestry and humiliate you before all consider this mad step my cousinâfor gods sakeâbefore it is too late to repent of your folly and indiscretion you may deny it but i am satisfied that if it had not been so this surreptitious monster carlito de la mar would not have calumniated me as he has done this has been the method which he has adopted to prejudice you against me once more darling i implore you leave me not without a word of comfort or i die of a broken heart

mary sympathized with her cousin  and she could not stay the tears that trickled down her cheeks his words had pierced her heart and she wished she had never heard them as she mused over her inability to grant him his request

but my dear cousin i do not think that a heart like yours should buy a spurious love you are worthy of something better than i can offer you why should you have worthless brass for your brilliant diamond

if it were possible for me to make the sacrifice and consent to be your wife i would be deficient of those indispensable elements which genuine love produces to join hearts in one and support marital relationship upon the sure foundation intended by god bertie

bertie we are not ordained to be one do not be angry with me it is the decree of fate everything works together for good to them that love god and though you may deplore your disappointment be sure you will in the future see enough to make it clear to you that all discord is harmony not understood you will soon learn to forget this trying moment when you will find some heart to reciprocate your affection as vou deserve

your words are not just cousin mary you might have tried to love me had it not been for carlito whom i again repeat you passionately love the hardest steel relents and flint cannot resist the effects of perpetual contact of other forces is the human heart more obdurate than other things in the realms of nature

you are raving bertie who could have told you that there has been anything like a mutual understanding between young de la mar and myself he has always comported himself with due respect toward me and has never once even so much as spoken of love

never spoken of love cousin mary you astonish me would that i had never lived to hear you utter such a falsehood

falsehood do you say falsehood  mary grew indignant with rage am i not as much alive to the dishonor of a lie as you are then

stay you astonish me said bertie meekly seeing the storm which his imprudent remark had raised

you need not be angry with me i am rather buoyed up with hope to hear so stout a denial from lips that have never been tainted with a lie if i mistrusted you for once it was because i had been told certain things apparently supported by plausible evidence which at least wore the aspect of truth

and who may your informant be that knows so much about my affairs

cyril merton was the straightforward reply

cyril merton reiterated mary has this barefaced iago no other way of spending his time but in mischiefmaking how can he befriend you when he speaks derogatorily about you and has laid damaging information against you in the unfortunate circumstance between yourself and mr de la mar

this cannot be cyril merton do this how can i understand this inconsistency pray then does every one know of the conflict

i cannot say that everybody knows because i have heard nothing since i saw cyril and asked him to keep this disgraceful matter under cover your  victim is much distressed at your treatment and wonders how you could have been so blind as to act in the way you did he has been most magnanimous and even washed to hide the matter from me though i made the discovery that he had been wounded under peculiar circumstances he believes as i do that you have been duped and therefore cherishes no ill will against you

but i saw in his own handwriting the evil insinuations he made against me

i regret to say it dear cousin but i am positive that the wily cyril has been playing a double part for his own benefit and such a jjerson is not a meet companion for either you or mr de la mar that piece of paper which has been the foundation of the whole trouble will on proper investigations be found to be a huge fraud and if not a forgeryâtake my word for itâis something near it

bertie seemed to be almost stunned at this intelligence and after endeavouring to say something in reply to the startling information he got from his cousin he found himself utterly unable to speak coherently for some moments during the momentary spell of silence he became wrapped in profound thoughts which produced a painful expression on his face when he had recovered from his aberration he tenderly and pleadingly looked into marys eyes and said you know our final examination comes off this week at the grammar school my father awaits anxiously the result which will decide whether i am to go into law or medicine soon therefore i hope to be on the broad atlantic bound for england consider therefore your decision my life and say whether you will send me heartlessly away a despairing disappointed and wretched mortalâexiled from his native shores forever by a heart which felt no pity for the pangs of unrequited affectionâor say whether you will imbue me with vigor and ambition to go forth and study the profession that soon will place me in a position to gain eminence in life and procure the wherewithal for making you happy as my queen

trembling with emotion bertie took his cousins hand in his and kissed it gently kneeling upon the lawn

he anxiously awaited her reply and the few moments which intervened seemed like weary years of waiting

mary cousin mary he pleaded passionately when the suspense had become unbearable you will not say no to my appeal you cannot surely be so unkind it is a question of life and death and upon your answer hangs my fate

mary had never in her life experienced such a severe trial such hard struggling with herself at one moment her pity seemed to be gaining ascendency and she was sorely tempted to yield but a silent prayer sent up to the throne of grace imbued her with strength and impressed her more strongly than ever with the conviction that she did not really love bertie she remembered the words that he had just used it is a question of life and death and verily it was had she in a weak moment for pitys sake yielded herself it would have been the sowing of the first seeds of sorrow for which repentance would have come too late

she at length summoned up courage and with tears streaming from her sad eyes she whisperedânay stammeredâthe words that fell upon berties ears like a fatal cannon shot

it is of no use my dear cousin you can never be my husband do not think me unkind again i implore you this decision is for our mutual good you are noble and generous and worthy any womans love but the connection which has hitherto caused us to live so familiarly has produced its own peculiar affection if you had been absent from me and i had not known you before i think perhaps i might have loved you as my husband but that we have grown up together as children is certainly no fault of mine i am sorry my dear cousin that once for all i must ask you to cease to think in this way of me

bertie rose from his knees his eyes red with weeping

his mental suffering had produced deep marks of anguish upon his features and he looked like a criminal being led to the scaffold

the storm has now burst with all its terrific fury

said he and i find myself a wretched being the clouds have obscured my beacon light no longer visible and i must now be tossed upon the remorseless ocean of lifeâhelpless and forlorn straightway from your presence i go a changed mortal and these eyes of mine must cease to look upon you ambition beckons me on no longer goodbye and if for ever still for ever fare thee well god bless you i will not forget to pray for you though you may forget that there is on this planet a being like myself

marys heart was touched and she flung her arms around berties neck and kissed him but he straightway withdrew from her clasp and walked hastily away

a few days afterward she received the following letter from him mars den villa dec  â

my dear cousin my life is a blank the main object on which my thoughts and energy have been concentrated cannot be attained i have therefore resolved to enlist as soldier in the west indian regiment which embarks from st lucia for st helena in a few days a bullet shot may one day perform the kindly act of closing the career of an illstarred being like me again i reiterate god bless you

farewell

your brokenhearted cousin bertie

the examination of canon plighfields grammar school came off it was the last that many of the advanced students were to see at that excellent college which had produced so many brilliant scholars and always paved the way smoothly for those destined for the liberal professions there was a great deal of interest shown by those acquainted with the students and the results were looked forward to with great anxiety the rev mr george bridgewater was the chief examiner and looked through all the papers in divinity classics mathematics french and natural sciences the other subjects were covered by canon highfield

as had been expected the highest number of marks was taken by carlito de la mar bertie followed and he who was expected to take the third placeâcyril mertonâfell extremely short and was outstripped by a lad many years his junior from whom such results had never been expected it was indeed a gala day for the whole school and the lads with the exception of cyril evinced much animation the prizes were promptly presented on the same day carlito receiving the prize of ten pounds from a certain fund raised for that purpose besides a silver watchâthe gift of mr bridgewater

a couple of days after this event bertie sent a note to carlito couched in very friendly language inviting him to meet him on the st cyr cricket field after sunset that day naturally carlito was eager to know what business bertie could have with him and impatiently awaited the appointed meeting

it was a quarter to six when he arrived at the spot but he had to wait many minutes more before bertie appeared when he did put in his appearance carlito was surprised to see the change that had come over his countenance it was a serenely calm and sad expression that now marked the once bright and lively eyes and the complexiou had grown much paler than it was wont to be carlito wondered what were the causes that had brought about such a penitential air

i am glad to meet you again as a friend carlito

said bertie extending his hand warmly

so am i replied carlito with a smile i have no doubt by this time you have discovered your mistake

i have beyond the shadow of a doubt and i am come to make vamende honorable i never thought you had such a noble soul carlito and that i have so basely wronged you will for many a day fill my soul with remorse

i knew that would one day come and i have waited anxiously for it is this not more in accordance with what the master enjoins upon us than to have endeavoured to convince you of your error by more forceful methods

it is cyril merton who is the villain and not you

it is his duplicity which had brought about this conflict between us he laid before me false statements purporting to have been statements made by you impugning my character and i took them for gospel truth then again he produced such plausible evidence in that piece of paper in which your handwriting undoubtedly appeared but i do not question its origin since i am convinced that you really love me and could never have hoped to harm me in any way whatever i am perfectly sure carlito that you will forgive my unpardonable wrong and upon my knees i implore it since you have shown yourself a worthier being than i

bertie had fallen upon his knees and had clasped carlitos hands with energy the latter bade him rise and as a token of his forgivenness embraced him and kissed his cheeks when this imposing little melodramatic scene had ended carlito said verily cyril merton stands in the category of the basest of mortals his wicked tricks although having worked a temporary suspension of our friendship have ultimately proved abortive and he has now shown himself in all his true colors without succeeding in his plans that were to cause a separation between us and thus give him a better opportunity for carrying off the prize when we were incapacitated i saw him snatch something from your pocket on the day you attacked me but i did not dare accuse him of theft then i do so now however since i find him capable of such duplicity

he paused in his rush of words

my god ejaculated bertie can human nature sink so low

i shall satisfy you with tangible evidence that you cherished a serpent in your bosom whose fangs have played complete havoc

so saying carlito drew from his pocketbook the following letter dear carlito i wish to see you personally but at present such a thing is not possible i am the victim of a somewhat troublesome cold as the exam comes off soon our efforts must be directed towards getting that pedant bertie melville somewhere in the corner he makes a fool of himself by boasting that he intends to win the first prize and if you agree with me let me know at once

yours sincerely cyril

this is my reply showing to bertie this copy dear cyril yours received my motto has always been palmam qui meruit feral if bertie boasts that is his personal business i would prefer to meet on fair grounds so that we may compete by sheer force of intellect your suggestions are not charitable and i cannot lend myself to any conspiracy against bertife a lowborn scullion unworthy of the name man i should deem myself under such circumstances i hope the day will come when we shall mutually cooperate in some laudable cause worthy of true gentlemen

yours truly carlito de la mar

carlito had read this correspondence hurriedly

since the letters were written this was but the second occasion of his looking at them and it did not appear to him that there was anything striking in them

but bertie who was always on the qui vive detected something at once which made him put the question to carlito have you preserved the piece of paper that did the mischief he enquired

i have was the reply

then continued bertie it will not be difficult to discover how cyril prepared his plans since i have found the key

the remarkable scrap of paper was produced and as bertie anticipated it was found to be a part of carlitos letter to cyril refusing to cooperate with him against bertie the ingenious cyril has requisitioned the use of the inkeraser for perpetrating his villianous act on referring to carlitos copy it was discovered that the full stop which was placed after the name bertie was erased and the verb is took its place the words of the name man were replaced by the name mary highfield and defied detection by the ordinary observer on the whole it was a cleverly executed fraud and both the young men thought the author would make something in the world if he only turned his ingenuity in the direction of virtue and honor they spent some time in giving their personal experience of cyrils conduct and by a comparison of their notes it was necessary to arrive at the conclusion that the delinquent should be sternly tabooed

just two days afterward bertie and carlito met again it was to exchange words pregnant with sincerity and to shed tears at parting on the same night bertie bade goodbye to his beloved country and with a heart bearing the burden of rejected love was on his way to st lucia to join his west indian regiment

oliver goldsmith

caulito having left college selected the vocation of a schoolmaster canon highfield was not financially in a position to send him to the continent to take up a profession but gave him all encouragement for the future and buoyed him up in his ambitious projects

at a quiet little village situated about a mile and a half from the parsonage young de la mar spent his days in imparting to boys and girls the rudiments of education his kindly disposition suggested to him the method of teaching by love and not by force he soon won their hearts and they all began to look upon him as a friend whose companionship became invaluable there was a word of encouragement to the did little fellow who could not for all the world take in what two from ten would leave and the sevenyearold maiden who wearily and monotonously tried her efforts to spell circumlocution would be handed back the book with the words take it darling and try again the result was that she went away fully resolved to give the kind master no more trouble

though a student of moral philosophy carlito did not in every case conform to the theory of the hinterschlag professor of carlyles sartor resartus who acted upon the faculty called memory through the muscular integuments by means of birch rods he did not believe that the powers of the brain could be developed by means of excessive castigation and it was only in the case of inattention or downright carelessness that he resorted to the birch to accomplish his ends with a patience worthy of plato he explained each subject that he took up and no scowl sat on his face nor hasty expression escaped his lips when he found that at the end of his instructions the results were far from being satisfactory being strictly moral and religious he never failed to inculcate the principles of virtue in the minds of his pupils by means of lectures and pertinent illustrations selfishness was an element that formed no part of his moral composition and the same spirit of communism that he exhibited in his earlier days now showed itself in bold relief being of a gentle quiet disposition he was dubbed by his friends and admirers le petit pretre

an incident however occurred one day which made it patent that he was an advocate of muscular christianity and could use his strong arms and agile body with advantage to protect the weak and oppressed

it was an afternoon when the rain was falling in torrentsâand the stream which he had to cross on his way home had swollen a great dealâthat he saw a poor black woman standing on the bank with an indian basket on her head hesitating as to whetner or not she should risk fording the stream she might not have been more than forty years old yet she seemed worn with care her once sable ringlets had been almost entirely converted into silver threads and an expression of unmistakable sorrow rested on her face her clothes were none of the best and were stained with mud and dust it was evident that she had come some distance

there were a few persons standing by some of whom viewed her with curiosity while others cast insults at her one man remarked that she was a witch who had come to dupe the place when carlito saw her his sympathy was awakened

where do you come from madam and where do you wish to go he tenderly enquired

this unexpected approach on the part of the young schoolmaster was received with amazement by the stranger who was at first inclined to believe that he was one of the mocking crowd but when on a nearer scrutiny she observed the kindly expression that glowed in his eyes and the books he carried under his arms she was impressed with his sincerity and ventured to reply i am a stranger sir in search of employment and for heavens sake i implore your aid and protection

you shall have them by all means my poor woman but you seem feeble and can never cross this stream with that huge basket i will take it over for you and assist you across

you are not going to help that shedevil mr de la mar said a chorus of mocking voices you have forgotten you are a gentleman sir

a gentleman aye whats a gentleman  asked the young man in a sarcastic tone as the dignified passivity of the strange woman powerfully impressed him

a stalwart youth who was laughing heartily at the idea of what he was pleased to call carlitos craziness drew near and pushed the helpless woman so that she staggered and fell on her face to the ground

carlito gazed at the cruel perpetrator of this inhuman act with a rage that seemed unbounded never before had his temper so completely mastered him he seized the ruffian by the collar and shook him a fierce combat ensued they seemed equally matched now carlitos strong arm dealt a severe blow on his opponents eye now the latter returned another which also took good effect ultimately however mars decided in favor of carlito and with a wellaimed blow he sent the other reeling senseless to the ground de la mar immediately took off his books and rolled up his trousers and having taken the basket from the helpless woman he carried it across the stream

hurrah nobly done my boy shouted a voice that carlito knew

the voice was that of canon highfield who with his niece had just come upon the scene and in a moment had taken in the entire situation

the benevolent youth looked at them in amazement and smiled pleasantly it was not the time however to listen to flattering compliments and the next thing that he did was to escort the woman over this done he now entered into conversation with the canon and explained the circumstances as they had happened

the woman also was conducted to the rectory and placed in the charge of old annie the housekeeper who despite her idiosyncrasies and fits of disagreeableness manifested an extraordinary amount of fellowfeeling and was wondrous kind to the distressed tramp

weary exhausted and sad the poor creature appreciated beyond expression the dainty supper and comfortable lodgings with which she was provided she felt as if she were in an elysium as her thoughts ceased to dwell upon the sad things that had hitherto occupied them and she began to enjoy the comforts which were so kindly lavished upon her out of pity she was taken into the service of the canon as assistant housekeeper

ellen as she was called exhibited astonishing intelligence considering the sphere to which she appeared to belong and the evidences of her strict probity were numerous this delighted the clergyman and proved a great meed of satisfaction to her benefactor carlito

one fine afternoon some time after ellens installation at the rectory carlito and mary were sitting together upon a bench half hidden away in a grotto of flowers conversing on some subject that considerably interested them when ellen happened to pass and her gaze became fixed upon carlito

why do you stare at me in that manner ellen

enquired carlito

i really can not tell mr de la mar but whether it is from the obligations under which rou have placed me or some other unaccountable reason i must confess excuse my presumption sir that my maternal instincts have been aroused whenever i look upon your bright and intelligent features

you pay me a compliment really my poor ellen

so you are or have been a mother put in mary

you are ambitious ellen when you compare your offspring with one of mr de la mars type

a gentle rippling laugh set the girls face aflush

her words were uttered thoughtlessly and she would gladly have recalled them but it was now too late for they had already made deep impressions on de la mars mind he however very adroitly endeavoured to rid her of her embarrassment by continuing his interrogation of ellen

you saj that you have been a mother ellen he questioned

yes sir i have been but o mr de la mar for gods sake ask me nothing further and do not probe the wounds which the kind hand of time has wellnigh healed

another victim of mans perfidy alas

no sir no sirâbut ask me no more i beseech you and she covered her face and sobbed aloud as she withdrew from their presence

that woman has a history surely said carlito and i feel great sympathy for her there is a secret in her life which seems to haunt her perhaps she has been deceived by some demon who has completely darkened her life the secret may come out one day time will tell

ellen wears the insignia of marriage said mary and perhaps her husband has been unfaithful to her

poor woman i believe this is the cause of her suffering alas how unthankful is the sterner sex nowadays and how often men steel their hearts against the tender graceful being that perfumes their lives with the incense of faithful love if men could only realise the tenderness of a womans affection im sure they would think a million times before they crushed it with their heartless words or deeds

you speak strongly and appear not to be a stranger to what true love is

carlito spoke the words mechanically he scarcely knew the real force of his words and in his emotion his hand fell on marys she had not replied to his question nor did she withdraw her hand from his gentle pressure he had read the answer in her eyes which were glowing with the strange light that love lent them

at one time he might have thought it more probable for a queen to bestow on him her affection than to cherish the remotest idea that the haughty brilliant and erudite mary highfield should fall under this spell

but what he had lately begun to imagine in a halfhearted manner now appeared to be an incontrovertible fact he lifted the delicate hand to his lips and kissed it with tenderness and emotion

do you love me mary he asked peering into the sweet liquid eyes

i do carlito she replied tremulously

the curtain was lifted and the drama commenced

in action faithful and in honor clear who broke no promise served no private end

pope

it was in the stillness of the night when queen mab had set out on her tour drawing her cobwebs athwart mens eyes and playing fantastic tricks that she alighted on carlito and delivered him of the thoughts which had filled his breast to overflowing the light of the silver moon which had just risen fell upon his face through an open window a solitary star struggled to peep through a floating dark cloud and seemed to look down kindly upon the sleeping youth the effulgence proved too much for him and he suddenly released himself from the fairy queen and shut out the light which had disturbed him he did not return to dream a weight came over him that he could not throw off and he labored without effect to court sleep

to be in love is serious it is a reality that perhaps is not duly considered because men sometimes mistake ephemeral passion for the transcendental principle of true affection carlito had made this mistake

his pity for rita and his sympathy for her devotion had roused in him a feeling that he had mistaken for genuine loveâa feeling that had caused him to pledge his word to her now that his heart had told him that that simple yet warmhearted country girl could never gain the place in his affection of which she was indeed worthy lie became burdened with the most poignant grief and his sufferings were doubly augmented when he recognised the fact that he had now found his real love and his true ideal and yet he was forced by the voice of conscience the arbiter that fixed the standard of his moral responsibility and to which he had always listened to sacrifice the elysium he would under other circumstances have given his life to possess he must be true to his word true to himself true to his god whom he had called to witness that though the heavens fell he would not forsake rita he wished that that moment had never come that had seen mary confess her love had seen him yield to the irresistible fires that had all along been inflaming his being and as the reality of the situation stared him in the face he clenched his fists bit his lips and cried like a child

why was he so weak as to have betrayed himself and to have been guilty of the crime of fanning the love of that highsouled girl into intense flame by his imprudent conduct towards her he made it evident that he had loved her and she was convinced that there was nothing in the way of their love a moments resolution a complete immolation of self wrould have nipped the bud in its infancy and prevented an unprofitable growth but no he could as bravely and resolutely face death as any spartan hero but alas his philosophy could not render him proof against the magic charms of a womans love

time wore on and de la mar threw himself more into his scholastic duties than he had ever done before several brilliant articles on educational subjects came from his penâarticles that were valued by newspaper men as the productions of deep and earnest thought and his moral essays which from time to time adorned the columns of a favorite periodical were highly commended and raised their youthful author in the publics esteem

besides most of the classic tongues carlito studied hebrew and sanscrit with extraordinary application

in these labors he burned much midnight oil and as he paced the room reciting selections from homer or the talmud his eyes glaring with a brilliant light one would have supposed that he had gone mad but all this study could not serve as he had hoped to put mary out of his thoughts she had taken too firm a root there and he found it impossile to dislodge her

the intercourse between them had become less frequent as he walked to school quite early and did not return until dinner time which was  p m this he did with the object of avoiding mary but this apparent slight on his part seemed to cause her love to glow with greater ardour from that first evening when they had betrayed their mutual affection the barriers had been trampled down and little or no ceremony marked their intercourse nevertheless though mary had often referred to their former conversation carlito steered clear of the subject as by venturing upon such dangerous shoals he felt he would surely come to grief

this naturally led the young girl to fear that her affections may have been bestowed on one who did not really care for her mary had made rapid progress in italian and had ceased to take lessons from carlito but as a means to an end she implored him to come home earlier from school in order that they might get through some pages of tasso carlito though he would have wished otherwise could not refuse and so he dismissed school earlier than usual that he might grant her request

one evening as he with the canon and mary were seated at the dinner table the canon remarked my dear carlito you do not seem happy and i have noticed for some time that you have grown paler and that your appetite is not what it was wont to be i am afraid it is the effect of too much study or else there is something which weighs heavily on your mind

you must not study too closely my boy there is plenty of time you are not yet twentyone and the world is still before you

it is not study which has had the effect of which you speak it is due to some other potent cause

carlito glanced at mary and a tear stole down his cheek

then what can you have weighing so heavily upon you what else could it possily be

carlito endeavoured to turn aside the conversation

but the canon became rather apprehensive

perhaps he has discovered a clue in connection with his identity he thought and if this is so it is necessary for me to withhold no longer his history from him

with this resolution he rose from the table

one evening a short time afterward carlito and mary were reading together by lamplight they were alone and only the voice of the wind murmuring monotonously among the palm leaves now and then caught their attention

what is it which makes you appear so sad my dear carlito my uncle noticed it in you and i have myself seen you stand for moments as if you were completely lost tell me what it isâdo not keep it from me

my darling my only loveâsay that you will forgive me if i tell you the truth which has caused me unutterable sorrow and anguish of soul from the moment i felt that you loved me for this i had not dared to hope though i know i would give my life to save you from the slightest suffering when it so happened that fate had intertwined our hearts i felt that all the joys of earth had been combined together and laid at my feet it was for me a realization of the highest pleasure which this world affords i would not have exchanged the wealth of golconda for that gentle smile or kind word which men have sought and have not received  mary my love for you is greater than you can ever imagine i have watched you tenderly at every possible opportunity and have yearned constantly for you although i have pained you by my apparent slights we are toys in the hands of fate whose caprice it is to mock hearts  mary my shortlived day of brilliant joy has been suddenly turned into the black night of despair i must tell you that i have pledged my word to a simple spanish maiden whom i once thought i loved but whom as i fully realize now i did not forgive me darling that i did not tell you this before how can i be false to that trusting heart which placed all confidence in my word and how can i be true to myself if i fail to keep my plighted word i cannot be less than a man and to maintain my manhood i must make the eternal sacrifice that will forever embitter my life i cannot be yours

one would have thought that mary highfield would have succumbed to this severe shock which fell upon her with terrible effect but she bore it with a superhuman strength not common to woman instead of being diminished her love was strengthened and her faith in carlito became impregnable he was before in her eyes as an ordinary man blest with genius and rare gifts but now a heavenly halo seemed to surround him and she considered him almost a demigod

carlito you have saddened me beyond expression by your frank confession she began steadily but the firmness soon changed into a falter as she continued and although i too must feel the loss of that hope which had always given me pleasure i must bend to the inevitable since my unselfishness can picture the trusting creature relying on your word you are the first man that i have ever loved and you will be the last

there is no place left for another in making the necessary sacrifice i do so with the cup not unmixed with some element of pleasure that is to say i shall retain and value the friendship of a true and honorable gentleman whose equal i have hitherto not found it is now left for me to seclude myself from the world and give myself wholly to the lethean springs where i have often found a panacea for the discomforts that have menaced me from time to time i mean a closer association with yirgil horace plutarch and dante to say nothing of the book of books and our own immortal bard the time for my departure will be tomorrow at midday i shall endeavour strenuously to bury the recollection of this fated day it is impossible for me to unburden my soul but i shall struggle against the tide that threatens to overwhelm me

noble type of womanhood cried carlito who would not die for such a being

noble type of manhood replied mary and who would not die for a soul so beautiful and good

and they parted with hearts brimful of sorrowâ to meet again

as are our hearts our way is one and cannot be divided strong affection contends with all things and oercometh all things

joanna baillie

marys departure from the rectory had immensely increased carlitos struggle with himself against the terrible wave of passion which threatened to overwhelm him her presence had given him constant pleasure and he pined for his only love he knew the evil consequences that would result from a too near approach to the alluring flames but like the doomed moth it was beyond his will to resist such powerful attractions

canon highfield noticed that there was no appreciable change for the better in the young mans health which was manifestly declining nevertheless he did not carry out his resolution to enlighten him on certain important matters in connection with his history

he however from a consideration of carlitos movements reached certain conclusions the young man had taken up the habit of visiting his old home these visits had become more frequent of late and often in the afternoon when the cool and refreshing breeze invited the overworked frame and harassed mind to enjoy the luxury of the salubrious air carlito bestrode his little cream pony mazeppa and wended his way to x where he again met with rita

canon highheld knew that this was the period when young men are apt to fall in love and he took it for granted that carlito had been seeking to win the hand of rita but had encountered serious obstacles which reacted on both his mind and body as the reader knows however the thoughtful clergyman was entirely mistaken

carlito had renewed his vow to marry the girl to whom he had so solemnly given his troth and as far as rita was concerned there was no obstacle she was no more the smiling simple and talkative child who had won the canons admiration on the auspicious night of the beloric she had developed into a stately woman with a countenance of beauty and dignity of expression and a form as exquisite as any specimen of spanish beauty her ideas had in a degree outgrown the crude mould in which they were once formed but she lacked considerably that refinement and culture that can only be produced by the careful training and education of the mind she was like a rare and beautiful flower whose virtues are unhappily pent up in the unwholesome environment of uncongenial soil she had accustomed herself to hard work and there were few men in the neighborhood who could put more energy in the felling of a tree or toil more than she among the cocoa trees consequently she possessed physical strength to a great degree and her complexion was of a healthy brown she was fully alive to her own interest and though don francisco verde was nominally trustee to her properties the whole duty of managing the estate devolved upon her and she proved herself fully competent to perform this with entire satisfaction

she looked with unspeakable delight toward carlitos visits and though at one time she had begun to think him unfaithful she now felt convinced of the contrary and cherished once more the hope that they would one day be united

as she sat down on a chair near him one fine afternoon she observed that there was a melancholy air about him which considerably disturbed her mind

whats the matter darling why are you so sad she asked

nothing was the laconic reply

im sure it is something maybe it is your ambition that still haunts you i remember reading somewhere that there is no unhappier wretch than the man who is ambitious but disappointedâwho has the desire for fame but has lost the power to achieve it you see therefore that ambition is an awful thing and i am afraid it is that which makes you look so sad at times

maybe it is ambition as you say darling because i have been duly considering my position of late i shall be twentyone early in september and i have not yet seen my way clear to carry out my promise i should certainly not dare to marry until i have secured a profession and a competency to support you properly i must under the circumstance implore you to wait until providence blesses me with the realization of my wishes which ere long i hope to obtain

you astonish me really carlito if it is merely a profession you wantâthat can easily be provided for

i can give you money to cover all expenses in that direction and i have wondered why you will drudge away at that old schoolkeeping wearing out your lungs when you can do so much better

i thank you for your kind offer sweet but i would rather not accept it since it does not harmonize with my principles

but all that is mine will be yours one day

naturally but i must then be in a position to give you something worth while in return

will you not reconsider your decision carlito do you mean i must wait all these years had i not known you as i do i would have thought that you were vacillating but i cannot do this because i know that you are honorable and true

that evening as carlito was returning home he noticed a dark shadow silhouetted against the evening sky on a nearer approach he distinguished the form of cyril merton who advanced toward him and laid his hand on the pommel of his saddle

carlito seemed surprised but did not speak

hello de la mar said cyril you have got so big it seems you hardly care to recognize me

oh replied carlito somewhat sarcastically i would recognize cyril merton anywhere i can never forget him

the words were spoken in such a tone that cyril at once felt their import

i am glad to see you man since i quitted x i have not been back more than once so i am anxious to know something about the folk you see i have grown quite a robinson crusoe and am as it were isolated from my own circle

ah yes your sudden disappearance from amongst us astonished a good many people however i indirectly learned that you had identified yourself with the plantocracy and were managing some important estate in this quarter is that really so carlito asked casually

that is really so i have plenty of work to do and i can spare little time to come down to the village it is therefore my good fortune that has brought me in contact with you this evening

but my visits here are frequent and it is strange that i have not met you before

for the simple reason that i have already explained

i observed your pony at a certain place this afternoon but i thought it was some adventurer after that spanish girls money i would not however imagine that of a highsouled being like you

thank you for your compliment cyril i am sorry i have not more time to spare it is getting late and i must be home before the canon dines

so saying carlito parted from the man whom of all others he utterly abhorred and on whom he had not laid his eyes since the day of the examination at the canons grammar school

when he reached home he found to his great dismay that the canon was out so he was obliged to take dinner alone he ordered a cup of tea before he rose from the table and as ellen was bringing it in the waiter slipped and fell on the floor spilling its contents carlito started

whats wrong with you ellen he said sternly

this is a piece of downright carelessness on your part and i shall expect you to exercise more care in the future there is the carpet soiled by your slovenliness and i am not pleased

i did not do this on purpose mr de la mar replied ellen touched to the quick by this harsh and unexpected rebuke and as the tears welled up in her eyes she continued my feet unfortunately stumbled and in my effort to maintain my balance i allowed the waiter to fall

there is no use making excuses this is an accident which could have been avoided if you had exercised greater care

i shall try not to allow it to happen again but i am sure you are quite unlike yourself tonight dear gentle mr de la mar and have treated me more harshly than i ever thought you capable of doing that i am a servant sir and in this position i owe to an unkind fate or rather to the villainous plotting of a base usurper i am not deserving such harsh treatment

at these words the woman buried her face in her hands and wept violently

carlito felt for her and would gladly have recalled the words which in a moment of ill temper he has used

i am sorry that i have pained you ellen he said with deep emotion the best of us are sometimes led away for a moment by evil influences to say or do unkind things i offer you my sincere apologies for my harshness which has wrung those tears from you

he rose from his seat and patted the woman gently on the cheek while his own eyes filled with tears ellen was satisfied with this manifestation of genuine regret and concluded that there was certainly something serious at work to sour the gentle disposition of the young man for whom she always had had a warm corner in her heart

can you say ellen inquired carlito when their differences were settled what has taken the canon out 

oh sir this you should have known before but for the accident mr highfield miss marys father sent posthaste for his brother this afternoon as miss mary had been taken ill and the doctor says there is a very grave strain on her nervous system the poor young lady is suffering very much and the servant hints there is a general opinion that something weighs heavily on her mind

something on her mind ejaculated carlito in some surprise what can it be

oh i suppose sir it must be some love affair you cannot imagine how this can affect the minds of young people

you are certainly joking ellen miss highfield is too sensible to be thus influenced

ah dear master education cannot stay the tide of human passion and it is not strange to find the erudite and accomplished courtier sighing like a furnace and making woeful ballads to the eyebrows of his mistress

such is the mystery of our incomprehensible humanity

you speak wisely ellen i trust miss highfield will not be any worse by tomorrow were it not already late i would have gone over to see how she is tonight this must however be postponed now until tomorrow

it was with a heart laden with sorrow that carlito retired after the sad news of marys illness had reached his ears but when in the midnight stillness he communed with himself his unbounded sympathy for mary made him feel miserable indeed he listened anxiously for the footsteps of the canon and when eleven oclock had arrived and he had not returned he became exceedingly uneasy it was not however long afterward that voices were heard a short distance off and carlito in pajamas and slippers ran down stairs his suspense was at an end when the canon with an unusually troubled countenance bade him goodnight

goodnight sir answered carlito what news

is miss highfield any better

not better nor yet worse was the reply but i am afraid that she is in a very precarious condition

carlito stood awestruck and he trembled in every limb at this moment both annie and ellen were on the spot anxious to learn what news the canon had brought and when they heard it they retired with sad faces and troubled hearts they were fond of miss highfield and were much concerned about her

i would be glad if you would come down to my study early tomorrow morning carlito said the canon i have something of importance to say to you meanwhile you had better retire

very well sir goodnight replied carlito

and they parted

there is nothing in the wide world so like the voice of a spirit

gray

there is laid a sword in thy fathers tomb and its edge is frought with thy foemans doom

mrs he mans

caelito could not sleep his efforts to do so were in vain the wind began to howl monotonously among the trees and a slight shower of rain producing its rhythmic music as it pattered on the houseroof had a soothing effect on him but not sufficient to produce slumber

an unbearable heat pervaded the roomâwhich was unaccountable since the weather was on the whole cool

he had not much faith in supernatural apparitions nevertheless a queer sensation seized him his hair stood on end and he began to fear the intrusion of some unwelcome visitor and in this he was not far wrong the light dimly burning on the table was suddenly extinguished he got out of bed and relighted it it was again put out a form enveloped in white could be clearly discerned

carlito though naturally brave trembled as he saw the strange object approaching he quickly rose and prepared to meet his visitor the apparition threw off the white robe in which it had appeared to be wrapped and revealed the regular outlines of a man clad in deep black its face wore not the hue of earth but upon it rested a solemn sad almost repulsive expression carlito filled with the impetuosity with which fear had imbued him thundered goblin of hell damned spirit return to your resting place what do i owe to you who thus disturb my rest

no answer was returned to his address

speak cried carlito or by the powers of heaven i will compel you to do so

he advanced bent upon touching the unwelcome visitor but his hand passed through the form as if it had been ether a slight laugh rang through the room and the ghost spoke in a clear firm and resolute tone

fear not child of earth it said i am not come to injure a hair of your head long years have i waited for this hour it has now arrived my blood shall not be unavenged nor virtue suffer longer go to australia robert heineman waits there to greet you adieu

with these words the spirit disappeared and left carlito wrapped in amazement and wonder the next morning as he left his apartment and came downstairs he met ellen who greeted him with a pleasant smile

you look haggard mr de la mar she said why is that have you not slept well

i have had a strange adventure he replied such as would have made an ordinary mortal madâa vision from the regions of the dead you seem astonished but nevertheless i am convinced that it was no illusion but an incontestable fact

i never thought that a place like the rectory was haunted nor since i have been here have i heard any hint of such a thing

nor have i hence the significance of the phenomenon

and what did your visitor say to you

i never thought a disembodied spirit could utter sounds until this was unmistakably illustrated to me last night and i am still left wondering by what vehicle the impalpable shadow through which my hand passed as through the air spoke in so clear and coherent a manner it is no fairy dream i have never yet been victimized by illusions i again repeat and the words which so impressively fell upon my ears still cling tenaciously to my memory the time has arrived said the ghost my blood shall not be unavenged nor virtue suffer longer go to australia robert heineman waits there to greet you what this means i cannot tell

ellen stood for some time like a sphinx transfixed to the earth dark shadows appeared to float before her while a curious light shone in her eyes and a deadly pallor fell upon her cheeks something in carlitos words had undoubtedly struck her

your hand a moment sirâyour hand i would see

she gasped as if her breath had suddenly stopped

carlito seemed astonished at this request but stretched out his hand ellen nervously rolled up his sleeve as far as the elbow while carlito with the essence of good nature looked on with a smile a pomegranate mark was exposed to view and ellen had not gazed upon it for a second when she fell upon carlitos neck with an impulse akin to frenzy and kissed him eagerly then fell upon the floor insensible it was the work of a moment for carlito to summon old annie and the canon

i always taut dis lady did have a secret said old annie sometime she sit down wid her han under her jaw an begin to cry and wen i ask her whats matter she say in a way dat bring tears from my eyes noting annie i am de chile of misfortune but i hope god will soon relieve me by tecking me to heself las night she come in my room an begin to cry because she say mr carlito say something rough to her and she lub him as her own chile de ting went to her heart and perhaps dat is the matter poor ting mr

carlito you might not have hurt her so

the tenderhearted dame at this moment fixed her eyes upon the unfortunate creature on the floor and large teardrops fell from her eyes

carlito was himself struck with remorse on seeing that the wound which he had created in ellens heart was not easy to heal

the canon ordered ellen to be taken up and laid on her own bed where she received the best attention possible carlito with his own hands administered restoratives and bathed the womans heated brow with refreshing lotions she did not remain long in an unconscious state and as she opened her eyes and saw carlito annie and the clergyman looking at her with christian solicitude she heaved a sigh of relief a glass of brandy and water was administered and the patient was left to enjoy the benefits of quietude

a little later canon highfield sat in his study and carlito stood before him ready to hear what he had to say the canon seemed disquieted there was evidently something of much importance engaging his mind

before commencing to speak to you on what i intended he said i would like you to tell me carlito what you think has so effected ellen she seems of a curious temperament and i have acutely watched her movements of late and my pity has been aroused

so have i sir and i have come to the conclusion that she suffers from some nervous disorder

he then related his adventures of the night and said that he believed that it was the relation of this incident that caused ellen to swoon the canon too was much moved by the narrative

robert heineman you said carlito robert heineman he repeated again were i not accustomed to hear startling thingsâan experience that has steeled my nervesâi should have no doubt swooned like ellen

the canon paused a while and with a solemn pensive air shook his head having fairly collected his thoughts he looked at carlito and said gravely who says that the affairs of men are not governed and directed by a superior intelligence there is no such thing as chance and the atomist and materialist must give us more tangible evidence of the correctness of their theory of fortuitous circumstances the inscrutable force behind the universe as kant designates god with his excellent wisdom designs each separate link in the chain of circumstance connected with our being and though mans incompetent cognition cannot foresee the connections the links are suddenly united by one mystic touch and joined into a harmonious whole by the will of the almighty ruler of creation carlito the time has indeed come when what i had hitherto withheld from you must be told

canon highfleld then began to relate those startling facts which transpired between the tragic death of burleigh woodhouse and the time when he discovered carlito at the house of his late benefactor where he had remained for the period of five years in a condition of complete idiocy it is not necessary to repeat these details as the reader is already acquainted with them

there were some portions of the canons narrative that appeared to carlito like disconnected threads of an interesting dream but they were not so indelibly fixed on his brain as to reproduce perfect memories

do you see the hand of god pointing out your path and do you not see your remarkable destiny surely there are few men who have such wonderful horoscopes cast for them

carlito sighed he had listened with rapt attention and his facial muscles had undergone several changes

he uttered however never a word when the canon told him that he had good reasons for believing that ellen was no other than his longlost mother he glared wildly around him as if seized by consternation and ejaculated tremulously impossible you have almost bewildered me by your tale do not madden me sir i pray do not madden me ellen my mother  god can this be so help me sir i am overcome

and carlito leaned heavily upon the canon for support his next impulse was to rush into ellens room and throw himself joyfully into her arms but he had enough good sense to know that the emotions that such an action was likely to produce would be detrimental to her he therefore stood for a while with his head bent on his breast his hands extending downwards and clasped together while the saddest pathos rested in his eyes and the perpendicular lines on his brow became more distinct

why is it dear canon that you so suddenly conclude that ellen is my mother he asked after a few moments had passed

come with me and i will tell you my reason said the canon

he conducted him to his own bedroom upstairs and approaching a lifesize picture draped in black he removed the drapery and revealed a beautiful ebonyhued woman whose evenly chiselled features impressed carlito strongly

but who is this beautiful woman he enquired of the canon

it is your mother edith woodhouse that picture i took the liberty of taking from her baggage when she was thought to be lost forever

but how can you say then that you believe ellen is the same person there is certainly no resemblance between that picture and the wistful broken emaciated creature below

scarcely my boy you are very right indeed and up to a few moments before i spoke to you such apparent madness would not have entered my brain no i would not then have thought that ellen was identical with the handsome edith woodhouse although there was always something in her manner that seriously impressed me it is you who have unconsciously furnished me with the invaluable key for discovering the identity

why did your strange story so interest her and why did she swoon when she saw the pomegranate on your arm do you not see any resemblance between ellen and that picture now

carlito did not reply but gazed with rapt attention on the portrait

well i shall help you said the canon observe that mole on the cheek and that gentle curve on the under lip those thickset arched eyebrows and beautiful dark eyes sorrow and grief have almost recast the face but there are those marks which have not wholly been stamped out let us go downstairs the problem will find its solution soon

carlito as if struck dumb followed the canon into the study

the first part of my story is ended continued the canon when they were duly seated at the study table but there is something yet to follow which i know will pain you my brother has been seriously disturbed by the failing health of mary since her return from her visit to me the doctor has been called in to her on several occasions and has not been able to discover what is wrong it was concluded that owing to her peculiar isolated habits her nerves have been affected or that something rests on her mind under no circumstances would she tell her secret until she betrayed herself in sleep she called your name several times then clung to her pillow and pressed it passionately uttering words which however were not quite audible

this continued at intervals for some time on the last occasion her father determined to speak to her and obtain a confession she absolutely refused to say anything and was so shocked at the probable discovery of her secret that she fell into hysterics though she has regained her equilibrium she continues very weak and the doctor recommends a change of air my brother is of a naturally irate disposition and has unjustly poured forth anathemas against you he swears by all the powers of heaven that he will have you shot if he hears anything further about the matter i could not have imagined that there was any love affair between mary and yourself and if this be really so i deeply regret it this would be unsuitable attachment

carlito was naturally surprised at the canons words and though he hung down his head in a somewhat bashful manner the thought of mr highfields threat caused indignation to swell within his breast like a mighty river then as if seized with a sudden inspiration he said canon highfield it is a fact that an irresistible attachment has sprung up between your niece and myself for which neither of us is responsible and i cannot but say that it is evidently a lack of good sense on the part of your brother to allow his prejudice to blind his reason however he need have no fear as to the issue for fate and fate alone has set the boundary which cannot easily be overstepped

i have as much to regret in this unfortunate love affair as yourself carlito to begin with it is necessary that you should leave here at once in order to avoid any further complication you will have to give up the school and i shall seek somewhere else for a remunerative office where you will no longer meet the dangers which now sternly menace you

this is another instance of your paternal sympathy sir but i do not think i shall avail myself of it as i have other plans can you imagine why your brothers ire has been so much kindled against me is it my poverty

i am afraid it is the question of color the pigmentâyes the pigment and nothing more

but god has made of one blood all nations under heaven to dwell upon the face of the earth and since the mind is the standard of human excellence i do not see why the poor casket should be given preeminence may god help me to illustrate the brotherhood of the human family may god help me to show that virtue and integrity are far above the color of the skin or the facial characteristics of a man and may john highfield be thereby edified one day

the bell rang for tea and both men proceeded to the diningroom

o that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest

let ns leave carlito surveying carefully the intricate labyrinths of mysterious circumstances he had passed lifting his soul on high to the kind providence that had guided him onward through the misty gloom of a hard and stormy fate and placed him in view of the haven where he would secure peace and happiness rest and hope and glance at rita the charming spanish girl whose heart continues to beat with an unabating affection for him

it is one of those delightful evenings when the air is laden with the sweet perfume of lilies and roses and when the gentle zephyrs play wantonly among the trees imparting a pleasant bracing stimulus to the body

fireflies in their silvery beauty illumine the grassy plots here and there with their phosphoric brilliance as they gaily flit from blade to blade the monotonous croaking of the frogs hidden in the bushes blends with the music of the tiny crickets

rita had long ago returned from making her customary tour through the vast forest of cocoa trees over which she held absolute ownership and authority and before her modest home awaits her lovers accustomed visit he is long in coming and she begins to fear that something has happened to cause such unusual delay the clock strikes seven and his beloved footsteps have not yet sounded upon the pathway it strikes eight and with it the last lingering ray of hope dies she concludes that he will not come but hark

âthere is the sound of approaching footsteps her pulse throbs quicker and her heart leaps for joy he is coming at last she approaches the door her face aflush with delight but alas what disappointment

it is not he it is however a wellknown person who is on terms of friendship and who evinces much solicitude for her welfare it is cyril merton

i have rather gloomy news for you miss cedeno

said cyril after the usual civilities had been gone through

rita manifested interest and he continued

i all along have told you that carlito was not sincere in his professions of attachment to you and had made up his mind to slip the cable as soon as possible and leave you in the lurch

why do you say such unkind things of carlito

he would never deceive me he is too noble and good to stamp his name with perfidy do not wrong him mr merton

but he has sailed for southampton continued cyril with a haughty overbearing ring in his voice

impossible that can never be i would not believe it

well then i shall convince you

and cyril drew a copy of the port of spain gazette from his pocket and pointed out the name of carlito de la mar in the list of passengers who had sailed for southampton on the previous day by the steamship barraconta

no pen can picture the feelings of poor rita at this moment she wished the earth would take tender pity of her and engulf her miserable self in its depths the beauties and glory of life had now lost their charms for her and in a moment she turned her eyes away from them and prayed for death her chivalrous spirit assumed all its wild ardor and as her lofty pride felt the sharp darts of spurned insulted and abandoned love her eyes glared with a fierce unhallowed light she stood and mused awhile and then smiled an extraordinary smile it was evident that she had resolved upon some desperate deed

so he has really gone then she said turning to cyril

yes undoubtedly gone replied cyril sympathetically he is smitten by miss highfield who warmly reciprocates his affection as i have confidently told you more than a hundred times and if you had followed my advice you would have sent him about his business long ago before you permitted yourself to suffer such base humiliation

it is only now i can truly recognize your honesty and your worth as also the marks of sincere friendship which you have always evinced towards me

ah mr merton had i remembered your advice when carlito told me that he could not marry for some time i would have understood his meaningâbut it is too late all is irreparably lost and i must pay for my ignorance and folly too late too late

cyril merton did not go away that night from ritas home without securing the preliminaries for carrying out the monstrous schemes over which he had so long brooded in order to possess himself of the vast wealth that rita possessed he had the courage to ask her hand in marriage and she did not refuse it she no longer cared what happened to her though under ordinary circumstances she would never have thought of allying herself with cyril it now seemed a matter of small importance to her her love had been mockedâ cruelly mockedâby an unfaithful and wicked heart and she would now go blindly on troubling not herself with the indiscretion or discretion of her actions

it was not necessary to take all this pain there was no philosophy in gilding the road of shadows where she was now determinedly pursuing her course

the next day mr cox the village schoolmaster who had always been on intimate terms with her and who had taken much interest in her education was summoned to an interview he was a pleasant fatfaced elderly gentleman who smiled gracefully and inspired much confidence in all those with whom he came in contact to him was given the task of writing ritas last will and testament and when he had winked knitted his brow and looked serious he stared at rita and said whats matter me darling that you are going to do this now you anticipate that you are going to dieâa healthy stripling like you

but mr cox what are you saying she replied assuming an air of innocence do not the young die as well as the old

cox did not reply to this he might have thought much but he would not run the risk of endangering the possibility of gaining a few dollars in performing a comparatively easy task rita placed him in possession of her wishes which principally consisted in bequeathing all that she wras worth to her betrothed cyril merton the schoolmaster was shocked but did not venture to interfere further than was necessary rita observed his embarrassment and by way of satisfying his curiosity said i know you think my action strange but its all right mr merton has promised to marry me he has been very kind and gentlemanly toward me the marriage may be delayed for some time owing to unavoidable circumstances i am to go for a sea voyage with him this will be in a few days and so i mean to take his advice and have my business arranged before incurring the perils of the sea

that same day the document that made cyril merton heir of all the estates of rita cedeho was duly signed and sealed

alas for loveâfor womans breast if woe like this must be

mrs ilemana

cyril mertons plans were happily frustrated he had really intended to take rita across the sea and dispatch her by some foul means when he was certain that his heirship was well secured but he was spared the pains of redhanded murder

it was just seven days since rita had received the shocking news of carlitos flight it was friday afternoon about the time wrhen he usually came to see her and her thoughts wandered restlessly until they alighted on him

o heartless carlito she sobbed you have treated me so cruelly yet i cannot hate you and what have i done given another my heart while you are still alive nay i never meant it would that it were some dream some harassing nightmare but alas it is not so and you have run away from meâyour little spanish maid

she took off the medallion that carlito had hung around her neck and kissed it then placed it in an envelope with a slip of paper on which were written the following words unfaithful heart take back your tribute i want nothing from you i will rid myself of the pain which you have given me by dying like a true woman who cannot take back her love

the envelope bore the address of carlito de la mar and was placed on a table in a conspicuous place

she then went out bent upon the terrible deed which she had contemplated toward the serpentine stream girdled in by a belt of cocoa trees the unhappy girl wended her way there she had spent many pleasant afternoons sitting upon a stone listening to the rush of the waters and watching the tiny mudfish playing therein with a mirth and happiness which she did not envy them now toward  deep basin in that same stream she advanced with a firm and steady step while a frightful unearthly pallor sat upon her face she looked up at the skies with the gay clouds floating above then down at the earth where vegetation smiled under her feet she listened to the sweet melody of the brighthued birds whose notes had always pleased her and seemed to find some music in the dreadful deathly screech even of the horned owl she sank upon her knees and exclaimed  dios mio dios mio ayuda me all all is happiness i am of all beings on earth the most miserable

holy mary come to my assistance

she tried to say more but could not pray she rose from her knees with a sudden effort and casting both hands forward plunged into the water and sank from sight she rose again then sank and her hair floated on the surface of the water another moment and she would be no more but quick as lightning some one approaches the stream

it is carlito

without delaying a second he plunged into the water and ere rita sank for the third time with a firm and steady grasp he lifted her to the shore she was almost exhausted and carlito did all in his power to restore respiration his heart throbbed within him when he saw her open her eyes and gaze at him he entertained strong hopes of her recovery and when he had settled her in a favorable position he ran to the nearest house for help and sent for the doctor

doctor grayson was a clever physician and was able to afford rita temporary relief from the effects of her submersion but he confessed he had much greater difficulties to contend with which increased his fears of ultimate recovery

o spartan dog more fell than anguish hunger or the sea

look on the tragic loading of this bedj this is thy work

shakespeare

a terrible fever seized rita and after a few days the symptoms of pleuropneumonia set in which bore out the apprehensions of the physician the patient soon became entirely prostrated and a dry painful cough continually disturbed her la vieja matilda who was much concerned about her hijita was unremitting in her attention and her kindly disposition suggested every possible means to encourage rita to take the nourishment which was unsparingly provided but food was distasteful to the sick girl and a great deal of coaxing had to be done before she would consent to swallow a mouthful of bovril or beeftea her respiration was imperfect hurried and painful and the system soon became greatly debilitated at times during the day her thoughts wandered and she even became unconscious of all that went on around her don francisco verde walked to and fro in the room with gloomy brow whispering to himself no hay remedio la pobecita no es mas por este mundo  carlito had returned twice to see her but she persistently objected to his entering her room every its no use the poor girl cannot live

body was astonished at thisâattributing it to the vagaries of her nervous derangement

dr grayson advised carlito against attempting to intrude himself into her presence against her wish and intimated that in his opinion she was suffering from some maniacal delusion from which she would in time recover and recognize him

the good physician was right it happened that a few days later carlito was conversing with don francisco in a tone a little above a whisper when his voice seemed to be recognized by the invalid she called him to her bedside an unusual light beamed in her eyes and she seemed imbued with extraordinary strngth it was the first time since she had been laid on her couch that she had shown signs of returning reason

so you are here then carlito she said i cannot understand this it is heaven who has disappointed you and sent you back to see the result of your unfaithfulness ah wretch villain monster  why was i not allowed to die instead of looking upon you again

rita rita cried carlito with indescribable emotion be careful what you say or you will repent your words what wretch has been filling your mind with falsehoods you are not yourself think before you speak again such terrible words rita your excellent mind your winning face your womanly virtues will not shield you from my displeasure

better the everlasting hate of an unfriendly viper than the poisoned stings of feigned sincerity she replied in all the eloquence of her native tongue

in what way have i been unfaithful to you pray

is this the reward for my honesty

you think i do not know your aims but you are mistaken you have deceived me and are in love with mary highfield the niece of the canon of st pauls

you have been deceiving me all the time tell me how did your name come to be in the list of passengers booked for southampton surely you had a purpose and i believe you have met with disappointment

then you accuse me of perfidy of the blackest kind which my sense of manhood will not brook were you aphrodite incarnate and beaming with the virtues of lucretia this fact would not reunite the links which you have now ruthlessly shattered by your unpardonable insults and were you not armed with the strength of your womanly weakness i should have been unkind for once in my life and been goaded to desperation

rita cedena he continued with emotion i will tell you the storyâthe incorrect version of which has caused you to place me in the category of deceivers and then i shall leave your presence and these eyes shall never again gaze upon the woman who dared to look into them and call their owner untrue

rita became nervous as she saw the resolution in carlitos eyes and for once the terrible thought occurred to her that she might have judged wrongfully and that there might have been a misunderstanding somewhere

carlito continued i had really booked to sail by the barraconta for grenada on some urgent business thither i went and returned in a few days if you had paid the same attention to the paper of the following day you would have seen that an error had unfortunately been made by the reporter and i appeared as sailing for southampton instead of grenada this with my presence here at this moment is sufficient guarantee of the truth of my story

with these words he turned to leave the room

rita burst into a flood of tears a few minutes before she was in great pain and suffering now with an effort almost superhuman she threw herself from the bed and clutched carlito he turned round and watched her while tender pity came into his face

carlito carlito pity me she cried forgive me for wronging you you are still noble and good oh it was cyril merton who made me do this it was he who put these things into my head and heart against you forgive me forgive me my carlitoâand i shall quit this world in peace

she sank exhausted upon the floor

at the mention of cyril mertons name carlitos face assumed an awful frown but how could he be so inhuman as to turn his back upon the prostrate girl who looked into his eyes with all the penitence of keen remorse he stooped over her and gently took her in his arms and as he laid her upon the bed her pleading eyes once more sued for forgiveness he imprinted a soft kiss upon her lips and she gave a sigh of infinite relief

poor girl muttered carlito i forgive you from my heart that villain would overthrow a more subtle mind than yours but he shall receive his deserts some day if there be a god of vengence and he shall be crushed by his own fall

before carlito left ritas bedside that day there was restored that complete harmony which had before existed between them and ritas confidence in his constancy and uprightness became firmer than ever

as carlito was going through the gate the clattering of a horses feet was heard and cyril soon appeared upon the scene as they passed each other cyril made a polite bow which carlito did not return

something or other is up mused cyril to himself as he dismounted from his pony and approached the house

there was an abject fear within him which made him tremble and spurred him on toward the end of his fatal tetherâan end that he was sensible enough to foresee he spent a few moments in conversation with those who were present in the hall and was as usual soon permitted to enter ritas apartment she was dozing when he went in but was roused by the footsteps cyril approached the bed silently on his toes and peeped into her face rita endeavoured to raise herself and as her eyes rested upon him she burst forth out of my presence you have caused me to unjustly outrage a true gentleman by your lying tales

what you seekâmy wealthâhe shall receive and that which he spurnsâvillainy deceit and craftiness are yours and shall be yours

the most notorious villain whose constant atrocities shut out the light of conscience and who is prepared to commit the blackest crimes that a fiendish heart can suggest finds that the very strength on which he depends suddenly deserts him at the moment when his schemes have been exposed his true character then appears in the light of day he becomes vulnerable to the darts of the weakest of mortals and shrinks from the scene of exposure with the marks of ignominy written on his cowardly brow

it was pitiful to see the wretched man cyril merton leave the presence of rita whose words had penetrated into his breast like a stiletto one would have thought him demented perhaps such a conclusion would not have been far wrong for that was the last moment that that degenerate specimen of the human race was to enjoy the light of reason the symptoms of mania began to make themselves apparent ere he reached his home only to develop into a more pronounced form of insanityâwhich seemed to be a just punishment for his wickedness

she gazedâtill thoughts that long had slept shook all her thrilling frameâ she fell upon his neck and wept

mrs ilemans

the reader will remember that in the course of carlitos conversation with the reverend canon highfield he had refused to accept the offer which the latter had made to procure him a lucrative berth elsewhere after he had given due consideration to the circumstances by which his life was surrounded he determined to leave for australia in accordance with the advice of his ghostly visitant and seek out robert heineman who he had no doubt would be able to furnish some valuable information and support in the gigantic task that now absorbed himâthe task of ferreting out the murderer of his father and avenging his mothers wrrongs

canon highfield was decidedly in favor of this step

himself somewhat of a mystic he did not despise a voice from the dead he was naturally loth to part with carlito but being very much interested in the results of the adventure he put every possible means within his power to assist carlito in his undertaking

ellen had recovered from the effects of her swoon

the next day after the accident the canon called her into his study with the firm determination to make all clear

ellen he said in a voice as friendly as it was kind from the day you came to the rectory i have noticed something mysterious about you that wistful countenance you wear has more than once caused me to sympathize with you and to imagine that you must have seen better days do not for a moment keep back your history from me speak outright i feel confident that that face of yours on which honesty and truth are plainly stamped will not speak falsely

i have had my suspicions and i think the event of yesterday has afforded some clue to a solution of enigma

ellens face assumed a very anxious expression

annie annie called the canon

the tidy old housemaid entered attired in her smart cap and gay apron

bring me some brandy and water politely requested the canon

very well parson

annie rapidly retreated and in an instant reappeared with a goblet of water a bottle containing brandy and a couple of glasses in a waiter the clergyman poured out a good draught of the brandy which he gave to ellen and continued you will tell me all now ellenâwont you

she demurred at first after which she made an effort to speak which was interrupted by a stifling cough

have you known me or even seen me before you came to this place enquired the canon

the right chord was struck and the answer came forth i have

and do you remember where you met me first

ellen paused a while then in a faltering voice replied  in my own dear country canon

and which is that

the island of montserrat

that is many years ago isnt it

a good many years certainly sir

and you have seen much trouble sinceâhavent you that is quite evident

oh my troubles and sorrows are beyond expression to speak of them would be probing afresh the wounds that have eaten away my life

you are a widow i presume

yes sir

and when did your husband die

he did not die a natural death but was murdered many years ago

ellen burst into a flood of tears

do not weep so my poor woman sorrow may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning have you ever had any children

one sir

and where is he is he alive

yes sir if i am not mistaken if i am not mad if i am not mocked by fate i believe he yet lives

canon highfield asked no further questions but the words escaped his lips thank god there is no delusion it is a reality

and at the words he fell upon his knees a heavenly sweetness beaming upon his face while he poured forth his thankfulness to almighty god that his hopes had been truly realized he rose from his reverent posture and as ellen watched him anxiously he seized her hand while tears trickled down his cheeks and then exclaimed  the ways of god are past finding out who enter into the secret place of the most high edith woodhouse hugh highfield greets you providence decrees that you shall no longer pass disguised undei my roof and despite yourself the veil has been torn aside and we meet no longer as master and servant but as friends

you the wife of the unfortunate murdered burleigh woodhouse shall henceforth have the respect that is your due

mrs woodhouse for there was no longer any doubt of her identity was awestricken when she found that her secret was discovered the revelation had not been unexpected and had in a measure been prepared for unravelling she however could not suppress the tide of emotion that overwhelmed her and she threw herself into the canons arms and wept

compose yourself delady he said with this discovery the night has disappeared and behold the mom with its glorious brightness is at hand

but another scene equally touching was soon to follow carlito had just entered when this little drama was being enacted the sobs from the study had attracted his attention and he turned his steps in that direction

the canon thereupon took him by the hand and led him toward mrs woodhouse with the words madam here is your son carl woodhouse here is your mother

mrs woodhouse embraced her son with all the passionate ardour of a tender loving mother and the maternal affection that had been so long buried within her breast now burst forth with intense force

carlito was almost dazed when the reality of the presence of that mother of whom he had heard such tales of suffering and sorrow broke upon him

annie entered the room as mrs woodhouse and her boy stood face to face with their countenances eloquently expressing the feelings that permeated their hearts at that supreme moment and which words were too feeble to express

annie said the canon breaking the solemn silence henceforth mr de la mar becomes mr carl woodhouse he is the son of this lady and she whom you knew as plain ellen must in future be known as mrs edith woodhouse and respected as being a wellbred lady who was at the sunny period of her life an intimate friend of mine an evil destiny has clouded her life but the day of her troubles is now ended

annie stood spellbound when the canon had finished his speech and she opened her little eyes wider than she had ever done before and placing her thumb in her mouth shook her hand frantically when she had recovered from her astonishment she said i do not grudge ellen her good fortune beg yo pardon milady i mean mrs woodhouse i always used to think she was something as i often tell you sir what is in de bones can come out and when a pusson is bring up a lady or a gentleman de real character will always shine bove de pot sut sometimes when she used to talk to me i couldnt understand she an i use to quarrel an say she playing english lady but afterward when she watch me so an smile wid such a heavenly smile pon he face i had to say she cant help for she dictionnecessary word because she must have been well brought up i am glad that de lawd has help you in your trouble and bring you to dis moment mistress you have a precious chile an he will be sure to make you mose well god bless you two maam

she made a respectful courtesy and was about to leave the room when she was strictly warned by the canon not to mention to any one what had occurred

in a few moments mrs woodhouse related her remarkable history we saw her last launched in a tiny boat on the broad ocean by merciless villains who had doomed her to a terrible end providence however frustrated their designs the boat drifted on and on until it came under the lea of martinique where the frail occupant was rescued by some french fishermen who took her ashore and extended her their hospitality

she continued in the island for some time and did good work as governess in an english family

she was however induced to leave her employment by a person who misled her into believing that he could find a more lucrative situation for her in cayenne

monsieur gardier for that was the name of this individual was a general commission agent and undertook a contract for supplying a number of immigrants to cayenne he was a man of no principle though he endeavoured to force himself upon his credulous victims as a man of high moral qualities and sound religious principles this was the cloak under which he had concealed his real infamy and it was this which crowned his energy with unbounded success mrs woodhouse like many others had fallen a prey to his machinations

she agreed to put herself under his care as a passenger aboard his vessel to cayenne on the voyage she received every mark of respect and it was only when the shores of cayenne were sighted that the demeanour of mr gardier became suspicious mrs woodhouse approached him with a view to obtaining some necessary advice and information from him but received for her anxious enquiry a ringing ironical laugh followed by the startling words you are to be indentured as an immigrant madam and you will please give me no more of your nonsense

get below boys strike up the good old song

and the wellknown refrain ive reached the land of corn and wine rent the air as it burst forth from scores of throats

mrs woodhouse now felt all the terrors of despair

she endeavoured to speak but her tongue clave to the roof of her mouth she had become temporarily speechless and her eyes spoke utter bewilderment it followed that she was indentured for a period of seven years as a domestic servant where she endured the greatest physical and mental suffering after her term of indenture had expired she went to trinidad where she was eking out a miserable existence in extreme poverty and complete obscurity in the malarial district of chaquanas it was from this place that she ventured out with a strong determination to improve her condition when the tide of fortune turned

it is needless to say that this story considerably impressed carlito and the canon

on being informed by the latter that he had quite recently received news from lindsay who was taking a vacation in the beautiful island of grenada mrs

woodhouses heart beat with joy and she immediately decided to communicate with her sincere friend who she felt certain would be filled with delight to see her once more in the flesh it was arranged therefore that she should leave for grenada that week

vainly we offer each ample oblation vainly with gifts would his favor secure richer by far is the hearts adoration dearer to god are the prayers of the poor

heber

there was no extraordinary demonstration when carlito woodhouse who had taken a short vacation boarded the steamer with his mother with the intention of accompanying her to grenada there were a few busybodies who wondered if the highly respected and learned young gentleman had lost his senses when he allowed himself to be seen in such close relations with a common domestic servant however their faith in mr de la mars unstained character was sufficient to imbue them with the idea that he was despite ugly appearances perfectly able to take care of himself and to maintain his dignity sans peur et sans reproche

the trip across the channel was most delightful a clear sky and placid sea increased the pleasure of the voyage while the balmy breezes that swept over the waters produced a most exhilarating effect

as the steamer sailed into the harbour of grenada the towering mountains in their vernal splendour grey hills and picturesque houses attracted the attention of mother and son andrihev rose with light hearts to gaze upon them

mrs woodhouse stole from her stateroom where she had been indulging in reading plutarchs lives

and went out to meet carl her heart seemed to burst with inexplicable delight as she looked forward to her reunion with maud after so many years of separation

in about half an hour after the barraconta had dropped anchor carl and his mother were on their way to bellevue cottage to be the guests of mrs maud lindsay

it is not necessary to lift the curtain and reveal the touching scenes that were acted in that first half hour when the two longseparated friends were once more thrown together the reader can but imagine the waves of sympathy and spontaneous human emotion that rose high and mighty during those moments and submerged the soul in the very depths of tenderness and love

carlito was pleased to be introduced to the friend of his mother and was much taken with her he learned that lindsay would join them as soon as he got an opportunity to do so

having been fairly satisfied that his mother was duly installed under the kind and hospitable roof of her hostess he again sailed for the land of the humming bird

carl for so we will now call him took the earliest opportunity of calling upon his fiancee the little note that rita had written and placed in a conspicuous position on the table was the means of saving the rash girl from an untimely end carl had discovered it a few moments after it was written and alarmed at its contents he had hastened to the river the reader is already acquainted with the result

rita continued much prostrated and anxious friends unceasingly enquired after her condition she was a good kindhearted girl and had won the esteem of every one round the village

carl had abandoned his school to the deep regret of both parents and scholars and was bent upon carrying out his resolution to sail to australia in search of that important personage robert heineman he was obliged however to postpone his voyage and await the result of ritas illness

the canon was in no great hurry to part with him especially since his brothers ire had somewhat subsided mary had left her home and had gone elsewhere for a change by the doctors advice carl had never ventured to enquire about her movements although he felt much interested in her the fact was the only person he would have cared to ask was the canon and he maintained strict reticence

the young lover paid every attention to his betrothed and whenever possible was found at her bedside

it was a bright moonlight evening when a delicatelyshaped figure closely veiled without ceremony entered ritas bedroom approached the couch whereon the sick girl lay and throwing off her shawl and bonnet laid her hand tenderly on the invalid

how are you this evening rita said the visitor âmaryâi have been anxious to learn how you were and not hearing i have stolen away from home to come and see you

rita with a pleasant smile upon her pale wan features turned and looked up

so you are not afraid you might one day be trapped in coming to see me

no darling was the reply even though i know i am running a great risk i am willing to take the consequences since i feel there is something that links us together

ah how kind and good you are whenever you come to see me i always feel better because i love you so much and now that i feel i am making my journey homewards i would like to see your kind loving face as often as possible but tell meâ why does the doctor prevent you from coming this way

my father has strictly requested that dr spencer should not allow me to come in this direction

do tell me what reason he has for this i am anxious to know are there traps hidden away to hold you

no no iiita but if you are so anxious to know i shall not hide it from you in order to do this i must begin at the beginning though i have never seen mr

de la mar here i know that he comes to see you often

well he and i have met and loved my father has discovered this and hates him some telltale has informed him that mr de la mar is a constant visitor at your home and he does not want us to meet under any circumstances whatever though i have clearly stated to papa the impossibility of anything arising out of such a meeting he still insists on my not coming but it is honor alone and not his veto that arrests the progress of our love it is you rita and not the voice of the multitude who have fixed this gulf between mr de la mar and myself

how questioned rita in a tone savouring of surprise

 rita i am no hypocrite and my soul would  rebuke me if i hid what you must hereafter know if i touch a tender chord in your nature or arouse your jealousy i hope you will be charitable enough to forgive me

when first i met carlito de la mar my heart went out to him his brilliant intellect his winning manners his noble character his ambition to scale the ladder that leads to the temple of fameâall seriously impressed me and when i examined my own heart i found that i loved him yes loved him passionately i tried to keep it secret but in vain the impress had been too indelibly stamped upon me and nothing could remove it in an unguarded moment i betrayed my feelings and i found that he loved me too

rita do not sigh it was not his fault that he was exposed to the darts of love it would have been his fault if he had sacrificed honor and principle with his soul overflowing with emotion he told me he had pledged his word to a simple spanish maiden whom he could not forsake that simple spanish maid has now developed into the charming lovable rita whom i think worthy of his noble heart ah how i regarded him almost as a demigod at that moment when the dagger pierced my heart when he bowed with heroic resignation like any son of sparta and with the tears streaming from his eyes said feelingly i cannot be yours since then i have always thought tenderly of you and cannot but love any one who is allied to such an exalted being by any ties whatever

ah dear lady replied rita years of serious thought have entirely changed me and i now see things differently from what i saw them in the days of childhood when carlito and i played together were it then i should have stabbed you for confessing that he loved you really and only thought he loved me but since my reason has taught me some of the mysteries of love i am wiser and less impulsive there is therefore no room in my breast for foolish jealousy of such an angel as you are though i am bound to confess that when it came to my ears that carlito loved you and intended to deceive me and to marry you i despaired of life and sought to destroy myself but it was all a lie which was invented by a fortunehunter

the allwise father spared me to see that my darling was as true as ever

before she had ended the door was thrown ajar and carl appeared

rita looked anxious and a ray of pleasure stole across her wan pale face

he advanced toward her and bowed politely to the female figure standing in close proximity to the couch then leaning over rita he pressed her withered hands and imprinted a loving kiss on her parched lips

you do not know this person said rita in a half whispering tone

carl turned to scrutinize the face before him then ejaculated  heavens miss highfield is it really you

yes carlito replied mary highfield

some startling events have happened of late my dear mary and i have had to tax my brain to decide whether my senses are intact or whether i have passed into dreamland i knew you had been sent for a change of air somewhere but never for a moment thought it was this way what curious coincidences do really happen in life i am very glad to meet you after such a long separation and hope that your health has improved

thank you carlito i am very much better and hope soon to be quite well again

rita turned her face toward them both and smiled sweetly

miss highfield she said were it possible for me to live and become carlitos wife i would have taken hope that although he loved you more than me he would have learned to give me his undivided affection and now that the angel of death beckons me to the other land i leave him free to take you to his heart

i shall die happy when i know that he will become the husband of an unselfish pureminded woman like you

i do not envy you your happiness and in token that i do notâsee carlito give me your hand  miss highfield yours

she joined marys hand with carls and whispered solemnly  dios y la virgen santissima vos bendigan

having done this she sank exhausted upon her pillows while mary and carl stood with tears in their eyes gazing at the emaciated face in which two lustrous orbs seemed to shine more brilliantly than ever

overwhelmed with emotion carl leaned over the dying girl and pressed his lips to hers mary followed his example and rita opened her eyes slightly and smiled then closed them again

a week passed and it became evident from her sunken condition that she could not last much longer dr

grayson who continued unremitting in his attention shook his head ominously whenever don francisco or la vieja matilda enquired after ritas condition and said i think all hope is lost now its no use hiding it from you i expect the worst the lungs are almost gone and it is as evident as daylight that she cannot last long

the services of padre domingo sylvain were immediately requisitioned and he administered to the spiritual wants of the dying girl

carl was in his study busily engaged in painting an interesting picture when some one rapped at the door

he laid down his brush and opened it in answer to the call

he fell back in amazement as his eyes fell upon the distorted countenance of cyril merton the mans eyes were bloodshot and seemed to be dropping out of their socket his face was besmeared with dirt and his once beautiful raven hair was almost gray and fell in a disordered mass on his neck there were numerous bruises about his head which told that that member had been subjected to extraordinary violence he raved fiercely and the expression in his eyes was frightful in a moment the indignation which had been piling up in the breast of carl against the underhanded and unprincipled cyril merton now gave way before the rushing stream of pity that rose within him as he contemplated the miserable specimen of manhood before him

cyril uttered in a loud voice words that startled carlito

you are the king of the world said he and the mighty empires of rome assyria carthage and phoenicia are now at your feet look at your brilliant white steed are you riding forth to battle yes you are great indeed carlito de la mar but i have come to conquer you and conquer you i will do you not see that jupiter has sent me armed with power to hurl you from your mighty throne i have her now in my possession that glorious queen the lady whom you robbed me of she is now in my castle on the blue mountains over there and i shall carry her over to the domains of my master who has sent me to reclaim her ha ha carlito of destruction you are defeated by a mightier hand than yours

with those words he turned away and left carlito wrapped in pity and amazement

poor fellow he said as he shook his head sadly

how has this mans infamy recoiled upon his own head

a few moments later a painful train of thoughts passed through his mind

after all he mused there must be some method in this mans madness i am afraid that something can be gathered from his ravings what queen is it which he had taken away from me and borne to his blue mountains can it be that rita has become worse and that this is the form of words which his madness allows his lips to employ to boast of his triumph no  but this cannot be the man is evidently too insane to show the least possible sign of reason

ah the foolish fears that will sometimes invade the breast of a rational man

a strange medley of thoughts continued to grow and trouble him and in order to gain some respite he ordered his pony and started for x to see how rita fared about two furlongs from her home he met the good father sylvain from whom he ascertained that he had administered extreme unction to rita who was undoubtedly perfectly reconciled and was prepared to meet her fate with a heavy heart the young man hastened his steps and as he stepped upon the threshold of the door of that gloomy home wherein lay the prostrate form the once beautiful casket that contained the bright loving soul of rita cadeno that was now fleeting onwards to its eternal home a picture filled with pleasant reminiscences and affectionate associations appeared before him and his breast swelled with a deep tenderness almost womanly

he had recovered somewhat when he entered ritas bedroom she looked at him with sunken eyes lit with a heavenly light and her livid lips parted to utter her greeting

so you are come at last she said i have deen waiting so long for you will you prop me up that i may lean upon you for the last time i have not many more hours to live

carl did as he was bid and when he felt that she was resting comfortably he looked at her sadly

do not be sad she murmured placing her arms around his neck lovingly i am only going home and you will meet me over there some day may god forgive me the one rash act of my life which has resulted in my untimely end two things i shall ask you ere i close my eyes upon this world the first is that you will forgive the intrigues of cyril merton his condition demands my sympathy and forgiveness only yesterday he raved outside the house and would not be appeased until he saw me i have wept for him my second request is that if you do lot marry that sweet angel mary highfield promise me that you will marry no other woman

carl was somewhat struck by this strange request

he had just discovered the cause of those expressions of the lunatic cyril merton and his mind was still dwelling upon the incident that had caused him to be at ritas bedside at that moment when he was again plunged into serious reflection he could not for a moment resist the sad sweet light in those dying eyes and replied impulsively yes darling i shall promise you that

then i shall die in peace knowing that you will keep your word

they were alone and the golden streaks of sunset crept in gently through an open window

the time has now come when i must deliver to you what i can no longer keep

carl felt surpised but his astonishment became more intense when she took from under her pillow a bunch of keys and having selected one of them she directed him to open her chest of drawers and take therefrom a small box carl obeyed and handed to her a beautiful mahogany casket with rich engravings and the initials c de la m cut on the outside

this is yours carl my father at his death asked me to keep it until you were about to be married her tone became weaker and her words less coherent i will not live to see that day so you must take it now

its contents i do not know and since i have kept faith and curbed my curiosity you must do likewise until that day arrives

she had grown weaker and her whole weight was thrown upon carl who tenderly brushed back the locks that covered her face

put me down she whispered carlito will you read for me that beautiful hymn that you taught me once

he began to read the inspiring verses of the hymn let saints on earth in concert sing

she smiled sweetly at him as he ended and made an effort to draw him nearer to her but the hand fell back heavily and carl realized that the end was approaching he bent tenderly over her she clasped his hand with the fervor of death

the angels are waiting she whispered goodnight darling

the bar was crossed the spirit had taken its wings and had soared aloft to the everlasting mansions of the blessed

where hath not woman stood strong in affections might a reed upborne by an everlasting current

anon

the genius of love having contrived a meeting between carl and mary a few days after ritas interment they then pledged their hearts sincerely to each other and vowed that though at present insurmountable obstacles stood in their way they would spare no effort to remove them so that they might eventually secure the object that they both so earnestly desired

the long wishedfor day for his departure dawned and carl amid the encouraging words of canon highfield and the kindly expressions of his most intimate friends boarded the steamer solent bound for australia

let us leave him enjoying the pleasures of his long trip across the ocean and indulging in all kinds of fancies as to the possible result of his remarkable adventures and follow the beautiful erudite mary highfield who has sufficiently convalesced to return from her temporary home amid the wild scenes of x to her fathers house

well mary said her father one day in the paroxysm of gout bring me my slippers by jove i think i shall have to take some radical steps against these blooming feet if they wont let me alone ahâ by the byeâyou are becoming yourself again little dear another month would have made you as pink as a rose but you see i couldnt burden dr spencer any more with you you must have the finishing touch here

i considered it was too much study that had turned your head and made you dream of the negrito savant

its all right now its all right i guess and i wont apprise your bright soldier cousin of your mania

mary blushed she read the purport of these words but the change that came over her face was not perceived by her father who in the same strain continued sooth my nerves darling sooth my nerves by playing one of those lovely pieces you know

mary went to the piano and in her rich soprano voice sang that spirited song les italiens en algiers

while her fingers moved gracefully over the keyboard

the old man was pleased and as the music charmed him he kept time with his head it was the zenith of his happiness to sit on the balcony in the cool of the evening and hear mary discourse sweet music he loved her more than tongue can express and in her all his hopes were centered imagine therefore the condition of mind in which his apprehensions concerning the clandestine affair between carl and herself had thrown him

there was to be a ball at the brownes the leading society folk of the district colonel browne had been in the army and had fought in several engagements which had added glory and territory to the british empire and as old age approached he retired on a decent pension and settled with his two handsome daughtersâchildren of a second marriageâin an oldfashioned yet comfortable building in the suburbs of the town these spoiled girls were attended by a governess who was also fond of amusement and who encouraged them in their penchant for pleasure

at this ball mary was one of the honored guests

gathered in the spacious drawingroom was the elite of society

mary was the last guest to enter and the grace with which she passed across the room coupled with the rich beauty of her face caused the attention of all present to be centred upon her beautiful faces there wereâ many tooâwithin that hall but their light was eclipsed by the effulgence of a far greater luminary

little violet brownes heart suddenly leaped as handsome young gerald chesters suddenly left off pressing her hand to gaze with open mouth upon mary

why do you stare so hard at miss highfield

enquired violet

that question ought not to be directed to me alone violet i am not singular in this

but is she so pretty do you think she is already labeled engaged none need apply 

to whom enquired chesters

oh all the world knows that her cousin bertie melville has won her hand it is expected that he will marry her when he returns from the continent i hear mr highfield is much taken with the match and i have it upon good authority that he intends to make over thirteen thousand pounds to herâlat least so he told papa

then poor tommy atkins will have a good unction to soothe the bullet wounds he must have received during his campaigns said chesters laughingly and then turning to a thickset pleasantfaced fellow who had just come up and overheard the latter part of the conversation have you not heard this leslie he said

i have not said leslie with an air of the knowall personage young melville had better remain where he is and keep company with cold steel rather than expose himself to a snubbing and a broken heart he will never get those thirteen thousand pounds though the old nick stands at the door dont you see poor merton has gone stark mad it was that enchantress that turned him so the world believes she has locked her affection against all others except the sable plato who went to australia some time ago

do you really mean that there was a rumour i remember about some love affair between de la mar and miss highfield but i thought it rubbish and gave it no place in my mind

that can certainly never be true mr leslie put in violet do you think mary would be so foolish

i beg your pardon miss browne replied leslie in a suave yet impressive tone i am positive that what i assert is correct besides obtaining certain information from an authorative source holingsworth who is the second clerk at the post office informs me that he has spotted de la mars writing on an envelope bearing the australian postmark addressed to miss highfield

ah mr leslie you are telling tales out of school

chided violet with a gentle rippling laugh

then the post office is no longer an inviolable institution

since there are powerful detectives there put in chesters with a sarcastic twitching of the lips

a rather unpleasant compliment for mr holingsworth remarked violet

it does not matter what your opinion may be said leslie unable to conceal his displeasure since you take my remarks with so much irony i will leave you to find out for yourself

mary continued to be the cynosure at which all gazes were directed that evening her courteous and gentle manners attracted and impressed all and there were sincere hearts that would have given their lifes blood to win that sweet child of nature on whom that dear old mother had lavished the most bewitching adornments

that same night after the party broke up colonel browne and his daughters sat around a table in deep conversation the old gentleman betrayed unusual excitement and from the unpleasant look which lilyâ the younger of the two girlsâcast at violet now and then it was evident that the latter had aroused the colonels ire by some imprudent remark

never mind papa said violet tapping her father gently on the shoulder you must never believe such nonsense i never took it seriously

dont mind what you believe thundered the old soldier i know a great deal more about this than you and by jove i shall put john upon the scent at once or hang me for a rogue its all nonsense and though i break the chaps heart the thing must be nipped in the bud ere it gets beyond control

the colonel rose from his seat in a flurry while the two girls stood up astonished and watched him disappear into his room

you were wrong violet to have mentioned anything to papa of such a nature said lily

yes darling but i had never dreamt of such results

and the opening act of a most pathetic drama commenced

how sublime a thing it is to suffer and be strong

longfellow

four months had passed since carl bade an revoir to the shores of trinidad but they seemed like four years to the anxious loving mary who more than ever prayed for his speedy return

since his departure she had received one letter from him which reported his safe arrival at melbourne she had placed that letter in her bosom near her heart after having watered it with tears of love

of late she became distressed in consequence of the exhibition of a sudden coldness toward her by her once devoted father and the elaborate formality that accompanied his intercourse with her

john highfield was a perfectly changed man toward his daughter and though mary sought by every means in her power to restore the old relationship that had become so mysteriously strained nothing would induce the resolute old sire to breathe a familiar word of love or to make one of those customary requests the performance of which always gave her so much pleasure

however it was not long before she discovered the nature of the barrier that stood between them

a few hours after the arrival of the english mails one morning mr highfield though suffering intensely from his old complaint ordered his carriage to take him down to the post office

mary heard the order and advancing towards her father said with a somewhat sad expression papa why are you going out this ugly morning

im sure joseph can bring up the mails as usual you were so unwell last night and i felt so much for you

although you are so cold toward me you cannot imagine the love of an affectionate daughter

mr highfield did not seem to listen to the sweet voice of the girl and reiterated his command to the groom

papa dear papa why treat me thus this will surely break my heart

and poor mary turned away and sitting down she burst into tears

the trap was drawn up at the door and as mr

highfield prepared to enter by a sudden impulse she caught his hand but he shook her off with disdain

half an hour had elapsed when mr highfield alighted from his carriage and stepped into the house with an expression of determination on his face he went straight to his office and placed upon the table a pile of newspapers and letters but there was one letter âopenedâthat he still kept in his hand

come here mary he called aloud do you remember this writing he asked

i do replied mary trembling in every limb

well then miss highfield i hope i shall be excused for an infringement of the code of etiquette if in exercising the prerogative of a father i have broken the seal of your letter which i now hand to you i have indeed given you credit for a higher ambition than that of which this communication has convinced me i can no longer feel myself justified in identifying myself with a daughter who seeks to bring disgrace on the honored name of highfield and much as i have loved you i now spurn and despise you henceforth i shall extend to you no fatherly protection and i expect that you will leave my house before the night closes and may the just judgment of heaven repay your disobedience

mary listened with astonishment to these determined words but having drawn herself up to her full height she assumed an air of dignity and returned slowly and impressively papa i have not much to say in reply to your harsh expressions for fear that i should for a moment be guilty of disrespect of using some word that may savour of unkindness to you who are responsible for my being

nevertheless it is necessary to tell you that since you have deemed it proper to deprive me of your home and protection i shall never till my latest day cease to remember that you were capable of turning me out upon the streets and thereby giving the lie to the exalted opinion i have always held of you though i henceforth go through the world without your paternal smiles this fact shall not prevent me from being a true woman and from maintaining the dignity of my sex

you spurn me because i have responded to my own natural feelings in loving a youth whose only crime is that he wears a darker skin ah my father would that your blinding prejudices would allow you to see that the pigment is but the guinea stamp i had rather face your displeasure and be true to his noble soul than forsake him and be reinstated in your affection your daughter has spoken goodbye for ever my once beloved father and if we meet no more in life may our onward march toward the eternal home be directed in the same path

she moved off with the grace of a duchess while her father folded his arms before him and looked at her in bewilderment as she disappeared from his view he clenched his fist bit his lips and stamped with anger

mary soon prepared to leave her home and she determined also to leave the district altogether and cast in her lot with strangers she would not entertain the idea of placing herself under the care of her uncle for fear that she might cause the good man some pain by refusing to listen to his counselsâwhich she anticipatedâto abandon her lover

four oclock had just struck when a cab drew up at john highfields door and called for his daughter

mary without any hesitation entered with her luggage consisting of a large trunk and a basket then bade the cabman drive to the railway station

as the vehicle sped on at a rapid rate she lifted the curtain and gazed with tearful eyes upon her fastreceding home which perhaps she might never again enter as she sat in the train a terrible sensation crept upon her and she was weak enough to wish herself once more revelling in the sunshine of her fathers love

she took up her handbag and drew therefrom a neatly bound copy of the new testament and turned over the leaves until she alighted on the story of the prodigal son a fewr teardrops fell upon the leaves of the sacred volume and the expression on the face of the unhappy girl was sadder than can possibly be told in words but when the train arrived at st joseph the conflict within her ceased she drew from her bosom a letter and began to read it the effect was marvellous it was the glorious sunshine after the black and stormy night it wras the oil that calmed the troubled ocean into gentle sleep the letter ran thus melbourne australia

dearest mary i am happy to tell you that i have been most fortunate in my peregrinations up to the present brilliant success has attended my adventures i shall be in trinidad accompanied by a most valued friend before christmas how long the time seems since we parted verily true love has the power of converting days into years the loving thoughts of you which constantly fill my breast make me wish that mans genius might soon reach that stage when it shall render possible the annihilation of distances

i shall come back to you my love before long providence being my guide meanwhile you must pray for my speedy return

with a heart overflowing with love i remain yours fondly carlito

mary replaced the missive in her bosom just at the moment when the train steamed into port of spain

that same evening she entered incognito one of the hotels of the city under the assumed name of gertrude manners here she continued for some days awaiting the result of the following advertisement which she caused to be inserted in the daily papers a young lady conversant with spanish french german and italian besides possessing a thorough english education is desirous of obtaining a position as governess in a family reply to duke office of this paper

this advertisement continued to appear for a few weeks without any satisfactory result to mary this was indeed most unfortunate for her she had anticipated that her accomplishments would have attracted immediate attention and she had not exercised much economy in spending the small amount that she had brought from home with the diminution of her funds it soon became necessary to avail herself of cheaper apartments so she at once hired a small room in the beautiful and healthy environment of belmont where she cosily installed herself

day after day she scanned the papers with the hope that her advertisement might be answered but she was doomed to be continually disappointed she spent most of her time in manufacturing fancy articles which she occasionally sold to the neighbors about thus replenishing now and then her depleted exchequer

one morning however she found herself actually penniless and without any hope of obtaining a single meal for the day she sat in a melancholy mood near a window looking out upon the radiant sky a little bird hopped upon a twig nearby and chiruped sweetly and as it glanced now and then at the pale face at the window seemed to enquire what was the burden that hung so heavily upon her mary was interested in the pretty little thing and watched it eagerly and lovingly as it alighted on the ground and proceeded to pick up a few worms she did not move from her seat until the bird had flown when she burst into tears

what little faith have i she said that i should have mistrusted providence and rendered myself unhappy thereby when that little creature among the smallest that came from the mighty fathers hand is so happy and so wellcared for ah i am a coward and cannot face adversity nay worseâi am a hypocrite why have i professed christianity and pretended implicit faith in christ when i tacitly ignore his divine direction in all things is the servant greater than his lord can our vile hearts not consent to share a small portion of the tribulations of our great leader who sacrificed himself upon the alter of an allabsorbing love may god forgive me for my faithlessness 

with these words she began to sing in a melodious and spirited tone the following lines of miss warings beautiful hymn there are briars besetting every path that call for patient care there is a cross in every lot and a constant need for prayer yet a lowly heart that leans on thee is happy anywhere

from that day forward although mary struggled against fearful oddsâsometimes going to bed hungry and tiredâshe never lost confidence in him who clothes the lilies of the field with magnificent splendour and tempers the wind to the shorn lamb she awaited patiently the day when her weeping would be turned into joyâthat most glorious day that should bring her face to face with him she loved the remembrance of her sufferings would only sweeten their cup of love and draw closer the links that should ever after unite them

she gave up all hope of receiving any reply to her advertisement and one afternoon she wended her way into the city to see if she could get anything there to do she was returning much dispirited having met with no success when she turned her steps to the burial ground it was a place to which she had often resorted since her residence in the city a melancholy haunt for a melancholy soul within the precints of this vast enclosure she sat down and contemplated this fleeting life in all of its phases

there was a gravedigger busy at work preparing a grave for one who had died a few hours before and as the stalwart worker threw up spadefuls of heavy moist earth he whistled a lively air and seemed quite at home in his vocation but marys heart grew sick and a sensation of awe and curious fear struck her as she recollected that down there in that cold damp earth she would one day be laid to be the feast of worms

what is poor frail man after all she mused

and as if to accentuate her expressions the grave diggers spade struck a hard substance which proved to be a skull this he threw up without the least ceremony and it fell with a thud at marys feet she recoiled from the repulsivelooking object and it was not until she had recovered her selfpossession that she again drew near to it and scrutinized it

were you not afraid to handle that thing quarmin she asked

no maam is been use to dem for over thirty years now and de lawd knows i hab no hesitashun in handlin it to me is de same like teckine up a piece o dirt

but it might have belonged to a great man hence you ought to treat it with more reverence

excuse me maam dis is only de paper in which de nice tings was wrap if it was belong to a great and good soul dis dont matter anyting now de real man is now living wid de lawd

yes poor illiterate man mused mary simple demonstration of a marvellous truth what does this earthly structure which must soon dissolve into its proper elements matter the man lives  the energy the ego the soul or call it what you will that once enlivened the frail casket is indestructible and these works whether for good or evil that were evolved from that silent sad casement must leave their influence on mankind when the clay shall have been transformed into new creations pythagoras anaxagoras zeno and you sweet hypatiaâillustrious beacons of classic philosophy you who labored to dive into the deeper depths of human thought to find those principles which should elevate your species and satisfy its moral social and religious instinctsâthe shortcomings of your ethics are evident socrates your splendid idealisms have failed the voice that you heard is not the right voice this poor ignorant gravedigger in his simple faith has within his grasp the everlasting keystone that you sought with all the ardour of your intellectual natureâand did not find the mysteries of mind have been solved not according to pagan myth but according to the revelations of the incarnate son of god

better the least in the kingdom of paley than the greatest in the kingdom of aristotle poor skull what was once your complexion black white or yellow

were you beautiful what was the color of your eyes

were they rich blue hazel brown or black was your dome covered with glossy raven locks or coarse wool ah you seem to frown at me as if to accuse me of folly my blood thrills as i imagine what beauty might have adorned you where is all this i fancy i hear you replying in plaintive solemn tones no more no more touching reality who therefore will be so supremely foolish as to worship poor frail flesh and ignore the powerful claims of the mind is the university professor particular about the physique of euclid theon pythagoras galileo or newton

who ever remembers the form or color of hippocrates pasteur or the illustrious hervey when associating their names with their gifts to humanity the most superficial would not sink to such trifles what christian soul will ignore cyrenian simon bearing his lords cross while he reveres the memory of tender mary performing the work of love at her masters feet these noble minds have all left their footprints on the sand of time which are as indestructible as the source from which they emanated

marys musings had quite startled old quarmin who concluded that she had too much lamin and that her head was a leetle crazy and when she left the cemetery that afternoon the simple man leaned on his spade for a full quarter of an hour and considered with pity in his eyes the handsome leetle young lady w tith the sad eyes and mournful face who he expected would one day be an inmate of a lunatic asylum

there is an old adage which says it never rains but it pours and it is a remarkable fact that one calamity treads upon the heels of another so likewise it may be said that when the fountain of joy is once opened it flows delightfully on into streams of happiness such was the case with mary highfield with her countenance beaming with pleasure she laid on the table near her a note she had just received from the editor of the port of spain gazette telling her that her services as governess were immediately required by a wellknown french family who requested that she should call at the bee hive the next morning

glancing over the columns of the mornings paper she was filled with delight when her eyes fell upon de la mars name in the list of passengers who had arrived the day before from southampton it was with much difficulty that she controlled her feelings

her first act was to indite a letter to the good editor who had written to her and declare her inability to accept the position which she had but a few days before so eagerly sought having done this she wrote the following letter to carl who she inferred had gone to x on his arrival

belmont p o spain

my darling carlito imagine my surprise when i saw your arrival announced in this mornings paper can i give thanks enough to god for having brought you back again safely to me your own true love you are by this time aware of all the suffering and sorrow which i have endured for your sake a fathers anathemas a life of privation misery and isolation a heart almost broken with suspense but the cloud has passed away and now i think only of that happy moment when we shall meet again i need not tell you that i shall suffer the pangs of suspense until i receive word from you

i am still your darling mary

p s when you come enquire at the post office for miss manners and should you write address your letter in that way

m h

this letter was forwarded by the midday post to the country and the next morning to marys intense delight three gentlemen were ushered into her humble apartments they were her uncle the canon carlito and a dignified looking personage who was announced as mr robert heineman merchant of melbourne australia

the scene that followed was extremely touching

carlito wept for joy as he again looked upon his beloved and thought of the power of that enduring affection which had weathered the roughest storms and never for a moment swerved in its course

the canon glanced around the room and sighed deeply he took in the whole situation at a glance and looked with tender pity at his frail niece whose whereabouts he had long wished to know

mr heineman seemed interested

what about my father uncle enquired mary after the lapse of some moments

ah poor child replied the clergyman since your departure from home he has been experiencing calamitous times which have completely submerged him in trying to grasp everything he has lost all he invested a large sum of money in a certain enterprise that failed completely after an extraordinarily short existence

this left him a sadder but a wiser man immediately after this messrs barton bros to whom he had heavily mortgaged his property came down upon him and threatened to foreclose within six months this will leave him a completely ruined manâalmost penniless

he recently received a letter from your cousin bertie informing him that he had left the army and had amassed a considerable fortune in south america where he is now settled comfortably the fact that you could have been berties wife has considerably exasperated him against you and he swears that he will have nothing whatever to do with you

but my dear uncle father does not see that it is just probable that had i consented to marry bertie the tide might have turned in the other direction instead of into the channel of immense wealth it might have been immense sorrow then her eyes filling with tears she continued o uncleâdear good uncleâ what do you think of me are you angry with me for what i have done oh pity me how else could i have rescued myself from the horns of a terrible dilemma

my poor father he does not care for me nor pity me but my heart yearns for him would to god that we could be reconciled that i could once more rejoice in his loving smiles that i could again sit at his feet and with tender hands soothe his pain speak uncle do not keep me in suspense do not tell me to abandon the only being i have ever loved or am capable of loving as my husband

the canons heart sank within him he drew a deep breath and then briefly replied do not dwell upon this painful subject any more mary you have my sympathy and you may depend upon me for my assistance is this enough

thank you uncle she replied i am satisfied

now mary continued the canon since you have made up your mind to marry carlito i shall not object both my experience as a man and my personal convictions forbid interference between sweethearts

you shall accompany your cavalier to the island of montserrat whither i also am going this week to take my share in the solution of certain mysteries that have laid in the shades of obscurity for many years

mary felt her heart beat high with hopes but still a look of concern crept into her face

mr heineman who was engaged in a deep conversation with carlito expressed a desire to retire to his hotel in the city as he had important matters engaging his attention there the canon accompanied him and carlito and his fiancee sat together interchanging thoughts pregnant with the highest joy and happiness

i rather like mr heinemans countenance remarked mary he has greatly impressed me

rightly so replied carlito he is a man full of rich benevolence and a true sense of manhood it is enough to say that in the interest of justice he haj left his faraway home in australia and has traveled all the way to the west indies this speaks volumes for his good nature doesnt it

whats all this about it must be something very grave that caused him to come wont you give me a hint darling

you shall know all later there is a pleasant surprise for you naively replied carlito

departure from home he has been experiencing calamitous times which have completely submerged him in trying to grasp everything he has lost all he invested a large sum of money in a certain enterprise that failed completely after an extraordinarily short existence

this left him a sadder but a wiser man immediately after this messrs barton bros to whom he had heavily mortgaged his property came down upon him and threatened to foreclose within six months this will leave him a completely ruined manâalmost penniless

he recently received a letter from your cousin bertie informing him that he had left the army and had amassed a considerable fortune in south america where he is now settled comfortably the fact that you could have been berties wife has considerably exasperated him against you and he swears that he will have nothing whatever to do with you

but my dear uncle father does not see that it is just probable that had i consented to marry bertie the tide might have turned in the other direction instead of into the channel of immense wealth it might have been immense sorrow then her eyes filling with tears she continued  uncleâdear good uncleâ what do you think of me are you angry with me for what i have done oh pity me how else could i have rescued myself from the horns of a terrible dilemma

my poor father he does not care for me nor pity me but my heart yearns for him would to god that we could be reconciled that i could once more rejoice in his loving smiles that i could again sit at his feet and with tender hands soothe his pain speak uncle do not keep me in suspense do not tell me to abandon the only being i have ever loved or am capable of loving as my husband

the canons heart sank within him he drew a deep breath and then briefly replied do not dwell upon this painful subject any more mary you have my sympathy and you may depend upon me for my assistance is this enough

thank you uncle she replied i am satisfied

now mary continued the canon since you have made up your mind to marry carlito i shall not object both my experience as a man and my personal convictions forbid interference between sweethearts

you shall accompany your cavalier to the island of montserrat whither i also am going this week to take my share in the solution of certain mysteries that have laid in the shades of obscurity for many years

mary felt her heart beat high with hopes but still a look of concern crept into her face

mr heineman who was engaged in a deep conversation with carlito expressed a desire to retire to his hotel in the city as he had important matters engaging his attention there the canon accompanied him and carlito and his fiancee sat together interchanging thoughts pregnant with the highest joy and happiness

i rather like mr heinernans countenance remarked mary he has greatly impressed me

rightly so replied carlito he is a man full of rich benevolence and a true sense of manhood it is enough to say that in the interest of justice he haj left his faraway home in australia and has traveled all the way to the west indies this speaks volumes for his good nature doesnt it

whats all this about it must be something very grave that caused him to come wont you give me a hint darling

you shall know all later there is a pleasant surprise for you naively replied carlito

very well i shall not be overcurious she said playfully then continued i want you to accompany me to dear ritas grave in the country i may not have the opportunity of seeing it again since we are going away

the next day leaving mr heineman to look after his business in the city they took the train and accompanied by the canon they arrived at x where having parted with mr highfield at the rectory they proceeded onwards to look at ritas last restingplace

it was a bright and lovely day when the two young lovers entered the garden of god it was a lonely place not a sound stirred the air and it seemed as if the cold finger of death had imprinted itself on everything else except a tiny humming bird that flitted from tree to tree extracting honey from the flowers

the stone slabs and wooden crosses suggested forcibly the last dread end of human existenceâthe tranquil and eternal sleep overhead heavy dark clouds were floating while the suns beams kissed the grassy mounds reared above the remains of those who were sleeping their last sleep

they approached ritas grave it was covered with sod and two lovely lilies adorned it at either end while a freshlygathered garland of flowers had been placed in the middle by some loving hand there was an elaborate marble stone at the head on which were inscribed the following words a la memoria de â   rita cedeno quiex fallecio el  de octobre de en descanso este  to the memory of rita cedeno who departed this life on the th october â may she rest in peace

carl broke off a piece of the smiling lily and held it in his hand mary began to remove some stray leaves that fell around the grave and her eyes were moist with tears as they prepared to leave the spot they observed some one coming towards them it was soon discovered that it was none other than mr cox the village schoolmaster and hedgelawyer

goodmorning to you mr de la mar he said extending his hand to carl and making a very polite bow to mary i am indeed very glad to see you sir i heard you had gone to australia you did the trip very quickly and i rejoice to see you are looking so well

i thank you sincerely my dear cox i am now a regular bird of passage and i shall be leaving here again soon not for australia but for an island nearer home

is that so then i hope you are in quest of something important you will i presume enter into possession of your property before you leave the island wont you

carl was startled

i do not understand you said he will you kindly make yourself more explicit

do you mean to say you are not yet aware that you have been made the sole heir of miss cadeho i made two wills for her the first she destroyed and the second has put you in possession of her entire estate

carl stood transfixed and simultaneously the words poor rita escaped the lips of both himself and mary no thought of this had ever entered the mind of either of these two highsouled beings there was no rearing of any air castles which they could well afford to do from the knowledge of such a lucky windfall

no it was only the thought of poor dead ritaâtne sweet girl who had been taken away under such painful circumstances

what steps will you take mr de la mar enquired cox who was evidently struck by carls coolness

i have other business mr cor which demands my immediate attention i shall see mr frost the solicitor who will look after my interests

thus saying he shook hands with the schoolmaster and taking mary on his arm conducted her to her uncles residence

the next day he did not hesitate to call upon his solicitor as he had intimated to coxâafter he had discovered the truth of his disclosures certain details were gone through documents were signed and important arrangements made in which the welfare of john highfield formed a matter of primary considerationâof which we shall hear further in this narrative

horror and doubt distract his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir the hell within him

milton

on shore four hundred miles away from their home in trinidad where they had breakfasted just two days before were to be seen a small party consisting of canon highfield and his niece carl woodhouse his mother and the stranger from australia mr robert heineman to whom we have been previously introduced

they wyere all being entertained under the hospitable roof of the famous barrister oscar lindsay whom we have met before

canon highfield and his host were inseparable friends as has been previously told and though many years had passed since last they met the same warmth and goodwill remained

there were frequent conferences of a private nature between heineman the canon and lindsay which had for their purpose the securing of evidence against the suspected murderer of burleigh woodhouse of elmsdale

many years ago when plain liugh highfield then the guest of lindsay had remarked in connection with the elmsdale murder mc intyre is at the bottom of it ill wager my last dollar his shrewdness and perspicacity had convinced him of the correctness of his conelusion and all through the years during which the mystery remained unsolved he never for a moment lost hope that it would one day be discovered to the satisfaction of all who loved justice

mc intyre meanwhile enjoyed his prosperity without the least idea that there was a terrible storm gradually collecting its most destructive powers that would fall and crush him with its terrible force his estates were in a flourishing condition and though he lived well and continued in his epicurean habits they remained unencumbered he had never thought of marrying he spurned the idea flitting around him wrere gay and winsome ladies but he was never attracted by any

cupid had never touched his heart the darling of society he had gathered around him an extraordinary amount of interest there was no sport considered of much consequence unless it was patronized by mc intyre

and if he did not happen to lend his beautiful tenor voice in an evening soiree half of the fun would be considered lost his seat in the parish church was never vacant unless through illness or other unavoidable circumstances even the old rector father fairley had absolutely lost sight of the suspicion of murder with which the name of the popular mc intyre had at one time been associated and admitted him to the companionship of his family circle without the slightest scruple the cut of his coat the shape of his collar and the style of his walk were imitated by the street urchins while the women of shadowy reputation found a pleasure in linking his name with their lewd songs holding him up as the truest sample of the man of life

seated in his portico one evening about half past six oclock enjoying a pleasant smoke and awaiting the calls of his usual visitors a servant appeared and announced that lawyer lindsay wished to see him mc intyre experienced a strange feeling of anxiety which he had scarcely known before this was the first visit he had ever had from lindsay

conduct him to the drawingroom said he to the servant as he cleared his throat which seemed all at once to have become parched

a few moments later he greeted lindsay who in a stiff and distant manner said goodevening mr mc intyre

goodevening mr lindsay returned mc intyre

im indeed glad to see you will you take a seat

certainly and with the greatest pleasure but may i be permitted to introduce to you some particular friends who are in my carriage at the door

yes you need not have asked such a question mr

lindsay my house is a house of good cheer by the way i have heard that you have a good many visitors from a neighboring island but not thinking it likely that i should be acquainted with them i did not take the trouble to enquire who they were i am really very much indebted to you for the honour you pay me in bringing over your guests to elmsdale

lindsay strode across the room to the door meanwhile mc intyre trembled with fearâa premonitory symptom of impending ill had seized him it was the work of a moment for lindsay to return with a dusky dame on his arm and four other gentlemen bringing up the rear

mr mc intyre mrs woodhouse late of elmsdale

mrs woodhouse the distinguished mr mc intyre of elmsdale announced lindsay

this was a moment of the most terrible ordeal for the popular proprietor of elmsdale a veritable bolt from the blue had fallen he wished all at once he had never lived to see that day despair anguish remorse clouded his features and his hands fell heavily by his side while his knees shook nervously under him

the others in their turn were introduced to him by lindsay a bystander cognizant of the circumstances that had placed mc intyre in the state of mental torture which he could hardly conceal would have pitied him as well as admired the efforts that he made to hide his embarrassment under cover of a laissez faire

when the party left that evening mc intyre closed his private apartment and communed with himself

the night was pitch dark and through a window that opened on the street he looked out and gazed earnestly at the few stars dimly shining in the heavens silent witnesses of the struggle that he was undergoing

he closed the window suddenly and his hands trembled nervously it was evident he had shrunk from a desperate deedâthat of flinging himself from the window and thereby putting an end to his existence with his hands behind his back he paced the room to and fro while great drops of perspiration bathed his brow in the agony of despair he exclaimed great god what shall i do o ambition ambition cursed be the moment when i encouraged you to enter my breast see the recompense you have brought me the stamp of cain and the everlasting disgrace which stands at the door oh that i had been satisfied with what god had given me and made the best of life in a poor but honest way but it is now too late and the poorest would not envy the usurper and murderer george mc intyre ah how do those horrifying sounds distort my ears  father of heaven nay can i with these bloodstained hands call thee source of purity and goodness father  thou christ of mercy whom i had forgotten in my prosperity extend to me the clemency which thou didst show to the degraded thief upon the cross though sin has stained my life and has brought me face to face with the gallows still can i look back to the time when on my mothers knee i lisped words of love gathered from the mine of gods holy book i can remember how the story of the crucifixion impressed me and brought tears to my eyes i can see now my mothers fair face bending down sweetly upon me as i repeated the simple lines gentle jesus meek and mild look upon a little child pity my simplicity suffer me to come to thee

fain would i to thee be brought gracious god forbid it not

in the kingdom of thy grace give a little child a place

but for ambition foul ambition this moment had never come

here the strong ironframed man burst into piteous tears and threw himself headlong upon the floor a few moments after his emotion had subsided an unusual sound caught his ears he rose and throwing back the window curtains looked out and saw the light of a lantern and some people moving in the street he closed the window and sat down when he distinctly heard from a wellknown voice the words which sent a fresh pang through his soul when black clouds cover the sun at midday then shall begin the sorrows of elmsdale and when the white dove no longer sits upon the wall the dark lantern will shine to drag the fox from his hole the bones from the earth and give back virtue and honour to elmsdale

this surely points to me but then i have no white dove accustomed to sit upon the wall whose flight must mark my downfall mused mc intyre this is the only irreconcilable thing in the prophecy

the next morning he rose from bed at an unusually early hour and took his accustomed route round his demesne he examined the interesting menagerie of elmsdale which he had never neglected from the day he took possession of the premises his pigeons monkeys parrots guinea pigs and other pets came in for their share of attention and he seemed to have a few moments respite from the terrible thoughts that were weighing heavily upon him as he fondled the gay little animals that greeted him with pleasant demonstrations of joy his splendid brood of pigeons was the last thing he thought of and as he wended his way toward the pigeonhouse a gloomy picture met his gaze the pigeonry was deserted and not one of the favorite birds could be seen they had all flown to seek new homes

mc intyre was stunned and the word ominous ominous  involuntarily escaped his lips

he returned to the house scarcely conscious of what he was doing as he entered the door one of the servants wearing a look of dismay and horror met him with the words two policemen sir two policemen

this was enough mc intyre instantly solved the problem and without further ado entered and met the officers of the law as soon as they saw him one of them produced a warrant signed by a magistrate authorizing the arrest of mc intyre this document the officer read in a stern voice and then said george mc intyre in the name of the king we arrest you for the murder of burleigh woodhouse late of elmsdale

a deadly pallor came over the face of mc intyre and he drew his breath painfully but not a word escaped his lips by this time all the servants had collected together in the room and were looking on with amazement one of them in livery made bold to approach his master and asked him what was the meaning of this curious demonstration and what steps should be taken during his absence from home

its nothing serious replied mc intyre there is a mistake somewhere which will soon be set right my good thomas you will take charge of everything until this unfortunate situation is made clear meanwhile aw revoir dont neglect to see that everything is all right

the two policemen without further ado then led the criminal aw tay who as he passed through the long streets with dejected countenance became an object of pity and wonder to all who beheld him

pride and worse ambition threw me down

milton

on tuesday morning two days before the examination of the accused lindsay sat in his office turning over some papers and by his side the venerable doctor fane playfully swung round in an office chair and pored over the morning paper suddenly he looked up as if struck by some thought and watching lindsay steadfastly said by the way old chap as i have some moments to spare i may intimate to you that my report anent the exhumed remains of our deceased friend woodhouse has already been sent to the authorities

is that really so asked lindsay surprised

why thats much sooner than i anticipated i had no idea that the remains had been already exhumed

and what further conclusions have you arrived at

the same old story i supposeâa bullet

the doctor looked serious and gave a negative shake of the head

im afraid he said that canon highfields philosophy is superior to that of many of his confreres

he was always of the opinion that woodhouse was not shot and a note made in his pocketbook years ago to that effect has now been unmistakably confirmed by my examination

great god ejaculated lindsay rising from his seat is it possible that that chap hugh could have been so longheaded i remember he did endeavour to force that conviction on me but i did not think his inductions sufficiently weighty for my consideration

go on with your explanation dr fane

in my evidence at the inquest touching woodhouses death i regret to say that my foregone conclusions prevented the due exercise of my professional acumen my previous opinions have been greatly changed by my recent investigations i am convinced beyond the least shadow of a doubt that the instrument that dealt the mortal blow was not a revolver the orifice is much larger than any bullet would have made and although the occipital bone is fractured there is no evidence of a bullet having penetrated it it is evident therefore that a blunt instrument about the size of a crowbar must have pierced the brain and was apparently later used to batter the skull

this evidence is sufficient to hang him we had depended mostly upon heinemans testimony not having imagined that your professional investigations had rendered us such valuable service

as far as i understand mr heinemans evidence is merely circumstantial although he set the ball rolling

to the contraryâquite direct but in the face of yours it will become now of secondary importance as also a certain letter and manuscript which i was perusing when you came in

but is not mr heineman an australian merchant

what connection can he therefore have in this matter and what about the manuscript and letter you speak of

let me say briefly mr heineman was once a resident of this island and was employed many years ago on the staff of the daily chronicle

here dr fane seemed startled his countenance became more thoughtful and he knitted his brow and gave an assenting nod

lindsay was continuing his speech when a commotion was heard at the door he rose to see what it might be and his eyes fell upon a very old negro bent and crooked who was approaching the office by the aid of a long staff while a number of persons followed

old age had not altogether robbed its victim of a certain amount of intelligence which seemed more evident as an expression of joy and extreme pleasure brightened the countenance

well zac what is it now queried lindsay for this individual was none other than our interesting acquaintance professor zac

ah marse ossie replied the professor you know if you destroy the root of a tree the branches cant stay no sir they must die well sir since you all have cut the root a branch has fell it couldnt remain a day longer praise to jehovah who hath delivered the philistines into our hands

what do you mean  enquired lindsay impatiently nervously toying with the lappet of his coat and forcing a smile you are always talking in parables zac

pray what is it

well sir dick ray has been imitating judas

oh to the point do not beat about the bush

will you please explain yourself

well sir i shall make it as plain as i can dick ray has hanged himself

hanged himself reiterated lindsay and cheated the hands of the law

better so poor fellow remarked the professor

he has left the world for the worlds good and this is the kindest thing he has ever done

the people had now dispersed and after a few moments spent in answering some questions put by lindsay the professor retired with these words on his lips i told you marse ossie that i would live to see honour and virtue come back to elmsdale

what a queer chap that fellow is remarked dr

fane as the old man disappeared

yes a remarkably queer one replied lindsay

how lightly indeed does he take that rogues death

i for my part am sorry since we were on the eve of arresting him

i am anxious to hear the story of that interesting manuscript you hold and which purports to supply valuable information said dr fane after a few moments breaking the spell of silence which had lasted for some time i do not believe that the news of the tragedy has altogether upset you

no my dear doctor continued lindsay producing the manuscript in question i shall soon satisfy your anxiety and you will be surprised to know what schemes a rogue can resort to to accomplish his ends

to begin with i discovered the manuscript in woodhouses study after his death but by a strange fate i never glanced at the pages as events of much greater importance occupied my attention at the time i threw it among some old volumes in my library whence it was not long ago unearthed by old zac you will observe doctor that this is an unfinished drama by poor woodhouse literature had always been his hobby poor chap if you can read just here pointing to a particular point of the manuscript you will observe from the prologue of this speech which ralph gordon pours forth against his wife ethel that an interesting part of the context is missing which would just harmonize with the contents of this letter that implicated mrs

woodhouse and which according to my custom i took pains to preserve now you see doctor that not only do the words fit in but also the slip of paper which was clipped from the manuscript

that is possible said dr fane interested by this very important explanation but what about the difference between the names edith and ethel

i shall satisfy you upon that point in a moment

said lindsay as he got up from his seat and opened a large drawer whence he withdrew a powerful magnifying glass handing it to the doctor with the request that he should look at the writing through the glass dr

fane did so and with a smile on his lips ejaculated well done mr mc intyre this would have deceived the devil himself i can see that the name ethel occurring in two places has been carefully erased and the name edith inserted instead

very well dr fane you now have as near a solution of this intricate problem as it is possible to obtain

at this stage a tall slender person wdth a very intellectual face and bright blue eyes entered and dr

fane withdrew

this last visitor was mr henry berkley barristeratlaw who had won the implicit confidence of the community since his debut in the law courts of the colony when he concluded an interesting and important case and the masterly manner in which he defended his client surprised not a few of the learned members of the bar and inspired the hope that at no distant date he would reach the zenith of fame it was therefore with the greatest pleasure that lindsay consulted him in this case

i learn that you will not consent to defend the criminal berkley began lindsay

under no circumstances whatever was the emphatic reply i do not think there is a jury in the world who would think of acquitting mc intyre of murder in the light of recent discoveries i have decided not to associate myself with the case

so you are of opinion he will be condemned

decidedly i am so convinced there will be much interest taken in the examination on friday the affair is on everybodys lips i have been to see the unfortunate fellow in prison having had a special call from him he implored me to defend him but when i told him i found it impossible to do so he utterly broke down and seemed to lose all hope i think he means to try foster whom he thinks he will secure i left him in a most pitiable condition weeping like a woman

despite his base crimes i could hardly help feeling sympathy for him

i shall if i be permitted call to see him tomorrow

said lindsay he may have something to say to me as the representative of young woodhouse and this may relieve his mind

that would not be a bad plan replied berkley

and the interview terminated

all nature is but art unknown all chance direction which thou canst not see all discord harmony not understood all partial evil universal good

pope

mary highfield was enjoying herself in the pleasant home of mrs lindsay where every possible care and attention were lavished upon her there were certain enigmas which daily presented themselves to her for solution arising out of the peculiar sayings and doings of her companions she was altogether isolated from the rest in their movements and serious conversations it is true she had a strong suspicion that there was something important engaging the minds of carlito and the canon from the hints that had been thrown out by them but of the real import of these hints she never dreamed she had left her home in trinidad with a simple childlike faith in the man whom above all others she thought most excellent and she felt that she was perfectly secure under his protection dreaming not of ill she believed that her barque would move smoothly on manned as it was by a pilot of exemplary virtues more than once she attempted to obtain some information from carl as to his suspicious movements but he always gave her the same old reply i have a pleasant surprise in store for you darling

mrs woodhouse was on excellent terms with mary who had deeply impressed her by her endearing charms and her utter devotion to carl and she longed for that happy day when the clouds should roll away and they should recognize each other as mother and daughter

it was a delightful evening when mrs lindsay the canon carl and mary were sitting around a card table enjoying a pleasant game lindsay had not yet come in and heineman and mrs woodhouse in a corner of the room were conversing together on the merits of tennysons enoch arden carl and mary were partners at the game against the canon and mrs

lindsay

the last round of the cards was being played mary threw down the queen of hearts trumps on which the canon placed the king with a smart snap of the thumb saying triumphantly at the same time ive caught that jack master carl put it down

carl with a pleasant smile laid down the ace of trumps to the entire discomfiture of the minister whose chagrin was augmented a thousandfold when his partner with a vanquished air placed the knave upon the winning card

ive broken his neck ejaculated carl

and all joined in a right hearty laugh

yes his neck is surely broken poor fellow sounded a voice from the corridor and in another moment lindsay entered wearing a look of utter amazement

everybody turned round to hear what news he had brought and after he had seated himself he announced without further hesitation that dick ray had hanged himself

the assembly was startled by the unexpected news and mary felt as if she was living in a world of enchantments with dark mysterious shadows gradually enveloping her it was not so with the others who received the announcement with some measure of regret that the notorious culprit did not get his deserts at the hands of the law

this is the second piece on the programme said lindsay as he strode toward the door and lit a cigar

he was immediately followed by the canon who seemed to lose all interest in the game in which he had become so much absorbed begging for a postponement on the ground that he had something of importance to communicate to his friend lindsay

i am afraid you have been arousing considerably marys suspicions said he as he stood with lindsay in the large airy gallery overlooking the street

do you really think so

i am certain for she exhibited an air of concern or rather of excitement when you spoke of the tragedy

poor trusting girl i hope that the climax will soon be reached and these mysteries solved when she will be amply repaid for the patience that she has exhibited under these very trying circumstances

i hope so breathed the canon with a sigh

there will i suppose be unusual public interest at the trial and i imagine half the town will be present to listen to the examination berkley has refused to plead for him i understand

yes and i think he deserves credit for refusing to associate himself with the defence he would ruin his hitherto untarnished reputation were he to meddle with it i shall go to the prison tomorrow and see how mc intyre fares

i fancy that would be striking below the belt your presence would only increase his misery and you have no right to rejoice over a fallen foe

ah you are exhibiting the elements of christianity for once in this matter well done canon highfield you can afford to be charitable now

and lindsay could not repress a hearty laugh

the fun is over when the game is caught i have sought all these years to expose this man for his villainy and perfidy against me and now that he is pinned to the ground i almost pity his condition

by the way how memories of the distant past can be revived in an instant my mind reverts now to that horsewhipping affair it is certainly not my intention to visit him in the depth of his degradation to increase his misery but as the inevitable consequences must follow it may be my privilege to be of some service to him

at this moment they were startled by the melodious strains of the piano as mary struck up with her usual fascinating touch the prelude of the grand old song home sweet home her voice then rang out in sweetest harmony with the soulstirring notes and all eyes were riveted upon her her whole being seemed merged in the song as she reached the last verse her feelings became more intense and she sang more passionately while her touch became livelier carl had been turning the pages for her but he seemed all at once carried away by the torrent of the thrilling music that fell like a charm upon his ears and when he collected himself and realized that he had been a moment dilatory in his duty he looked tenderly into marys eyes they were sad and filled with tears but before he could ask himself why those sweet sparkling orbs were bedimmed the last note of the song had died away and mary suddenly fell upon the floor as if dead her face was ashen pale and her hands had become icy cold

carl mad with excitement and fear caught her up in his arms with superhuman strength the ardour of his passion found itself unchecked by his hitherto unfailing discretion and he imprinted a score of kisses mingled with tears upon the cold lips

the panic fortunately did not last long for after suitable remedies had been applied there was a speedy recovery carl lingered by the girls side as she reclined on a couch and pressing his hand gently upon her brow said do you feel better sweet

yes much darling was the reply but oh my heart is overburdened with sadness why do you keep me in suspense ah carlito though your presence ensures my protection i do not like such mysteries

there seems to be some doleful secret that you are hiding from me

do you trust me love said carl

i do sincerely how could it be otherwise

then continue to trust me and all will be right

she looked at him her heart beating with emotion and a gentle reassuring smile lit up her face as she said  your love alone carl serves as an invaluable solace for the sad thoughts that sometimes overwhelm me do you remember having read in your first latin book si natwram expellas semper recurret although my father so strenuously locks his heart against me my affection for him remains unchanged his tender smiles his words of devotion his trustfulness and the confidence he once reposed in me are all pictured in my memory and sometimes my heart feels as if it would burst when i realize the great gulf that divides us  my father my father could you but know your daughters grief but ah the die is cast

and all this for me groaned carl deeply affected as he turned aside and paced the room how can i ever repay such unparalleled devotion such sweet selfsacrificing love how wonderful this mysterious linking of souls by the divine power is not this a process as sublime and marvellous as those laws regulating the natural affection between the child and its parents

therefore shall a man leave father and mother and cleave unto his wife this is the divine mandate and this reversed must apply to thee my angel and exonerate thee from the charge of ingratitude which the world will not hesitate to charge thee with even schopenhauer in the fury of his pessimism would have hailed such a one as thee as a beaming light and i how shall i call theeâby what name under heaven shall i classify those inestimable qualities which make thee so dear to my heart

when carl parted from mary that night he began to consider whether it would be wise to still prolong her suspense or reveal to her the whole secret which had been so long kept from her

the morrow however decided

no action whether foul or fair is ever done but it leaves somewhere a record written by fingers ghostly as a blessing or a curse or mostly in the greater weakness or greater strength of the acts which follow it till at length the wrongs of ages are redressd and the justice of god made manifest

anon

prison life is far from being a pleasant one it is a time for sad reflections and the criminal unaccustomed to such an atmosphere must if he possesses a spark of manhood feel a keen sense of humiliation as he broods over his environment and the associations which force themselves upon him

mc intyre had been only four days in confinement in the royal gaol and the total change of his appearance was as remarkable as it had been rapid he had aged considerably his face became gaunt and his eyes sunken whenever he paced the narrow apartment in which he was confined his knees shook and appeared hardly able to sustain him his once raven locks were now a snowy white in fact he was a miserable figure on whom the marks of complete distraction and despair were plainly visible

the unfortunate prisoner endeavoured to obtain some respite from the desperate thoughts that pursued him by tracing geometrical lines in chalk upon the floor and giving his imagination play by drawing flowers trees and animals upon the walls at other times he would gaze fixedly and intently through the prison bars upon the streams of passersby carried away in the roaring rapid tide of the citys traffic the noise of carriage wheels and the hum of the town were truly companions in his solitude and misery the sweet cadence of the evening bells was falling upon the twilight air summoning the faithful to prayer at st marys church mc intyre could see the good people passing by in the moonlight and his heart began to fail him and he sighed mournfully his accustomed seat one of the uppermost in the church was now vacant he placed his hands upon his ears to shut out the sound of those sweet evening bells but their persistent peals reemed to haunt him more and more and he wished he might have been struck with instant deafness so as not to hear the horrifying sounds

the large town clock pealed out the hour of seven and instantly the church bell ceased the silence was a relief to the miserable man who threw himself heavily upon the floor and sobbed violently then composing himself he murmured never will i face this terrible crisis it is surely more than i can bear i am a murderer my hand is red with the blood of burleigh woodhouse and the laws of the realm would have me expiate this there is obviously no use of my seeking to ward off the inevitable consequences by means of lying and hypocrisy the gallowsâthe gallows menaces me but i will cheat it

and he beat the floor violently with his fist ah he continued if i were allowed the chance to escape would i not repent of my crimes and by my acts of humiliation and selfcrucifixion labour to erase this most fatal blot from my name but alas blood has been shed and my own blood must pay the penalty  human persecutors have a little of gods mercy and spare a forlorn villain who may yet live to some good purpose in the world and die reclaimed but if they condemn me thus i shall defy the destructive powers of my kind and these very hands shall extinguish the spark of life and that portion of my being which is beyond human control must go forth to meet its destiny but i must make a sacrifice which will lighten my passage through the vale that i soon must enter that sacrifice must be a complete confession of my crimes

his face had become deathly pale and he clenched his teeth after reaching this resolution he lay therefore quietly and dreamily upon his pallet but with the despair of a selfcondemned man his thoughts dwelt upon the various circumstances of his life and he gathered together the principle incidents associated with his crimes with the intention of committing them to writing on the morrow

at ten oclock the next morning he had just completed the task and was enclosing his confession in an envelope when an unexpected visitor was ushered in

it was lindsay

goodmorning mr mc intyre said he

mc intyre looked up suddenly and seemed half frightened

i know it all he groaned his wan features presenting quite a woeful appearance you need not taunt me with goodmorning i shall not give you much trouble my agony will not be much prolonged

i have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you and if you will return to this cell in half an hour with mrs woodhouse and her son i shall explain what i have to say

the change in mc intyres appearance and in his demeanour quite startled lindsay he encountered a scene which he had hardly expected he did not anticipate seeing the lion crouching so readily and with a feeling of pity mixed with abhorrence he walked rapidly out of the prison to summon mrs woodhouse and carl

in exactly half an hour he returned with them mrs

woodhouse was nervous and trembling from head to foot but this was the result of a great anxiety she had prepared herself for something unusual

mc intyre was lying prostrate on the floor when the three made their appearance he seemed to be suffering but the cause of this was not imagined by them

on a nearer approach however it was discovered that he was in a semiconscious condition his eyes were half closed and his face was cadaverous mrs woodhouse drew back terrified at the sight exclaiming my god what is this

the cry roused the wretched man and he looked up with glazing eyes at the visitors

one word from you madam that speaks of forgiveness he murmured weakly and my burden will become lighter that i have wronged you a thousand times and dragged your name in the dust by nefarious and devilish chicanery i must confess the climax has now been reached and i can never face the just penalty that awaits me rather would i tear my heart from its place than submit to the awful ordeal i have invited you here to see the last of a monsters career and if you will but mix your exultation in this your signal triumph with one drop of pity for the wretch who lies vanquished at your feet you will help him to die in peace

he paused awhile and hung his head to await an answer but none was forthcoming

i should have liked to make a confession with my own lips but i could never face your honest gaze so i have written a confession that all the world will see

his face was becoming more ghastly and his voice grew feebler with an effort he raised himself and put his hand into his bosom when he withdrew it it was besmeared with blood

lindsay fearing the worst approached him and laying open the murderers bosom discovered that a pocket knife was sunk almost to the hilt in mc intyres breast he drew back with alarm the idea not even occurring to him to withdraw the fatal instrument

drive it down deep my avenger gurgled mc intyre as the pains of death seized him this has been reserved for you

and he looked painfully into carls face and expected to see him plunge the knife up to the hilt into the flesh but he was astonished when he saw carl watching him with pity

mrs woodhouse murmured with unbridled emotion poor soul may god forgive you

these words fell like a charm upon the ears of the dying man he sighed deeply and lifting from under his pillow the confession he had written handed it to mrs woodhouse

at this stage his breathing became rapid and his voice sunk to a mere whisper

the sword of nemesis has fallen he ejaculated

the last scene of the act is played i

he could not complete the sentenceâthe end came so rapidly

mc intyre was in the presence of his maker

all yet seems well and if it ends so meet the bitter past more welcome is the sweet

alls well that ends well

the curtain had fallen over the last tragic scene in connection with the elmsdale mystery and a new and brighter scene was opened to the extreme gratification of all who were interested

poor wretch fell from canon highfields lips as he learned of the painful manner in which mc intyre had escaped the gallows

heineman however seemed somewhat disappointed as he did not entertain much sympathy for the murderer but he shrugged his shoulders and said platonically whatever is is right

carl took a favorable opportunity to explain everything to mary ending with the awful tragedy and her interest in the remarkable narrative was visibly expressed in her luminous eyes as she took in each word that fell from carls lips

so you have thought fit to keep me in the dark all this time love she said when she had assured herself that carl had completed his tale indeed you have fulfilled your promise and given me a most pleasant surprise not that i give the smallest place in my heart to any consideration of the worldly advantages that you are so soon to gainâadvantages that i had never for a moment anticipatedâbut because there is once more the hope of a reconciliation between myself and my father when his haughty pride will gratify itself in the fact that you were not what you seemed to him but a noble scion of a noble sire

thank you sweet for your compliment i only hope that the significant and forceful words with which you completed your sentence may never never be found false the mysteries are all over now and we enter the ordinary wrnrld and will mark our entrance therein byâ and he paused while his lips trembled nervouslyâby casting our lot together

at these words mary could not suppress the emotions that rose within her which were indicated by the tears which fell down her rosy cheeks she could have cried for joy at the happy words that she had so long expected and wished to hear

for some days nothing occurred to disturb the ordinary course of events at the grove the company enjoyed themselves by riding and driving and playing whist and lawn tennis

mr heineman who was thoroughly satisfied with the gradual unravelling of the elmsdale mystery waited to see the celebration of carl and marys nuptials before returning to australia

one morning while the inmates of the grove were wrapped in quiet sleep a visitor appeared throwing the entire household into surprise and consternation it was none other than mr john highfield marys father

when the name of this gentleman was announced the entire household donned their garments and rushed downstairs with incredible rapidity to satisfy themselves that they were not victimised by some gigantic hoax

mary stood awestricken but carls face shone with unmistakable marks of pleasure as he faced her with the equanimity of the most ardent disciple of zeno

the young girl did not dare to face her offended father and so lingered behind while carl and the others went forward to meet him he looked somewhat careworn and his face was much thinner than it was wont to be and yet the pleasant smile which hung upon his lips indicated that the bitterness of his heart had somewhat softened

mary had secured a coign of vantage whence she could observe the scenes which were about to transpire

her heart throbbed violently within her as she looked upon the face of her father and her extremities became icy cold

a hearty welcome to you mr highfield was the greeting that carl extended to the newcomer in a clear manly voice at the same time holding out bis hand which john highfield grasped eagerly

may god bless you my son was the affectionate reply while further efforts to speak were stifled by sobs

and your baggage mr highfield enquired carl in a manner that showed the warmth of his welcome

the porter is at the door replied mr highfield

carl immediately turned his attention to the impedimenta of the new guest who meanwhile was undergoing the closest scrutiny by those present indeed john highfield proved an object of much curiosity to the household at the grove

the reverend canon highfield although a farseeing man never anticipated such a rapidâand to say the leastâmelodramatic reconciliation between carl and his quondam antagonist lindsays happiness knew no bounds but still he was puzzled to know what had caused this visit

and my daughter how does she fare enquired the interesting old gentleman as carl returned and sat by his side

oh as well as possible put in the canon who was just recovering from his astonishment

but what were the feelings of poor mary at this supreme moment wellnigh indescribable she was experiencing one of those remarkable moods when the mind drinks in the honey of pleasant emotions in which cruel drops of gall springing from painful recollections suddenly fall with evil effect ah how memory recalled that last outburst of her irascible parent when he mercilessly drove her from under his roof from that moment the iron had entered her soul and had continued to crush her down to the earth may the just judgment of heaven repay your disobedience these were the words that had doomed her to a life of gloom âand they had never been effaced from her memory

and was this the crisis of the just judgment of heaven

then truly she needed no more weighty evidence to convince her of the righteousness of her cause if heaven dispenses its punishments commensurate with the gravity of the sins committed by mortals

and it was this thought that ultimately took possession of mary and caused her to rush boldly into her fathers arms she could not account for his presence there at that moment nor could she imagine what was the cause of the change in his disposition but she feared not the consequence of her impulsive action

the old man pressed his child to his heart there was something aweinspiring in the deep impressive silenceâa silence that seemed to suggest the hallowed presence of some smiling angel registering the reconciliation of paternal and filial love

as days wore on old highfield found himself quite at home among his new circle of friends

carl took the first opportunity to intimate to his curious and anxious companions that before leaving trinidad he had made arrangements with his solicitor to call upon mr highfield with a view of offering to assist him in his unenviable pecuniary embarrassment by winding up affairs with his creditors

there is truth in the old saying any port in a storm the haughty old patrician had stooped to earth in order to gather strength and so avoid inevitable disgrace and probable suicide the estates that rita had generously bequeathed to carl were mortgaged for eleven thousand pounds this amount was handed over to mr highfield without security which entirely released him from his creditors and started him afresh with his valuable properties untrammelled

and now the old mans heart swelled and was ready to burst with gratitude and love for his generous benefactor his visit to the grove had a dual purpose âto enjoy the satisfaction of seeing his daughter united to the man who had saved him and to settle for good all business relationships between them but there were other surprises awaiting him which he little anticipated when carl was reproved by his friends for his extreme reticence in the matter with a smile he quoted the scriptural text  a man full of words shall not prosper upon the earth 

can comeliness of form or shape or air with comeliness of words or deeds compare

mr highfield and carl were sitting together one afternoon in a cool spot in the beautiful gardens which surrounded the grove when carl took the opportunity to introduce the subject of their business relationship

i was greatly gratified said he to gather from your correspondence that rou had no difficulty in settling your affairs my dear mr highfield

yes indeed and how generous it was of you to come to my rescue just at the time when i was on the brink of a most dangerous precipice those villainous money grabbers seemed to have steeled their hearts and would not listen to reason they were bent upon sacrificing my estates at just onefifth of their value

i assure you my dear young man that had my properties been thus confiscated i do not think i would have had the courage to live on there is a divinity which shapes our end never for a moment could i have imagined that my deliverance wrould have come from this direction the shock was too much for me and i was almost overcome with joy and amazement

oh do not refer to that my dear sir you will sufficiently compliment me and repay me if you will but permit me to think that i only did my duty

never mind i shall never cease to thank you as my saviour if i pay you compliments they are sincere though feeble expressions of my gratitude but to business as you are aware according to your suggestions mr frost secured eleven thousand pounds at eight per cent on your properties this has entirely liquidated my debts now as you have appointed me your attorney and placed entire confidence in me to the extent of declining to take any securities i propose to make the following suggestions i shall manage your properties to the best of my ability without exacting a single farthing from you they are in a position to pay for their care and the handsome proceeds realized will be banked in your favor my own properties will be worked with every possible care and economy so as to pay the interest on the loan and secure the principal which i have calculated to pay off in half the allotted time providing for contingencies and the fall of prices i do not know what your future movements may be but you will be in a position to live like a real monte cristo from the proceeds of your lucky windfall and still accumulate a handsome fortune i cannot refrain from complimenting you on your remarkable career heaven has been most lavish to you in its gifts and from your humble position has raised you to the seat of princes but this has been your destiny

there must after all be some truth in the ancient doctrine of transmigration your exalted character has been apparent to all who have known you and though i once pretended to ignore it i must now confess it i dont want to play the philosopher but your ego for aught i know may have once animated the clay of a plato who spurned the munificent gifts of denis and begged for books or that of xcnocrates who refused to accept alexanders gold because the royal donor had greater need of it

charles v stooped to pick up the brush of titian francis de medici uncovered his head to the immortal michaelangelo and i john highfield make way for the lowborn youth whose genius and magnanimity overpower me and my daughters hand i confer upon him with the fervour of my heart and consider that in accepting her he does me honour

the expression lowborn caused a smile to flit across carlitos face he remembered berangers verses bearing that title and some striking reflections passed through his mind the time had come for him to convince mr highfield that he was not altogether as lowborn as the old man thought and drawing from his pocket a copy of the chronicle which was still extant he handed it to his companion with the request that he would read a somewhat lengthy article that was marked with blue pencil

this important article embraced the whole history of the elmsdale affair it began with personal reminiscences of the woodhouse family which were flattering and almost panegyric then dealt with the entire details from the night of the fatal ball up to the arrest of mr mc intyre nothing was forgotten no incident was omitted that would enhance the interest of the extraordinary chain of romantic mysteries the whole of mc intyres confession was there and mr highfields astonishment was overwhelming as he read the following which we produce to gratify the readers curiosity the confession of george mc intyre the atrocious murderer and usurper standing as i do upon the threshold of the eternal world whence i shall not return i george mc intyre prompted by a sense of regret for my mortal crimes which blacken my soul and blot out even the last vestige of manhood do make these revelations with the hope that the consciousness of having done some good by exposing to the world of the unwary my life of crime and its just consequences may produce some calm in the stormy state of my mind

it was i who put an end to the useful benevolent inoffensive life of my cousin burleigh woodhouse these bloodstained hands were urged by craft and envy to lift themselves against the man who was my best friend he had always loved me and i in turn hated him for his love and meditated destruction a most favourable opportunity occurred on the fatal night of the ball a night contemplated by my cousin in which to make me and others happy but which i hailed with inexpressible delight because i knew it would be favourable to my scheme when reason would be clouded by champagne mv impatience ran high when others were enjoying themselves i feigned illness and so appealed to the sympathetic nature of poor woodhouse he accompanied me outside the ball room with the intention of giving me remedies but i induced him to go with me to a dark spot under a lime tree and there with an iron stake which now lies in a wooden chest in my private room at klmsdule where not a living soul has entered since i took possession of the property i performed the heinous deed which stamps me a foul murderer the revolver which was discovered near mv cousins corpse and which everybody thought was the instrument of suicidal death was as innocent as heavenâit was only a ruse that worked splendidly it only occurred to the farseeing hugh highfield that no report of firearms was heard on the fatal night this was a thought which unnerved me at the time of the tragedy since suspicion pointed to me if this key had been utilized the consequences might have been different and retribution less tardy

i had collected all materials which satanic artifice could devise to make it appear suicide through the infidelity of his wife with young highfield ah monstrous diabolic lie the innocent victim was thus deprived of all claim on her husbands estates

i forged a document making myself the sole beneficiary of the deceased and placed it in his pocket after i had killed him with the famous letter to his widow leaving no doubt of her guilt this letter was another masterpiece of iniquity the sensation it caused at the inquest was marvellous and after all what was it

a simple paragraph cut out from a manuscript of dramatic excellence which woodhouse had written the name of the prominent female character was neatly erased and edith mrs woodhouses christian name inserted instead i had thoughtlessly and injudiciously imparted information of my cousins suicide to young robert heineman of the chronicle quite early and while in a state of excitement this afterwards greatly obstructed my plans but i managed to wriggle through i sent the unsuspecting youth to melbourne to an imaginary firm with whom i was supposed to be connected after giving him valuable pecuniary assistance

i had foreseen that he would have been honest enough to confess that i had supplied him with the matter for the sensational article which appeared in the chronicle and my plans would have been subverted and i perhaps ruined i had long forgotten him when he reappeared with the rest of my pursuers to hound me to the death

after i came into possession of my illgotten gains my next thought was to put mother and son out of my way i asked mrs woodhouse to permit me to send the boy carl to mr kuhners grammar school and enlisted the rev mr fairleys mediation to induce her to do so the suggestion had the effect of a red rag before an enraged bull it was well she did not give her consent for i had been preparing a scheme to capture the child and strangle him i hired two brigands and paid them in gold bright tempting gold for this purpose failing this the resourceful villains who were none other than hawkie and dick ray who lately took his own life hit upon another plan providence seemed to have specially guarded the victims of my vengeance and i trembled when i knew they were soon to leave for trinidad under the protection of the smart young student hugh highfield and thus thwart my designs

hawkie and dick ray made a raid on the schooner although i was at the time unaware of their schemes they succeeded in capturing both mother and son they brought me a massive gold ring which i knew belonged to mrs woodhouse and in this i recognized the token of the success of their adventure i wanted no further proof to assure me that they had perished and i gave the brigands another handsome sum

the shock which carraciolos corpse caused to nelsons crew was as nothing compared to my dismay and indescribable agony when i became convinced that my intended victims had been preserved through all vicissitudes to take vengeance on me how it is or by what miracle they still continue to live i do not know

may the good man whom i wronged and accused of adultery with one of the purest of women forgive me as he expects to be forgiven it was i who impressed upon rev fairley that hugh highfield was guilty of this misdemeanor and mr fairley having sternly censured him for the offense in his indignation i got my deserts in a good horsewhipping this humiliation which i suffered people do not generally know

long years ago i threw away the key to the private room i have spoken of i could not bear to come near it much less to enter it for it contains that cruel instrument which made me a murderer you must break the door to effect an entrance

and now all is finished nemesis has pronounced judgment and i go to reap my reward farewell

mr highfields astonishment after the reading of this document can better be imagined than described

he now felt thoroughly satisfied of the wisdom of consenting to the marriage of his daughter and carl his interest in his prospective soninlaw became more intense as he thought of his remarkable career and he felt pierced to the heart that he had so bitterly opposed him henceforth he vowed to do all in his power to promote his happiness and thus atone for his past uncharitableness by unabating evidences of kindly devotion and paternal solicitude

be slow to judge and slower to despise

oliver wendell holmes

the heir of elmsdale had come into possession of his own high and low rich and poor hailed with delight the installation of this hero whose checkered and adventurous career appeared more mythical than real

they had all seen the victory of virtue over vice the triumph of right over wrong carl was the central figure of the day and while lie was greeted on all sides with sincere congratulations george mc intyres memory was clouded with curses and condemnations

carl was very happy his conscience was pure his mind was ever turning toward the sublime the beautiful and the good and his generous heart was full of tiie milk of human kindness the glowing sympathy that he received from his friends and acquaintances enhanced his delight and to crown all he was looking eagerly toward that day when mary highfield and he should be united

it was not known outside of his immediate circle of friends who accompanied him to montserrat that miss highfield was his chosen bride the announcement of the banns was deferred for at least a couple of months until all should have regained their equilibrium and the excitement should have subsided

marv and mrs woodhouse were the guests of mrs

lindsay while the rest of the party enjoyed themselves at elmsdale mansion

the old conservative mode of life and manners was again resumed by the genial host and this was manifest to all the rev mr fairley though much advanced in years still continued his ministrations and it was with evident joy that he congratulated carl on the satisfactory turn that events had taken

judge mapleton an old aristocrat who had retired with honor from a judicial career extending over thirty years and who had been a warm friend of the woodhouse family manifested his appreciation of carls homecoming by proposing a picnic on one of his estates in honor of his interesting young friend the scheme was taken up with animation and several distinguished persons were invited

judge mapleton was a widower his wife had died several years ago leaving him a pretty little daughter who had developed into a charming young girl on whom he doted he was immensely rich and this fact had induced many a courtly cavalier to pay his respects to daphne mapleton and sue for her heart and hand but with no success

the day of judge mapletons picnic arrived mrs

lindsay and canon highfield had the honor of driving with the judge in his stately carriage while winsome ladies and gay young cavaliers on finely caparisoned horses enjoyed the journey to the picturesque broderick plantation

miss highfield was accompanied by mr dyett a gallant youth who had already distinguished himself by winning the enviable position of first treasury officer in the island dyett was lavish in his attention to the handsome young girl by whose side he rode and did all in his power to contribute to her happiness

daphne mapleton was accompanied by the young heir of elmsdale and it was manifest that she was experiencing great pleasure in carls company

the journey to brodericks was most delightful

away from the hustle and bustle of the town the party now looked upon scenes that charmed and impressed all

they were riding over a sandy beach below lay the sapphire ocean gilded by the rays of the morning sun which appeared magnificent as it encircled in its friendly arms the cosy little emerald island the playful breakers at intervals lashed the shore bringing with them seashells and marine animals which lay calmly and peacefully upon the sand scintillating with the glory with which the sunlight so gorgeously bedecked them cocoanut trees lined the route while at a certain point branches of the poisonous manchineel formed a high arch above passing through varied scenes which more and more interested them they at last arrived at their destination after an hours rest followed by a sumptuous lunch a ramble was made over the plantation

judge mapleton was intoxicated with delight his large heart was full to overflowing as he observed the young people heartily enjoying themselves

but mary highfield and carl woodhouse were ill at ease although both labored strenuously to conceal their mental torture carl who was the very soul of gallantry seemed to grow more attentive to miss mapleton even though he went to extremes which were likely to give birth to some wrong impressions in daphnes heart and to arouse suspicion of his love for her he nevertheless considered himself justified in doing this so as to avoid a betrayal of the unhappiness he was experiencing dyett did not know that carl had any special claims upon mary nor had daphne the least suspicion that her companion was deeply in love with another as they strode arm in arm around the plantation

it was merely incidental that miss highfield and carl were separated on the journey but they both thought that on arriving at brodericks they would have been reunited and so enter with high hopes into the pleasures and enjoyment of the day instead of this however dyett became distinctly infatuated with mary and was bent upon monopolizing all her time while daphnes manifest preference for carl placed him in a quandary from which he could not easily extricate himself

whenever carl came in contact with his affianced he endeavoured to reassure her of his constancy by saying some tender and pretty things that he thought would interest her while the smile of love hung on his lips

his discomfort was not occasioned by the thought that he would be dethroned by dyett from the place he held in marys heart no for his faith in his love was unshaken it was the longing he had to be by her side that made him miserable he felt anxious to renew his vows of affection amidst these wild and charming scenes oh how he wished that hand in hand and with heart and pulses beating with the rapture of love they could drink in together the marvellous beauty above beneath and around them on mountain heights were heard the wooddoves cooing notes of love in the sloping valleys the picfci rsque canefields were being wafted by the kindly breezes of perpetual summer as they chanted their mysterious music that fell like a sweet lullaby upon the ear

as the day wore on carls disappointment became more intense and a sudden revelation seemed to dawn upon him it was on an occasion when daphne and he were standing by a beautiful pond in which glittering fish were darting to and fro the golden rays of sunshine fell upon the surface of the shimmering water and reflected the images of the pair as they stood upon the bank daphne had never before looked so charming as she did at that moment carl glanced from the gilded surface of the water into the face of the young girl standing before him she was tall and slender with a figure as graceful as it was faultless her complexion was of that beautiful brown which is so characteristic of eastern people but not uncommonly seen in the west indiesâa result of miscegenation her eyes were as dark as midnight and shaded by delicately pencilled eyebrows her nose and lips were so well proportioned and moulded in such exquisite forms that they not only imparted beauty to the face but gave it an expression of dignity and sweetness her hair was tastefully arranged in the latest fashion and held together by a jewelled comb while a broad clear brow added strength and vigor to the already fascinating beauty

what a fairy queen indeed mused carl but i am proof against her charms since my heart belongs to mary highfield and to her alone were it otherwise i should scarcely have been able to resist them

how i wish she were my sister my own dear little sister

what are you thinking of carl said daphne as she recognized his preoccupation

iam wishing you were my sisterâif i must confess

only your sister said daphne suggestively

then i shall consent to be that and enjoy the advantages which a sister can claim at the hands of a dear brother like you

she drew nearer to carl and placed her hand in his carl drew her toward him and put his arm around her

dear sweet sister he said do not forget the pledge we have made this afternoon i shall always expect to have the privileges and the confidence of a brother

he had just withdrawn his arm when he discovered that this little innocent act of his was observed by mary who was approaching with dyett as she drew near carl became convinced that the greeneyed monster had intruded upon the scene for he observed in marys eyes an expression that startled him and chilled his very life blood he had rated her high above the mean and unwholesome sentiment of jealousy and as far as he was concerned was he not justified in doing so since her experiences of him were enough to warrant the conviction of his profound stability in love could it be possible he thought that this erudite young girl âwhose brilliant intellect had fed upon the very best pabulum which the labours of philosophers and savants of ancient and modem times could affordâshould fall a prey to jealousy surely she has by this time learned to probe deeper into human nature than the ordinary illiterate woman and to discriminate between the hypocrisy of a spurious love and that enduring affection which springs from the heart

poor carl his ideas of the nature of a womans love were sadly defective he did not realize that the instincts which draw together the opposite sexes are closely interwoven with the physical phenomena of their constitution and will always seek to gain the mastery even though the higher self may strive to temper and subjugate them jealousy selfishness and suspicion seem to be dominant principles of our animal nature and carls philosophy had not yet taught him this

dyett was looking at the arms of the old windmill performing their continual revolutions as the strong wind from the hillsides struck them while the massive rollers mercilessly devoured one after the other the fagots of sugar cane with which they were fed by the labourers mary too was viewing the same sight but her thoughts were far away

you seem to love the old windmill said daphne placing her arms lovingly around marys waist as girls are wont to do mr woodhouse also is very much interested in the quaint old structure the wild and beautiful scenes of broderick have quite fascinated him and he would like to live among them all his life he says

did you not say so mr woodhouse turning to carl

what do you think of this mary are you likewise charmed

carl had not replied to daphne and was awaiting with some anxiety marys answer

the latter did not speak for some moments she was making an effort to control the choking sensations in her throat and to subdue the beating of her heart

having somewhat regained her selfcontrol she said i do not doubt the possibility of mr woodhouses making broderick his future home that seems lo depend upon himself

carl looked at her with amazement a thrilling sensation passing through his entire frame he was hurt to the quick as he considered the purport of these words these were the fruit of his indiscretion and impulsiveness and he actually scorned himself at that moment he gave another puzzled glance at mary who seemed to realize the pain she had caused him for a cloud of regret fell over her face

it was evident that the meaning of marys words was not apparent to daphne she understood that her friend had implied a purchase of her fathers estate by carl and so replied my father would not part with broderick for a million pounds it is the best of his properties and is intimately associated with his family history

mary tried to look pleased as they strolled some distance away

i agree she said that broderick is a delightful place and i too think i would be happy in making my home here in this fairyland

it was toward sunset and they were standing on a hillock whence they could view the landscape stretching far away toward the sea the air was redolent of the scent of mignonette and geranium the cattle from whose necks the yoke had just been removed after their day of toil were lying down lazily in the fields flocks of sheep were browsing upon the hillsides and the toilworn labourers were preparing to be gone

its time we too were going said dyett we do not wish that darkness should overtake us on the way we shall carry away with us pleasant reminiscences of this happy day we have spent together shant we miss highfield

mary looked up confusedly then glanced at carl who was not less perplexed the situation became still more critical as daphne with an air of womanly sweetness her eyes beaming with liquid fire which at that moment seemed to burn more intensely than ever pinned a nosegay to the lapel of carls coat

wont you wear this carl she said in memory of this enjoyable day you will remember me whenever you look at it i am sure

an indescribable magnetic influence shot through carls frame he felt the deft fingers resting upon his bosom and he wondered why such marvellous sensations should have seized him he had some experience in the various phenomena of human passions but this was altogether novel

thats right de la mar said dyett tauntingly after daphne had finished her pleasant task x knew the boy cupid has been very busy today i am a very acute observer dont you know i know too that love and murder will out 

what do you mean mr dyett by your sarcasm

put in daphne the hot red blood rushing to her cheeks and betraying her embarrassment can i not perform the duty which is peculiar to my sexânamely to increase the pleasure and happiness of another by some little evidence of appreciation springing from our natural inclination to please

this is one of cupids little tricks of course miss mapleton your peculiar appreciation on this occasion seems to me the more suggestive in that although there are flowers in profusion at broderick i have not been the recipient of any such marked token of regard

and he laughed a meaning and suggestive laugh looking meanwhile from daphne towards mary

i have seen miss mapleton present flowers to other gentlemen besides myself said carl to whom the position was becoming embarrassing

rebut not with such grace and evident delight

plied the sarcastic dyett

jealousy was gnawing spitefully at the very centre of marys heart while carl was wishing that the situation so unpleasant and undesirable for him would change and relieve him of the cruel tortures that he was undergoing

providence happily declared in his favor for in another moment there appeared on the scene canon highfield and the judge

why we have hunted in every corner for the ramblers this whole afternoon without success said judge mapleton and now that we have found you we will stick to our prisoners you have had enough of these woodlands and of these girls company my gallant knightserrant and you will now leave it to the older chaps to entertain them with a drink good enough for the immortal gods we would recommend for each of you young gentlemen a stimulating cocktail which would give you courage to resume the journey homeward

the two elder gentlemen accompanied the girls into the boilinghouse where the sugar was being manufactured and treated them with the delightful beverage known to the natives as hot liquor which was drawn from the steaming cauldron by an obsequious old plantation hand

the journey homeward was without adventure some went home to dream about the pleasant intercourse they had held with wild nature and of their new experiences  others thought with delight of the convivial manners of their host and of his incessant desire to enhance their enjoyment but there were two women and two men around whom some wicked fairy had woven a terrible spell of delusion which was only to be unravelled after a period of pain and suffering

carl took every opportunity to dislodge from marys mind the terrible suspicion that rested there he was ever constant in his visits and his devotion and attentions lacked nothing but it is no easy task to reestablish that confidence which fills the breast of a pure trusting woman for the man whom she adoredânay actually worshipped and paid the dearest homage of her lifeâwhen once she has had the slightest reason rightly or wrongly to entertain some suspicion of her heros divided affection

you are cold toward me of late said carl one day to mary as they sat together on the airy balcony of the grove do you not love me in the same old way since judge mapletons picnic my life has been unhappy for the warm and serene light of love that once burned in your eyes and set me in rapture has faded away why is this can you not remember me as your only beloved who vowed to love no other woman save you

mary sighed and carl drew near and pressed her warm glowing vermilion lips with his own then drew her to his bosom

why do you think i do not care for you she said

i shall always love you but i cannot rid myself of the nightmare that continues to disturb me even though i may believe that you are as pure and true as the sunbeams i cannot help thinking of that unhallowed day that i saw you with your arms around daphne mapletons waist when i observed the gleam of delight that flushed her face with pride nor can i easily forget the picture of that moment when she stood before you arrayed in all the power and charms of that rich beauty with which nature has so lavishly crowned her

i must confess that she is lovelyâwe are as much alive to the beauty of our sex as members of the opposite sex i hated her at that instant when i saw her fastening a nosegay to your coat and i have since wondered from what unknown depth of my nature such a manifestation of savage instincts could have sprung

but we are human carlâintensely human

would it were possible for me to obliterate that unhappy incident from your memory my angel let me once more implore your pardon it was a thoughtless act and had not its origin in such love as ours

then whence did it come and marys face assumed an appearance of pain that quite startled carl

i saw you looking into daphnes eyes with that burning intensity that exquisite tenderness which i once thought was exclusively reserved for me

that may have been so i will not deny a truth so evident to you yet it was nothing more than the endeavour to reciprocate with the sympathy of a brother the innocent hallowed and childlike affection which i saw was in daphnes heart for me it was under this influence of sympathy that i acted so indiscreetly

at this juncture carls breast was throbbing with emotion and intuitively mary discerned the storm that was raging within him

my darling she said i believe you with all my heart your very candour has shamed me and i now repay you with a thousand kisses for allowing an unnecessary thought against you to enter my breast

but take care my only carl take care of what men are pleased to call a platonic love this pretty idol set up in the heart and worshipped by the most lofty souls has often been mercilessly shattered into a thousand fragments by the batteries of that mysterious force within us for which nature alone is responsible

beware of the platonic love

she fell upon carl and kissed him with that passionate love for which he had pined for many daysâand happiness reentered their lives

carl then proposed that the risk of any possible misunderstandings again occuring should be prevented by an early solemnization of their marriage mary willingly agreed and that same evening carl instructed the rev mr fairley to publish the banns of marriage on the following sunday in the parish church

alas things are not what they seem despite their golden glimmer all my fancies were a dream ive seen their dying shimmer

it was as though a bolt from the blue had suddenly fallen upon the head of edgar dyett when for the first time he learned the unwelcome news that mary highfield was to become carls wife life to him seemed suddenly to lose all its charms in mary he thought that he had discovered his souls choice and upon her his every thought was becoming centered

in his constant visits to the grove he had noticed marys reserved manner and the formal demeanour that she had observed towards him and though this sometimes made him feel that his task to gain her love on which he had set his mind was by no means an easy one yet being a youth of indomitable courage and perseverance he had determined to woo and win her he had seen nothing to indicate a special intimacy between her and carl and the way appeared quite open but now he found that the towering aircastle which he had so ambitiously reared was ruthlessly undermined and came crashing to the ground with a terrible effect

in his deep disappointment dyett became intensely jealous and this jealousy took the ascendancy of clear dispassionate reason it ran riot within him he accused carl of dishonor to him of unnecessary secretiveness and of other questionable qualities of which he alone seemed to be cognizant it occurred to him that it was carls business to have declared his relationship with miss highfield and thus to have saved him the pain of making himself ridiculous unfortunate lovelorn lad blame him not dear reader such are the fallacies of human reason when our spirits are crushed to earth when we find ourselves unhappily thrown into conditions whereby our haughty human pride is made to suffer humiliation and to drain the bitter cup of disappointment 

one afternoon carl called at the treasury to have a chat with dyett as he had done previously on several occasions pie was surprised at the reception given him by his friend

i will be glad if you cease coming to annoy me in my work sir this is the kings duty and i will not be interrupted

carl laughed at this outburst which he interpreted as a strenuous effort on the part of dyett to be ultrahumorous

you cannot scare me edgartry another ruse

said he

i am really not joking my dear sir if you have any business to settle do so at once or i will put you through the window

carl at this juncture saw an unusual flash of wicked fire in the determined eyes of dyett and his mind intuitively told him that things were really looking serious he stood for a moment silent his limbs trembling and his heart beating rapidly he was not precipitate in either word or deed and always waited to justify himself in any procedure he might think it necessary to adopt

the silence was broken by dyett

i wish to know sir whether you have any business at the office he reiterated imperatively approaching carl with venom in his eye

i have no business mr dyett i am however surprised at your conduct i thought you were joking at first but i now see you are in earnest you have always posed as a man of candour and it seems to me a pity that you have not given me the opportunity of knowing what offense i have given you it must be something very grave that has led you to play the part of an untutored savage

i had rather be an untutored savage than a civilized hypocrite you who have been coming here and speaking to me as a confidential friend might have been honest enough to say that you were in love with miss highfield we have spoken about this young lady on several occasions i hinted to you my deep regard for her and you never gave me the simplest notion that you have been all the time getting ready to be married is there anything manly or friendly in such covert action 

my dear sir said carl in a tone of evident anger and with fixed determination on his lips i had given you credit for much more common sense let me begin by saying that although i once thought myself justified in accepting you as a friend i never for a moment imagined that there was that bond between us that would entitle you to a knowledge of my private affairs

if i thought to keep my espousal to miss highfield secret for reasons best known to us both i cannot see that i have in any way offended the ethics of casual acquaintanceship and further such talk as yours is nonsenseâsimply puerile in a man of your age i should have expected this from a boy of ten or twelve

you are simply making yourself ridiculous

thereupon carl turned away from his aggressive friend as he was going down the flight of steps that led to the street he looked back upon the youth who had retired to a corner where he was leaning over a desk with his hand sustaining his chin and a look of utter desperation upon his face

carl was disturbed over this unhappy conflict and made his way to the house of his friend zac where he hoped to find in the old mans wit and pleasantries an effectual antidote for the present condition of his mind

zac had been provided with a comfortable home at elmsdale where he got the very best that could be provided for him he had passed the threescoreyearsandten span allotted to mankind and was looking toward joining the great majority the residents of elmsdale treated him with marked kindness and his liberty was not circumscribed mrs lindsay and her husband were unfailing in their solicitude for his comfort

as carl was approaching the door he saw at some distance before him little dora the fiveyearold daughter of mrs lindsay carrying a basket containing the dainty dinner which came from the grove every day for the old man the delicate cherub voice of the child with its ringing music of lisping monosyllables the charming mellowed inflections peculiar to that tender period of life fell delightfully upon zacs ears

tumming with zacs dinner said the little one

the old man arose from his chair and approached the door with manifest joy a bright light came over his face as he saw the child and her pretty little voice again enriched the air with its melody a thrill of delight went through zacs frame his heart was centred in this little blossom of humanity whose presence semed to rekindle the vital sparks that were fast ebbing away in him and his love and complete devotion to her was as beautiful as it was pathetic

do you still love your old zac he asked of the child

oh yes she said zac is so dood i am going to bring my doll to play with you tomorrow

yes you must come with the doll and come oftener âevery dayâbecause zac wont be here with you much longer he is going to heaven soon

no dear zac you must not do way from dora

if you do i will go too

and the child put up her pretty pink lips against the ebony face then tightly threw her arms about the old mans neck

carl who from without was witnessing this pretty scene was so charmed that his mind was completely diverted from his recent quarrel on entering the room he said hello zac i guess you want to steal dora from her parents she never seems so happy as when she is perched upon your knee

thank the lord mars carl for this dear little life i would give my own were it worth anything of course you know my mortal coil is only good enough now to fertilize the earth and nothing else so if i made the sacrifice it would be nothing but when i was like you sir i would have thought it an honor to die for this little angel

zac would you give your life for this little white child asked carl

why not mars carl i cannot understand that a gentleman of your education would ask such a question when i was young they used to teach sense at school but now i think they must be teaching the other thing

what other thing zac surely you do not mean to insinuate that i am talking nonsense

and carl laughed in his accustomed goodnatured way he had come to measure swords with zac and he knew that he would be fairly matched

zac cleared his throat naively then said mars carl will you have a drink

no thank you zac since dora has such influence over you i shall tell her to advise you to give up drinking dora will you please ask your friend not to drink

the child looked spitefully at carl then petulantly blurted out i wont do it zac can do what he wants

mars carl do you really mean that i must stop drinking the very angel in this little babe rebukes you

yes i mean it replied carl

then sir i must say you are more cruel than i thought men in these days are thinking themselves greater than god who made them if the almighty say to them walk they run if he says stand still they jump high up in the air if he says to them drink and gives for the purpose rivers wells and streams the great philosophers like you say dont drink well what must i do follow you or my maker when you meet old dives down yonder and he gives you his experience you will be sorry you ever despised a drink

but you are all the time referring to waterâpure harmless water you did not offer me waterâwhen i spoke i had alcoholic beverages in mind

and because you had your alcoholic beverages in mind you assume that i had them in mind too dont you well mars carl if i could speak common words and if you were not dear old massas son i would surely tell you what i have in my mindâand that is that you only want little longer ears and two more feet to be a pretty specimen i had thought you were getting choked a while ago and that a glass of water would have done you good

very good zac but you called me an ass

such a word never escaped my lips this day i am sure

but then you insinuated it

i will not swear that you are wrong your conscience knows better what you are yourself and if you think my insinuation is correct then its all right

but it is not correct

i dont know but i have great faith in the voice of conscience two more legs and a little longer ears would have made you a lamb in my mind for you are indeed a fine young fellow but as you consider yourself an ass i have no criticisms to make whatever

very well zac i accept your apology we are friends once more arent we

always so mars carl

i am sure there is something strong in that basket though

evidently so as little dora brings my dinner and the little angel might chance to fall and break the ware

mrs lindsay does not send over her china but enamel dishes which are very strong i tell you

carl went to the basket and mischievously drew out a flask of brandy

aha zac heres brandy thats what i was talking about all the time this will harden your arteries and make them become chalky

well sir i am glad you have told me that for even though i were foolish enough to give up my little grog to please foolish people with this splendid information i get from you at this moment i am resolved more than ever that i wont give it up i am so glad that when this mortal coil is put under the earth it will furnish some material with which conscientious schoolmasters i hope will write on blackboards for your children and grandchildren better things than fell to your lot

at this juncture dora interrupted and called zacs attention to the savoury dinner on the table

eat your dinner zac and dont bother with carl

he is too bad

zac acquiesced in the demands of his little friend and turned his attention towards his dinner

carl retired leaving the professor with the child

the publication of the banns of marriage between carl and mary took the town by surprise it was a severe blow to daphne mapleton who was deeply in love with carl and who had entertained hopes that their close friendship might ultimately have developed into carls proposing marriage to her when the news reached her ears she retired to her room and wept bitterly

it was at the judges diningtable that carl first met her after the publication of the banns on that occasion few words were interchanged between them but there was a pathos in daphnes eyes an expression on her countenance which seemed eloquently to rebuke carl and to interpret her inward pain

carl hardly dared to look into the pleading eyes of the girl his soul seemed to accuse him of cruelty he had undoubtedly known that daphne loved him ardently and it now appeared to him that he should have taken her into his confidence and let her know his real position he however sought to justify the voice of conscience by the consideration that he had never spoken to her of love or given any encouragement to her overtures as he bade goodnight to daphne she turned sweetly and with ringing pathos in her voice said wont you come and spend the evening with me carl it may be perhaps for the last time father and i are going away for an extended holiday i have something to say to you im sure miss highfield will not issue any veto against my request

carl could not refuse the invitation those dark liquid eyes so tender and sweet that shone like two brilliant jewels in the face of the graceful girl completely magnetized him

yes certainly daphne he replied i will come

at what hour tomorrow evening

i cannot say now but will write to let you know

we must be alone for a while and i must take time to consider when that will be most convenient

carl pressed her hand tenderly and they parted

the next day carl anxiously awaited daphnes note but it was not forthcoming a curious thing however happened one of judge mapletons servants handed him a letter addressed to him in daphnes writing but on opening it it was found to be intended for mary

the letter was as follows my deaii mary i have to congratulate you on your intended departure from the society of your spinster sisters i am however surprised that you had the heart to keep this secret from me who loved you so much

come and spend tomorrow with me and tell me all about it

yours daphne

carl had foregone the pleasure of accompanying mary and her father on a visit to one of his plantations that afternoon in order to keep his appointment with daphne and now it seemed as if she did not care to see him and had perhaps closed her heart against him

suddenly however like a flash of lightning the thought struck him had daphne made the unfortunate mistake of addressing his note to mary and hers to him

this seemed a probable solution but he hoped that it might not be so with his mind weighted with anxious thoughts he hastened to the judges home at eight oclock that evening as he approached the gate he suddenly met daphne who was impatiently walking up and down the pathway

is that the way you keep your appointment she said i have been expecting you since seven oclock

carls heart sank within him

i do not understand you he replied i have been waiting all day for your letter which i have not yet received so i took it into my head to walk over and see what is the matter i thought perhaps you had suddenly turned against me and did not wish to have me intrude into your august presence again

fie carl there is certainly a mistake somewhere

i sent two letters off by our groom to elmsdale this afternoon one for you and the other for your intended wife

is that so then you have made a mess of it

oh horror you addressed my note to mary and marys to me this is marys i have it here

and he took the communication from his pocket and handed it to daphne

 carl she exclaimed what a fool i have made of myself i was worried when i wrote and scarcely knew what i was doing i hope however mary will not think i want to usurp her rights

i regret very much this occurrence replied carl for although there may be nothing savouring of usurpation or direct dishonour in the communication it may be a means of raising a hornets nest about my ears you know very well that women are awfully jealous and when blinded by this instinct are apt to become unreasonable pray what did you write

it was a very hurried note asking you to meet me under the flamboyant tree in the garden at seven oclock when i would tell you what i had to say

enough in itself to arouse suspicion i however hope that mary knows me too well to lose her faith in me and will content herself in believing that things are not always what they seem 

daphnes face flushed with disappointment and suppressed annoyance it was evident that carls apprehensions and tender appreciation of the feelings of his fiancee so candidly expressed had pierced her heart

her jealousy began to burn with an overpowering flame and her womanly pride was hurt she had known that carl loved mary exceedingly well but that hauteur that peculiar egoism incidental to the woman who loves would not allow her mind to dwell upon that thought she could not fancy herself relegated to a secondary place in the heart of one whom she really loved although the evidences that pointed to the fact that mary had the precedence of her were as clear as daylight she assumed a mask by which she voluntarily blinded herself and drank in the delightful dreams that spring from unvanquished hope

miss highfield it is true she said is your prospective wife and may at some later day be granted by you the privilege of reading your communications but i think it is rather early for her to begin it would have been both honorable and womanly had she given you the letter immediately after she discovered it was not intended for her

be charitable daphne it was not her fault she had just got into the carriage to go with her father when the servant handed her the letter it is therefore quite possible that she did not open it until she was some distance away from the grove for she was deeply engaged in conversation with mr highfield i saw that she put the letter on the seat beside her without opening it i do not think they have returned yet from the country as they were expected to dinner at nine oclock i shall go over to the grove and see if there be any sign of an impending storm

and suppose there be a storm you would not mind it eh carl dear would you

they were standing facing each other beneath the spreading branches of the lovely flamboyant the rays of the silver moon shone down upon them through the sea of green and vermilion and revealed the handsome face of the girl upturned to carl the black lustrous eyes with the mischievous light of love seemed to mock with their alluring flame the mild serene beauty of their sister stars twinkling high above them in their milky way

i am sure you will not mind the storm dear carl

reiterated the girl for her companion had not broken the silence that had followed her words if mary becomes jealous and forsakes you there are more fish in the sea than ever were caught are there not is not your sister daphnes love as good as hers

it is quite true that i love you daphne but mary and i have met and loved under the most peculiar circumstances i am bound to her by inseparable ties and it would be terrible indeed if anything should occur to disturb the course of our affection i wrould never feel happy after the obligations that i owe her for her fortitude and implicit faith in me i shall never be able to repay

i thought as much since you have waived the glaring inconsistency of marrying out of your own race

i had hoped that you would have reconsidered this step and looked nearer home but i am now convinced that nothing in this world will hinder you from carrying out your determination i summoned you here this evening to unburden my soul to you and i know your kind heart will forgive my weakness i at first admired loved then adored youâand my life will henceforth be a dreary blank when i know you must marry another

since i must abandon my fondest hopes let me feel that you do not despise me that you will still keep a warm corner in your heart for me and i shall be content one kiss the first and last from you dear carl shall leave its sweet impress on my lips and the memory of it shall never be erased from my brain even though the fount of your love be reserved for another i shall always think fondly of you

carl was mystified and awestricken by the pathos of the girls words the melting faltering voice so eloquent of her deep feelings quite unnerved him

daphne stood before him like some alluring venus whose flaming passion appealed with irresistible power to his virile masculinity he presented a spectacle of manly beauty the symmetry of his stalwart frame was unequalled with broad wellproportioned shoulders beautifully rounded brown neck that supported like an elegant column his finely shaped head he might have been taken for a statue of apollo carved out of ebony daphne could hardly have escaped the fascination

it was a supreme moment of struggle to stem the tide of overmastering human passion that came rushing with a mighty irrepressible force through the channels of the flushed senses the higher self for some moments was entirely submerged with animation akin to frenzy carl placed his arm around daphnes neck and drew her face toward him he was in the act of kissing her but ere their lips met a mysterious voice seemed instantaneously to reach his ears and to vibrate through his soul it was the stern voice of conscience of manhood of honour that had suddenly burst its bonds and appeared to utter the words is it thus that you would maintain your honour carl the bridge that you would now so ruthlessly destroy is but the beginning of disaster

it was not too late to receive the warning which his good angel brought to him from the eternal heights

suddenly he turned away his face and daphne with a deathly pallor placed her arms on his shoulders and leaned on his breast as a support against the tide of emotions that threatened to overwhelm her

some moments afterward oh turning away from the garden their eyes fell upon mary highfield retreating with rapid steps through the gate suspicion now seized them both and they wondered if fate had been so unpropitious as to have revealed this little episode of romance to eyes for which they were least intended

carl took leave of daphne and walked rapidly home

then wedding bells ring out for joy and haste ye sluggard weary hours ye are the steeds that bear my life from barren wastes to blooming bowers

thos bailey aldrich

caul did not feel in an attitude of mind to meet his fiancee that same evening as he had intended his equanimity was upset when he left daphne and he entertained a premonition of ill he did not go down to breakfast until late the next morning and as he entered the diningroom one of the servants handed him on a silver tray a letter which he opened with great anxiety impatiently his eyes ran over the contents and a painful expression came over his face

gracious goodness he exclaimed can this be possible yet alas i am to blame

he put the missive in his pocket and left the room without tasting the food that awaited him on the table and went back upstairs to his room he sat down heavily upon a chair and sighed deeply and sorrowfully as if some terrible calamity had overtaken him he once more took the letter from his pocket and read it over and over it ran thus my dear carl when this comes to your hand you will kindly consider our engagement at an end and give immediate notice to the rev mr fairley to stay the further publication of our banns i know that this is a very serious step i am taking but it is not without due deliberation that i have come to the conclusion that the severance of our connection will result to our mutual advantage i have been an eyewitness to a scene in which you and another woman âfor whom i had entertained a high regardâwere the actors and i do not know that i could ever again place implicit confidence in any mortal my unsuspected presence near the place of your love episode was not premeditated but simply accidental i say this lest you should accuse me of the vulgarity of eavesdropping if i had a thousand tongues i could never express the disappointment pain and wretchedness which burst upon me when i realized that you whom i regarded as the ideal of true manhood had so unmistakably revealed your duplicity i thought i had wronged you a little while ago when i became jealous of her on whom you seemed to be lavishing at least a portion of your affection but perhaps i was not so far wrong do not think me impetuous or cruel my dear carl this step has caused me much pain even now while i write my soul is steeped in bitterness but i have no alternative

you will remember that we had been drawn together by the irresistible influences born of pure devotion and lofty ideals this sweet dream has now vanished my idol has turned to clay you may seek extenuation for your improprieties by pleading frailty and sudden passion i could not however bear to think that you would voluntarily allow yourself to be blinded by such a fallacy

i grant of course that we are all human but i had placed you upon a pedestal so high that it seemed impossible to me you could have made such an unfortunate detour from your standard

i think indiscriminate and promiscuous love directly clashes with lofty moral ideas the one man is the complement of the one woman when they have left the merely carnal stage and risen to lifes true plane the action of diffused rays of light can never be as potent as when these are focused upon one object

now that i know you have only half a love for me which may yet be divided into further fractions i must emphatically refuse to enter into a contract which in my estimation is too grand and sacred to be made a farce of

in order to save you the trouble of an explanation which i deem quite unnecessary i have decided that i shall not be able to grant you an interview and believe that this will be kindest for both of us

mary highfield

this was a trying time for carl his characteristic spartan philosophy which had rendered him imperturbable under other serious circumstances now entirely forsook him it had taken him some time fully to realize the force and meaning of that decisive communication and now that all his hopes were shattered and his dreams of happiness with mary were vanished a sensation of excruciating agony swept over him and his very brain and heart seemed crushed by some terrible instrument of torture scarcely knowing what he did he rushed out of the house and went over to the grove with a determination of seeing mary he discovered that that same indomitable will which had been once exercised on his behalf was now reasserted against him for like an impregnable rock she kept her word and refused to see him this deepened his misery

with a candour that left nothing untold he explained to lindsay and his wife the circumstances that had resulted in this unfortunate denouement they offered him their sympathy and promised to exert their influence to bring about a reconciliation which was so essential to complete the joys of the new life upon which he had just entered

mr highfield was much troubled when his daughter told him of her decision nevertheless he did not lose his confidence in carl and vainly advised mary not to rush precipitately to conclusions that she might have reason to regret when carl learned this it cheered him greatly as he was anxious to know mr highfields opinion in the matter he now felt more confident in approaching this gentleman whose sympathy he had reason to believe he would be able to secure he walked into mr highfields room and a cordial welcome was extended to him

a lengthy conversation ensued on the recent unhappy events carl took the opportunity completely to unburden his mind his steady clear voice manfully expressing the feelings of his heart his bright eyes glowing with the honest light that told that their owner could not possibly be false his candour that endeavoured neither to hide his mistakes nor palliate his errors  the strong expressions with which he strenuously defended his honour and sought to establish his innocence all appealed to mr highfields sympathy and large experience of the underlying currents of human nature

i am convinced more strongly than ever my dear carl said he that you are perfectly innocent of the charges that mary has made against you and i hope to see a perfect reconciliation brought about which will make us all happy once more i shall use all my influence to disabuse marys mind of her false conceptions of you

carl found himself day after day growing more sad and morose he drew away entirely from his friends and became painfully taciturn a picture of mary hung in his room and he often stood gazing upon it and sighing from the depths of his bruised heart she had refused to see him in person and her picture therefore became dearer and dearer to him weeks haul passed and although he had visited the grove frequently he could never get a glimpse of his unrelenting love

one afternoon however he saw mr dyett and mary walking across the grounds they seemed deeply engaged in conversation and mary now and then laughed in a melancholy way it was not that hearty rich laugh that he was once accustomed to hear with so much pleasureâmerely an apology for it this however did not impress carl so strongly as did the fact that she should be in such close companionship with the man who had become his open enemy the warm blood rushed to his brain his heart throbbed angrily against his chest and if he had given way to his desperate feelings he would have rushed upon dyett and throttled him on the spot lie knew well that this young coxcomb had now secured the opportunity he had long and earnestly sought for and so could now have everything his own way the thought simply maddened him

carl observed to his further chagrin that the intimacy between these two became closer each day they indulged in afternoon rides together and together they played lawn tennis and croquet matters assumed such a suspicious appearance that it was soon rumoured about that young dyett had won the heart that carl prized so dearly

carl had now reached a depth of misery that baffles description he left elmsdale early each morning and worked among the managers and overseers of his plantations returning late at night this did not however help him to escape from his burdened thoughts one night as he stood before marys picture gazing at it with burning anxious eyes he indulged in musings such as this my dearest girl perhaps if it were possible for me to hate you i could then determine to live on in this world and find my eden in another womans love but alas i cannot hate you  my god it is trueâi cannot hate her i must therefore face death and be released from the trammels which weigh down my every moment i do not blame you my highsouled girl for your conception of virtue and honour but i blame you for so cruelly locking your heart against me without giving me a chance to establish my innocence if you would but let me explain all would be right

he went to his iron safe that stood in a corner opened it and took out a loaded revolver which he held for some moments in his hand the cold steel glistened fiercely its withering aspect excited fear and horror

shall i do it now said the halfmaddened youth as his eyes glared with an unearthly light he stood for a moment seeming to halt between two opinions

then as if a sudden inspiration had taken possession of him he exclaimed great heavens what a fool i am making of myself

has my christian fortitude forsaken me it would be cowardice in me to die i shall live and fight manfully against this terrible ordeal and time will heal my wounds for god is just and good bettter bear the ills we have than fly to others that we know not of 

he therefore carefully unloaded the instrument of death went downstairs and threw it into the fire he gave up all thought of marrying mary highfield and with the banishment of this hope he gradually became more cheerful and once more entered the society of his friends to find soon that the kind hand of time was healing his wounded heart

whenever he met mary and mr dyett together he found that his anger and jealousy had become greatly modified and he lifted his hat with grace and apparent good will on these occasions he noticed that marys face always wore a pained expression which he interpreted as an index of some inward disquiet

one day after he had been entertained with the rich fund of comedy and wit which profusely sprung from zacs versatile brain they both went toward the elmsdale gate that opened upon the street at the side of the road stood a huge tamarind tree and between it and st albans church there was the path which immediately led from the highway to the rectory a runaway horse ridden by a lady was speeding down the road toward this spot as the animal drew nearer they saw that the rider was miss highfield who was making desperate efforts to control it but with little effort and it seemed evident that she would be dashed to pieces against the tree

just at this moment little dora lindsay who had not seen the runaway horse appeared on the road with zacs basket on her tiny arm her life was imperilled yet many who saw her position thought only of their own safety and fled with all their might to places of refuge while dyett who was on his way to the rectory joined the fleeing crowd the bent aged form of zac inspired with almost superhuman strength for one so advanced in years recked not the danger the life of his little friend the darling of his declining years was in imminent peril and he must save her though he perish in the attempt he ran into the road and caught up the child in his arms dora had now realized her position for the horse was but a few yards away

another moments delay and she would have lain a trampled bleeding corpse upon the ground the faithful old man achieved his purpose but as he placed the child down in safety he fell exhausted upon the pavement

marys life was evidently jeopardized for the horse was about to bolt into the rectory one of two things seemed imminentâeither that the horse would run against the tree and dash her to pieces or fling her upon the ground in making the sudden turn

but so unhappy an event was averted

carl ran into the road to save the girl whom he still loved like hercules of old he stood undaunted imperturbable a hero of heroes his dark handsome face was set as if in granite his rigorous heart beat anxiously within him and the stout muscles of his stalwart frame stood boldly out to support him

the horse with its terrified rider dashed fiercely along and was about to make the sudden turn when carl threw up his brawny arms and with a vigorous display of strength and agility caught the reins suddenly arresting the progress of the recalcitrant steed

a breathless silence ensued for those who had been looking at the scene were overcome with fright this was however followed by a loud hurrah in honour of carls manly act he stood for some moments holding the reins when mr dyett among others came up and tendered his congratulations

mary could hardly utter a word so overcome was she with terror carl led the now quieted animal into the rectory grounds and with the grace of a polished cavalier helped mary to dismount the dignity of his demeanour and the quiet formality that he observed were crushing to the young girl whose heart smote her bitterly for her obduracy one of mr fairleys servants came forward and led the horse away whereupon carl courteously bowed to mary and turned away without a word

but you have not waited for me to thank you carl

you are really so good to have thus jeopardized your life for me

oh dont mention it miss highfield it was simply a duty

he looked back upon the pale lovely face and smiled then continued on his way to the gate

as mary stood transfixed on the curbstone where she had alighted she presented an interesting picture

the complex expressions that sat upon her countenance would have furnished a fascinating study for an artist there were the evidences of terror mingled with penitence and remorse and she might have passed for some mater dolorosa of the middle ages on whose ears some mystic voice had sounded had not her form been relieved by the closelyfitting elegant ridinghabit that she wore and her headâher pretty little round head with its wealth of golden hairâbeen covered by the shapely terai hat

yes he loved meâi am sure she mused i am afraid i was too rash in reaching my conclusions

she threw up her veil and gazing steadily at carls moving form continued i will like the prodigal return to the arms of my wronged lover even though he should cast me from him

it is only the love that springs from the fountain of our moral ideal that could brave such danger for me

carl had almost reached the gate when she ran toward him and grasped his arm

carl can you forgive me stammered the girl with quivering lips i know that i have wronged youâ how much i alone can tell after your noble effort to save me at the hazard of your own life the veil has been drawn from my eyes and i can now see you once more in your true light it is i who am not worthy of your love

with a glad cry carl turned his face illuminated with pride and joy

then you think i have regained my lost moral ideal

nay carl you had never lost it i am sure i now accept fully my fathers explanation of the occurrence that resulted in our estrangement

do you really believe mary that you are the only woman that i have ever loved with that love that many waters cannot quench neither can the floods drown it

with all my heart i do my hero my life my only love

and are you prepared to take me again to your heart as of yore and believe me to be ever true

yes carl and nothing in this world shall again separate us what are we poor mortals that we should judge each other

carl caught her in his arms and rained kisses on her flushed face

freeing herself from his tender embrace mary with a shy upward glance said sweetly let us go at once to mr fairley and tell him to publish the banns again
