sport of the gods the dunbar paul laurence 
fiction has said so much in regret of the old days when there were plantations and overseers and masters and slaves that it was good to come upon such a household as berry hamiltons if for no other reason than that it afforded a relief from the monotony of tiresome iteration

the little cottage in which he lived with his wife fannie who was housekeeper to the oakleys and his son and daughter joe and kit sat back in the yard some hundred paces from the mansion of his employer it was somewhat in the manner of the old cabin in the quarters with which usage as well as tradition had made both master and servant familiar but unlike the cabin of the elder day it was a neatly furnished modem house the home of a typical goodliving negro for twenty years berry hamilton had been butler for maurice oakley he was one of the many slaves who upon their accession to freedom had not left the south but had wandered from place to place in their own beloved section waiting working and struggling to rise with its rehabilitated fortunes

the first faint signs of recovery were being seen when he came to maurice oakley as a servant through thick and thin he remained with him and when the final upward tendency of his employer began his fortunes had increased in like manner when having married oakley bought the great house in which he now lived he left the little servants cottage in the yard for as he said laughingly there is no telling when berry will be following my example and be taking a wife unto himself 

his joking prophecy came true very soon berry had long had a tenderness for fannie the housekeeper as she retained her post under the new mrs oakley and as there was a cottage ready to his hand it promised to be cheaper and more convenient all around to get married fannie was willing and so the matter was settled

fannie had never regretted her choice nor had berry ever had cause to curse his utilitarian ideas the stream of years had flowed pleasantly and peacefully with them their little sorrows had come but their joys had been many

as time went on the little cottage grew in comfort it was replenished with things handed down from the house from time to time and with others bought from the pairs earnings

berry had time for his lodge and fannie time to spare for her own house and garden flowers bloomed in the little plot in front and behind it vegetables and greens testified to the housewifes industry

over the door of the little house a fine virginia creeper bent and fell in graceful curves and a cluster of insistent morning glories clung in summer about its stalwart stock

it was into this bower of peace and comfort that joe and kitty were bom they brought a new sunlight into the house and a new joy to the fathers and mothers hearts their early lives were pleasant and carefully guarded they got what schooling the town afforded but both went to work early kitty helping her mother and joe learning the trade of barber

kit was the delight of her mothers life she was a pretty cheery little thing and could sing like a lark joe too was of a cheerful disposition but from scraping the chins of aristocrats came to imbibe some of their ideas and rather too early in life bid fair to be a dandy but his father encouraged him for said he its de popah thing fu a man what waits on quality to have quality mannahs an to waih quality clothes

 taint no use to be ahumoin dat boy too much bey fannie had replied although she did fully as much humoin  as her husband hit sho do mek him biggety an a biggety po niggah is a bomination befo de face of de lawd but i know taint no use atalkin to you fu you plum boun up in dat joe

her own eyes would follow the boy lovingly and proudly even as she chided she could not say very much either for berry always had the reply that she was spoiling kit out of all reason the girl did have the prettiest clothes of any of her race in the town and when she was to sing for the benefit of the ame church or for the benefit of her fathers society the tribe of benjamin there was nothing too good for her to wear in this too they were aided and abetted by mrs oakley who also took a lively interest in the girl

so the two doting parents had their chats and their jokes at each others expense and went bravely on doing their duties and spoiling their children much as white fathers and mothers are wont to do

what the less fortunate negroes of the community said of them and their offspring is really not worthwhile envy has a sharp tongue and when has not the aristocrat been the target for the plebeians sneers

joe and kit were respectively eighteen and sixteen at the time when the preparations for maurice oakleys farewell dinner to his brother francis were agitating the whole hamilton household all of them had a hand in the work joe had shaved the two men kit had helped mrs oakley s maid the mother had fretted herself weak over the shortcomings of a cook that had been in the family nearly as long as herself while berry was stem and dignified in anticipation of the glorious figure he was to make in serving

when all was ready peace again settled upon the hamiltons mrs hamilton in the whitest of white aprons prepared to be on hand to annoy the cook still more kit was ready to station herself where she could view the finery joe had condescended to promise to be home in time to eat some of the good things and berryâberry was gorgeous in his evening suit with the white waistcoat as he directed the nimble waiters hither and thither

maurice oakley was not a man of sudden or violent enthusiasms conservatism was the quality that had been the foundation of his fortunes at a time when the disruption of the country had involved most of the men of his region in ruin

without giving anyone ground to charge him with being lukewarm or renegade to his cause he had yet so adroitly managed his affairs that when peace came he was able quickly to recover much of the ground lost during the war with a rare genius for adapting himself to new conditions he accepted the changed order of things with a passive resignation but with a stern determination to make the most out of any good that might be in it

it was a favorite remark of his that there must be some good in every system and it was the duty of the citizen to find out that good and make it pay he had done this his house his reputation his satisfaction were all evidences that he had succeeded

a childless man he bestowed upon his younger brother francis the enthusiasm he would have given to a son his wife shared with her husband this feeling for her brotherinlaw and with him played the role of parent which had otherwise been denied her

it was true that francis oakley was only a halfbrother to maurice the son of a second and not too fortunate marriage but there was no halving of the love which the elder man had given to him from childhood up

at the first intimation that francis had artistic ability his brother had placed him under the best masters in america and later when the promise of his youth had begun to blossom he sent him to paris although the expenditure just at that time demanded a sacrifice which might have been the ruin of maurices own career franciss promise had never come to entire fulfillment he was always trembling on the verge of a great success without quite plunging into it despite the joy which his presence gave his brother and sisterinlaw most of his time was spent abroad where he could find just the atmosphere that suited his delicate artistic nature after a visit of two months he was about returning to paris for a stay of five years at last he was going to apply himself steadily and try to be less the dilettante

the company which maurice oakley brought together to say goodbye to his brother on this occasion was drawn from the best that this fine old southern town afforded there were colonels there at whose titles and the owners rights to them no one could laugh there were brilliant women there who had queened it in richmond baltimore louisville and new orleans and every southern capital under the old regime and there were younger ones there of wit and beauty who were just beginning to hold their court for francis was a great favorite both with men and women he was a handsome man tall slender and graceful he had the lace and brow of a poet a pallid face framed in a mass of dark hair there was a touch of weakness in his mouth but this was shaded and half hidden by a full mustache that made much forgivable to beautyloving eyes

it was generally conceded that mrs oakley was a hostess whose guests had no awkward halfhour before dinner no praise could be higher than this and tonight she had no need to exert herself to maintain this reputation her brotherinlaw was the life of the assembly he had wit and daring and about him there was just that hint of charming danger that made him irresistible to women the guests heard the dinner announced with surpriseâan unusual thing except in this house

both maurice oakley and his wife looked fondly at the artist as he went in with claire lessing he was talking animatedly to the girl having changed the general trend of the conversation to a manner and tone directed more particularly to her while she listened to him her face glowed and her eyes shone with a light that every man could not bring into them

as maurice and his wife followed him with their gaze the same thought was in their minds and it had not just come to them why could not francis marry claire lessing and settle in america instead of going back ever and again to that life in the latin quarter they did not believe that it was a bad life or a dissipated one but from the little that they had seen of it when they were in paris it was at least a bit too free and unconventional for their traditions there were too temptations which must assail any man of franciss looks and talents they had perfect faith in the strength of his manhood of course but could they have had their way it would have been their will to hedge him about so that no breath of evil invitation could have come nigh to him

but this younger brother this half ward of theirs was an unruly member he talked and laughed rode and walked with claire lessing with the same free abandon the same show of uninterested good comradeship that he had used toward her when they were boy and girl together there was not a shade more of warmth or selfconsciousness in his manner toward her than there had been fifteen years before in fact there was less for there had been a time when he was six and claire three that francis with a boldness that the lover of maturer years tries vainly to attain had announced to claire that he was going to marry her but he had never renewed this declaration when it came time that it would carry weight with it

they made a fine picture as they sat together tonight one seeing them could hardly help thinking on the instant that they were made for each other something in the womans face in her expression perhaps supplied a palpable lack in the man the strength of her mouth and chin helped the weakness of his she was the sort of woman who if ever he came to a great moral crisis in his life would be able to save him if she were near and yet he was going away from her giving up the pearl that he had only to put out his hand to take

some of these thoughts were in the minds of the brother and sister now

five years does seem a long while francis was saying but if a man accomplishes anything after all it seems only a short time to look back upon

all time is short to look back upon it is the looking forward to it that counts it doesnt though with a man i suppose hes doing something all the while

yes a man is always doing something even if only waiting but waiting is such unheroic business

that is the part that usually falls to a womans lot i have no doubt that some darkeyed mademoiselle is waiting for you now

francis laughed and flushed hotly claire noted the flush and wondered at it had she indeed hit upon the real point was that the reason that he was so anxious to get back to paris the thought struck a chill through her gaiety she did not want to be suspicious but what was the cause of that telltale flush he was not a man easily disconcerted then why so tonight but her companion talked on with such innocent composure that she believed herself mistaken as to the reason for his momentary confusion

someone cried gayly across the table to her oh miss claire you will not dare to talk with such little awe to our friend when he comes back with his ribbons and his medals why we shall all have to bow to you frank

youre wronging me esterton said francis no foreign decoration could ever be to me as much as the flower of approval from the fair women of my own state

hear cried the ladies

trust artists and poets to pay pretty compliments and this wily friend of mine pays his at my expense

a good bit of generalship that frank an old military man broke in esterton opened the breach and you at once galloped in thats the highest art of war

claire was looking at her companion had he meant the approval of the women or was it one woman that he cared for had the speech had a hidden meaning for her she could never tell she could not understand this man who had been so much to her for so long and yet did not seem to know it who was full of romance and fire and passion and yet looked at her beauty with the eyes of a mere comrade she sighed as she rose with the rest of the women to leave the table

the men lingered over their cigars the wine was old and the stories new what more could they ask there was a strong glow in francis oakleys face and his laugh was frequent and ringing some discussion came up which sent him running up to his room for a bit of evidence when he came down it was not to come directly to the dining room he paused in the hall and dispatched a servant to bring his brother to him

maurice found him standing weakly against the railing of the stairs something in his air impressed his brother strangely

what is it francis he questioned hurrying to him

i have just discovered a considerable loss was the reply in a grieved voice

if it is no worse than loss i am glad but what is it

every cent of money that i had to secure my letter of credit is gone from my bureau 

what when did it disappear

i went to my bureau tonight for something and found the money gone then i remembered that when i opened it two days ago i must have left the key in the lock as i found it tonight 

its a bad business but dont lets talk of it now come lets go back to our guests dont look so cut up about it frank old man it isnt as bad as it might be and you mustnt show a gloomy face tonight

the younger man pulled himself together and reentered the room with his brother in a few minutes his gaiety had apparently returned

when they rejoined the ladies even their quick eyes could detect in his demeanor no trace of the annoying thing that had occurred his face did not change until with a wealth of fervent congratulations he had bade the last guest goodbye

then he turned to his brother when leslie is in bed come into the library i will wait for you there he said and walked sadly away

poor foolish frank mused his brother as if the loss could matter to him

frank was very pale when his brother finally came to him at the appointed place he sat limply in his chair his eyes fixed upon the floor

come brace up now frank and tell me about it

at the sound of his brothers voice he started and looked up as though he had been dreaming

i dont know what youll think of me maurice he said i have never before been guilty of such criminal carelessness 

dont stop to accuse yourself our only hope in this matter lies in prompt action where was the money

in the oak cabinet and lying in the bureau drawer such a thing as a theft seemed so foreign to this place that i was never very particular about the box but i did not know until i went to it tonight that the last time i had opened it i had forgotten to take the key out it all flashed over me in a second when i saw it shining there even then i didnt suspect anything you dont know how i felt to open that cabinet and find all my money gone its awful

dont worry how much was there in all nine hundred and eightysix dollars most of which i am ashamed to say i had accepted from you

you have no right to talk that way frank you know i do not begrudge a cent you want i have never felt that my father did quite right in leaving me the bulk of the fortune but we wont discuss that now what i want you to understand though is that the money is yours as well as mine and you are always welcome to it 

the artist shook his head no maurice he said i can accept no more from you i have already used up all my own money and too much of yours in this hopeless fight i dont suppose i was ever cut out for an artist or id have done something really notable in this time and would not be a burden upon those who care for me no ill give up going to paris and find some work to do

frank frank be silent this is nonsense give up your art you shall not do it you shall go to paris as usual leslie and i have perfect faith in you you shall not give up on account of this misfortune what are the few paltry dollars to me or to you

nothing nothing i know it isnt the money its the principle of the thing 

principle be hanged you go back to paris tomorrow just as you had planned i do not ask it i command it

the younger man looked up quickly

pardon me frank for using those words and at such a time you know how near my heart your success lies and to hear you talk of giving it all up makes me forget myself forgive me but youll go back wont you

you are too good maurice said frank impulsively and i will go back and ill try to redeem myself 

there is no redeeming of yourself to do my dear boy all you have to do is to mature yourself well have a detective down and see what we can do in this matter 

frank gave a scarcely perceptible start i do so hate such things he said and anyway whats the use theyll never find out where the stuff went to

oh you need not be troubled in this matter i know that such things must jar on your delicate nature but i am a plain hardheaded businessman and i can attend to it without distaste

but i hate to shove everything unpleasant off on you its what ive been doing all my life

never mind that now tell me who was the last person you remember in your room

oh esterton was up there awhile before dinner but he was not alone two minutes

why he would be out of the question anyway who else

hamilton was up yesterday

alone

yes for awhile his boy joe shaved me and jack was up for a while brushing my clothes  then it lies between jack and joe

frank hesitated

neither one was left alone though

then only hamilton and esterton have been alone for any time in your room since you left the key in your cabinet

those are the only ones of whom i know anything what others went in during the day of course i know nothing about it couldnt have been either esterton or hamilton

not esterton no

and hamilton is beyond suspicion

no servant is beyond suspicion

i would trust hamilton anywhere said frank stoutly andwith anything

thats noble of you frank and i would have done the same but we must remember that we are not in the old days now the negroes are becoming less faithful and less contented and mores the pity and a deal more ambitious although i have never had any unfaithfulness on the part of hamilton to complain of before

then do not condemn him now

i shall not condemn anyone until i have proof positive of his guilt or such clear circumstantial evidence that my reason is satisfied 

i do not believe that you will ever have that against old hamilton

this spirit of trust does you credit frank and i very much hope that you may be right but as soon as a negro like hamilton learns the value of money and begins to earn it at the same time he begins to covet some easy and rapid way of securing it the old negro knew nothing of the value of money when he stole he stole hams and bacon and chickens these were his immediate necessities and the things he valued the present laughs at this tendency without knowing the cause the present negro resents the laugh and he has learned to value other things than those which satisfy his belly

frank looked bored

but pardon me for boring you i know you want to go to bed go and leave everything to me  the young man reluctantly withdrew and maurice went to the telephone and rung up the police station

as maurice had said he was a plain hardheaded businessman and it took very few words for him to put the chief of police in possession of the principal facts of the case a detective was detailed to take charge of the case and was started immediately so that he might be upon the ground as soon after the commission of the crime as possible

when he came he insisted that if he was to do anything he must question the robbed man and search his room at once oakley protested but the detective was adamant even now the presence in the room of a man uninitiated into the mysteries of criminal methods might be destroying the last vestige of a really important clue the master of the house had no alternative save to yield together they went to the artists room a light shone out through the crack under the door

i am sorry to disturb you again frank but may we come in

who is with you

the detective

i did not know he was to come tonight

the chief thought it better 

all right in a moment 

there was a sound of moving around and in a short time the young fellow partly undressed opened the door

to the detectives questions he answered in substance what he had told before he also brought out the cabinet it was a strong oak box uncarven but bound at the edges with brass the key was still in the lock where frank had left it on discovering his loss they raised the lid the cabinet contained two compartments one for letters and a smaller one for jewels and trinkets

when you opened this cabinet your money was gone

yes

were any of your papers touched

no

how about your jewels

i have but few and they were elsewhere the detective examined the room carefully its approaches and the hallways without he paused knowingly at a window that overlooked the flat top of a porch

do you ever leave this window open

it is almost always so

is this porch on the front of the house

no on the side

what else is out that way

frank and maurice looked at each other the younger man hesitated and put his hand to his head maurice answered grimly my butlers cottage is on that side and a little way back 

uh huh and your butler is i believe the hamilton whom the young gentleman mentioned some time ago

yes

franks face was really very white now the detective nodded again

i think i have a clue he said simply i will be here again tomorrow morning

but i shall be gone said frank

you will hardly be needed anyway

the artist gave a sigh of relief he hated to be involved in unpleasant things he went as far as the outer door with his brother and the detective as he bade the officer goodnight and hurried up the hall frank put his hand to his head again with a convulsive gesture as if struck by a sudden pain

come come frank you must take a drink now and go to bed said oakley

i am completely unnerved

i know it and i am no less shocked than you but weve got to face it like men

they passed into the dining room where maurice poured out some brandy for his brother and himself who would have thought it he asked as he tossed his own down

not i i had hoped against hope up until the last that it would turn out to be a mistake

nothing angers me so much as being deceived by the man i have helped and trusted i should feel the sting of all this much less if the thief had come from the outside broken in and robbed me but this after all these years is too low

dont be hard on a man maurice one never knows what prompts him to a deed and this evidence is all circumstantial

it is plain enough for me you are entirely too kindhearted frank but i see that this thing has worn you out you must not stand here talking go to bed for you must be fresh for tomorrow mornings journey to new york

frank oakley turned away toward his room his face was haggard and he staggered as he walked his brother looked after him with a pitying and affectionate gaze

poor fellow he said he is so delicately constructed that he cannot stand such shocks as these and then he added to think of that black hounds treachery ill give him all that the law sets down for him

he found mrs oakley asleep when he reached the room but he awakened her to tell her the story she was horrorstruck it was hard to have to believe this awful thing of an old servant but she agreed with him that hamilton must be made an example of when the time came before that however he must not know that he was suspected

they fell asleep he with thoughts of anger and revenge and she grieved and disappointed

the inmates of the oakley house had not been long in their beds before hamilton was out of his and rousing his own little household

you joe he called to his son git me fom daih an come right hyeah you got to hep me befo you go to any shop dis monin you kitty stir yo stumps miss i know yo mas adressin now ef she aint i bet ill be aftah huh in a minute too you all iayin roun snoozin wen you all des pintly know dis is de monin mistah frank go way fom hyeah

it was a cool autumn morning fresh and dewwashed the sun was just rising and a cool clear breeze was blowing across the land the blue smoke from the house where the fire was already going whirled fantastically over the roofs like a belated ghost it was just the morning to doze in comfort and so thought all of berrys household except himself loud was the complaining as they threw themselves out of bed they maintained that it was an altogether unearthly hour to get up even mrs hamilton added her protest until she suddenly remembered what morning it was when she hurried into her clothes and set about getting the familys breakfast

the good humor of all of them returned when they were seated about their table with some of the good things of the night before set out and the talk ran cheerily around

i do declaih said hamilton you all s as bad as dem white people was las night de way dey waded into dat food was a caution he chuckled with delight at the recollection

i reckon dats what dey come fu i wasnt payin so much tention to what dey eat as to de way dem women was dressed why mis jedge hill was des mo n gogeous

oh yes ma an miss lessing wasnt no ways behin her put in kitty

joe did not condescend to join in the conversation but contended himself with devouring the good things and aping the manners of the young men whom he knew had been among last nights guests

well i got to be goin said berry rising therell be early breakfas at de house dis monin sos mistah frank kin ketch de fus train

he went out cheerily to his work no shadow of impending disaster depressed his spirits no cloud obscured his sky he was a simple easy man and he saw nothing in the manner of the people whom he served that morning at breakfast save a natural grief at parting from each other he did not even take the trouble to inquire who the strange white man was who hung about the place

when it came time for the young man to leave with the privilege of an old servitor berry went up to him to bid him goodbye he held out his hand to him and with a glance at his brother frank took it and shook it cordially goodbye berry he said maurice could hardly restrain his anger at the sight but his wife was moved to tears at her brotherinlaws generosity

the last sight they saw as the carriage rolled away toward the station was berry standing upon the steps waving a hearty farewell and godspeed

how could you do it frank gasped his brother as soon as they had driven well out of hearing

hush maurice said mrs oakley gently i think it was very noble of him

oh i felt sorry for the poor fellow was franks reply promise me you wont be too hard on him maurice give him a little scare and let him go hes possibly buried the money anyhow

i shall deal with him as he deserves

the young man sighed and was silent the rest of the way

whether i fail or succeed you will always think well of me maurice he said in parting

and if i dont come up to your expectations well    forgive me    thats all

his brother wrung his hand you will always come up to my expectations frank he said wont he leslie

he will always be our frank our good generoushearted noble boy god bless him

the young fellow bade them a hearty goodbye and they knowing what his feelings must be spared him the prolonging of the strain they waited in the carriage and he waved to them as the train rolled out of the station

he seems to be sad at going said mrs oakley

poor fellow the affair of last night has broken him up considerably but ill make berry pay for every pang of anxiety that my brother has suffered

dont be revengeful maurice you know what brother frank asked of you

he is gone and will never know what happens so i may be as revengeful as i wish

the detective was waiting on the lawn when maurice oakley returned they went immediately to the library oakley walking with the firm hard tread of a man who is both exasperated and determined and the officer gliding along with the catlike step which is one of the attributes of his profession

well was the impatient mans question as soon as the door closed upon them

i have some more information that may or may not be of importance

out with it maybe i can tell

first let me ask if you had any reason to believe that your butler had any resources of his own say to the amount of three or four hundred dollars

certainly not i pay him thirty dollars a month and his wife fifteen dollars and with keeping up his lodges and the way he dresses that girl he cant save very much

you know that he has money in the bank no

well he has over eight hundred dollars what berry it must be the pickings of years

and yesterday it was increased by five hundred more

the scoundrel

how was your brothers money in bills

it was in large bills and gold with some silver 

berrys money was almost all in bills of a small denomination and silver 

a poor trick it could easily have been changed 

not such a sum without exciting comment he may have gone to several places

but he had only a day to do it in

then someone must have been his accomplice

that remains to be proven

nothing remains to be proven why its as clear as day that the money he has is the result of a long series of peculations and that this last is the result of his first large theft

that must be made clear to the law

it shall be

i should advise though no open proceedings against this servant until further evidence to establish his guilt is found 

if the evidence satisfies me it must be sufficient to satisfy any ordinary jury i demand his immediate arrest

as you will sir will you have him called here and question him or will you let me question him at once

yes

oakley struck the bell and berry himself answered it

youre just the man we want said oakley shortly

berry looked astonished

shall i question him asked the officer or will you

i will berry you deposited five hundred dollars at the bank yesterday

well suh mistah oakley was the grinning reply ef you aint de beatenes man to fin out things i evah seen

the employer half rose from his chair his face was livid with anger but at a sign from the detective he strove to calm himself

you had better let me talk to berry mr oakley said the officer

berry the officer pursued you admit having deposited five hundred dollars in the bank yesterday

sutny dey aint no reason why i shouldnt admit it ceptin erroun ermong dese jealous niggahs

uh huh well now where did you get this money

why i woked fu it o cose whaih you spose i got it t aint drappin off trees i reckon not roun dis pat of de country

you worked for it you must have done a pretty big job to have got so much money all in a lump

but i didnt git it in a lump why man i ve been savin dat money fu mon fo yeahs

more than four years why didnt you put it in the bank as you got it

why mosly it was too small an so i des kep it in a of sock i tol fannie dat some day ef de bank didnt bus wid all de res i had id put it in too she was alius sayin it was too much to have layin roun de house but i des tol huh dat no robber wasnt goin to bothah de po niggah down in de yad wid de rich white man up at de house but finlly i listened to huh an sposited it yistiddy

youre a liar youre a liar you black thief oakley broke in impetuously you have learned your lesson well but you cant cheat me i know where that money came from

calm yourself mr oakley calm yourself

i will not calm myself take him away he shall not stand here and lie to me

berry had suddenly turned ashen

you say you know whaih dat money come f om whaih

you stole it you thief from my brother franks room

stole it my gawd mistah oakley you believed a thing lak dat aftah all de yeahs i been wid you

youve been stealing all along 

why what shell i do said the servant helplessly i tell you mistah oakley ask fannie shell know how long i been asavin dis money 

ill ask no one 

i think it would be better to call his wife oakley

well call her but let this matter be done with soon 

fannie was summoned and when the matter was explained to her first gave evidences of giving way to grief but when the detective began to question her she calmed herself and answered directly just as her husband had

well posted sneered oakley arrest that man

berry had begun to look more hopeful during fannies recital but now the ashen look came back into his face at the word arrest his wife collapsed utterly and sobbed on her husbands shoulder

send the woman away

i wont go cried fannie stoutly ill stay right hyeah by my husband you shant drive me away fom him

berry turned to his employer you blieve dat i stole fom dis house aftah all de yeahs ive been in it aftah de caih i took of yo money an yo valybles aftah de way ive put you to bed fom many a dinnah an you woke up to fin all yo money safe now can you blieve dis

his voice broke and he ended with a cry

yes i believe it you thief yes take him away 

berrys eyes were bloodshot as he replied den damn you damn you ef dats all dese yeahs counted fu i wish i had astoled it 

oakley made a step forward and his man did likewise but the officer stepped between them

take that damned hound away or by god ill do him violence

the two men stood fiercely facing each other then the handcuffs were snapped on the servants wrist

no no shrieked fannie you musnt you musnt oh my gawd he aint no thief ill go to mis oakley she nevah will believe it she sped from the room

the commotion had called a crowd of curious servants into the hall fannie hardly saw them as she dashed among them crying for her mistress in a moment she returned dragging mrs oakley by the hand

tell em oh tell em miss leslie dat you dont believe it dont let em rest berry

why fannie i cant do anything it all seems perfectly plain and mr oakley knows better than any of us you know 

fannie her last hope gone flung herself on the floor crying o gawd o gawd hes gone fu sho

her husband bent over her the tears dropping from his eyes nevah min fannie he said nevah min hits boun to come out all right

she raised her head and seizing his manacled hands pressed them to her breast wailing in a low monotone gone gone

they disengaged her hands and led berry away

take her out said oakley sternly to the servants and they lifted her up and carried her away in a sort of dumb stupor that was half a swoon

they took her to her little cottage and laid her down until she could come to herself and the full horror of her situation burst upon her

the arrest of berry hamilton on the charge preferred by his employer was the cause of unusual commotion in the town both the accuser and the accused were well known to the citizens white and blackâmaurice oakley as a solid man of business and berry as an honest sensible negro and the pink of good servants the evening papers had a full story of the crime which closed by saying that the prisoner had amassed a considerable sum of money it was very likely from a long series of smaller perculations

it seems a strange irony upon the force of right living that this man who had never been arrested before who had never even been suspected of wrongdoing should find so few who even at the first telling doubted the story of his guilt many people began to remember things that had looked particularly suspicious in his dealings some others said i didnt think it of him there were only a few who dared to say i dont believe it of him

the first act of his lodge the tribe of benjamin whose treasurer he was was to have his accounts audited when they should have been visiting him with comfort and they seemed personally grieved when his books were found to be straight the ame church of which he had been an honest and active member hastened to disavow sympathy with him and to purge itself of contamination by turning him out his friends were afraid to visit him and were silent when his enemies gloated on every side one might have asked where is charity and gone away empty

in the black people of the town the strong influence of slavery was still operative and with one accord they turned away from one of their own kind upon whom had been set the ban of the white people s displeasure if they had sympathy they dared not show it their own interests the safety of their own positions and firesides demanded that they stand aloof from the criminal not then not now nor has it ever been true although it has been claimed that negroes either harbor or sympathize with the criminal of their kind they did not dare to do it before the sixties they do not dare to do it now they have brought down as a heritage from the days of their bondage both fear and disloyalty so berry was unbefriended while the storm raged around him the cell where they had placed him was kind to him and he could not hear the envious and sneering comments that went on about him

this was kind for the tongues of his enemies were not

tell me tell me said one you neednt tell me dat a bird kin fly so high dat he don have to come down some time an wen he do light honey my lawd how he flop

mistah rich niggah said another he wanted to dress his wife an chillen lak white folks did he well he foun out he foun out by de time de jedge git thoo wid him he wont be hol in his haid so high

wy dat gal ohisn broke in old isaac brown indignantly wy she wouldn speak to my gal minty when she met huh on de street i reckon she come down offn huh high hoss now

the fact of the matter was that minty brown was no better than she should have been and did not deserve to be spoken to but none of this was taken into account either by the speaker or the hearers the man was down it was time to strike

the women too joined their shrill voices to the general cry and were loud in their abuse of the hamiltons and in disparagement of their hightoned airs

i knowed it i knowed it mumbled one old crone rolling her bleared and jealous eyes with glee wenevah you see niggahs gittin so high dat dey own folks ain good enough fu em look out 

wy la aunt chloe i knowed it too dem people got so owdacious proud dat dey wouldnt walk up to de collection table no mo at chuch but alius set an waited twell de basket was passed erroun

hits de livin trufe an is been seein it all long i aint said nuffin but i knowed what uz gwine to happen  chloe aint lived all dese yeahs fu nuffin an ef she got de gif o secon sight t aint fu huh to say

the women suddenly became interested in this half assertion and the old hag seeing that she had made the desired impression lapsed into silence the whites were not neglecting to review and comment on the case also it had been long since so great a bit of wrongdoing in a negro had given them cause for speculation and recrimination

i tell you said old horace talbot who was noted for his kindliness toward people of color i tell you i pity that darky more than i blame him now heres my theory they were in the bar of the continental hotel and the old gentleman sipped his liquor as he talked its just like this the north thought they were doing a great thing when they come down here and freed all the slaves they thought they were doing a great thing and im not saying a word against them i give them the credit for having the courage of their convictions but i maintain that they were all wrong now in turning these people loose upon the country the way they did without knowledge of what the first principle of liberty was the natural result is that these people are irresponsible they are unacquainted with the ways of our higher civilization and itll take them a long time to learn you know rome wasnt built in a day i know berry and ive known him for a long while and a politer likelier darky than him you would have to go far to find and i havent the least doubt in the world that he took that money absolutely without a thought of wrong sir absolutely he saw it he took it and to his mental process that was the end of it to him there was no injury inflicted on any one there was no crime committed his elemental reasoning was simply this this man has more money than i have here is some of his surplus ill just take it why gentlemen i maintain that that man took that money with the same innocence of purpose with which one of our servants a few years ago would have appropriated a stray ham

i disagree with you entirely mr talbot broke in mr beachfield davis who was a mighty hunter make mine the same jerry only add a little syrup i disagree with you its simply total depravity thats all all niggers are alike and theres no use trying to do anything with them look at that man dodson of mine i had one of the finest young hounds in the state you know that white pup of mine mr talbot that i bought from hiram gaskins mighty fine breed well i was spendin all my time and patience trainin that dog in the daytime at night i put him in that niggers care to feed and bed well do you know i came home the other night and found that black rascal gone i went out to see if the dog was properly bedded and by jove the dog was gone too then i got suspicious when a nigger and a dog go out together at night one draws certain conclusions i thought i had heard bayin way out toward the edge of the town so i stayed outside and watched in about an hour here came dodson with a possum hung over his shoulder and my dog trottin at his heels hed been possum huntin with my houndâwith the finest hound in the state sir now i appeal to you all gentlemen if that aint total depravity what is total depravity

not total depravity beachfield i maintain but the very irresponsibility of which i have spoken why gentlemen i foresee the day when these people themselves shall come to us southerners of their own accord and ask to be reenslaved until such time as they shall be fit for freedom old horace was nothing if not logical

well do you think theres any doubt of the darkys guilt asked colonel saunders hesitatingly he was the only man who had ever thought of such a possibility they turned on him as if he had been some strange unnatural animal

any doubt cried old horace

any doubt exclaimed mr davis

any doubt almost shrieked the rest why there can be no doubt why colonel what are you thinking of tell us who has got the money if he hasnt tell us where on earth the nigger got the money hes been putting in the bank doubt why there isnt the least doubt about it

certainly certainly said the colonel but i thought of course he might have saved it there are several of those people you know who do a little business and have bank accounts

yes but they are in some sort of business this man makes only thirty dollars a month dont you see

the colonel saw or said he did and he did not answer what he might have answered that berry had no rent and no board to pay his clothes came from his master and kitty and fannie looked to their mistress for the larger number of their supplies he did not call to their minds that fannie herself made fifteen dollars a month and that for two years joe had been supporting himself these things did not come up and as far as the opinion of the gentlemen assembled in the continental bar went berry was already proven guilty

as for the prisoner himself after the first day when he had pleaded not guilty and been bound over to the grand jury he had fallen into a sort of dazed calm that was like the stupor produced by a drug he took little heed of what went on around him the shock had been too sudden for him and it was as if his reason had been for the time unseated

that it was not permanently overthrown was evidenced by his waking to the most acute pain and grief whenever fannie came to him then he would toss and moan and give vent to his sorrow in passionate complaints

i didnt tech his money fannie you know i didnt i woked fu every cent of dat money an i saved it myself oh ill nevah be able to git a job agin me in de lockupâme aftah all dese yeahs beyond this apparently his mind could not go that his detention was anything more than temporary never seemed to enter his mind that he would be convicted and sentenced was as far from possibility as the skies from the earth if he saw visions of a long sojourn in prison it was only as a nightmare half consciously experienced and which with the struggle must give way before the waking

fannie was utterly hopeless she had laid down whatever pride had been hers and gone to plead with maurice oakley for her husbands freedom and she had seen his hard set face she had gone upon her knees before his wife to cite berrys long fidelity

oh mis oakley she cried ef he did steal de money weve got enough saved to mek it good let him go let him go

then you admit that he did steal mrs oakley had taken her up sharply

oh i didnt say dat i didnt mean dat

that will do fannie i understand perfectly you should have confessed that long ago

but i aint confessing i aint he didntâ

you may go 

the stricken woman reeled out of her mistresss presence and mrs oakley told her husband that night with tears in her eyes how disappointed she was with fannieâthat the woman had known it all along and had only just confessed it was just one more link in the chain that was surely and not too slowly forging itself about berry hamilton

of all the family joe was the only one who burned with a fierce indignation he knew that his father was innocent and his very helplessness made a fever in his soul dandy as he was he was loyal and when he saw his mothers tears and his sisters shame something rose within him that had it been given play might have made a man of him but being crushed died and rotted and in the compost it made all the evil of his nature flourish the looks and gibes of his fellow employees at the barbershop forced him to leave his work there kit bowed with shame and grief dared not appear upon the streets where the girls who had envied her now hooted at her so the little family was shut in upon itself away from fellowship and sympathy

joe went seldom to see his father he was not heartless but the citadel of his longdesired and muchvaunted manhood trembled before the sight of his fathers abject misery the lines came round his lips and lines too must have come round his heart poor fellow he was too young for this forcing process and in the hothouse of pain he only grew an acrid unripe cynic

at the sitting of the grand jury berry was indicted his trial followed soon and the town turned out to see it some came to laugh and scoff but these his enemies were silenced by the spectacle of his grief in vain the lawyer whom he had secured showed that the evidence against him proved nothing in vain he produced proof of the slow accumulation of what the man had in vain he pleaded the mans former good name the judge and the jury saw otherwise berry was convicted he was given ten years at hard labor

he hardly looked as if he could live out one as he heard his sentence but nature was kind and relieved him of the strain with a cry as if his heart were bursting he started up and fell forward on his face unconscious someone a bit more brutal than the rest said its five dollars fine every time a nigger faints but no one laughed there was something too portentous too tragic in the degradation of this man

maurice oakley sat in the courtroom grim and relentless as soon as the trial was over he sent for fannie who still kept the cottage in the yard

you must go he said you cant stay here any longer i want none of your breed about me

and fannie bowed her head and went away from him in silence

all the night long the women of the hamilton household lay in bed and wept clinging to each other in their grief but joe did not go to sleep against all their entreaties he stayed up he put out the light and sat staring into the gloom with hard burning eyes

what particularly irritated maurice oakley was that berry should to the very last keep up his claim of innocence he reiterated it to the very moment that the train which was bearing him away pulled out of the station there had seldom been seen such an example of criminal hardihood and oakley was hardened thereby to greater severity in dealing with the convicts wife he began to urge her more strongly to move and she dispirited and humiliated by what had come to her looked vainly about for the way to satisfy his demands with her natural protector gone she felt more weak and helpless than she had thought it possible to feel it was hard enough to face the world but to have to ask something of it was almost more than she could bear

with the conviction of her husband the last five hundred dollars had been confiscated as belonging to the stolen money but their former deposit remained untouched with this she had the means at her disposal to tide over their present days of misfortune it was not money she lacked but confidence some inkling of the worlds attitude toward her guiltless though she was reached her and made her afraid

her desperation however would not let her give way to fear so she set forth to look for another house joe and kit saw her go as if she were starting on an expedition into a strange country in all their lives they had known no home save the little cottage in oakleys yard here they had toddled as babies and played as children and been happy and carefree there had been times when they had complained and wanted a home off by themselves like others whom they knew they had not failed either to draw unpleasant comparisons between their mode of life and the old plantation quarters system but now all this was forgotten and there were only grief and anxiety that they must leave the place and in such a way

fannie went out with little hope in her heart and a short while after she was gone joe decided to follow her and make an attempt to get work

ill go an see what i kin do anyway kit taint much use i reckon trying to get into a bahbah shop where they shave white folks because all the white folks are down on us ill try one of the colored shops

this was something of a condescension for berry hamiltons son he had never yet shaved a black chin or put shears to what he termed naps

and he was proud of it he thought though that after the training he had received from the superior tonsorial parlours where he had been employed he had but to ask for a place and he would be gladly accepted

it is strange how all the foolish little vaunting things that a man says in days of prosperity wax a giant crop around him in the days of his adversity berry hamiltons son found this out almost as soon as he had applied at the first of the colored shops for work

oh no suh said the proprietor i dont think we got anything fu you to do youre a white mans bahbah we dont shave nothin but niggahs hyeah an we shave em in de light o day an on de groun flo

wy i hyeah you say dat you couldnt git a paih of sheahs thoo a niggahs naps you aint been practicin lately has you came from the back of the shop where a grinning negro was scraping a fellows face

oh yes youre done with burrheads are you but burrheads are good enough fu you now

i think the proprietor resumed that i hyeahed you say you wasnt fond o grape pickin well josy my son i wouldnt begin it now specially as anothah kin o pickin seems to run in yo fambly

joe hamilton never knew how he got out of that shop he only knew that he found himself upon the street outside the door tears of anger and shame in his eyes and the laughs and taunts of his tormentors still ringing in his ears

it was cruel of course it was cruel it was brutal but only he knew how just it had been in his moments of pride he had said all those things half in fun and half in earnest and he began to wonder how he could have been so many kinds of a fool for so long without realizing it

he had not the heart to seek another shop for he knew that what would be known at one would be equally well known at all the rest the hardest thing that he had to bear was the knowledge that he had shut himself out of all the chances that he now desired he remembered with a pang the words of an old negro to whom he had once been impudent nevah min boy nevah min yous bon but you aint daid

it was too true he had not known then what would come he had never dreamed that anything so terrible could overtake him even in his straits however desperation gave him a certain pluck he would try for something else for which his own tongue had not disqualified him with joe to think was to do he went on to the continental hotel where there were almost always boys wanted to run the bells the clerk looked him over critically he was a bright sprucelooking young fellow and the man liked his looks

well i guess we can take you on he said whats your name

joe was the laconic answer he was afraid to say more

well joe you go over there and sit where you see those fellows in uniform and wait until i call the head bellman

young hamilton went over and sat down on a bench which ran along the hotel corridor and where the bellmen were wont to stay during the day awaiting their calls a few of the bluecoated mercuries were there upon joes advent they began to look askance at him and to talk among themselves he felt his face burning as he thought of what they must be saying then he saw the head bellman talking to the clerk and looking in his direction he saw him shake his head and walk away he could have cursed him the clerk called to him

i didnt know he said i didnt know that you were berry hamiltons boy now ive got nothing against you myself i dont hold you responsible for what your father did but i dont believe our boys would work with you i cant take you on

joe turned away to meet the grinning or contemptuous glances of the bellmen on the seat it would have been good to be able to hurl something among them but he was helpless

he hastened out of the hotel feeling that every eye was upon him every finger pointing at him every tongue whispering there goes joe hamilton whose father went to the penitentiary the other day

what should he do he could try no more he was proscribed and the letters of his ban were writ large throughout the town where all who ran might read for a while he wandered aimlessly about and then turned dejectedly homeward his mother had not yet come

did you get a job was kits first question

no he answered bitterly no one wants me now

no one wants you why joe they    they dont think hard of us do they

i dont know what they think of ma and you but they think hard of me all right

oh dont you worry itll be all right when it blows over 

yes when it all blows over but whenll that be

some of the girls cheery hopefulness had come back to her in the presence of her brothers dejection as a woman always forgets her own sorrow when someone she loves is grieving but she could not communicate any of her feeling to joe who had been and seen and felt and now sat darkly waiting his mothers return some presentiment seemed to tell him that armed as she was with money to pay for what she wanted and asking for nothing without price she would yet have no better tale to tell than he

none of these forebodings visited the mind of kit and as soon as her mother appeared on the threshold she ran to her crying oh where are we going to live ma

fannie looked at her for a moment and then answered with a burst of tears gawd knows child gawd knows

the girl stepped back astonished why why and then with a rush of tenderness she threw her arms about her mothers neck oh youre tired to death she said thats whats the matter with you never mind about the house now ive got some tea made for you and you just take a tp cup

fannie sat down and tried to drink her tea but she could not it stuck in her throat and the tears rolled down her face and fell into the shaking cup joe looked on silently he had been out and he understood

ill go out tomorrow and do some looking around for a house while you stay at home an rest ma

her mother looked up the maternal instinct for the protection of her daughter at once aroused oh no not you kitty she said

then for the first time joe spoke youd just as well tell kitty now ma for shes got to come across it anyhow

what you know about it whaih you been to

ive been out huntin work ive been to joness bahbah shop an to the continental hotel

his light brown face turned brick red with anger and shame at the memory of it i dont think ill try anymore

kitty was gazing with wide and saddening eyes at her mother

mean oh kitty kitty you dont know what it was like it nigh killed me thaih was plenty of houses an owned by people ive knowed fu yeahs but not one of em wanted to rent to me some of em made excuses bout one thing er tother but de res come right straight out an said dat wed give a neighborhood a bad name ef we moved into it ive almos tramped my laigs off ive tried every decent place i could think of but nobody wants us 

the girl was standing with her hands clenched nervously before her it was almost more than she could understand

why we aint done anything she said even if they dont know any better than to believe that pa was guilty they know we aint done anything

id like to cut the heart out of a few ofem said joe in his throat

it aint goin to do no good to look at it that away joe his mother replied i know hits had but we got to do de bes we kin

what are we goin to do cried the boy fiercely they wont let us work they wont let us live anywhaih do they want us to live on the levee an steal like some of em do

what are we goin to do echoed kitty helplessly id go out ef i thought i could find anythin to work at 

dont you go anywhaih child it ud only be worse de niggah men dat ust to be bowin an scrapin to me an tekin off dey hats to me laughed in my face i met mintyâan she slurred me right in de street deyd do worse fu you

in the midst of the conversation a knock came at the door it was a messenger from the house as they still called oakleys home and he wanted them to be out of the cottage by the next afternoon as the new servants were coming and would want the rooms

the message was so curt so hard and decisive that fannie was startled out of her grief into immediate action

well we got to go she said rising wearily

but where are we goin wailed kitty in affright theres no place to go to we havent got a house wherell we go

out o town someplace as fur away from this damned hole as we kin git the boy spoke recklessly in his anger he had never sworn before his mother before

she looked at him in horror joe joe she said youre mekin it wuss youre mekin it haddah fu me to baih when you talk dat away what you mean whaih you think gawd is

joe remained sullenly silent his mothers faith was too stalwart for his comprehension there was nothing like it in his own soul to interpret it

well git de seconhan dealah to tek ouah things tomorrer an then we ll go away some place up noth maybe

lets go to new york said joe

new yok

they had heard of new york as a place vague and far away a city that like heaven to them had existed by faith alone all the days of their lives they had heard of it and it seemed to them the center of all the glory all the wealth and all the freedom of the world new york it had an alluring sound who would know them there who would look down upon them

its a mighty long ways offfu me to be statin at dis time olife

we want to go a long ways off 

i wonder what pa would think of it if he was here put in kitty

i guess hed think we was doin the best we could

well den joe said his mother her voice trembling with emotion at the daring step they were about to take you set down an write a lettah to yo pa an tell him what we goin to do an tomorrerâtomorrerâwell stat

something akin to joy came into the boys heart as he sat down to write the letter they had taunted him had they they had scoffed at him but he was going where they might never go and some day he would come back holding his head high and pay them sneer for sneer and gibe for gibe

the same night the commission was given to the furniture dealer who would take charge of their things and sell them when and for what he could

from his window the next morning maurice oakley watched the wagon emptying the house then he saw fannie come out and walk about her little garden followed by her children he saw her as she wiped her eyes and led the way to the side gate

well theyre gone he said to his wife i wonder where theyre going to live

oh some of their people will take them in replied mrs oakley languidly

despite the fact that his mother carried with her the rest of the money drawn from the bank joe had suddenly stepped into the place of the man of the family he attended to all the details of their getting away with a promptness that made it seem untrue that he had never been more than thirty miles from his native town he was eager and excited as the train drew out of the station he did not look back upon the place which he hated but fannie and her daughter let their eyes linger upon it until the last house the last chimney and the last spire faded from their sight and their tears fell and mingled as they were whirled away toward the unknown

to the provincial coming to new york for the first time ignorant and unknown the city presents a notable mingling of the qualities of cheeriness and gloom if he have any eye at all for the beautiful he cannot help experiencing a thrill as he crosses the ferry over the river filled with plying craft and catches the first sight of the spires and buildings of new york if he have the right stuff in him a something will take possession of him that will grip him again every time he returns to the scene and will make him long and hunger for the place when he is away from it later the lights in the busy streets will bewilder and entice him he will feel shy and helpless amid the hurrying crowds a new emotion will take his heart as the people hasten by himâa feeling of loneliness almost of grief that with all of these souls about him he knows not one and not one of them cares for him after a while he will find a place and give a sigh of relief as he settles away from the citys sights behind his cozy blinds it is better here and the city is cruel and cold and unfeeling this he will feel perhaps for the first half hour and then he will be out in it all again he will be glad to strike elbows with the bustling mob and be happy at their indifference to him so that he may look at them and study them after it is all over after he has passed through the first pangs of strangeness and homesickness yes even after he has got beyond the strangers enthusiasm for the metropolis the real fever of love for the place will begin to take hold upon him the subtle insidious wine of new york will begin to intoxicate him then if he be wise he will go away anyplaceâyes he will even go over to jersey but if he be a fool he will stay and stay on until the town becomes all in all to him until the very streets are his chums and certain buildings and corners his best friends then he is hopeless and to live elsewhere would be death the bowery will be his romance broadway his lyric and the park his pastoral the river and the glory of it all his epic and he will look down pityingly on all the rest of humanity

it was the afternoon of a clear october day that the hamiltons reached new york fannie had some misgivings about crossing the ferry but once on the boat these gave way to speculations as to what they should find on the other side with the eagerness of youth to take in new impressions joe and kitty were more concerned with what they saw about them than with what their future would hold though they might well have stopped to ask some such questions in all the great city they knew absolutely no one and had no idea which way to go to find a stopping place

they looked about them for some colored face and finally saw one among the porters who were handling the baggage to joes inquiry he gave them an address and also proffered his advice as to the best way to reach the place he was exceedingly polite and he looked hard at kitty they found the house to which they had been directed and were a good deal surprised at its apparent grandeur it was a fourstoried brick dwelling on twentyseventh street as they looked from the outside they were afraid that the price of staying in such a place would be too much for their pockets inside the sight of the hard gaudily upholstered installmentplan furniture did not disillusion them and they continued to fear that they could never stop at this fine place but they found mrs jones the proprietress both gracious and willing to come to terms with them

as mrs hamiltonâshe began to be mrs hamilton now to the exclusion of fannieâwould have described mrs jones she was a big yellow woman she had a broad goodnatured face and a tendency to run to bust

yes she said i think i could arrange to take you i could let you have two rooms and you could use my kitchen until you decided whether you wanted to take a flat or not i has the whole house myself and i keeps roomers but latah on i could fix things so s you could have the whole third floor ef you wanted to most o my gentmens railroad gentmen they is i guess it must v been mr thomas that sent you up here

he was a little bright man down at de deepo

yes thats him thats mr thomas hes always lookin out to send someone here because hes been here three years hisself an he kin recommend my house

it was a relief to the hamiltons to find mrs jones so gracious and homelike so the matter was settled and they took up their abode with her and sent for their baggage

with the first pause in the rush that they had experienced since starting away from home mrs hamilton began to have time for reflection and their condition seemed to her much better as it was of course it was hard to be away from home and among strangers but the arrangement had this advantageâthat no one knew them or could taunt them with their past trouble she was not sure that she was going to like new york it had a great name and was really a great place but the very bigness of it frightened her and made her feel alone for she knew that there could not be so many people together without a deal of wickedness she did not argue the complement of this that the amount of good would also be increased but this was because to her evil was the very present factor in her life

joe and kit were differently affected by what they saw about them the boy was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant in the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going back home there had been no place much worth going to except church and one or two peoples houses but these young fellows seemed to show by their manners that they were neither going to church nor a family visiting in the moment that he recognized this a revelation came to himâthe knowledge that his horizon had been very narrow and he felt angry that it was so why should those fellows be different from him why should they walk the streets so knowingly so independently when he knew not whither to turn his steps well he was in new york and now he would learn someday some greenhorn from the south should stand at a window and look out envying him as he passed redcravated patentleathered intent on some goal was it not better after all that circumstances had forced them thither had it not been so they might all have stayed home and stagnated well thought he its an ill wind that blows nobody good and somehow with a guilty underthought he forgot to feel the natural pity for his father toiling guiltless in the prison of his native state

whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad the first sign of the demoralization of the provincial who comes to new york is his pride at his insensibility to certain impressions which used to influence him at home first he begins to scoff and there is no truth in his views nor depth in his laugh but by and by from mere pretending it becomes real he grows callous after that he goes to the devil very cheerfully

no such radical emotions however troubled kits mind she too stood at the windows and looked down into the street there was a sort of complacent calm in the manner in which she viewed the girls hats and dresses many of them were really pretty she told herself but for the most part they were not better than what she had had down home there was a sound quality in the girls makeup that helped her to see through the glamor of mere place and recognize worth for itself or it may have been the critical faculty which is prominent in most women that kept her from thinking a fivecent cheesecloth any better in new york than it was at home she had a certain selfrespect which made her value herself and her own traditions higher than her brother did his

when later in the evening the porter who had been kind to them came in and was introduced as mr william thomas young as she was she took his open admiration for her with more coolness than joe exhibited when thomas offered to show him something of the town some day or night

mr thomas was a loquacious little man with a confident air bom of an intense admiration of himself he was the idol of a number of servant girls hearts and altogether a decidedly dashing backareaway don juan

i tell you miss kitty he burst forth a few minutes after being introduced they aint no use talkin nyawkil give you a shakin up at you wont soon forget its the only town on the face of the earth you kin bet your life they aint no flies on nyawk we git the best shows here we git the best concertsâsay now whats the use o my callin it all outâwe simply git the best of everything

great place said joe wisely in what he thought was going to be quite a manoftheworld manner but he burned with shame the next minute because his voice sounded so weak and youthful then too the oracle only said yes to him and went on expatiating to kitty on the glories of the metropolis

djever see the statue o liberty great thing the statue o liberty ill take you round some day an cooney islandâoh my now thats the place and talk about fun thats the place for yy me

la thomas mrs jones put in how you do run on why the strangersll think theyll be talked to death before they have time to breathe

oh i guess the folks understan me im one o them kin o men at believe in whooping things up right from the beginning im never strange with anybody im a nyawker i tell you from the word go i say mis jones lets have some beer an well have some music purty soon theres a fellah in the house at plays ragtime out o sight 

mr thomas took the pail and went to the comer as he left the room mrs jones slapped her knee and laughed until her bust shook like jelly

mr thomas is a case sho she said but he likes you all an im mighty glad of it fu hes mighty curious about the house when he dont like the roomers

joe felt distinctly flattered for he found their new acquaintance charming his mother was still a little doubtful and kitty was sure she found the young man fresh

he came in pretty soon with his beer and a half dozen crabs in a bag

thought id bring home something to chew i always like to eat something with my beer

mrs jones brought in the glasses and the young man filled one and turned to kitty

no thanks she said with a surprised look

what dont you drink beer oh come now youll get out o that

kitty dont drink no beer broke in her mother with mild resentment i drinks it sometimes but she dont i reckon maybe de chillen better go to bed

joe felt as if the chillen had ruined all his hopes but kitty rose

the ingratiating n yawker was aghast

oh let em stay said mrs jones heartily a little beer aint goin to hurt em why sakes i know my father gave me beer from the time i could drink it and i knows i aint none the worse fu it

theyll git out o that all right if they live in nyawk said mr thomas as he poured out a glass and handed it to joe you neither

oh i drink it said the boy with an air but not looking at his mother

joe she cried to him you must ricollect you aint at home what ud yo pa think then she stopped suddenly and joe gulped his beer and kitty went to the piano to relieve her embarrassment

yes thats it miss kitty sing us something said the irrepressible thomas an alter while well have that fellah down that plays ragtime hes out o sight i tell you

with the pretty shyness of girlhood kitty sang one or two little songs in the simple manner she knew her voice was full and rich it delighted mr thomas

the mother hesitated and joe filled the breach

wed all like to go he said ma we ll go if you aint too tired 

tired pshaw youll furgit all about your tiredness when smithkins gits on the stage y ought to hear him sing i bin huntin fu wok youd die laughing

mrs hamilton made no further demur and the matter was closed

awhile later the ragtime man came down and gave them a sample of what they were to hear the next night mr thomas and mrs jones twostepped and they sent a boy after some more beer joe found it a very jolly evening but kits and the mothers hearts were heavy as they went up to bed

say said mr thomas when they had gone that little girls a peach you bet a little green i guess but shell ripen in the sun

fannie hamilton tired as she was sat long into the night with her little family discussing new yorkâits advantages and disadvantages its beauty and its ugliness its morality and immorality she had somewhat receded from her first position that it was better being here in the great strange city than being at home where the very streets shamed them she had not liked the way that their fellow lodger looked at kitty it was bold to say the least she was not pleased either with their new acquaintances familiarity and yet he had said no more than some stranger if there could be such a stranger would have said down home there was a difference however which she recognized thomas was not the provincial who puts everyone on a par with himself nor was he the metropolitan who complacently patronizes the whole world he was trained out of the one and not up to the other the intermediate only succeeded in being offensive mrs joness assurance as to her guests fine qualities did not do all that might have been expected to reassure mrs hamilton in the face of the difficulties of the gentlemans manner

she could not however lay her finger on any particular point that would give her the reason for rejecting his friendly advances she got ready the next evening to go to the theater with the rest mr thomas at once possessed himself of kitty and walked on ahead leaving joe to accompany his mother and mrs jonesâan arrangement by the way not altogether to that young gentlemans taste a good many men bowed to thomas in the street and they turned to look enviously after him at the door of the theater they had to run the gantlet of a dozen pairs of eyes here too the partys guide seemed to be well known for someone said before they passed out of hearing i wonder who that little light girl is that thomas is with tonight hes a hot one for you

mrs hamilton had been in a theater but once before in her life and joe and kit but a few times oftener on those occasions they had sat far up in the peanut gallery in the place reserved for people of color this was not a pleasant cleanly nor beautiful locality and by contrast with it even the garishness of the cheap new york theater seemed fine and glorious

they had good seats in the first balcony and here their guide had shown his managerial ability again for he had found it impossible or said so to get all the seats together so that he and the girl were in the row in front and to one side of where the rest sat kitty did not like the arrangement and innocently suggested that her brother take her seat while she went back to her mother but her escort overruled her objections easily and laughed at her so frankly that from very shame she could not urge them again and they were soon forgotten in her wonder at the mystery and glamor that envelops the home of the drama there was something weird to her in the alternate spaces of light and shade without any feeling of its ugliness she looked at the curtain as at a door that should presently open between her and a house of wonders she looked at it with the fascination that one always experiences for what either brings near or withholds the unknown

as for joe he was not bothered by the mystery or the glamor of things but he had suddenly raised himself in his own estimation he had gazed steadily at a girl across the aisle until she had smiled in response of course he went hot and cold by turns and the sweat broke out on his brow but instantly he began to swell he had made a decided advance in knowledge and he swelled with the consciousness that already he was coming to be a man of the world he looked with a new feeling at the swaggering sporty young negroes his attitude toward them was not one of humble selfdepreciation anymore since last night he had grown and felt that he might that he would be like them and it put a sort of chuckling glee into his heart

one might find it in him to feel sorry for this smallsouled warped being for he was so evidently the jest of fate if it were not that he was so blissfully so conceitedly unconscious of his own nastiness down home he had shaved the wild young bucks of the town and while doing it drunk in eagerly their unguarded narrations of their gay exploits so he had started out with false ideals as to what was fine and manly he was afflicted by a sort of moral and mental astigmatism that made him see everything wrong as he sat there tonight he gave to all he saw a wrong value and upon it based his ignorant desires

when the men of the orchestra filed in and began tuning their instruments it was the signal for an influx of loiterers from the door there were a large number of colored people in the audience and because members of their own race were giving the performance they seemed to take a proprietary interest in it all they discussed its merits and demerits as they walked down the aisle in much the same tone that the owners would have used had they been wondering whether the entertainment was going to please the people or not

finally the music struck up one of the numerous negro marches it was accompanied by the rhythmic patting of feet from all parts of the house

then the curtain went up on a scene of beauty it purported to be a grove to which a party of picnickers the ladies and gentlemen of the chorus had come for a holiday and they were telling the audience all about it in crescendos with the exception of one who looked like a faded kid glove the men discarded the greasepaint but the women under their makeups ranged from pure white pale yellow and sickly greens to brick reds and slate grays they were dressed in costumes that were not primarily intended for picnic going but they could sing and they did sing with their voices their bodies their souls they threw themselves into it because they enjoyed and felt what they were doing and they gave almost a semblance of dignity to the tawdry music and inane words

kitty was enchanted the airily dressed women seemed to her like creatures from fairyland it is strange how the glare of the footlights succeeds in deceiving so many people who are able to see through other delusions the cheap dresses on the street had not fooled kitty for an instant but take the same cheesecloth put a little water starch into it and put it on the stage and she could see only chiffon

she turned around and nodded delightedly at her brother but he did not see her he was lost transfixed his soul was floating on a sea of sense he had eyes and ears and thoughts only for the stage his nerves tingled and his hands twitched only to know one of those radiant creatures to have her speak to him smile at him if ever a man was intoxicated joe was mrs hamilton was divided between shame at the clothes of some of the women and delight with the music her companion was busy pointing out who this and that actress was and giving jellylike appreciation to the doings on the stage

mr thomas was the only cool one in the party he was quietly taking stock of his young companion âof her innocence and charm she was a pretty girl little and dainty but well developed for her age her hair was very black and wavy and some strain of the souths chivalric blood which is so curiously mingled with the african in the veins of most colored people had tinged her skin to an olive hue

are you enjoying yourself he leaned over and whispered to her his voice was very confidential and his lips near her ear but she did not notice

oh yes she answered this is grand how id like to be an actress and be up there

maybe you will some day

oh no im not smart enough

well see he said wisely i know a thing or two

between the first and second acts a number of thomass friends strolled up to where he sat and began talking and again kittys embarrassment took possession of her as they were introduced one by one they treated her with a halfcourteous familiarity that made her blush her mother was not pleased with the many acquaintances that her daughter was making and would have interfered had not mrs jones assured her that the men clustered about their hosts seat were some of the best people in town joe looked at them hungrily but the man in front with his sister did not think it necessary to include the brother or the rest of the party in his miscellaneous introductions

one brief bit of conversation which the mother overheard especially troubled her

not going out for a minute or two asked one of the men as he was turning away from thomas

no i dont think ill go out tonight you can have my share

the fellow gave a horselaugh and replied well youre doing a great piece of work miss hamilton whenever you can keep old bill from goin out an lushin between acts say you got a good thing push it along 

the girls mother half rose but she resumed her seat for the man was going away her mind was not quiet again however until the people were all in their seats and the curtain had gone up on the second act at first she was surprised at the enthusiasm over just such dancing as she could see any day from the loafers on the street corners down home and then like a good sensible humble woman she came around to the idea that it was she who had always been wrong in putting too low a value on really worthy things so she laughed and applauded with the rest all the while trying to quiet something that was tugging at her away down in her heart

when the performance was over she forced her way to kittys side where she remained in spite of all thomass palpable efforts to get her away finally he proposed that they all go to supper at one of the colored cafes

youll see a lot o the show people he said no i reckon wed bettah go home said mrs hamilton decidedly de chillen aint ust to stayin up all hours o nights an i aint anxious fu em to git ust to it

she was conscious of a growing dislike for this man who treated her daughter with such a proprietary air joe winced again at de chillen

thomas bit his lip and mentally said things that are unfit for publication aloud he said mebbe miss kitty ud like to go an have a little lunch

oh no thank you said the girl ive had a nice time and i dont care for a thing to eat

joe told himself that kitty was the biggest fool that it had even been his lot to meet and the disappointed suitor satisfied himself with the reflection that the girl was green yet but would get bravely over that

he attempted to hold her hand as they parted at the parlor door but she drew her fingers out of his clasp and said goodnight thank you as if he had been one of her mothers old friends

joe lingered a little longer

say that was out o sight he said

think so asked the other carelessly

id like to get out with you some time to see the town the boy went on eagerly

all right well go some time so long

so long

some time was it true would he really take him out and let him meet stage people joe went to bed with his head in a whirl he slept little that night for thinking of his hearts desire

whatever else his visit to the theater may have done for joe it inspired him with a desire to go to work and earn money of his own to be independent both of parental help and control and so be able to spend as he pleased with this end in view he set out to hunt for work it was a pleasant contrast to his last similar quest and he felt it with joy he was treated everywhere he went with courtesy even when no situation was forthcoming finally he came upon a man who was willing to try him for an afternoon from the moment the boy rightly considered himself engaged for he was master of his trade he began his work with heart elate now he had within his grasp the possibility of being all that he wanted to be now thomas might take him out at any time and not be ashamed of him

with thomas the fact that joe was working put the boy in an entirely new light he decided that now he might be worth cultivating for a week or two he had ignored him and proceeding upon the principle that if you give com to the old hen she will cluck to her chicks had treated mrs hamilton with marked deference and kindness this had been without success as both the girl and her mother held themselves politely aloof from him he began to see that his hope of winning kittys affections lay not in courting the older woman but in making a friend of the boy so on a certain saturday night when the banner club was to give one of its smokers he asked joe to go with him joe was glad to and they set out together arrived thomas left his companion for a few moments while he attended as he said to a little business what he really did was to seek out the proprietor of the club and some of its hangerson

i say he said ive got a friend with me tonight hes got some dough on him hes fresh and young and easy

whew exclaimed the proprietor

yes hes a good thing but push it along kin o light at first he might get skittish 

thomas let me fall on your bosom and weep said a young man who on account of his usual expression of innocent gloom was called sadness this is what ive been looking for for a month my hat was getting decidedly shabby do you think he would stand for a touch on the first night of our acquaintance

dont you dare do you want to frighten him off make him believe that youve got coin to burn and that its an honor to be with you  but you know he may expect a glimpse of the gold

a smart man dont need to show nothin all hes got to do is to act 

oh ill act well all act

be slow to take a drink from him

thomas my boy youre an angel i recognize that more and more every day but bid me do anything else but that that i refuse its against nature and sadness looked more mournful than ever

trust old sadness to do his part said the portly proprietor and thomas went back to the lamb

nothin doin so early he said lets go an have a drink

they went and thomas ordered

no no this is on me cried joe trembling with joy

pshaw your moneys counterfeit said his companion with fine generosity this is on me i say jack whatll you have yourself

as they stood at the bar the men began strolling up one by one each in his turn was introduced to joe they were very polite they treated him with a pale dignified highminded respect that menaced his pocketbook and possessions the proprietor mr turner asked him why he had never been in before he really seemed much hurt about it and on being told that joe had only been in the city for a couple of weeks expressed emphatic surprise even disbelief and assured the rest that anyone would have taken mr hamilton for an old new yorker

sadness was introduced last he bowed to joes happy to know you mr williams

better known as sadness he said with an expression of deep gloom a distant relative of mine once had a great grief i have never recovered from it

joe was not quite sure how to take this but the others laughed and he joined them and then to cover his own embarrassment he did what he thought the only correct and manly thing to doâhe ordered a drink

i dont know as i ought to said sadness

oh come on his companions called out dont be stiff with a stranger make him feel at home

mr hamilton will believe me when i say that i have no intention of being stiff but duty is duty ive got to go downtown to pay a bill and if i get too much aboard it wouldnt be safe walking around with money on me

aw shut up sadness said thomas my friend mr hamiltonll feel hurt if you dont drink with him

i certny will was joes opportune remark and he was pleased to see that it caused the reluctant one to yield

they took a drink there was quite a line of them joe asked the bartender what he would have the men warmed toward him they took several more drinks with him and he was happy sadness put his arm about his shoulder and told him with tears in his eyes that he looked like a cousin of his that had died

aw shut up sadness said someone else be respectable

sadness turned his mournful eyes upon the speaker i wont he replied being respectable is very nice as a diversion but its tedious if done steadily joe did not quite take this so he ordered another drink

a group of young fellows came in and passed up the stairs shearing another lamb said one of them significantly

well with that gang it will be well done 

thomas and joe left the crowd after a while and went to the upper floor where in a long brilliantly lighted room tables were set out for drinking parties at one end of the room was a piano and a man sat at it listlessly strumming some popular air the proprietor joined them pretty soon and steered them to a table opposite the door

just sit down here mr hamilton he said and you can see everybody that comes in we have lots of nice people here on smoker nights especially after the shows are out and the girls come in

joes heart gave a great leap and then settled as cold as lead of course those girls wouldnt speak to him but his hopes rose as the proprietor went on talking to him and to no one else mr turner always made a man feel as if he were of some consequence in the world and men a good deal older than joe had been fooled by his manner he talked to one in a soft ingratiating way giving his whole attention apparently he tapped one confidentially on the shoulder as if to say my dear boy i have but two friends in the world and you are both of them

joe charmed and pleased kept his head well there is a great deal in heredity and his father had not been maurice oakleys butler for so many years for nothing

the banner club was an institution for the lower education of negro youth it drew its pupils from every class of people and from every part of the country it was composed of all sorts and conditions of men educated and uneducated dishonest and less so of the good the bad and theâ unexposed parasites came there to find victims politicians for votes reporters for news and artists of all kinds for color and inspiration it was the place of assembly for a number of really bright men who after days of hard and often unrewarded work came there and drunk themselves drunk in each others company and when they were drunk talked of the eternal verities

the banner was only one of a kind it stood to the stranger and the man and woman without connections for the whole social life it was a substituteâpoor it must be confessedâto many youths for the home life which is so lacking among certain classes in new york

here the rounders congregated or came and spent the hours until it was time to go forth to bout or assignation here too came sometimes the curious who wanted to see something of the other side of life among these white visitors were not infrequentâthose who were young enough to be fascinated by the bizarre and those who were old enough to know that it was all in the game mr skaggs of the new york universe was one of the former class and a constant visitorâhe and a lady friend called maudie who had a penchant for dancing to ragtime melodies as only the puffessor of such a club can play them of course the place was a social cesspool generating a poisonous miasma and reeking with the stench of decayed and rotten moralities there is no defense to be made for it but what do you expect when false idealism and fevered ambition come face to face with catering cupidity

it was into this atmosphere that thomas had introduced the boy joe and he sat there now by his side firing his mind by pointing out the different celebrities who came in and telling highly flavored stories of their lives or doings joe heard things that had never come within the range of his mind before

aw theres skaggsy an maudieâmaudies his girl yknow an hes a reporter on the nyawk universe fine fellow skaggsy

maudieâa portly voluptuouslooking brunette âleft her escort and went directly to the space by the piano here she was soon dancing with one of the colored girls who had come in

skaggs started to sit down alone at a table but thomas called him come over here skaggsy

in the moment that it took the young man to reach them joe wondered if he would ever reach that state when he could call that white man skaggsy and the girl maudie the newcomer soon set all of that at ease

i want you to know my friend mr hamilton mr skaggs

why how d ye do hamilton im glad to meet you now look a here dont you let old thomas here string you about me bein any old mr skaggs im skaggsy to all of my friends i hope to count you among em

it was such a supreme moment that joe could not find words to answer so he called for another drink

not a bit of it said skaggsy not a bit of it

when i meet my friends i always reserve to myself the right of ordering the first drink waiter this is on me whatll you have gentlemen

they got their drinks and then skaggsy leaned over confidentially and began talking

i tell you hamilton there aint an ounce of prejudice in my body do you believe it

joe said that he did indeed skaggsy struck one as being aggressively unprejudiced

he went on you see a lot o fellows say to me what do you want to go down to that nigger club for thats what they call itânigger club but i say to em gentlemen at that nigger club as you choose to call it i get more inspiration than i could get at any of the greater clubs in new york ive often been invited to join some of the swell clubs here but i never do it by jove id rather come down here and fellowship right in with you fellows i like colored people anyway its natural you see my father had a big plantation and owned lots of slavesâno offense of course but it was the custom of that timeâand ive played with little darkies ever since i could remember

it was the same old story that the white who associates with negroes from volition usually tells to explain his taste

the truth about the young reporter was that he was bom and reared on a vermont farm where his early life was passed in fighting for his very subsistence but this never troubled skaggsy he was a monumental liar and the saving quality about him was that he calmly believed his own lies while he was telling them so no one was hurt for the deceiver was as much a victim as the deceived the boys who knew him best used to say that when skaggs got started on one of his debauches of lying the recording angel always put on an extra clerical force

now look at maudie he went on would you believe it that she was of a fine rich family and that the colored girl shes dancing with now used to be her servant shes just like me about that absolutely no prejudice

joe was wideeyed with wonder and admiration and he couldnt understand the amused expression on thomass face nor why he surreptitiously kicked him under the table

finally the reporter went his way and joes sponsor explained to him that he was not to take in what skaggsy said and that there hadnt been a word of truth in it he ended with everybody knows maudie and that colored girl is mamie lacey and never worked for anybody in her life skaggsys a good fellah all right but hes the biggest liar in n yawk

the boy was distinctly shocked he wasnt sure but thomas was jealous of the attention the white man had shown him and wished to belittle it anyway he did not thank him for destroying his romance

about eleven oclock when the people began to drop in from the plays the master of ceremonies opened proceedings by saying the free concert will now begin and i hope that all present ladies included will act like gentlemen and not forget the waiter mr meriweather will now favor us with the latest coon song entitled come back to yo baby honey 

there was a patter of applause and a young negro came forward and in a strident musichall voice sung or rather recited with many gestures the ditty he couldnt have been much older than joe but already his face was hard with dissipation and foul knowledge he gave the song with all the rank suggestiveness that could be put into it joe looked upon him as a hero he was followed by a little brownskinned fellow with an immature vandyke beard and a lisp he sung his own composition and was funny how much funnier than he himself knew or intended may not even be hinted at then while an instrumentalist who seemed to have a grudge against the piano was hammering out the opening bars of a march joes attention was attracted by a woman entering the room and from that moment he heard no more of the concert even when the master of ceremonies announced with an air that by special request he himself would sing answerâthe request was his ownâhe did not draw the attention of the boy away from the yellowskinned divinity who sat at a near table drinking whiskey straight

she was a small girl with fluffy dark hair and good features a tiny foot peeped out from beneath her rattling silk skirts she was a goodlooking young woman and daintily made though her face was no longer youthful and one might have wished that with her complexion she had not run to silk waists in magenta

joe however saw no fault in her she was altogether lovely to him and his delight was the more poignant as he recognized in her one of the girls he had seen on the stage a couple of weeks ago that being true nothing could keep her from being glorious in his eyesânot even the greasepaint which adhered in unneat patches to her face nor her taste for whiskey in its unreformed state he gazed at her in ecstasy until thomas turning to see what had attracted him said with a laugh oh its hattie sterling want to meet her

again the young fellow was dumb just then hattie also noticed his intent look and nodded and beckoned to thomas

come on he said rising

oh she didnt ask for me cried joe tremulous and eager

his companion went away laughing

whos your young friend asked hattie

a fellah from the south

bring him over here

joe could hardly believe in his own good luck and his head which was getting a bit weak was near collapsing when his divinity asked him what hed have he began to protest until she told the waiter with an air of authority to make it a little skey then she asked him for a cigarette and began talking to him in a pleasant soothing way between puffs

when the drinks came she said to thomas now old man youve been awfully nice but when you get your little drink you run away like a good little boy youre superfluous

thomas answered well i like that but obediently gulped his whiskey and withdrew while joe laughed until the master of ceremonies stood up and looked sternly at him

the concert had long been over and the room was less crowded when thomas sauntered back to the pair

well goodnight he said guess you can find your way home mr hamilton and he gave joe a long wink

goonight said joe woozily i be a ri goonight 

make it another skey was hatties farewell remark

it was late the next morning when joe got home he had a headache and a sense of triumph that not even his illness and his mothers reproof could subdue

he had promised hattie to come often to the club

mrs hamilton began to question very seriously whether she had done the best thing in coming to new york as she saw her son staying away more and more and growing always farther away from her and his sister had she known how and where he spent his evenings she would have had even greater cause to question the wisdom of their trip she knew that although he worked he never had any money for the house and she foresaw the time when the little they had would no longer suffice for kitty and her realizing this she herself out set out to find something to do

it was a hard matter for wherever she went seeking employment it was always for her and her daughter for the more she saw of mrs jones the less she thought it well to leave the girl under her influence mrs hamilton was not a keen woman but she had a mothers intuitions and she saw a subtle change in her daughter at first the girl grew wistful and then impatient and rebellious she complained that joe was away from them so much enjoying himself while she had to be housed up like a prisoner she had receded from her dignified position and twice of an evening had gone out for a car ride with thomas but as that gentleman never included the mother in his invitation she decided that her daughter should go no more and she begged joe to take his sister out sometimes instead he demurred at first for he now numbered among his city acquirements a fine contempt for his woman relatives finally however he consented and took kit once to the theater and once for a ride each time he left her in the care of thomas as soon as they were out of the house while he went to find or to wait for his dear hattie but his mother did not know all this and kit did not tell her the quick poison of the unreal life about her had already begun to affect her character she had grown secretive and sly the innocent longing which in a burst of enthusiasm she had expressed that first night at the theater was growing into a real ambition with her and she dropped the simple old songs she knew to practice the detestable coon ditties which the stage demanded

she showed no particular pleasure when her mother found the sort of place they wanted but went to work with her in sullen silence mrs hamilton could not understand it all and many a night she wept and prayed over the change in this child of her heart there were times when she felt that there was nothing left to work or fight for the letters from berry in prison became fewer and fewer he was sinking into the dull dead routine of his life her own letters to him fell off it was hard getting the children to write they did not want to be bothered and she could not write for herself so in the weeks and months that followed she drifted farther away from her children and husband and all the traditions of her life

after joes first night at the banner club he had kept his promise to hattie sterling and had gone often to meet her she had taught him much because it was to her advantage to do so his greenness had dropped from him like a garment but no amount of sophistication could make him deem the woman less perfect he knew that she was much older than he but he only took this fact as an additional sign of his prowess in having won her he was proud of himself when he went behind the scenes at the theater or waited for her at the stage door and bore her off under the admiring eyes of a crowd of gapers and hattie she liked him in a halfcontemptuous halfamused way he was a goodlooking boy and made money enough as she expressed it to show her a good time so she was willing to overlook his weakness and his callow vanity

look here she said to him one day i guess youll have to be moving theres a young lady been inquiring for you today and i wont stand for that

he looked at her startled for a moment until he saw the laughter in her eyes then he caught her and kissed her whatre you givin me he said

its a straight tip thats what

who is it

its a girl named minty brown from your home

his face turned brick red with fear and shame minty brown he stammered

had that girl told all and undone him but hattie was going on about her work and evidently knew nothing

oh you neednt pretend you dont know her she went on banteringly she says you were great friends down south so ive invited her to supper she wants to see you

to supper he thought was she mocking him was she restraining her scorn of him only to make his humiliation the greater after a while he looked at her but there was no suspicion of malice in her face and he took hope

well id like to see old minty he said its been many a long day since ive seen her

all that afternoon after going to the barbershop joe was driven by a tempest of conflicting emotions if minty brown had not told his story why not would she yet tell and if she did what would happen he tortured himself by questioning if hattie would cast him off at the very thought his hand trembled and the man in the chair asked him if he hadnt been drinking

when he met minty in the evening however the first glance at her reassured him her face was wreathed in smiles as she came forward and held out her hand

well well joe hamilton she exclaimed if i aint rightdown glad to see youl how are you

im middlin minty hows yourself he was so happy that he couldnt let go her hand

an jes look at the boy ef he aint got the impidence to be waihin a mustache too you must abeen lettin the cats lick yo upper lip didnt expect to see me in new york did you

no indeed what you doin here

oh i got a gentman friend whats a porter an his runs been changed so that he comes hyeah an he told me if i wanted to come hed bring me thoo fur a visit so you see hyeah i am i alius was mighty anxious to see this hyeah town but tell me hows kit an yo ma

theyre both right well he had forgotten them and their scorn of minty

whaih do you live im comin roun to see em

he hesitated for a moment he knew how his mother if not kit would receive her and yet he dared not anger this woman who had his fate in the hollow of her hand

she saw his hesitation and spoke up oh thats all right let bygones be bygones you know i aint the kin o person that holds a grudge agin anybody 

thats right minty thats right he said and gave her his mothers address then he hastened home to prepare the way for mintys coming joe had no doubt but that his mother would see the matter quite as he saw it and be willing to temporize with minty but he had reckoned without his host mrs hamilton might make certain concessions to strangers on the score of expediency but she absolutely refused to yield one iota of her dignity to one whom she had known so long as an inferior

but dont you see what she can do for us ma she knows people that i know and she can ruin me with them

i aint never bowed my haid to minty brown an i aint agoin to do it now was his mothers only reply

oh ma kitty put in you dont want to get talked about up here do you

wed jes as well be talked about fu somepn we didnt do as fu sompn we did do an it wouldn be long befo wed come to dat if we made friens wid dat brown gal i aint agoin to do it im ashamed o you kitty fu wantin me to

the girl began to cry while her brother walked the floor angrily

youll see whatll happen he cried youll see

fannie looked at her son and she seemed to see him more clearly than she had ever seen him beforeâhis foppery his meanness his cowardice

well she answered with a sigh it cant be no wuss den whats already happened 

youll see youll see the boy reiterated

minty brown allowed no wind of thought to cool the fire of her determination she left hattie sterlings soon after joe and he was still walking the floor and uttering dire forebodings when she rang the bell below and asked for the hamiltons

mrs jones ushered her into her fearfully upholstered parlor and then puffed upstairs to tell her lodgers that there was a friend there from the south who wanted to see them

tell huh said mrs hamilton dat dey aint no one hyeah wants to see huh

no no kitty broke in

heish said her mother im goin to boss you a little while yit 

why i dont understan you mis hamilton puffed mrs jones shes a nicelookin lady an she said she knowed you at home

all you got to do is to tell dat ooman jes what i say

minty brown downstairs had heard the little colloquy and perceiving that something was amiss had come to the stairs to listen now her voice striving hard to be condescending and sweet but growing harsh with anger floated up from below

oh nevah min lady i aint anxious to see em i jest called out o pity but i reckon dey shamed to see me cause de ol mans in penitentiary an dey was run out o town

mrs jones gasped and then turned and went hastily downstairs

kit burst out crying afresh and joe walked the floor muttering beneath his breath while the mother sat grimly watching the outcome finally they heard mrs joness step once more on the stairs she came in without knocking and her manner was distinctly unpleasant

mis hamilton she said ive had a talk with the lady downstairs an shes tol me everything id be glad if youd let me have my rooms as soon as possible

so you going to put me out on de wod of a stranger

im kin o sorry but everybody in the house heard what mis brown said an itll soon be all over town an that ud ruin the reputation of my house

i reckon all dat kin be splained 

yes but i dont know that anybody kin splain your daughter alius being with mr thomas who aint even divoced from his wife she flashed a vindictive glance at the girl who turned deadly pale and dropped her head in her hands

you daih to say dat mis jones you dat fust interduced my gal to dat man and got huh to go out wid him i reckon youd bettah go now

and mrs jones looked at fannies face and obeyed

as soon as the womans back was turned joe burst out there there see what youve done with your damned foolishness

fannie turned on him like a tigress dont you cuss hyeah befo me i aint nevah brung you up to it an i wont stan it go to dem whaih you lamed it an whaih de wods soun sweet the boy started to speak but she checked him dont you daih to cuss agin or befo gawd deyll be somepn fu one o dis fambly to be rottin in jail fu

the boy was cowed by his mothers manner he was gathering his few belongings in a bundle

i aint go in to cuss he said sullenly im go in out o your way

oh go on she said go on its been a long time sence you been my son you on yo way to hell an you is been fu lo dese many days

joe got out of the house as soon as possible he did not speak to kit nor look at his mother he felt like a cur because he knew deep down in his heart that he had only been waiting for some excuse to take this step

as he slammed the door behind him his mother flung herself down by kits side and mingled her tears with her daughters but kit did not raise her head

dey aint nothin lef but you now kit  but the girl did not speak she only shook with hard sobs

then her mother raised her head and almost screamed my gawd not you kit the girl rose and then dropped unconscious in her mothers arms

joe took his clothes to a lodging house that he knew of and then went to the club to drink himself up to the point of going to see hattie after the show

what joe hamilton lacked more than anything else in the world was someone to kick him many a man who might have lived decently and become a fairly respectable citizen has gone to the dogs for the want of someone to administer a good resounding kick at the right time it is corrective and clarifying

joe needed especially its clarifying property for though he knew himself a cur he went away from his mother s house feeling himself somehow aggrieved and the feeling grew upon him the more he thought of it his mother had ruined his chance in life and he could never hold up his head again yes he had heard that several of the fellows at the club had shady reputations but surely to be the son of a thief or a supposed thief was not like being the criminal himself

at the banner he took a seat by himself and ordering a cocktail sat glowering at the few other lonely members who had happened to drop in

there were not many of them and the contagion of unsociability had taken possession of the house the people sat scattered around at different tables perfectly unmindful of the bartender who cursed them under his breath for not getting together

joes mind was filled with bitter thoughts how long had he been away from home he asked himself nearly a year nearly a year passed in new york and he had come to be what he so much desiredâa part of its fast lifeâand now in a moment an old womans stubbornness had destroyed all that he had builded

what would thomas say when he heard it what would the other fellows think and hattie it was plain that she would never notice him again he had no doubt but that the malice of minty brown would prompt her to seek out all of his friends and make the story known why had he not tried to placate her by disavowing sympathy with his mother he would have had no compunction about doing so but he had thought of it too late he sat brooding over his trouble until the bartender called with respectful sarcasm to ask if he wanted to lease the glass he had

he gave back a silly laugh gulped the rest of the liquor down and was ordering another when sadness came in he came up directly to joe and sat down beside him mr hamilton says make it two jack  he said with easy familiarity well whats the matter old man youre looking glum

i feel glum

the divine hattie hasnt been cutting any capers has she the dear old girl hasnt been getting hysterical at her age let us hope not

joe glared at him why in the devil should this fellow be so sadly gay when he was weighted down with sorrow and shame and disgust

come come now hamilton if youre sore because i invited myself to take a drink with you ill withdraw the order i know the heroic thing to say is that ill pay for the drinks myself but i cant screw my courage up to the point of doing so unnatural a thing 

young hamilton hastened to protest oh i know you fellows now well enough to know how many drinks to pay for it aint that 

well then out with it what is it havent been up to anything have you

the desire came to joe to tell this man the whole truth just what was the matter and so to relieve his heart on the impulse he did if he had expected much from sadness he was disappointed for not a muscle of the mans face changed during the entire recital

when it was over he looked at his companion critically through a wreath of smoke then he said for a fellow who has had for a full year the advantage of the education of the new york clubs you are strangely young let me see you are nineteen or twenty nowâyes well that perhaps accounts for it its a pity you werent bom older its a pity most men arent they wouldnt have to take so much time and lose so many good things learning now mr hamilton let me tell you and you will pardon me for it that you are a fool your case isnt half as bad as that of ninetenths of the fellows that hang around here now for instance my father was hung

joe started and gave a gasp of horror

oh yes but it was done with a very good rope and by the best citizens of texas so it seems that i really ought to be very grateful to them for the distinction they conferred upon my family but i am not i am ungratefully sad a man must be very high or very low to take the sensible view of life that keeps him from being sad i must confess that i have aspired to the depths without ever being fully able to reach them

now look around a bit see that little girl over there thats viola two years ago she wrenched up an iron stool from the floor of a lunchroom and killed another woman with it shes nineteenâjust about your age by the way well she had friends with a certain amount of pull she got out of it and no one thinks the worse of viola you see hamilton in this life we are all suffering from fever and no one edges away from the other because he finds him a little warm its dangerous when youre not used to it but once you go through the parching process you become inoculated against further contagion now theres barney over there as decent a fellow as i know but he has been indicted twice for pocketpicking a half dozen fellows whom you meet here every night have killed their man others have done worse things for which you respect them less poor wallace who is just coming in and who looks like a jaunty ragpicker came here about six months ago with about two thousand dollars the proceeds from the sale of a house his father had left him hell sleep in one of the club chairs tonight and not from choice he spent his two thousand learning but after all it was a good investment it was like buying an annuity he begins to know already how to live on others as they have lived on him the plucked birds beak is sharpened for others feathers from now on wallace will live eat drink and sleep at the expense of others and will forget to mourn his lost money he will go on this way until broken and useless the poorhouse or the potters field gets him oh its a fine rich life my lad i know youll like it i said you would the first time i saw you it has plenty of stir in it and a man never gets lonesome only the rich are lonesome its only the independent who depend upon others

sadness laughed a peculiar laugh and there was a look in his terribly bright eyes that made joe creep if he could only have understood all that the man was saying to him he might even yet have turned back but he didnt he ordered another drink the only effect that the talk of sadness had upon him was to make him feel wonderfully in it it gave him a false bravery and he mentally told himself that now he would not be afraid to face hattie

he put out his hand to sadness with a knowing look thanks sadness he said youve helped me lots

sadness brushed the proffered hand away and sprung up you lie he cried i havent i was only fool enough to try and he turned hastily away from the table

joe looked surprised at first and then laughed at his friends retreating form poor old fellow he said drunk again must have had something before he came in

there was not a lie in all that sadness had said either as to their crime or their condition he belonged to a peculiar classâone that grows larger and larger each year in new york and which has imitators in every large city in this country it is a set which lives like the leech upon the blood of othersâthat draws its life from the veins of foolish men and immoral women that prides itself upon its welldressed idleness and has no shame in its voluntary pauperism each member of the class knows every other his methods and his limitations and their loyalty one to another makes of them a great hulking fashionably uniformed fraternity of indolence some play the races a few months of the year others quite as intermittently gamble at shoestring politics and waver from party to party as time or their interests seem to dictate but mostly they are like the lilies of the field

it was into this set that sadness had sarcastically invited joe and joe felt honored he found that all of his former feelings had been silly and quite out of place that all he had learned in his earlier years was false it was very plain to him now that to want a good reputation was the sign of unpardonable immaturity and that dishonor was the only real thing worthwhile it made him feel better

he was just rising bravely to swagger out to the theater when minty brown came in with one of the clubmen he knew he bowed and smiled but she appeared not to notice him at first and when she did she nudged her companion and laughed

suddenly his little courage began to ooze out and he knew what she must be saying to the fellow at her side for he looked over at him and grinned where now was the philosophy of sadness evidently minty had not been brought under its educating influences and thought about the whole matter in the old ignorant way he began to think of it too somehow old teachings and old traditions have an annoying way of coming back upon us in the critical moments of life although one has long ago recognized how much truer and better some newer ways of thinking are but joe would not allow minty to shatter his dreams by bringing up these old notions she must be instructed

he rose and went over to her table

why minty he said offering his hand you aint mad at me are you

go on away fom hyeah she said angrily i dont want none o thievin berry hamiltons fambly to speak to me

why you were all right this evening

yes but jest out o pity an you was nice cause you was afraid id tell on you go on now go on now said mintys young man and he looked menacing

joe what little selfrespect he had gone slunk out of the room and needed several whiskeys in a neighboring saloon to give him courage to go to the theater and wait for hattie who was playing in vaudeville houses pending the opening of her company

the closing act was just over when he reached the stage door he was there but a short time when hattie tripped out and took his arm her face was bright and smiling and there was no suggestion of disgust in the dancing eyes she turned up to him evidently she had not heard but the thought gave him no particular pleasure as it left him in suspense as to how she would act when she should hear

lets go somewhere and get some supper she said im as hungry as i can be what are you looking so cut up about

oh i aint feelin so very good

i hope you aint lettin that longtongued brown woman bother your head are you

â  his heart seemed to stand still she did know then

do you know all about it

why of course i do you might know shed come to me first with her story

and you still keep on speaking to me

now look here joe if youve been drinking ill forgive you if you aint you go on and leave me say what do you take me for do you think id throw down a friend because somebody else talked about him well you dont know hat sterling when minty told me that story she was back in my dressing room and i sent her out o there aflying and with a tonguelashing that she wont forget for a month o sundays

i reckon that was the reason she jumped on me so hard at the club he chuckled he had taken heart again all that had sadness said was true alter all and people thought no less of him his joy was unbounded

so she jumped on you hard did she the cat

oh she didnt say a thing to me

well joe its just like this i aint an angel you know that but i do try to be square and whenever i find a friend of mine down on his luck in his pocketbook or his feelings why i give him my flipper why old chap i believe i like you better for the stiff upper lip youve been keeping under all this

why hattie he broke out unable any longer to control himself youre    youreâ

oh im just plain hat sterling who wont throw down her friends now come on and get something to eat if that thing is at the club well go there and show her just how much her talk amounted to she thinks shes the whole game but i can spot her and then show her that she aint one two three

when they reached the banner they found minty still there she tried on the two the same tactics that she had employed so successfully upon joe alone she nudged her companion and tittered but she had another person to deal with hattie sterling stared at her coldly and indifferently and passed on by her to a seat joe proceeded to order supper and other things in the nonchalant way that the woman had enjoined upon him minty began to feel distinctly uncomfortable but it was her business not to be beaten she laughed outright hattie did not seem to hear her she was beckoning sadness to her side he came and sat down

now look here she said you cant have any supper because you havent reached the stage of magnificent hunger to make a meal palatable to you youve got so used to being nearly starved that a meal dont taste good to you under any other circumstance youre in on the drinks though your thirst is always available jack she called down the long room to the bartender make it three lean over here i want to talk to you see that woman over there by the wall no not that oneâthe big light woman with griggs well shes come here with a story trying to throw joe down and i want you to help me do her

oh thats the one that upset our young friend is it said sadness turning his mournful eyes upon minty

thats her so you know about it do you

yes and ill help do her she mustnt touch one of the fraternity you know  he kept his eyes fixed upon the outsider until she squirmed she could not at all understand this serious conversation directed at her she wondered if she had gone too far and if they contemplated putting her out it made her uneasy

now this same miss sterling had the faculty of attracting a good deal of attention when she wished to she brought it into play tonight and in ten minutes aided by sadness she had a crowd of jolly people about her table when as she would have expressed it everything was going fat she suddenly paused and turning her eyes full upon minty said in a voice loud enough for all to hear say boys youve heard that story about joe havent you

they had

well thats the one that told it shes come here to try to throw him and me down is she going to do it

well i guess not was the rousing reply and every face turned toward the now frightened minty she rose hastily and getting her skirts together fled from the room followed more leisurely by the crestfallen griggs hatties laugh and thank you fellows followed her out

matters were less easy for joes mother and sister than they were for him a week or more after this kitty found him and told him that mintys story had reached their employers and that they were out of work

you see joe she said sadly weve took a flat since we moved from mis joness and we had to furnish it weve got one lodger a racehorse man an hes mighty nice to ma an me but that aint enough now weve got to do something

joe was so smitten with sorrow that he gave her a dollar and promised to speak about the matter to a friend of his

he did speak about it to hattie

youve told me once or twice that your sister could sing bring her down here to me and if she can do anything ill get her a place on the stage was hatties answer

when kitty heard it she was radiant but her mother only shook her head and said de las hope de las hope

kitty proved herself joes sister by falling desperately in love with hattie sterling the first time they met the actress was very gracious to her and called her child in a pretty patronizing way and patted her on the cheek

its a shame that joe hasnt brought you around before weve been good friends for quite some time

he told me you an him was right good friends

already joe took on a new importance in his sisters eyes he must be quite a man she thought to be the friend of such a person as miss sterling

so you think you want to go on the stage do you

yesm i thought it might be right nice for me if i could

joe go out and get some beer for us and then ill hear your sister sing

miss sterling talked as if she were a manager and had only to snap her fingers to be obeyed when joe came back with the beer kitty drank a glass she did not like it but she would not offend her hostess after this she sang and miss sterling applauded her generously although the young girls nervousness kept her from doing her best the encouragement helped her and she did better as she became more at home

why child youve got a good voice and joe youve been keeping her shut up all this time you ought to be ashamed of yourself

the young man had little to say he had brought kitty almost under a protest because he had no confidence in her ability and thought that his girl would disillusion her it did not please him now to find his sister so frilly under the limelight and himself upstage

kitty was quite in a flutter of delight not so much with the idea of working as with the glamor of the work she might be allowed to do

i tell you now hattie sterling pursued throwing a brightly stockinged foot upon a chair your voice is too good for the chorus gi me a cigarette joe have one kitty im goin to call you kitty its nice and homelike and then weve got to be great chums you know

kitty unwilling to refuse anything from the sorceress took her cigarette and lighted it but a few puffs set her off coughing

tut tut kitty child dont do it if you aint used to it youll learn soon enough

joe wanted to kick his sister for having tried so delicate an art and failed for he had not yet lost all of his awe of hattie

now what i was going to say the lady resumed after several contemplative puffs is that youll have to begin in the chorus anyway and work your way up it wouldnt take long for you with your looks and voice to put one of the up and ups out o the business only hope it wont be me ive had people ive helped try to do it often enough

she gave a laugh that had just a touch of bitterness in it for she began to recognize that although she had been on the stage only a short time she was no longer the allconquering hattie sterling in the first freshness of her youth

oh i wouldnt want to push anybody out kit expostulated

oh never mind youll soon get bravely over that feeling and even if you didnt it wouldnt matter much the thing has to happen somebodys got to go down we dont last long in this life it soon wears us out and when were worn out and sung out danced out and played out the manager has no further use for us so he reduces us to the ranks or kicks us out entirely

joe here thought it time for him to put in a word get out hat he said contemptuously youre good for a dozen years yet

she didnt deign to notice him save so far as a sniff goes

dont you let what i say scare you though kitty youve got a good chance and maybe youll have more sense than ive got and at least save moneyâwhile youre in it but lets get off that it makes me sick all youve got to do is to come to the opera house tomorrow and ill introduce you to the manager hes a fool but i think we can make him do something for you

oh thank you ill be around tomorrow sure

better come about ten oclock theres a rehearsal tomorrow and youll find him there of course hell be pretty rough he always is at rehearsals but hell take to you if he thinks theres anything in you and he can get it out 

kitty felt herself dismissed and rose to go joe did not rise

ill see you later kit he said i aint goin just yet say he added when his sister was gone youre a hot one what do you want to give her all that con for shell never get in

joe said hattie dont you get awful tired of being a jackass sometimes i want to kiss you and sometimes i feel as if i had to kick you ill compromise with you now by letting you bring me some more beer this got all stale while your sister was here i saw she didnt like it and so i wouldnt drink anymore for fear shed try to keep up with me

kit is a good deal of a jay yet joe remarked wisely

oh yes this world is lull of jays lots ofem have seen enough to make em wise but theyre still jays and dont know it thats the worst of it they go around thinking theyre it when they aint even in the game go on and get the beer 

and joe went feeling vaguely that he had been sat upon

kit flew home with joyous heart to tell her mother of her good prospects she burst into the room crying oh ma ma miss hattie thinks ill do to go on the stage aint it grand

she did not meet with the expected warmth of response from her mother

i do know as itll be so gran fom what i see of dem stage people dey dont seem to mount to much de way dem gals shows demseves is rightdown bad to me is you goin to dress lak dem we seen dat night

kit hung her head

you mustnt feel that away ma im doin it to help you

kit did not reply but there was no yielding in her manner

the mother looked up to see just what effect her plea would have on her daughter she hoped that what she said would have the desired result but the girl turned around from fixing her neck ribbon before the glass her face radiant why itll be splendid hes such a nice man an racehorse men most always have money why dont you marry him ma then id feel that you was safe an settled an that you wouldnt be lonesome when the show was out of town

you want me to may him an desert yo po pa

i guess what he says is right ma i dont reckon well ever see pa again an you got to do something you got to live for yourself now

her mother dropped her head in her hands all right she said ill do it ill may him i might as well go de way both my chillens gone po bey po bey ef you evah do come out gawd hep you to baih what youll fin and mrs hamilton rose and tottered from the room as if the old age she anticipated had already come upon her

kit stood looking after her fear and grief in her eyes poor ma she said an poor pa but i know an i know its for the best

on the next morning she was up early and practicing hard for her interview with the managing star of martins blackbirds

when she arrived at the theater hattie sterling met her with frank friendliness

im glad you came early kitty she remarked for maybe you can get a chance to talk with martin before he begins rehearsal and gets all worked up hell be a little less like a bear then but even if you dont see him before then wait and dont get scared if he tries to bluff you his bark is a good deal worse than his bite

when mr martin came in that morning he had other ideas than that of seeing applicants for places his show must begin in two weeks and it was advertised to be larger and better than ever before when really nothing at all had been done for it the promise of this advertisement must be fulfilled mr martin was late and was out of humor with everyone else on account of it he came in hurried fierce and important

mornin mr smith mornin mrs jones ha ladies and gentlemen all here

he shot every word out of his mouth as if the aftertaste of it were unpleasant to him he walked among the chorus like an angry king among his vassals and his glance was a flash of insolent fire from his head to his feet he was the very epitome of selfsufficient brutal conceit

kitty trembled as she noted the hush that fell on the people at his entrance she felt like rushing out of the room she could never face this terrible man she trembled more as she found his eyes fixed upon her

whos that he asked disregarding her as if she had been a stick or a stone

well dont snap her head off its a girl friend of mine that wants a place said hattie she was the only one who would brave martin

humph let her wait i aint got no time to hear anyone now get yourselves in line you all who are on to that first chorus while im getting into my sweatshirt

he disappeared behind a screen whence he emerged arrayed or only half arrayed in a thick absorbing shirt and a thin pair of woolen trousers then the work began the man was indefatigable he was like the spirit of energy he was in every place about the stage at once leading the chorus showing them steps twisting some awkward girl into shape shouting gesticulating abusing the pianist

now now he would shout the left foot on that beat bah bah stop you walk like a lot of tin soldiers are your joints rusty do you want oil look here taylor if i didnt know you id take you for a truck pick up your feet open your mouths and move move move oh and he would drop his head in despair and to think that ive got to do something with these things in two weeksâtwo weeks then he would turn to them again with a sudden reaccession of eagerness now at it again at it again hold that note hold it now whirl and on the left foot stop that music stop it miss coster youll learn that step in about a thousand years and ive got nine hundred and ninetynine years and fifty weeks less time than that to spare come here and try that step with me dont be afraid to move step like a chicken on a hot griddle and some blushing girl would come forward and go through the step alone before all the rest

kitty contemplated the scene with a mind equally divided between fear and anger what should she do if he should so speak to her like the others no doubt smile sheepishly and obey him but she did not like to believe it she felt that the independence which she had known from babyhood would assert itself and that she would talk back to him even as hattie sterling did she felt scared and discouraged but every now and then her friend smiled encouragingly upon her across the ranks of moving singers

finally however her thoughts were broken in upon by hearing mr martin cry oh quit quit and go rest yourselves you ancient pieces of hickory and let me forget you for a minute before i go crazy wheres that new girl now

kitty rose and went toward him trembling so that she could hardly walk

what can you do

i can sing very faintly

well if thats the voice youre going to sing in there wont be many thatll know whether its good or bad well lets hear something do you know any of these

and he ran over the titles of several songs she knew some of them and he selected one try this here tom play it for her

it was an ordeal for the girl to go through she had never sung before at anything more formidable than a church concert where only her immediate acquaintances and townspeople were present now to sing before all these strange people themselves singers made her feel faint and awkward but the courage of desperation came to her and she struck into the song at the first her voice wavered and threatened to fail her it must not she choked back her fright and forced the music from her lips

when she was done she was startled to hear martin burst into a raucous laugh such humiliation she had failed and instead of telling her he was bringing her to shame before the whole company the tears came into her eyes and she was about giving way when she caught a reassuring nod and smile from hattie sterling and seized on this as a last hope

haw haw haw laughed martin haw haw haw the little one was scared see she was scared d you understand but did you see the grit she went at it with just took the bit in her teeth and got away haw haw haw now thats what i like if all you girls had that spirit we could do something in two weeks try another one girl

kittys heart had suddenly grown light she sang the second one better because something within her was singing

good said martin but he immediately returned to his cold manner you watch these girls close and see what they do and tomorrow be prepared to go into line and move as well as sing  he immediately turned his attention from her to the chorus but no slight that he could inflict upon her now could take away the sweet truth that she was engaged and tomorrow would begin work she wished she could go over and embrace hattie sterling she thought kindly of joe and promised herself to give him a present out of her first months earnings

on the first night of the show pretty little kitty hamilton waspointed out as a girl who wouldnt be in the chorus long the mother who was soon to be mrs gibson sat in the balcony a grieved pained look on her face joe was in a front row with some of the rest of the gang he took many drinks between the acts because he was proud

mr thomas was there he also was proud and after the performance he waited for kitty at the stage door and went forward to meet her as she came out the look she gave him stopped him and he let her pass without a word

whod a thought he mused that the kid had that much nerve well if they dont want to find out things what do they come to nyawk for it aint nobodys old sunday school picnic guess i got out easy anyhow 

hattie sterling took joe home in a hansom

say she said if you come this way for me again its all over see your little sisters a comer and ive got to hustle to keep up with her 

joe growled and fell asleep in his chair one must needs have a strong head or a strong will when one is the brother of a celebrity and would celebrate the distinguished ones success

a year after the arrest of berry hamilton and at a time when new york had shown to the eyes of his family so many strange new sights there were few changes to be noted in the condition of affairs at the oakley place maurice oakley was perhaps a shade more distrustful of his servants and consequently more testy with them mrs oakley was the same acquiescent woman with unbounded faith in her husbands wisdom and judgment with complacent minds both went their ways drank their wine and said their prayers and wished that brother franks five years were past they had letters from him now and then never very cheerful in tone but always breathing the deepest love and gratitude to them

his brother found deep cause for congratulation in the tone of these epistles

frank is getting down to work he would cry exultantly he is past the first buoyant enthusiasm of youth ah leslie when a man begins to be serious then he begins to be something and her only answer would be i wonder maurice if claire lessing will wait for him

the two had frequent questions to answer as to franks doing and prospects and they had always bright things to say of him even when his letters gave them no such warrant their love for him made them read large between the lines and all they read was good

between maurice and his brother no word of the guilty servant ever passed they each avoided it as an unpleasant subject frank had never asked and his brother had never proffered aught of the outcome of the case

mrs oakley had once suggested it brother ought to know she said that berry is being properly punished

by no means replied her husband you know that it would only hurt him he shall never know if i have to tell him

you are right maurice you are always right we must shield frank from the pain it would cause him poor fellow he is so sensitive

their hearts were still steadfastly fixed upon the union of this younger brother with claire lessing she had lately come into a fortune and there was nothing now to prevent it they would have written frank to urge it but they both believed that to try to woo him away from his art was but to make him more wayward that any woman could have power enough to take him away from this jealous mistress they very much doubted but they could hope and hope made them eager to open every letter that bore the french postmark always it might contain news that he was coming home or that he had made a great success or better some inquiry after claire a long time they had waited but found no such tidings in the letters from paris

at last as maurice oakley sat in his library one day the servant brought him a letter more bulky in weight and appearance than any he had yet received his eyes glistened with pleasure as he read the postmark a letter from frank he said joyfully and an important one ill wager

he smiled as he weighed it in his hand and caressed it mrs oakley was out shopping and as he knew how deep her interest was he hesitated to break the seal before she returned he curbed his natural desire and laid the heavy envelope down on the desk but he could not deny himself the pleasure of speculating as to its contents

it was such a large interestinglooking package what might it not contain it simply reeked of possibilities had anyone banteringly told maurice oakley that he had such a deep vein of sentiment he would have denied it with scorn and laughter but here he found himself sitting with the letter in his hand and weaving stories as to its contents

first now it might be a notice that frank had received the badge of the legion of honor no no that was too big and he laughed aloud at his own folly wondering the next minute with half shame why he laughed for did he after all believe anything was too big for that brother of his well let him begin anyway away down let him say for instance that the letter told of the completion and sale of a great picture frank had sold small ones he would be glad of this for his brother had written him several times of things that were adoing but not yet of anything that was done or better yet let the letter say that some picture long finished but of which the artists pride and anxiety had forbidden him to speak had made a glowing success the success it deserved this sounded well and seemed not at all beyond the bounds of possibility it was an alluring vision he saw the picture already it was a scene from life true in detail to the point of very minuteness and yet with something spiritual in it that lifted it above the mere copy of the commonplace at the salon it would be hung on the line and people would stand before it admiring its workmanship and asking who the artist was he drew on his memory of old reading in his minds eye he saw frank unconscious of his own power or too modest to admit it stand unknown among the crowds around his picture waiting for and dreading their criticisms he saw the light leap to his eyes as he heard their words of praise he saw the straightening of his narrow shoulders when he was forced to admit that he was the painter of the work then the windows of paris were filled with his portraits the papers were full of his praise and brave men and fair women met together to do him homage fair women yes and frank would look upon them all and see reflected in them but a tithe of the glory of one woman and that woman claire lessing he roused himself and laughed again as he tapped the magic envelope

my fancies go on and conquer the world for my brother he muttered he will follow their flight one day and do it himself

the letter drew his eyes back to it it seemed to invite him to beg him even no i will not do it i will wait until leslie comes she will be as glad to hear the good news as i am

his dreams were taking the shape of reality in his mind and he was believing all that he wanted to believe

he turned to look at a picture painted by frank which hung over the mantel he dwelt lovingly upon it seeing in it the touch of a genius

surely he said this new picture cannot be greater than that though it shall hang where kings can see it and this only graces the library of my poor house it has the feeling of a womans soul with the strength of a mans heart when frank and claire marry i shall give it back to them it is too great a treasure for a clod like me heigho why will women be so long ashopping

he glanced again at the letter and his hand went out involuntarily toward it he fondled it smiling

ah lady leslie ive a mind to open it to punish you for staying so long

he essayed to be playful but he knew that he was trying to make a compromise with himself because his eagerness grew stronger than his gallantry he laid the letter down and picked it up again he studied the postmark over and over he got up and walked to the window and back again and then began fumbling in his pockets for his knife no he did not want it yes he did he would just cut the envelope and make believe he had read it to pique his wife but he would not read it yes that was it he found the knife and slit the paper his fingers trembled as he touched the sheets that protruded why would not leslie come did she not know that he was waiting for her she ought to have known that there was a letter from paris today for it had been a month since they had had one

there was a sound of footsteps without he sprang up crying ive been waiting so long for you a servant opened the door to bring him a message oakley dismissed him angrily what did he want to go down to the continental for to drink and talk politics to a lot of muddlepated fools when he had a brother in paris who was an artist and a letter from him lay unread in his hand his patience and his temper were going leslie was careless and unfeeling she ought to come he was tired of waiting

a carriage rolled up the driveway and he dropped the letter guiltily as if it were not his own he would only say that he had grown tired of waiting and started to read it but it was only mrs daviss footman leaving a note for leslie about some charity

he went back to the letter well it was his leslie had forfeited her right to see it as soon as he it might be mean but it was not dishonest no he would not read it now but he would take it out and show her that he had exercised his selfcontrol in spite of her shortcomings he laid it on the desk once more it leered at him he might just open the sheets enough to see the lines that began it and read no further yes he would do that leslie could not feel hurt at such a little thing

the first line had only dear brother dear brother why not the second that could not hold much more the second line held him and the third and the fourth and as he read on unmindful now of what leslie might think or feel his face turned from the ruddy glow of pleasant anxiety to the pallor of grief and terror he was not halfway through when mrs oakleys voice in the hall announced her coming he did not hear her he sat staring at the page before him his lips apart and his eyes staring then with a cry that echoed through the house crumpling the sheets in his hand he fell forward feinting to the floor just as his wife rushed into the room

what is it she cried maurice maurice

he lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling the letter clutched in his hands she ran to him and lifted up his head but he gave no sign of life already the servants were crowding to the door she bade one of them to hasten to a doctor others to bring water and brandy and the rest to be gone as soon as she was alone she loosed the crumpled sheets from his hand for she felt that this must have been the cause of her husbands strange attack without a thought of wrong for they had no secrets from each other she glanced at the opening lines then she forgot the unconscious man at her feet and read the letter through to the end

the letter was in franks neat hand a little shaken perhaps by nervousness

dear brother i know you will grieve at receiving this and i wish that i might bear your grief for you but i cannot though i have as heavy a burden as this can bring to you mine would have been lighter today perhaps had you been more straightforward with me i am not blaming you however for i know that my hypocrisy made you believe me possessed of a really soft heart and you thought to spare me until yesterday when in a letter from esterton he casually mentioned the matter i did not know that berry was in prison else this letter would have been written sooner i have been wanting to write it for so long and yet have been too great a coward to do so

i know that you will be disappointed in me and just what that disappointment will cost you i know but you must hear the truth i shall never see your face again or i should not dare to tell it even now you will remember that i begged you to be easy on your servant you thought it was only my kindness of heart it was not i had a deeper reason i knew where the money had gone and dared not tell berry is as innocent as yourselfâand iâwell it is a story and let me tell it to you

you have had so much confidence in me and i hate to tell you that it was all misplaced i have no doubt that i should not be doing it now but that i have drunken absinthe enough to give me the emotional point of view which i shall regret tomorrow i do not mean that i am drunk i can think clearly and write clearly but my emotions are extremely active

do you remember claires saying at the table that night of the farewell dinner that some darkeyed mademoiselle was waiting for me she did not know how truly she spoke though i fancy she saw how i flushed when she said it for i was already in loveâmadly so

i need not describe her i need say nothing about her for i know that nothing i say can ever persuade you to forgive her for taking me from you this has gone on since i first came here and i dared not tell you for i saw whither your eyes had turned i loved this girl and she both inspired and hindered my work perhaps i would have been successful had i not met her perhaps not

i love her too well to marry her and make of our devotion a stale prosy thing of duty and compulsion when a man does not marry a woman he must keep her better than he would a wife it costs all that you gave me went to make her happy

then when i was about leaving you the catastrophe came i wanted much to carry back to her i gambled to make more i would surprise her luck was against me night after night i lost then just before the dinner i woke from my frenzy to find all that i had was gone i would have asked you for more and you would have given it but that strange ridiculous something which we misname southern honor that honor which strains at a gnat and swallows a camel withheld me and i preferred to do worse so i lied to you the money from my cabinet was not stolen save by myself i am a liar and a thief but your eyes shall never tell me so

tell the truth and have berry released i can stand it write me but one letter to tell me of this do not plead with me do not forgive me do not seek to find me for from this time i shall be as one who has perished from the earth i shall be no more

your brother frank by the time the servants came they found mrs oakley as white as her lord but with firm hands and compressed lips she ministered to his needs pending the doctors arrival she bathed his face and temples chafed his hands and forced the brandy between his lips finally he stirred and his hands gripped

the letter he gasped

yes dear i have it i have it

give it to me he cried she handed it to him he seized it and thrust it into his breast

did    did    you read it

yes i did not knowâ

oh my god i did not intend that you should see it i wanted the secret for my own i wanted to carry it to my grave with me oh frank frank frank

never mind maurice it is as if you alone knew it 

it is not i say it is not

he turned upon his face and began to weep passionately not like a man but like a child whose last toy has been broken

oh my god he moaned my brother my brother

sh dearie think   its   its   frank thats it thats itâthats what i cant forget its frankâfrank my brother

suddenly he sat up and his eyes stared straight into hers

leslie no one must ever know what is in this letter he said calmly

no one shall maurice come let us bum it bum it no no he cried clutching at his breast it must not be burned what bum my brothers secret no no i must carry it with meâcarry it with me to the grave

but mauriceâ

i must carry it with me

she saw that he was overwrought and so did not argue with him

when the doctor came he found maurice oakley in bed but better the medical man diagnosed the case and decided that he had received some severe shock he feared too for his heart for the patient constantly held his hands pressed against his bosom in vain the doctor pleaded he would not take them down and when the wife added her word the physician gave up and after prescribing left much puzzled in mind

its a strange case he said theres something more than the nervous shock that makes him clutch his chest like that and yet i have never noticed signs of heart trouble in oakley oh well business worry will produce anything in anybody it was soon common talk about the town about maurice oakleys attack in the seclusion of his chamber he was saying to his wife ah leslie you and i will keep the secret no one shall ever know yes dear but   but   what of berry what of berry he cried starting up excitedly what is berry to frank what is that nigger to my brother what are his sufferings to the honor of my family and name

never mind maurice never mind you are right

it must never be known i say if berry has to rot in jail

so they wrote a lie to frank and buried the secret in their breasts and oakley wore its visible form upon his heart

five years is but a short time in the life of a man and yet many things may happen therein for instance the whole way of a familys life may be changed good natures may be made into bad ones and out of a soul of faith grow a spirit of unbelief the independence of respectability may harden into the insolence of defiance and the sensitive cheek of modesty into the brazen face of shamelessness it may be true that the habits of years are hard to change but this is not true of the first sixteen or seventeen years of a young persons life else kitty hamilton and joe could not so easily have become what they were it had taken barely five years to accomplish an entire metamorphosis of their characters in joes case even a shorter time was needed he was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him and once started there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths for his will was as flabby as his conscience and his pride which stands to some men for conscience had no definite aim or direction

hattie sterling had given him both his greatest impulse for evil and for good she had at first given him his gentle push but when she saw that his collapse would lose her a faithful and useful slave she had sought to check his course her threat of the severance of their relations had held him up for a little time and she began to believe that he was safe again he went back to the work he had neglected drank moderately and acted in most things as a sound sensible being then all of a sudden he went down again and went down badly she kept her promise and threw him over then he became a hangeron at the clubs a genteel loafer he used to say in his sober moments that at last he was one of the boys that sadness had spoken of he did not work and yet he lived and ate and was proud of his degradation but he soon tired of being separated from hattie and straightened up again after some demurs he received him upon his former footing it was only for a few months he fell again for almost four years this had happened intermittently finally he took a turn for the better that endured so long that hattie sterling again gave him her faith then the woman made her mistake she warmed to him she showed him that she was proud of him he went forth at once to celebrate his victory he did not return to her for three days then he was battered unkempt and thick of speech

she looked at him in silent contempt for a while as he sat nursing his aching head

well youre a beauty she said finally with cutting scorn you ought to be put under a glass case and placed on exhibition

he groaned and his head sunk lower a drunken man is always disarmed

his helplessness instead of inspiring her with pity inflamed her with an unfeeling anger that burst forth in a volume of taunts

youre the thing ive given up all my chances forâyou a miserable drunken jay without a jays decency no one had ever looked at you until i picked you up and youve been strutting around ever since showing off because i was kind to you and now this is the way you pay me back drunk half the time and half drunk the rest well you know what i told you the last time you got loaded i mean it too youre not the only star in sight see she laughed meanly and began to sing youll have to find another baby now

for the first time he looked up and his eyes were full of tearsâtears both of grief and intoxication there was an expression of a whipped dog on his face

do    haie do    he pleaded stretching out his hands to her

her eyes blazed back at him but she sang on insolently tauntingly

the very inanity of the man disgusted her and on a sudden impulse she sprang up and struck him full in the face with the flat of her hand he was too weak to resist the blow and tumbling from the chair fell limply to the floor where he lay at her feet alternately weeping aloud and quivering with drunken hiccoughing sobs

get up she cried get up and get out o here you shant lay around my house

he had already begun to fall into a drunken sleep but she shook him got him to his feet and pushed him outside the door now go you drunken dog and never put your foot inside this house again

he stood outside swaying dizzily upon his feet and looking back with dazed eyes at the door then he muttered pu me out wi you pu me out damn you well i ki you see f i dont and he half walked half fell down the street

sadness and skaggsy were together at the club that night five years had not changed the latter as to wealth or position or inclination and he was still a frequent visitor at the banner he always came in alone now for maudie had gone the way of all the halfworld and reached depths to which mr skaggss job prevented him from following her however he mourned truly for his lost companion and tonight he was in a particularly pensive mood

someone was playing ragtime on the piano and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music skaggsy looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor it made him think of maudie he sighed and turned away

i tell you sadness he said impulsively dancing is the poetry of motion

yes replied sadness and dancing in ragtime is the dialect poetry

the reporter did not like this it savored of flippancy and he was about entering upon a discussion to prove that sadness had no soul when joe with bloodshot eyes and disheveled clothes staggered in and reeled toward them

drunk again said sadness really its a waste of time for joe to sober up hullo there as the young man brought up against him take a seat he put him in a chair at the table been lushin a bit eh

gi me somen drink

oh a hair of the dog some men shave their dogs clean and then have hydrophobia here jack

they drank and then as if the whiskey had done him good joe sat up in his chair

haies throwed me down

lucky dog you might have known it would have happened sooner or later better sooner than never

skaggs smoked in silence and looked at joe

im goin to kill her 

i wouldnt if i were you take old sadnesss advice and thank your stars that youre rid of her

im goin to kill her he paused and looked at them drowsily then bracing himself up again he broke out suddenly say d ever tell y bout the of man he never stole that money know he din

he threatened to fall asleep now but the reporter was all alert he scented a story

by jove he exclaimed did you hear that bet the chap stole it himself ands letting the old man suffer for it great story aint it come come wake up here three more jack what about your father

father whose father oh do bother me what

here here tell us about your father and the money if he didnt steal it who did

who did tha s it who did of man din steal it know he din

oh let him alone skaggsy he dont know what hes saying

yes he does a drunken man tells the truth

in some cases said sadness

oh let me alone man ive been trying for years to get a big sensation for my paper and if this story is one im a made man

the drink seemed to revive the young man again and by bits skaggs was able to pick out of him the story of his fathers arrest and conviction at its close he relapsed into stupidity murmuring she throwed me down

well sneered sadness you see drunken men tell the truth and you dont seem to get much guilt out of our young friend youre disappointed arent you

i confess i am disappointed but ive got an idea just the same

oh you have well dont handle it carelessly it might go off and sadness rose the reporter sat thinking for a time and then followed him leaving joe in a drunken sleep at the table there he lay for more than two hours when he finally awoke he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep a part of the helplessness of his intoxication had gone but his first act was to call for more whiskey this he gulped down and followed with another and another for a while he stood still brooding silently his red eyes blinking at the light then he turned abruptly and left the club

it was very late when he reached hatties door but he opened it with his latchkey as he had been used to do he stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy as he had so often done before then he went directly to her room she was a light sleeper and his step awakened her

who is it she cried in affright

its me his voice was steadier now but grim

what do you want didnt i tell you never to come here again get out or ill have you taken out

she sprang up in bed glaring angrily at him

his hands twitched nervously as if her will were conquering him and he were uneasy but he held her eye with his own

you put me out tonight he said

yes and im going to do it again youre drunk

she started to rise but he took a step toward her and she paused he looked as she had never seen him look before his face was ashen and his eyes like fire and blood she quailed beneath the look he took another step toward her

you put me out tonight he repeated like a dog

his step was steady and his tone was clear menacingly clear she shrank back from him back to the wall still his hands twitched and his eye held her still he crept slowly toward her his lips working and his hands moving convulsively

joe joe she said hoarsely whats the matter oh dont look at me like that

the gown had fallen away from her breast and showed the convulsive fluttering of her heart

he broke into a laugh a dry murderous laugh and his hands sought each other while the fingers twitched over one another like coiling serpents

you put me out    you    you and you made me what l am the realization of what he was of his foulness and degradation seemed just to have come to him fully you made me what i am and then you sent me away you let me come back and now you put me out

she gazed at him fascinated she tried to scream and she could not this was not joe this was not the boy that she had turned and twisted about her little finger this was a terrible terrible man or a monster

he moved a step nearer her his eyes fell to her throat for an instant she lost their steady glare and then she found her voice the scream was checked as it began his fingers had closed over her throat just where the gown had left it temptingly bare they gave it the caress of death she struggled they held her her eyes prayed to his but his were the fire of hell she fell back upon her pillow in silence he had not uttered a word he held her finally he flung her from him like a rag and sank into a chair and there the officers found him when hattie sterlings disappearance had become a strange thing

when joe was taken there was no spirit or feeling left in him he moved mechanically as if without sense or volition the first impression he gave was that of a man overacting insanity but this was soon removed by the very indifference with which he met everything concerned with his crime from the very first he made no effort to exonerate or to vindicate himself he talked little and only in a dry stupefied way he was as one whose soul is dead and perhaps it was for all the little soul of him had been wrapped up in the body of this one woman and the stroke that took her life had killed him too

the men who examined him were irritated beyond measure there was nothing for them to exercise their ingenuity upon he left them nothing to search for their most damning question he answered with an apathy that showed absolutely no interest in the matter it was as if someone whom he did not care about had committed a crime and he had been called to testily the only thing which he noticed or seemed to have any affection for was a little pet dog which had been hers and which they sometimes allowed to be with him after the life sentence had been passed upon him and when he was awaiting removal he would sit for hours with the little animal in his lap caressing it dumbly there was a mute sorrow in the eyes of both man and dog and they seemed to take comfort in each others presence there was no need of any sign between them they had both loved her had they not so they understood

sadness saw him and came back to the banner torn and unnerved by the sight i saw him he said with a shudder and itll take more whiskey than jack can give me in a year to wash the memory of him out of me why man it shocked me through its a pity they didnt send him to the chair it couldnt have done him much harm and would have been a real mercy

and so sadness and all the club with a muttered poor devil dismissed him he was gone why should they worry only one more who had got into the whirlpool enjoyed the sensation for a moment and then swept dizzily down there were indeed some who for an earnest hour sermonized about it and said here is another example of the pernicious influence of the city on untrained negroes oh is there no way to keep these people from rushing away from the small villages and country districts of the south up to the cities where they cannot battle with the terrible force of a strange and unusual environment is there no way to prove to them that woolenshirted brownjeaned simplicity is infinitely better than broadclothed degradation they wanted to preach to these people that good agriculture is better than bad artâthat it was better and nobler for them to sing to god across the southern fields than to dance for rowdies in the northern halls they wanted to dare to say that the south has its faultsâno one condones themâand its disadvantages but that even what they suffered from these was better than what awaited them in the great alleys of new york down there the bodies were restrained and they chafed but here the soul would fester and they would be content

this was but for an hour for even while they exclaimed they knew that there was no way and that the stream of young negro life would continue to flow up from the south dashing itself against the hard necessities of the city and breaking like waves against a rockâthat until the gods grew tired of their cruel sport there must still be sacrifices to false ideals and unreal ambitions

there was one heart though that neither dismissed joe with gratuitous pity nor sermonized about him the mother heart had only room for grief and pain already it had borne its share it had known sorrow for a lost husband tears at the refused to be touched he rebuked her for withholding that which save for his help she would never have been able to make this went on until they were almost entirely estranged he was wont to say that now his sister was up in the world she had got the big head and she to retort that her brother wanted to use her for a soft thing 

from the time that she went on the stage she had begun to live her own life a life in which the chief aim was the possession of good clothes and the ability to attract the attention which she had learned to crave the greatest sign of interest she showed in her brothers affair was at first to offer her mother money to secure a lawyer but when joe confessed all she consoled herself with the reflection that perhaps it was for the best and kept her money in her pocket with a sense of satisfaction she was getting to be so very much more joes sister she did not go to see her brother she was afraid it might make her nervous while she was in the city and she went on the road with her company before he was taken away

miss kitty hamilton had to be very careful about her nerves and her health she had had experiences and her voice was not as good as it used to be and her beauty had to be aided by cosmetics so she went away from new york and only read of all that happened when someone called her attention to it in the papers

berry hamilton in his southern prison knew nothing of all this for no letters had passed between him and his family for more than two years the very cruelty of destiny defeated itself in this and was kind

there was perhaps more depth to mr skaggs than most people gave him credit for having however it may be when he got an idea into his head whether it were insane or otherwise he had a decidedly tenacious way of holding to it sadness had been disposed to laugh at him when he announced that joes drunken story of his fathers troubles had given him an idea but it was nevertheless true and that idea had stayed with him clear through the exciting events that followed on that fatal night he thought and dreamed of it until he had made a working theory then one day with a boldness that he seldom assumed when in the sacred presence he walked into the office and laid his plans before the editor they talked together for some time and the editor seemed hard to convince

it would be a big thing for the paper he said if it only panned out but it is such a rattlebrained harumscarum thing no one under the sun would have thought of it but you skaggs

oh its bound to pan out i see the thing as clear as day theres no getting around it

yes it looks plausible but so does all fiction youre taking a chance youre losing time if it failsâ

but if it succeeds

well go and bring back a story if you dont look out its against my better judgment anyway remember i told you that

skaggs shot out of the office and within an hour and a half had boarded a fast train for the south

it is almost a question whether skaggs had a theory or whether he had told himself a pretty story and as usual believed it the editor was right no one else would have thought of the wild thing that was in the reporters mind the detective had not thought of it five years before nor had maurice oakley and his friends had an inkling and here was one of the new york universes young men going miles to prove his idea about something that did not at all concern him

when skaggs reached the town which had been the home of the hamiltons he went at once to the continental hotel he had as yet formulated no plan of immediate action and with a fools or a geniuss belief in his destiny he sat down to await the turn of events his first move would be to get acquainted with some of his neighbors this was no difficult matter as the bar of the continental was still the gathering place of some of the citys choice spirits of the old regime thither he went and his convivial cheerfulness soon placed him on terms of equality with many of his kind

he insinuated that he was looking around for business prospects this proved his open sesame five years had not changed the continental frequenters much and skaggss intention immediately brought beachfield davis down upon him with the remark if a man wants to go into business business for a gentleman suh gad theres no finer or betterpaying business in the world than breeding blooded dogsâthat is if you get a man of experience to go in with you

dogs dogs driveled old horace talbot beachfields always talking about dogs i remember the night we were all discussing that hamilton niggers arrest beachfield said it was a sign of total depravity because his man hunted possums with his hound the old man laughed inanely the hotel whiskey was getting on his nerves

the reporter opened his eyes and his ears he had stumbled upon something at any rate

what was it about some niggers arrest sir he asked respectfully

oh it wasnt anything much only an old and trusted servant robbed his master and my theoryâ

but you will remember mr talbot broke in davis that i proved your theory to be wrong and cited a conclusive instance

yes a possumhunting dog

i am really anxious to hear about the robbery though it seems such an unusual thing for a negro to steal a great amount 

just so and that was part of my theory nowâ

its an old story and a long one mr skaggs and one of merely local repute interjected colonel saunders i dont think it could possibly interest you who are familiar with the records of the really great crimes that take place in a city such as new york

those things do interest me very much though i am something of a psychologist and i often find the smallest and most insignificantappearing details pregnant with suggestion wont you let me hear the story colonel

why yes though theres little in it save that i am one of the few men who have come to believe that the negro berry hamilton is not the guilty party

nonsense nonsensel said talbot of course berry was guilty but as i said before i dont blame him the negroesâ

total depravity said davis now look at my dogâ

if you will retire with me to the further table i will give you whatever of the facts i can call to mind

as unobtrusively as they could they drew apart from the others and seated themselves at a more secluded table leaving talbot and davis wrangling as of old over their theories when the glasses were filled and the pipes going the colonel began his story interlarding it frequently with comments of his own

now in the first place mr skaggs he said when the tale was done i am lawyer enough to see for myself how weak the evidence was upon which the negro was convicted and later events have done much to confirm me in the opinion that he was innocent

later events

yes the colonel leaned across the table and his voice fell to a whisper four years ago a great change took place in maurice oakley it happened in the space of a day and no one knows the cause of it from a social companionable man he became a recluse shunning visitors and dreading society from an openhearted unsuspicious neighbor he became secretive and distrustful of his own friends from an active businessman he has become a retired brooder he sees no one if he can help it he writes no letters and receives none not even from his brother it is said and all of this came about in the space of twentyfour hours

but what was the beginning of it

no one knows save that one day he had some sort of nervous attack by the time the doctor was called he was better but he kept clutching his hand over his heart naturally the physician wanted to examine him there but the very suggestion of it seemed to throw him into a frenzy and his wife too begged the doctor an old friend of the family to desist maurice oakley had been as sound as a dollar and no one of the family had had any tendency to heart affection

it is strange

strange it is but i have my theory

his actions are like those of a man guarding a secret

sh his negro laundress says that there is an inside pocket in his undershirts 

an inside pocket

yes

and for what skaggs was trembling with eagerness

the colonel dropped his voice lower

we can only speculate he said but as i have said i have my theory oakley was a just man and in punishing his old servant for the supposed robbery it is plain that he acted from principle but he is also a proud man and would hate to confess that he had been in the wrong so i believed that the cause of his first shock was the finding of the money that he supposed gone unwilling to admit this error he lets the misapprehension go on and it is the money which he carries in his secret pocket with a morbid fear of its discovery that has made him dismiss his servants leave his business and refuse to see his friends

a very natural conclusion colonel and i must say that i believe you it is strange that others have not seen as you have seen and brought the matter to light

well you see mr skaggs none are so dull as the people who think they think i can safely say that there is not another man in this town who has lighted upon the real solution of this matter though it has been openly talked of for so long but as for bringing it to light no one would think of doing that it would be sure to hurt oakleys feelings and he is of one of our best families

ah yes perfectly right

skaggs had got all that he wanted much more in fact than he had expected the colonel held him for a while yet to enlarge upon the views that he had expressed

when the reporter finally left him it was with a cheery goodnight colonel if i were a criminal i should be afraid of that analytical mind of yours

he went upstairs chuckling the old fool he cried as he flung himself into a chair ive got it ive got it maurice oakley must see me and then what he sat down to think out what he should do tomorrow again with his fine disregard of ways and means he determined to trust to luck and as he expressed it brace old oakley

accordingly he went about nine oclock the next morning to oakleys house a grayhaired sadeyed woman inquired his errand

i want to see mr oakley he said

you cannot see him mr oakley is not well and does not see visitors

but i must see him madam i am here upon business of importance

you can tell me just as well as him i am his wife and transact all of his business

i can tell no one but the master of the house himself 

you cannot see him it is against his orders

very well replied skaggs descending one step it is his loss not mine i have tried to do my duty and failed simply tell him that i came from paris

paris cried a querulous voice behind the womans back leslie why do you keep the gentleman at the door let him come in at once 

mrs oakley stepped from the door and skaggs went in had he seen oakley before he would have been shocked at the change in his appearance but as it was the nervous whitehaired man who stood shiftily before him told him nothing of an eating secret long carried the mans face was gray and haggard and deep lines were cut under his staring fishlike eyes his hair tumbled in white masses over his pallid forehead and his lips twitched as he talked

youre from paris sir from paris he said come in come in 

his motions were nervous and erratic skaggs followed him into the library and the wife disappeared in another direction

it would have been hard to recognize in the oakley of the present the man of a few years before the strong frame had gone away to bone and nothing of his old power sat on either brow or chin

he was as a man who trembled on the brink of insanity his guilty secret had been too much for him and skaggss own fingers twitched as he saw his hosts hands seek the breast of his jacket every other moment

it is there the secret is hidden he said to himself and whatever it is i must have it but how    how i cant knock the man down and rob him in his own house but oakley himself proceeded to give him his first cue

you    you    perhaps have a message from my brother    my brother who is in paris i have not heard from him for some time

skaggss mind worked quickly he remembered the colonels story evidently the brother had something to do with the secret now or never he thought so he said boldly yes i have a message from your brother 

the man sprang up clutching again at his breast you have you have give it to me after four years he sends me a message give it to me the reporter looked steadily at the man he knew that he was in his power that his very eagerness would prove traitor to his discretion

your brother bade me to say to you that you have a terrible secret that you bear it in your breastâthereâthere i am his messenger he bids you to give it to me 

oakley had shrunken back as if he had been struck

no no he gasped no no i have no secret 

the reporter moved nearer him the old man shrunk against the wall his lips working convulsively and his hand tearing at his breast as skaggs drew nearer he attempted to shriek but his voice was husky and broke off in a gasping whisper

give it to me as your brother commands

no no no it is not his secret it is mine i must carry it here always do you hear i must carry it till i die go away go away

skaggs seized him oakley struggled weakly but he had no strength the reporter s hand sought the secret pocket he felt a paper beneath his fingers oakley gasped hoarsely as he drew it forth then raising his voice gave one agonized cry and sank to the floor frothing at the mouth at the cry rapid footsteps were heard in the hallway and mrs oakley threw open the door

what is the matter she cried

my message has somewhat upset your husband was the cool answer

but his breast is open your hand has been in his bosom you have taken something from him give it to me or i shall call for help

skaggs had not reckoned on this but his wits came to the rescue

you dare not call for help he said or the world will know

she wrung her hands helplessly crying oh give it to me give it to me weve never done you any harm

but youve harmed someone else that is enough

he moved toward the door but she sprang in front of him with the fierceness of a tigress protecting her young she attacked him with teeth and nails she was pallid with fury and it was all he could do to protect himself and yet not injure her finally when her anger had taken her strength he succeeded in getting out he flew down the hallway and out of the front door the womans screams following him he did not pause to read the precious letter until he was safe in his room at the continental hotel then he sprang to his feet crying thank godl thank god i was right and the universe shall have a sensation the brother is the thief and berry hamilton is an innocent man hurrah now who is it that has come on a wildgoose chase who is it that ought to handle his idea carefully heigho saunders my man the drinksll be on you and old skaggsy will have done some good in the world 

mr skaggs had no qualms of conscience about the manner in which he had come by the damaging evidence against maurice oakley it was enough for him that he had it a corporation he argued had no soul and therefore no conscience how much less then should so small a part of a great corporation as himself be expected to have them

he had his story it was vivid interesting dramatic it meant the favor of his editor a big thing for the universe and a fatter lining for his own pocket he sat down to put his discovery on paper before he attempted anything else although the impulse to celebrate was very strong within him

he told his story well with an eye to every one of its salient points he sent an alleged picture of berry hamilton as he had appeared at the time of his arrest he sent a picture of the oakley home and of the cottage where the servant and his family had been so happy there was a strong pen picture of the man oakley grown haggard and morose from carrying his guilty secret of his confusion when confronted with the supposed knowledge of it the old southern city was described and the opinions of its residents in regard to the case given it was thereâclear interesting and strong one could see it all as if every phase of it were being enacted before ones eyes skaggs surpassed himself

when the editor first got hold of it he said huh over the opening linesâa few short sentences that instantly pricked the attention awake he read on with increasing interest this is good stuff he said at the last page heres a chance for the universe to look into the methods of southern court proceedings heres a chance for a spread

the universe had always claimed to be the friend of all poor and oppressed humanity and every once in a while it did something to substantiate its claim whereupon it stood off and said to the public look you what we have done and behold how great we are the friend of the people the universe was yellow it was very so but it had power and keenness and energy it never lost an opportunity to crow and if one was not forthcoming it made one in this way it managed to do a considerable amount of good and its yellowness became forgivable even commendable in skaggss story the editor saw an opportunity for one of its periodical philanthropies he seized upon it with headlines that took half a page and with cuts authentic and otherwise the tale was told and the people of new york were greeted next morning with the announcement a burning shame

a poor and innocent negro made to suffer for a rich mans crime

great expose by the universe

a universe reporter to the rescue

the whole thing to be aired that the people may know

then skaggs received a telegram that made him leap for joy he was to do it he was to go to the capital of the state he was to beard the governor in his den and he with the force of a great paper behind him was to demand for the people the release of an innocent man then there would be another writeup and much glory for him and more shekels in an hour after he had received his telegram he was on his way to the southern capital

meanwhile in the house of maurice oakley there were sad times from the moment that the master of the house had fallen to the floor in impotent fear and madness there had been no peace within his doors at first his wife had tried to control him alone and had humored the wild babblings with which he woke from his swoon but these changed to shrieks and cries and curses and she was forced to throw open the doors so long closed and call in help the neighbors and her old friends went to her assistance and what the reporters story had not done the ravings of the man accomplished for with a show of matchless cunning he continually clutched at his breast laughed and babbled his secret openly even then they would have smothered it in silence for the honor of one of their best families but too many ears had heard and then came the yellow journal bearing all the news in emblazoned headlines

colonel saunders was distinctly hurt to think that his confidence had been imposed on and that he had been instrumental in bringing shame upon a southern name

to think suh he said generally to the usual assembly of choice spirits to think of that mans being a reporter suh a common ordinary reporter and that i sat and talked to him as if he were a gentleman

youre not to be blamed colonel said old horace talbot youve done no more than any other gentleman would have done the trouble is that the average northerner has no sense of honor suh no sense of honor if this particular man had had he would have kept still and everything would have gone on smooth and quiet instead of that a distinguished family is brought to shame and for what to give a nigger a few more years of freedom when likely as not he dont want it and berry hamiltons life in prison has proved nearer the ideal reached by slavery than anything he has found since emancipation why suhs i fancy i see him leaving his prison with tears of regret in his eyes

old horace was inanely eloquent for an hour over his pet theory but there were some in the town who thought differently about the matter and it was their opinions and murmurings that backed up skaggs and made it easier for him when at the capital he came into contact with the official red tape

he was told that there were certain forms of procedure and certain times for certain things but he hammered persistently away the murmurings behind him grew louder while from his sanctum the editor of the universe thundered away against oppression and highhanded tyranny other papers took it up and asked why this man should be despoiled of his liberty any longer and when it was replied that the man had been convicted and that the wheels of justice could not be stopped or turned back by the letter of a romantic artist or the ravings of a madman there was a mighty outcry against the farce of justice that had been played out in this mans case

the trial was reviewed the evidence again brought up and examined the dignity of the state was threatened at this time the state did the one thing necessary to save its tottering reputation it would not surrender but it capitulated and berry hamilton was pardoned

berry heard the news with surprise and a halfbitter joy he had long ago lost hope that justice would ever be done to him he marveled at the word that was brought to him now and he could not understand the strange cordiality of the young white man who met him at the wardens office five years of prison life had made a different man of him he no longer looked to receive kindness from his fellows and he blinked at it as he blinked at the unwonted brightness of the sun the lines about his mouth where the smiles used to gather had changed and grown stem with the hopelessness of years his lips drooped pathetically and hard treatment had given his eyes a lowering look his hair that had hardly shown a white streak was as white as maurice oakleys own his erstwhile quick wits were dulled and imbruted he had lived like an ox working without inspiration or reward and he came forth like an ox from his stall all the higher part of him he had left behind dropping it off day after day through the wearisome years he had put behind him the berry hamilton that laughed and joked and sang and believed for even his faith had become only a numbed fancy

this is a very happy occasion mr hamilton said skaggs shaking his hand heartily

berry did not answer what had this slim glib young man to do with him what had any white man to do with him after what he had suffered at their hands

you know you are to go to new york with me

to new yawk what fu

skaggs did not tell him that now that the universe had done its work it demanded the right to crow to its hearts satisfaction he said only you want to see your wife of course

berry had forgotten fannie and for the first time his heart thrilled within him at the thought of seeing her again

i aint hyeahed fom my people fu a long time i didnt know what had become of em hows kit an joe

theyre all right was the reply skaggs couldnt tell him in this the first hour of his freedom let him have time to drink the sweetness of that all in there would be time afterward to taste all of the bitterness

once in new york he found that people wished to see him some fools some philanthropists and a great many reporters he had to be photographedâall this before he could seek those whom he longed to see they printed his picture as he was before he went to prison and as he was now a sort of beforeandaftertaking comment and in the morning that it all appeared when the universe spread itself to tell the public what it had done and how it had done it they gave him his wifes address

it would be better they thought for her to tell him herself all that happened no one of them was brave enough to stand to look in his eyes when he asked for his son and daughter and they shifted their responsibility by pretending to themselves that they were doing it for his own good that the blow would fall more gently upon him coming from her who had been his wife berry took the address and inquired his way timidly hesitatingly but with a swelling heart to the door of the flat where fannie lived

had not berrys years of prison life made him forget what little he knew of reading he might have read the name gibson on the doorplate where they told him to ring for his wife but he knew nothing of what awaited him as he confidently pulled the bell fannie herself came to the door the news the papers held had not escaped her but she had suffered in silence hoping that berry might be spared the pain of finding her now he stood before her and she knew him at a glance in spite of his haggard countenance

fannie he said holding out his arms to her and all of the pain and pathos of long yearning was in his voice dont you know me

she shrank away from him back in the hallway

yes yes bey i knows you come in

she led him through the passageway and into her room he following with a sudden sinking at his heart this was not the reception he had expected from fannie

when they were within the room he turned and held out his arms to her again but she did not notice them why is you shamed o me he asked brokenly

 shamed no oh bey and she sank into a chair and began rocking to and fro in her helpless grief

whats de mattah fannie aint you glad to see me

yes yes but you dont know nothin do you dey lef me to tell you

lef you to tell me whats de mattah is joe or kit daid tell me

no not daid kit dances on de stage fu a livin an bey she aint de gal she ust to be joe    joe    joe    hes in pententiary fu killin a ooman

berry started forward with a cry my gawd my gawd my little gal my boyl

dat aint all she went on dully as if reciting a rote lesson i aint yo wife no mo is maied agin oh bey bey dont look at me lak dat i couldnt hep it kit an joe lef me an dey said de pententiary divoced you an me an dat youd nevah come out nohow dont look at me lak dat bey

oh dont bey dont you hut me i couldnt hep it

he glared at her for a moment and then the real force of the situation came full upon him and he bowed his head in his hands and wept like a child the great sobs came up and stuck in his throat

she crept up to him fearfully and laid her hand on his head

dont cry bey she said i done wrong but i loves you yit 

he seized her in his arms and held her tightly until he could control himself then he asked weakly well what am i goin to do

i do know bey ceptin dat youll have to leave me

i wont ill never leave you again he replied doggedly

but bey you mus youll only mek it hader on me an gibsonu beat me agin 

agin

she hung her head yes

he gripped himself hard

why caint you come on off wid me fannie you was minefus

i couldnt he would fin me anywhaih i went to

let him fin you youll be wid me an well settle it him an me

i want to but oh i cant i cant she wailed

please go now bey befo he gits home hes mad anyhow cause youre out

berry looked at her hard and then said in a dry voice an so i got to go an leave you to him yes you mus im hisn now

he turned to the door murmuring my wife gone kit a nobody an joe little joe a murderer an then i   i   ust to pray to gawd an call him ouah fathah   he laughed hoarsely it sounded like nothing fannie had ever heard before

dont bey dont say dat maybe we dont unerstan

her faith still hung by a slender thread but his had given way in that moment

no we dont unerstan he laughed as he went out of the door we dont unerstan

he staggered down the steps blinded by his emotions and set his face toward the little lodging that he had taken temporarily there seemed nothing left in life for him to do yet he knew that he must work to live although the effort seemed hardly worthwhile he remembered now that the universe had offered him the underjanitorship in its building he would go and take it and someday perhaps    he was not quite sure what the perhaps meant but as his mind grew clearer he came to know for a sullen fierce anger was smoldering in his heart against the man who through lies had stolen his wife from him it was anger that came slowly but gained in fierceness as it grew

yes that was it he would kill gibson it was no worse than his present state then it would be father and son murderers they would hang him or send him back to prison neither would be hard now he laughed to himself

and this was what they had let him out of prison for to find out all this why had they not left him there to die in ignorance what had he to do with all these people who gave him sympathy what did he want of their sympathy could they give him back one tithe of what he had lost could they restore to him his wife or his son or his daughter his quiet happiness or his simple faith

he went to work for the universe but night after night armed he patrolled the sidewalk in front of fannies house he did not know gibson but he wanted to see them together then he would strike his vigils kept him from his bed but he went to the next mornings work with no weariness the hope of revenge sustained him and he took a savage joy in the thought that he should be the dispenser of justice to at least one of those who had wounded him

finally he grew impatient and determined to wait no longer but to seek his enemy in his own house he approached the place cautiously and went up the steps his hand touched the bellpull he staggered back

oh my gawd he said

there was crape on fannies bell his head went round and he held to the door for support then he turned the knob and the door opened he went noiselessly in at the door of fannies room he halted sick with fear he knocked a step sounded within and his wifes face looked out upon him he could have screamed aloud with relief

it aint you he whispered huskily

no its him he was killed in a fight at the racetrack some o his ffinds are settin up come in

he went in a wild strange feeling surging at his heart she showed him into the death chamber

as he stood and looked down upon the face of his enemy still cold and terrible in death the recognition of how near he had come to crime swept over him and all his dead faith sprang into new life in a glorious resurrection he stood with clasped hands and no word passed his lips but his heart was crying thank god thank god this mans blood is not on my hands

the gamblers who were sitting up with the dead wondered who the old fool was who looked at their silent comrade and then raised his eyes as if in prayer

when gibson was laid away there were no formalities between berry and his wife they simply went back to each other new york held nothing for them now but sad memories kit was on the road and the father could not bear to see his son so they turned their faces southward back to the only place they could call home surely the people could not be cruel to them now and even if they were they felt that after what they had endured no wound had power to give them pain

leslie oakley heard of their coming and with her own hands reopened and refurnished the little cottage in the yard for them there the whitehaired woman begged them to spend the rest of their days and be in peace and comfort it was the only amend she could make as much to satisfy her as to settle themselves they took the cottage and many a night thereafter they sat together with clasped hands listening to the shrieks of the madman across the yard and thinking of what he had brought to them and to himself

it was not a happy life but it was all that was left to them and they took it up without complaint for they knew they were powerless against some will infinitely stronger than their own
