why stands she near the auction stand that girl so young and fair

what brings her to this dismal place why stands she weeping there

with the growing population of slaves in the southern states of america there is a fearful increase of half whites most of whose fathers are slaveowners and their mothers slaves society does not frown upon the man who sits with his mulatto child upon his knee whilst its mother stands a slave behind his chair the late henry clay some years since predicted that the abolition of negro slavery would be brought about by the amalgamation of the races john randolph a distinguished slaveholder of virginia and a prominent statesman said in a speech in the legislature of his native state that the blood of the first american statesmen coursed through the veins of the slave of the south in all the cities and towns of the slave states the real negro or clear black docs not amount to more than one in every four of the slave population this fact is of itself the best evidence of the degraded and immoral condition of the relation of master and slave in the united states of america

in all the slave states the law says âslaves shall be deemed sold taken reputed and adjudged in law to be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors and their executors administrators and assigns to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever a slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs the master may sell him dispose of his person his industry and his labour he can do nothing possess nothing nor acquire anything but what must belong to his master the slave is entirely subject to the will of his master who may correct and chastise him though not with unusual rigour or so as to maim and mutilate him or expose him to the danger of loss of life or to cause his death the slave to remain a slave must he sensible that there is no appeal from his master where the slave is placed by law entirely under the control of the man who claims him body and soul as property what else could be expected than the most depraved social condition  the marriage relation the oldest and most sacred institution given to man by his creator is unknown and unrecognised in the slave laws of the united states would that we could say that the moral and religious teaching in the slave states were better than the laws but alas we cannot a few years since some slaveholders became a little uneasy in their minds about the rightfulness of permitting slaves to take to themselves husbands and wives while they still had others living and applied to their religious teachers for advice and the following will show how this grave and important subject was treated â  is a servant whose husband or wife has been sold by his or her master into a distant country to be permitted to marry again

the query was referred to a committee who made the following report which after discussion was adopted â  that in view of the circumstances in which servants in this country are placed the committee are unanimous in the opinion that it is better to permit servants thus circumstanced to take another husband or wife

such was the answer from a committee of the  shiloh baptist association  and instead of receiving light those who asked the question were plunged into deeper darkness

a similar question was put to the savannah river association and the answer as the following will show did not materially differ from the one we have already given â  whether in a case of involuntary separation of such a character as to preclude all prospect of future intercourse the parties ought to be allowed to marry again

answer â  that such separation among persons situated as our slaves are is civilly a separation by death and they believe that in the sight of god it would be so viewed to forbid second marriages in such cases would be to expose the parties not only to stronger hardships and strong temptation but to church censure for acting in obedience to their masters who cannot be expected to acquiesce in a regulation at variance with justice to the slaves and to the spirit of that command which regulates marriage among christians the slaves are not free agents and a dissolution by death is not more entirely without their consent and beyond their control than by such separation

although marriage as the above indicates is a matter which the slaveholders do not think is of any importance or of any binding force with their slaves yet it would be doing that degraded class an injustice not to acknowledge that many of them do regard it as a sacred obligation and show a willingness to obey the commands of god on this subject marriage is indeed the first and most important institution of human existence â the foundation of all civilisation and cultureâthe root of church and state it is the most intimate covenant of heart formed among mankind and for many persons the only relation in which they feel the true sentiments of humanity it gives scope for every human virtue since each of these is developed from the love and confidence which here predominate it unites all which ennobles and beautifies lifeâ sympathy kindness of will and deed gratitude devotion and every delicate intimate feeling as the only asylum for true education it is the first and last sanctuary of human culture as husband and wife through each other become conscious of complete humanity and every human feeling and every human virtue so children at their first awakening in the fond covenant of love between parents both of whom are tenderly concerned for the same object find an image of complete humanity leagued in free love the spirit of love which prevails between them acts with creative power upon the young mind and awakens every germ of goodness within it this invisible and incalculable influence of parental life acts more upon the child than all the efforts of education whether by means of instruction precept or exhortation if this be a true picture of the vast influence for good of the institution of marriage what must be the moral degradation of that people to whom marriage is denied not content with depriving them of all the higher and holier enjoyments of this relation by degrading and darkening their souls the slaveholder denies to his victim even that slight alleviation of his misery which would result from the marriage relation being protected by law and public opinion such is the influence of slavery in the united states that the ministers of religion even in the socalled free states are the mere echoes instead of the correctors of public sentiment

we have thought it advisable to show that the present system of chattel slavery in america undermines the entire social condition of man so as to prepare the reader for the following narrative of slave life in that otherwise happy and prosperous country

in all the large towns in the southern states there is a class of slaves who are permitted to hire their time of their owners and for which they pay a high price these are mulatto women or quadroons as they are familiarly known and are distinguished for their fascinating beauty the handsomest usually pays the highest price for her time many of these women are the favourites of persons who furnish them with the means of paying their owners and not a few are dressed in the most extravagant manner header when you take into consideration the fact that amongst the slave population no safeguard is thrown around virtue and no inducement held out to slave women to be chaste you will not be surprised when we tell you that immorality and vice pervade the cities of the southern states in a manner unknown in the cities and towns of the northern states indeed most of the slave women have no higher aspiration than that of becoming the finelydressed mistress of some white man and at negro balls and parties this class of women usually cut the greatest figure

at the close of the yearthe following advertisement appeared in a newspaper published in richmond the capital of the state of virginia â notice thirtyeight negroes will be offered for sale on monday november oth at twelve oclock being the entire stock of the late john graves esq the negroes are in good condition some of them very prime among them are several mechanics ablebodied field hands ploughboys and women with children at the breast and some of them very prolific in their generating qualities affording a rare opportunity to any one who wishes to raise a strong and healthy lot of servants for their own use also several mulatto girls of rare personal qualities  two of them very superior any gentleman or lady wishing to purchase can take any of the above slaves on trial for a week for which no charge will be made amongst the above slaves to be sold were currer and her two daughters clotel and althosa the latter were the girls spoken of in the advertisement as  very superior currer was a bright mulatto and of prepossessing appearance though then nearly forty years of age she had hired her time for more than twenty years during which time she bad lived in richmond in her younger days currer had been the housekeeper of a young slaveholder but of later years had been a laundress or washerwoman and was considered to be a woman of great taste in getting up linen the gentleman for whom she had kept house was thomas jefferson by whom she had two daughters  jefferson being called to washington to fill a government appointment currer was left behind and thus she took herself to the business of washing by which means she paid her master mr graves and supported herself and two children at the time of the decease of her master currers daughters clotel and althcsa were aged respectively sixteen and fourteen years and both like most of their own sex in america were well grown currer early resolved to bring her daughters up as ladies as she termed it and therefore imposed little or no work upon them as herdaughters grew older currer had to pay a stipulated price for them yet her notoriety as a laundress of the first class enabled her to put an extra priccupon her charges and thus she and her daughters lived in comparative luxury to bring up clotel and althesa to attract attention and especially at balls and parties was the great aim of currer although the term negro ball is applied to most of these gatherings yet a majority of the attendants are often whites nearly all the negro parties in the cities and towns of the southern states are made up of quadroon and mulatto girls and white men these are democratic gatherings where gentlemen shopkeepers and their clerks all appear upon terms of perfect equality and there is a degree of gentility and decorum in these companies that is not surpassed by similar gatherings of white people in the slave states it was at one of these parties that horatio green the son of a wealthy gentleman of richmond was first introduced to clotel the young man had just returned from college and was in his twentysecond year clotel was sixteen and was admitted by all to be the most beautiful girl coloured or white in the city so attentive was the young man to the quadroon during the evening that it was noticed by all and became a matter of general conversation while currer appeared delighted beyond measure at her daughters conquest from that evening young green became the favourite visitor at currers house he soon promised to purchase clotel as speedily as it could be effected and make her mistress of her own dwelling and currer looked forward with pride to the time when she should see her daughter emancipated and free it was a beautiful moonlight night in august when all who reside in tropical climes are eagerly gasping for a breath of fresh air that horatio green was seated in the small garden behind currers cottage with the object of his affections by his side and it was here that horatio drew from his pocket the newspaper wet from the press and read the advertisement for the sale of the slaves to which we have alluded currer and her two daughters being of the number at the close of the evenings visit and as the young man was leaving he said to the girl  you shall soon be free and your own mistress as might have been expected the day of sale brought an unusual large number together to compete for the property to be sold farmers who make a business of raising slaves for the market were there slavetraders and speculators were also numerously represented and in the midst of this throng was one who felt a deeper interest in the result of the sale than any other of the bystanders this was young green true to his promise he was there with a blank bank check in his pocket awaiting with impatience to enter the list as a bidder for the beautiful slave the less valuable slaves were first placed upon the auction block one after another and sold to the highest bidder husbands and wives were separated with a degree of indifference that is unknown in any other relation of life except that of slavery brothers and sisters were torn from each other and mothers saw their children leave them for the last time on this earth

it was late in the day when the greatest number of persons were thought to be present that currer and her daughters were brought forward to the place of sale currer was first ordered to ascend the auction stand which she did with a trembling step the slave mother was sold to a trader althesa the youngest and who was scarcely less beautiful than her sister was sold to the same trader for one thousand dollars clotel was the last and as was expected commanded a higher price than any that had been offered for sale that day the appearance of clotel on the auction block created a deep sensation amongst the crowd there she stood with a complexion as white as most of those who were waiting with a wish to become her purchasers her features as finely defined as any of her sex of pure anglosaxon  her long black wavy hair done up in the neatest manner  her form tall and graceful and her whole appearance indicating one superior to her position the auctioneer commenced by saying that  miss clotel had been reserved for the last because she was the most valuable how much gentlemen  real albino fit for a fancy girl for any one she enjoys good health and has a sweet temper now much do you say   five hundred dollars

only five hundred for such a girl as this  gentlemen she is worth a deal more than that sum you certainly dont know the value of the article you are bidding upon here gentlemen i hold in my hand a paper certifying that she has a good moral character  seven hundred  ah gentlemen that is something like this paper also states that she is very intelligent eight hundred she is a devoted christian and perfectly trustworthy nine hundred nine fifty ten eleven twelve hundred here the sale came to a dead stand the auctioneer stopped looked around and began in a rough manner to relate some anecdotes relative to the sale of slaves which he said had come under his own observation at this juncture the scene was indeed strange laughing joking swearing smoking spitting and talking kept up a continual hum and noise amongst the crowd while the slavegirl stood with tears in her eyes at one time looking towards her mother and sister and at another towards the young man whom she hoped would become her purchaser  the chastity of this girl is pure she has never been from under her mothers care she is a virtuous creature thirteen fourteen fifteen fifteen hundred dollars cried the auctioneer and the maiden was struck for that sum this was a southern auction at which the bones muscles sinews blood and nerves of a young lady of sixteen were sold for five hundred dollars her moral character for two hundred  her improved intellect for one hundred her christianity for three hundred and her chastity and virtue for four hundred dollars more and this too in a city thronged with churches whose tall spires look like so many signals pointing to heaven and whose ministers preach that slavery is a godordained institution 

what words can tell the inhumanity the atrocity and the immorality of that doctrine which from exalted office commends such a crime to the favour of enlightened and christian people  what indignation from all the would is not due to the government and people who put forth all their strength and power to keep in existence such an institution  nature abhors it the age repels it and christianity needs all her meekness to forgive it

clotel was sold for fifteen hundred dollars but her purchaser was horatio green thus closed a negro sale at which two daughters of thomas jefferson the writer of the declaration of american independence and one of the presidents of the great republic were disposed of to the highest bidder

 o god my every heartstring cries dost thou these scenes behold in this our boasted christian land and must the truth be told

blush christian blush  for een the dark untutored heathen see thy inconsistency and lo

they scorn thy god and thee

going to the south

my country shall thy honoured dame be as a byeword through the world 

rouse  for as if to blast thy fame this keen reproach is at thee hurled the banner that above thee waves is floating oer three million slaves

dick walker the slave speculator who had purchasd currer and althesa put them in prison until his gang was made up and then with hisforty slaves started for the new orleans market as many of the slaves had been brought up in richmond and had relations residing there the slave trader determined to leave the city early in the morning so as not to witness any of those scenes so common where slaves are separated from their relatives and friends when about departing for the southern market this plan was successful for not even clotel who had been every day at the prison to see her mother and sister knew of their departure a march of eight days through the interior of the state and they arrived on the banks of the ohio river where they were all put on board a steamer and then speedily sailed for the place of their destination

walker had already advertised in the new orleans papers that he would be there at a stated time with a prime lot of ablebodied slaves ready for field service together with a few extra ones between the ages of fifteen and twentyfive but like most who make a business of buying and selling slaves for gain he often bought some who were far advanced in years and would always try to sell them for five or ten years younger than they actually were few persons can arrive at anything like the age of a negro by mere observation unless they are well acquainted with the race therefore the slavetrader very frequently carried out this deception with perfect impunity after the steamer had left the wharf and was fairly on the bosom of the father of waters walker called his servant pompey to him and instructed him as to  getting the negroes ready for market amongst the forty negroes were several whose appearance indicated that they had seen some years and had gone through some services their grey hair and whiskers at once pronounced them to be above the ages set down in the traders advertisement pompey had long been with the trader and knew his business and if he did not take delight in discharging his duty he did it with a degree of alacrity so that he might receive the approbation of hi master  pomp as walker usually called him was of real negro blood and would often say when alluding to himself  dis nigger is no countefit he is de genewine artekil pompey was of low stature round face and like most of his race had a set of teeth which for whiteness and beauty could not be surpassed his eyes large lips thick and hair short and woolly pompey had been with walker so long and had seen bo much of the buying and selling of slaves that he appeared perfectly indifferent to the heartrending scenes which daily occurred in his presence it was on the second day of the steamers voyage that pompey selected five of the old slaves took them into a room by themselves and commenced preparing them for the market  well said pompey addressing himself to the company  i is de gentman dat is to get you ready so dat you will bring marser a good price in de orleans market how old is you   addressing himself to a man who from appearance was not less than forty  if i live to see next cornplanting time i will either be fortyfive or fiftyfive i dont know which  dat may be replied pompey  but now you is only thirty years old dat is what marser says you is to be  i know i is more den dat responded the man  i knows nothing about dat said pompey  but when you get in de market an anybody axe you how old you is an you tell em fortyfive marser will tie you up an gib you de whip like smoke but if you tell em dat you is only thirty den he wont  well den i guess i will only be thirty when dey axe me replied the chattel

 what your name inquired pompey geemes answered the man  oh uncle jim is it yes  den you must have off dem dare whiskers of yours an when you get to orleans you must grease dat face an make it look shiney this was all said by pompey in a manner which clearly showed that he knew what he was about how old is you asked pompey of a tall stronglooking man  i was twentynine last potatodigging time said the man whats your name my name is tobias but dey call me toby  well toby or mr tobias if dat will suit you better you is now twentythree years old an no more dus you hear dat   yes responded toby pompey gave each to understand how old he was to be when asked by persons who wished to purchase and then reported to his master that the old boys were all right at eight oclock on the evening of the third day the lights of another steamer were seen in the distance and apparently coming up very fust this was a signal for a general commotion on the patriot and everything indicated that a steamboat race was at hand nothing can exceed the excitement attendant upon a steamboat on the mississippi river by the time the boats had reached memphis they were side by side and each exerting itself to keep the ascendancy in point of speed the night was clear the moon shining brightly and the boats so near to each other that the passengers were calling out from one boat to the other on board the patriot the firemen were using oil lard butter and even bacon with the wood for the purpose of raising the steam to its highest pitch the blaze mingled with the black smoke showed plainly that the other boat was burning more than wood the two boats soon locked so that the hands of the boats were passing from vessel to vessel and the wildest excitement prevailed throughout amongst both passengers and crew at this moment the engineer of the patriot was seen to fasten down the safetyvalve so that no steam should escape this was indeed a dangerous resort a few of the boat hands who saw what had taken place left that end of the boat for more secure quarters

the patriot stopped to take in passengers and still no steam was permitted to escape at the starting of the boat cold water was forced into the boilers by the machinery and as might have been expected one of the boilers immediately exploded one dense fog of steam filled every part of the vessel while shrieks groans and cries were heard on every hand the saloons and cabins soon had the appearance of a hospital by this time the boat had landed and the columbia the other boat had come alongside to render assistance to the disabled steamer the killed and scalded nineteen in number were put on shore and the patriot taken in tow by the columbia was soon again on its way

it was now twelve oclock at night and instead of the passengers being asleep the majority were gambling in the saloons thousands of dollars change hand during a passage from louisville or st louis to new orleans on a mississippi steamer and many men and even ladies are compleely ruined  go call my boy steward said mr smith as he took his cards one by one from the table in a few moments a fine looking brighteyed mulatto boy apparently about fifteen years of age was standing by his masters side at the table i will see you and five hundred dollars better said smith as his servant jerry approached the table  what price do you set on that boy   asked johnson as he took a roll of bills from his pocket he will bring a thousand dollars any day in the new orleans market replied smith then you bet the whole of the boy do you yes i call you then said johnson at the same time spreading his cards out upon the table you have beat me said smith as soon as he saw the cards jerry who was standing on top of the table with the bank notes and silver dollars round his feet was now ordered to descend from the table  you will notforget that you belong to me said johnson as the young slave was stepping from the table to a chair no sir replied the chattel now go back to your bed and be up in time tomorrow morning to brush my clothes and clean ray boots do you hear

 yes sir responded jerry as he wiped the tears from bis eyes

smith took from his pocket the bill of sale and handed it to johnson  at the same time saying  i claim the right of redeeming that boy mr johnson my father gave him to me when i came of age and i promised not to part with him  most certainly sir the boy shall be yours whenever you hand me over a cool thousand replied johnson the next morning as the passengers were assembling in the breakfast saloons and upon the guards of the vessel and the servants were seen running about waiting upon or looking for their masters poor jerry was entering his new masters stateroom with his boots who do you belong to  said a gentleman to an old black man who came along leading a fine dog that he had been feeding  when i went to sleep last night i belonged to governor lucas but i understand dat he is bin gambling all night so i dont know who owns me dis morning such is the uncertainty of a slaves position he goes to bed at night the property of the man with whom he has lived for years and gets up in the morning the slave of some one whom he has never seen before  to behold five or six tables in a steamboats cabin with halfadozen men playing at cards and money pistols bowieknives c all in confusion on the tables is what may be seen at almost any time on the mississippi river

on the fourth day while at kalchez taking in freight and passengers walker who had been on shore to see some of his old customers returned accompanied by a tall thinfaced man dressed in black with a white neckcloth which immediately proclaimed him to be a clergyman  i want a good trusty woman for house service said the stranger as they entered the cabin where walkers slaves were kept  here she is and no mistake replied the trader stand up currer my gal heres a gentleman who wishes to see if you will suit him althesa clung to her mothers side as the latter rose from her seat  she is a rare cook a good washer and will suit you to a t i am sure  if you buy me i hope you will buy my daughter too said the woman in rather an excited manner  i only want one for my own use and would not need another said the man in black as he and the trader left the room walker and the parson went into the saloon talked over the matter the bill of sale was made out the money paid over and the clergyman left with the understanding that the woman should be delivered to him at his house it seemed as if poor althesa would have wept herself to death for the first two days after her mother had been torn from her side by the hand of the ruthless trafficker in human flesh on the arrival of the boat at baton rouge an additional number of passengers were taken on board and amongst them several persons who had been attending the races gambling and drinking were now the order of the day just as the ladies and gentlemen were assembling at the suppertable the report of a pistol was heard in the direction of the social hall which caused great uneasiness to the ladies and took the gentlemen to that part of the cabin however nothing serious had occurred a man at one of the tables where they were gambling had been seen attempting to conceal a card in his sleeve and one of the party seized his pistol and fired but fortunately the barrel of the pistol was knocked up just as it was about to be discharged and the ball passed through the upper deck instead of the mans head as intended order was soon restored all went on well the remainder of the night and the next day at ten oclock the boat arrived at new orleans and the passengers went to the hotels and the slaves to the market

 our eyes are yet on africs shores her thousand wrongs we still deplore we see the grim slave trader there we hear his fettered victims prayer and hasten to the sufferers aid forgetful of our own  slave trade  the ocean  pirates  fiendlike form shall sink beneath the vengeancestorm his heart of steel shall quake before the battledin and havoc roar the knave shall die the law hath said while it protects our own slave trade  what earthly eye presumes to scan the wily proteusheart of roan  â what potent hand will eer unroll the mantled treachery of his soul â o where is he who hath surveyed the horrors of our own slave trade

there is an eye that wakes in light there is a hand of peerless might which soon or late shall yet assail and rend dissimulations veil which will unfold the masquerade which justifies our own slave trade

we shall now return to natchez where we left currer in the hands of the methodist parson for many years natchez has enjoyed a notoriety for the inhumanity and barbarity of its inhabitants and the cruel deeds perpetrated there which have not been equalled in any other city in the southern states the following advertisements which we take from a newspaper published in the vicinity will show how they catch their negroes who believe in the doctrine that all men are created free

these dogs will attack a negro at their masters bidding and cling to him as the bulldog will cling to a beast many are the speculations as to whether the negro will be secured alive or dead when these dogs once get on his track a slave hunt took place near natchez a few days after currers arrival which was calculated to give her no favourable opinion of the people two slaves had run off owing to severe punishment the dogs were put upon their trail the slaves went into the swamps with the hope that the dogs when put on their scent would be unable to follow them through the water the dogs soon took to the swamp which lies between the highlands which was now covered with water waist deep here these faithful animals swimming nearly all the time followed the zigzag course the tortuous twistings and windings of these two fugitives who it was afterwards discovered were lost sometimes scenting the tree wherein they had found a temporary refuge from the mud and water at other places where the deep mud had palled off a shoe and they had not taken time to put it on again for two hours and a half for four or five miles did men and dogs wade through this bushy dismal swamp surrounded with grimvisaged alligators who seemed to look on with jealous eye at this encroachment of their hereditary domain  now losing the trailâthen slowly and dubiously taking it off again until they triumphantly threaded it out bringing them back to the river where it was found that the negroes had crossed their own trail near the place of starting in the meantime a heavy shower had taken place putting out the trail the negroes were now at least four miles ahead

it is well known to hunters that it requires the keenest scent and best blood to overcome such obstacles and yet these persevering and sagacious animals conquered every difficulty the slaves now made a straight course for the raton rouge and bayou sara road about four miles distant

feeling hungry now after their morning walk and perhaps thirsty too they went about half a mile off the road and ate a good hearty substantial breakfast negroes must eat as well as other people but the dogs will tell on them here for a moment the dogs are at fault but soon unravel the mystery and bring them back to the road again and now what before was wonderful becomes almost a miracle here in this common highwayâthe thoroughfare for the whole country around â through mud and through mire meeting waggons and teams and different solitary wayfarers and what above all is most astonishing actually running through a gang of negroes their favourite game who were working on the road they pursue the track of the two negroes they even ran for eight miles to the very edge of the plain â the slaves near them for the last mile at first they would fain believe it some hunter chasing deer nearer and nearer the whimpering pack presses on the delusion begins to dispel all at once the truth flashes upon them like a glare of light their hair stands on end  tis tabor with his dogs the scent becomes warmer and warmer what was an irregular cry now deepens into one ceaseless roar as the relentless pack rolls on after its human prey it puts one in mind of actaeon and his dogs they grow desperate and leave the road in the vain hope of shaking them off vain hope indeed  the momentary cessation only adds new zest to the chase the cry grows louder and louder the yelp grows short and quick sure indication that the game is at hand it is a perfect rush upon the part of the hunters while the negroes call upon their weary and jaded limbs to do their best but they falter and stagger beneath them the breath of the hounds is almost upon their very heels and yet they have a vain hope of escaping these sagacious animals they can run no longer the dogs are upon them they hastily attempt to climb a tree and as the last one is nearly out of reach the catchdog seizes him by the leg and brings him to the ground he sings out lustily and the dogs are called off after this man was secured the one in the tree was ordered to come down this however he refused to do but a gun being pointed at him soon caused him to change his mind on reaching the ground the fugitive made one more bound and the chase again commenced but it was of no use to run and he soon yielded while being tied he committed an unpardonable offence  he resisted and for that he must be made an example on their arrival home a mob was collected together and a lynch court was held to determine what was best to be done with the negro who had had the impudence to raise his hand against a white man the lynch court decided that the negro should be burnt at the stake a natchez newspaper the free trader giving an account of it says the body was taken and chained to a tree immediately on the banks of the mississippi on what is called union point faggots were then collected and piled around him to which he appeared quite indifferent when the work was completed he was asked what he had to say he then warned all to take example by him and asked the prayers of all around he then called for a drink of water which was handed to him he drank it and said now set fireâi am ready to go in peace the torches were lighted and placed in the pile which soon ignited he watched unmoved the curling flame that grew until it began to entwine itself around and feed upon his body then he sent forth cries of agony painful to the ear begging some one to blow his brains out at the same time surging with almost superhuman strength until the staple with which the chain was fastened to the tree not being well secured drew out and he leaped from the burning pile at that moment the sharp ringing of several rifles was heard the body of the negro fell a corpse on the ground he was picked up by some two or three and again thrown into the fire and consumed not a vestige remaining to show that such a being ever existed

nearly oo slaves were collected from the plantations in the neighbourhood to witness this scene numerous speeches were made by the magistrates and ministers of religion to the large concourse of slaves warning them and telling them that the same fate awaited them if they should prove rebellious to their owners there are hundreds of negroes who run away and live in the woods some take refuge in the swamps because they are less frequented by human beings a natchez newspaper gave the following account of the hidingplace of a slave who had been captured â  a runaways den was discovered on sunday near the washington spring in a little patch of woods where it had been for several months so artfully concealed under ground that it was detected only by accident though in sight of two or three houses and near the road and fields where there has been constant daily passing the entrance was concealed by a pile of pine straw representing a bogbed which being removed discovered a trapdoor and steps that led to a room about six feet square comfortably ceiled with plank containing a small fire place the flue of which was ingeniously conducted above ground and concealed by the straw the inmates took the alarm and made their escape but mr adams and his excellent dogs being put upon the trail soon run down and secured one of them which proved to be a negrofellow who had been out about a year he stated that the other occupant was a woman who had been a runaway a still longer time in the den was found a quantity of meal bacon corn potatoes c and various cooking utensils and wearing apparelâ vicksburgh sentinel dec cth 

currer was one of those who witnessed the execution of the slave at the stake and it gave her no very exalted opinion of the people of the cotton growing district

the quadroons home

 how sweetly on the hillside sleeps the sunlight with its quickening rays

the verdant trees that crown the steeps grow greener in its quivering blaze

about three miles from richmond is a pleasant plain with here and there a beautiful cottage surrounded by trees so as scarcely to be seen among them was one far retired from the public roads and almost hidden among the trees it was a perfect model of rural beauty the piazzas that surrounded it were covered with clematis and passion flower the pride of china mixed its oriental looking foliage with the majestic magnolia and the air was redolent with the fragrance of flowers peeping out of every nook and nodding upon you with a most unexpected welcome the tasteful hand of art had not learned to imitate the lavish beauty and harmonious disorder of nature but they lived together in loving amity and spoke in accordant tones the gateway rose in a gothic arch with graceful tracery in iron work surmounted by a cross round which fluttered and played the mountain fringe that lightest and most fragile of vines this cottage was hired by horatio green for clotel and the quadroon girl soon found herself in her new home

the tenderness of clotels conscience together with the care her mother had with her and the high value she placed upon virtue required an outward marriage though she well knew that a union with her proscribed race was unrecognised by law and therefore the ceremony would give her no legal hold on horatios constancy but her high poetic nature regarded reality rather than the semblance of things and when he playfully asked how she could keep him if he wished to run away she replied if the mutual love we have for each other and the dictates of your own conscience do not cause you to remain my husband and your affections fall from me i would not if i could hold you by a single fetter it was indeed a marriage sanctioned by heaven although unrecognised on earth there the young couple lived secluded from the world and passed their time as happily as circumstances would permit it was clouds wish that horatio should purchase her mother and sister but the young man pleaded that he was unable owing to the fact that he had not come into possession of his share of property yet he promised that when he did he would seek them out and purchase them their firstborn was named mary and her complexion was still lighter than her mother indeed she was not darker than other white children as the child grew older it more and more resembled its mother the iris of her large dark eye had the melting mezzotinto which remains the last vestige of african ancestry and gives that plaintive expression so often observed and so appropriate to that docile and injured race clotel was still happier after the birth of her dear child for horatio as might have been expected was often absent day and night with his friends in the city and the edicts of society had built up a wall of separation between the quadroon and them happy as clotel was in horatios love and surrounded by an outward environment of beauty so well adapted to her poetic spirit she felt these incidents with inexpressible pain for herself she cared but little for she had found a sheltered home in horatios heart which the world might ridicule but had no power to profane but when she looked at her beloved mary and reflected upon the unavoidable and dangerous position which the tyranny of society had awarded her her soul was filled with anguish the rare loveliness of the child increased daily and was evidently ripening into most marvellous beauty the father seemed to rejoice in it with unmingled pride but in the deep tenderness of the mothers eye there was an indwelling sadness that spoke of anxious thoughts and fearful foreboding clotel now urged horatio to remove to france or england where both her and her child would be free and where colour was not a crime this request excited but little opposition and was so attractive to his imagination that he might have overcome all intervening obstacles had not a change come over the spirit of his dreams he still loved clotel but he was now becoming engaged in political and other affairs which kept him oftener and longer from the young mother and ambition to become a statesman was slowly gaining the ascendancy over him

among those on whom horatios political success most depended was a very popular and wealthy man who had an only daughter his visits to the house were at first purely of a political nature but the young lady was pleasing and he fancied he discovered in her a sort of timid preference for himself this excited his vanity and awakened thoughts of the great worldly advantages connected with a union reminiscences of his first love kept these vague ideas in check for several months for with it was associated the idea of restraint moreover gertrude though inferior in beauty was yet a pretty contrast to her rival her light hair fell in silken ringlets down her shoulders her blue eyes were gentle though inexpressive and her healthy cheeks were like opening rosebuds he had already become accustomed to the dangerous experiment of resisting his own inward convictions and this new impulse to ambition combined with the strong temptation of variety in love met the ardent young man weakened in moral principle and unfettered by laws of the land the change wrought upon him was soon noticed by clotel

not far from canalstreet in the city of new orleans stands a large two story flat building surrounded by a stone wall twelve feet high the top of which is covered with bits of glass and so constructed as to prevent even the possibility of any ones passing over it without sustaining great injury many of the rooms resemble cells in a prison in a small room near the  office are to be seen any number of iron collars hobbles handcuffs thumbscrews cowhides whips chains gags and yokes a back yard inclosed by a high wall looks something like the playground attached to one of our large new england schools and in which are rows of benches and swings attached to the back premises is a goodsized kitchen where two old negresses are at work stewing boiling and baking and occasionally wiping the sweat from their furrowed and swarthy brows

the slavetrader walker on his arrival in new orleans took up his quarters at this slave pen with his gang of human cattle and the morning after at ten oclock they were exhibited for sale there first of all was the beautiful althesa whose pale countenance and dejected look told how many sad hours she had passed since parting with her mother at natchez there was a poor woman who had been separated from her husband and five children another woman whose looks and manner were expressive of deep anguish sat by her side there too was  uncle geemes with his whiskers off his face shaved clean and the grey hair plucked out and ready to be sold for ten years younger than he was toby was also there with his face shaved and greased ready for inspection the examination commenced and was carried on in a manner calculated to shock the feelings of any one not devoid of the milk of human kindness  what are you wiping your eyes for inquired a fat redfaced man with a white hat set on one side of his head and a cigar in his mouth of a woman who sat on one of the stools i spose i have been crying why do you cry because i have left my man behind  oh if i buy you i will furnish you with a better man than you left i have lots of young bucks on my farm  i dont want and will never have any other man replied the woman  whats your name  asked a man in a straw hat of a tall negro man who stood with his arms folded across his breast and leaning against the wall  my name is aaron sir  how old are yon   twentyfive

 where were you raised   in old virginny sir how many men have owned you four  do you enjoy good health   yes sir  how long did you live with your first owner   twenty years did you ever run away no sir did you ever strike your master no sir  were you ever whipped much   no sir i spose i did not deserve it  how long did you live with your second master  ten years sir  have you a good appetite   yes sir  can you eat your allowance   yes sir when i can get it  what were you employed at in virginia   i worked in de terbacar fed  in the tobacco field yes sir  how old did you say you were   i will be twentyfive if i live to see next sweet potaterdigging time  i am a cotton planter and if i buy you you will have to work in the cotton field my men pick one hundred and fifty pounds a day and the women one hundred and forty and those who fail to pick their task receive five stripes from the cat for each pound that is wanting now do you think you could keep up with the rest of the hands  i dont know sir i spec id have to  how long did you live with your third master three years sir why this makes you thirtythree i thought you told me you was only twentyfive  aaron now looked first at the planter then at the trader and seemed perfectly bewildered he had forgotten the lesson given him by pompey as to his age and the planters circuitous talk doubtless to find out the slaves real age had the negro off his guard  i must see your back so as to know how much you have been whipped before i think of buying said the planter pompey who had been standing by during the examination thought that his services were now required and stepping forward with a degree of officiousness said to aaron  dont you hear de gentman tell you he want to zamon your limbs come unharness yeself old boy an dont be standing dar aaron was soon examined and pronounced  sound  yet the conflicting statement about the age was not satisfactory

fortunate for althesa she was spared the pain of undergoing such an examination mr crawford a teller in one of the banks had just been married and wanted a maidservant for his wife and passing through the market in the early part of the day was pleased with the young slaves appearance and purchased her and in his dwelling the quadroon found a much better home than often falls to the lot of a slave sold in the new orleans market the heartrending and cruel traffic in slaves which has been so often described is not confined to any particular class of persons no one forfeits his or her character or standing in society by buying or selling slaves or even raising slaves for the market the precise number of slaves carried from the slaveraising to the slaveconsuming states we have no means of knowing but it must be very great as more than forty thousand were sold and taken out of the state of virginia in one year known to god only is the amount of human agony and suffering which sends its cry from the slave markets and negro pens unheard and unheeded by man up to his ear mothers weeping for their children breaking the nightsilence with the shrieks of their breaking hearts from some you will hear the burst of bitter lamentation while from others the loud hysteric laugh denoting still deeper agony most of them leave the market for cotton or rice plantations where the slavewhip ceaseless swings where the noisome insect stings where the fever demon strews poison with the falling dews where the sickly sunbeams glare through the hot and misty air

the rev john peck was a native of the state of connecticut where he was educated for the ministry in the methodist persuasion his father was a strict follower of john wesley and spared no pains in his sons education with the hope that he would one day he as renowned as the great leader of his sect john had scarcely finished his education at new haven when he was invited by an uncle then on a visit to his father to spend a few months at natchez in the state of mississippi young feck accepted his uncles invitation and accompanied him to the south few young men and especially clergymen going fresh from a college to the south but are looked upon as geniuses in a small way and who are not invited to all the parties in the neighbourhood mr peck was not an exception to this rule the society into which he was thrown on his arrival at natchez was too brilliant for him not to be captivated by it and as might have been expected he succeeded in captivating a plantation with seventy slaves if not the heart of the lady to whom it belonged added to this he became a popular preacher bad a large congregation with a snug salary like other planters mr peck confided the care of his farm to ned huckelby an overseer of high reputation in his way the poplar farm as it was called was situated in a beautiful valley nine miles from natchez and near the river mississippi the once unshorn face of nature had given way and now the farm blossomed with a splendid harvest the neat cottage stood in a grove where lombardy poplars lift their tutted tops almost to prop the skies the willow locust and horsechesnut spread their branches and flowers never cease to blossom this was the parsons country house where the family spent only two months during the year

the town residence was a fine villa seated upon the brow of a hill at the edge of the city it was in the kitchen of this house that currer found her new home mr peck was every inch of him a democrat and early resolved that his  people as he called his slaves should be well fed and not overworked and therefore laid down the law and gospel to the overseer as well as the slaves

 it is my wish said he to mr carlton an old schoolfellow who was spending a few days with him  it is my wish that a new system be adopted on the plantations in this estate i believe that the sons of ham should have the gospel and i intend that my negroes shall the gospel is calculated to make mankind better and none should be without it  what say you replied carlton  about the right of man to his liberty  now carlton you have begun again to harp about mans rights i really wish you could see this matter as i do i have searched in vain for any authority for mans natural rights if he had any they existed before the fall that is adam and eve may have had some rights which god gave them and which modern philosophy in its pretended reverence for the name of god prefers to call natural rights i can imagine they had the right to eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden they were restricted even in this by the prohibition of one as far as i know without positive assertion their liberty of action was confined to the garden these were not  inalienable rights however for they forfeited both them and life with the first act of disobedience had they after this any rights  we cannot imagine them they were condemned beings they could have no rights but by christs gift as king these are the only rights man can have as an independent isolated being if we choose to consider him in this impossible position in which so many theorists have placed him if he had no rights ho could suffer no wrongs rights and wrongs are therefore necessarily the creatures of society such as man would establish himself in his gregarious state they are in this state both artificial and voluntary though man has no rights as thus considered undoubtedly he has the power by such arbitrary rules of right and wrong as his necessity enforces  i regret i cannot see eye to eye with you said carlton  i am a disciple of rousseau and have for years made the rights of man my study and i must confess to you that i can see no difference between white men and black men as it regards liberty how my dear carlton would you really have the negroes enjoy the same rights with ourselves i would most certainly look at our great declaration of independence look even at the constitution of our own connecticut and see what is said in these about liberty  i regard all this talk about rights as mere humbug the bible is older than the declaration of independence and there i take my stand the bible furnishes to us the armour of proof weapons of heavenly temper and mould whereby we can maintain our ground against all attacks but this is true only when we obey its directions as well as employ its sanctions

our rights are there established but it is always in connection with our duties if we neglect the one we cannot make good the other our domestic institutions can be maintained against the world if we but allow christianity to throw its broad shield over them but if we so act as to array the bible against our social economy they must fall nothing ever yet stood long against christianity those who say that religious instruction is inconsistent with our peculiar civil polity are the worst enemies of that polity they would drive religious men from its defence sooner or later if these views prevail they will separate the religious portion of our community from the rest and thus divided we shall become an easy prey why is it not better that christian men should hold slaves than unbelievers  we know how to value the bread of life and will not keep it from our slaves

 well every one to his own way of thinking said carlton as he changed his position  i confess added he  that i am no great admirer of either the bible or slavery my heart is my guide  ray conscience is my bible i wish for nothing further to satisfy me of my duty to man if i act rightly to mankind i shall fear nothing carlton had drunk too deeply of the hitter waters of infidelity and had spent too many hours over the writings of rousseau voltaire and thomas paine to place that appreciation upon the bible and its teachings that it demands during this conversation there was another person in the room seated by the window who although at work upon a fine piece of lace paid every attention to what was said this was georgiana the only daughter of the parson she had just returned from connecticut where she had finished her education she had had the opportunity of contrasting the spirit of christianity and liberty in new england with that of slavery in her native state and had learned to feel deeply for the injured negro georgiana was in her nineteenth year and had been much benefited by a residence of five years at the north her form was tall and graceful her features regular and well defined and her complexion was illuminated by the freshness of youth beauty and health the daughter differed from both the father and his visitor upon the subject which they had been discussing and as soon as an opportunity offered she gave it as her opinion that the bible was both the bulwark of christianity and of liberty with a smile she said  of course papa will overlook my differing from him for although i am a native of the south i am by education and sympathy a northerner mr peck laughed and appeared pleased rather than otherwise at the manner in which his daughter had expressed herself

from this georgiana took courage and said we must try the character of slavery and our duty in regard to it as we should try any other question of character and duty to judge justly of the character of anything wo must know what it does that which is good does good and that which is evil does evil and as to duty gods designs indicate his claims that which accomplishes the manifest design of god is right that which counteracts it wrong whatever in its proper tendency and general effect produces secures or extends human welfare is according to the will of god and is good and our duty is to favour and promote according to our power that which god favours and promotes by the general law of his providence on the other hand whatever in its proper tendency and general effect destroys abridges or renders insecure human welfare is opposed to gods will and is evil and as whatever accords with the will of god in any manifestation of it should be done and persisted in so whatever opposes that will should not he done and if done should be abandoned can that then be right be well doingâcan that obey gods behest which makes a man a slave  which dooms him and all his posterity in limitless generations to bondage to unrequited toil through life  thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself this single passage of scripture should caue us to have respect to the rights of the slave true christian love is of an enlarged disinterested nature it lovc all who love the lord jesus christ in sincerity without regard to colour or condition georgiana my dear you are an abolitionist your talk is fanaticism said mr peck in rather a sharp tone but the subdued look of the girl and the presence of carlton caused the father to soften his language mr peck having lost his wife by consumption and georgiana being his only child he loved her too dearly to say more even if he felt displeased a silence followed this exhortation from the young christian but her remarks had done a noble work the fathers heart was touched  and the sceptic for the first time was viewing christianity in its true light

i think i must go out to your farm said carlton as if to break the silence  i shall be pleased to have you go returned mr peck  i am sorry i cant go myself but huckelby will show you every attention and i feel confident that when you return to connecticut you will do me the justice to bay that i am one who looks after my people in a moral social and religious point of view  well what do you say to my spending next sunday there   why i think that a good move you will then meet with snyder our missionary oh you have missionaries in these parts have you yes replied mr peck snyder is from new york and is our missionary to the poor and preaches to our people on sunday you will no doubt like him he is a capital fellow  then i shall go said carlton  but only wish i had company this last remark was intended for miss peck for whom he had the highest admiration

it was on a warm sunday morning in the month of may that miles carlton found himself seated beneath a fine old apple tree whose thick loaves entirely shaded the ground for some distance round under similar trees and near by were gathered together all the  people  belonging to the plantation hontz snyder was a man of about forty years of age exceedingly low in stature but of a large frame he had been brought up in the mohawk valley in the state of new york and claimed relationship with the oldest dutch families in that vicinity he had once been a sailor and had all the roughness of character that a seafaring man might expect to possess together with the halfyankee halfgerman peculiarities of the people of the mohawk valley it was nearly eleven oclock when a onehorse waggon drove up in haste and the low squatty preacher got out and took his place at the foot of one of the trees where a sort of rough board table was placed and took his books from his pocket and commenced

as it is rather late said he we will leave the singing and praying for the last and take our text and commence immediately i shall base my remarks on the following passage of scripture and hope to have that attention which is due to the cause of godâall things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them that is do by all mankind just as you would desire they should do by you if you were in their place and they in yours

now to suit this rule to your particular circumstances suppose you were masters and mistresses and had servants under you would you not desire that your servants should do their business faithfully and honestly as well when your back was turned as while you were looking over them  would you not expect that they should take notice of what you said to them  that they should behave themselves with respect towards you and yours and be as careful of every tiling belonging to you as you would be yourselves  you are servants do therefore as you would wish to be done by and you will be both good servants to your masters and good servants to god who requires this of you and will reward you well for it if you do it for the sake of conscience in obedience to his commands

 you are not to be eyeservants now eyeservants are such as will work hard and seem mighty diligent while they think anybody is taking notice of them hut when their masters and mistresses hacks are turned they are idle and neglect their business i am afraid there are a great many such eyeservants among you and that you do not consider how great a sin it is to be so and how severely god will punish you for it you may easily deceive your owners and make them have an opinion of you that you do not deserve and get the praise of men by it but remember that you cannot deceive almighty god who sees your wickedness and deceit and will punish you accordingly for the rule is that you must obey your masters in all things and do the work they set you about with fear and trembling in singleness of heart as unto christ not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with goodwill doing service as to the lord and not as to men

take care that you do not fret or murmur grumble or repine at your condition  for this will not only make your life uneasy but will greatly offend almighty god consider that it is not yourselves it is not the people that you belong to it is not the men who have brought you to it hut it is the will of god who hath by his providence made you servants because no doubt he knew that condition would be best for you in this world and help you the better towards heaven if you would but do your duty in it so that any discontent at your not being free or rich or great as you see some others is quarrelling with your heavenly master and finding fault with god himself who bath made you what you are and hath promised you as large a share in the kingdom of heaven as the greatest man alive if you will hut behave yourself aright and do the business he hath set you about in this world honestly and cheerfully riches and power have proved the ruin of many an unhappy soul by drawing away the heart and affections from god and fixing them on mean and sinful enjoyments so that when god who knows our hearts better than we know them ourselves sees that they would he hurtful to us and therefore keeps them from us it is the greatest mercy and kindness he could show us

you may perhaps fancy that if you had riches and freedom you could do your duty to god and man with greater pleasure than you can now but pray consider that if you can but save your souls through the mercy of god you will have spent your time to the best of purposes in this world and he that at last can get to heaven has performed a noble journey let the road be ever so nigged and difficult besides you really have a great advantage over most white people who have not only the care of their daily labour upon their hands but the care of looking forward and providing necessaries for tomorrow and next day and of clothing and bringing up their children and of getting food and raiment for as many of you as belong to their families which often puts them to great difficulties and distracts their minds so as to break their rest and take off their thoughts from the affairs of another world whereas you are quite eased from all these cares and have nothing but your daily labour to look after and when that is done take your needful rest neither is it necessary for you to think of laying up anything against old age as white people are obliged to do for the laws of the country have provided that you shall not he turned off when you are past labour but shall be maintained while you live by those you belong to whether you are able to work or not

 there is only one circumstance which may appear grievous that i shall now take notice of and that is correction

now when correction is given you you either deserve it or you do not deserve it but whether you really deserve it or not it is your duty and almighty god requires that you bear it patiently you may perhaps think that this is hard doctrine but if you consider it right you must needs think otherwise of it suppose then that you deserve correction you cannot but say that it is just and right you should meet with it suppose you do not or at least you do not deserve so much or so severe a correction for the fault you have committed you perhaps have escaped a great many more and are at last paid for all or suppose you are quite innocent of what is laid to your charge and suffer wrongfully in that particular thing is it not possible you mayhave done some other bad thing which was never discovered and that almighty god who saw you doing it would not let you escape without punishment one time or another  and ought you not in such a case to give glory to him and be thankful that he would rather punish you in this life for your wickedness than destroy your souls for it in the next life  but suppose even this was not the case a case hardly to be imagined and that you have by no means known or unknown deserved the correction you suffered there is this great comfort in it that if you bear it patiently and leave your cause in the hands of god he will reward you for it in heaven and the punishment you suffer unjustly here shall turn to your exceeding great glory hereafter

lastly you should serve your masters faithfully because of their goodness to you see to what trouble they have been on your account tour fathers were poor ignorant and barbarous creatures in africa and the whites fitted out ships at great trouble and expense and brought you from that benighted land to christian america where you can sit under your own vine and fig tree and no one molest or make you afraid oh ray dear black brothers and sisters you are indeed a fortunate and a blessed people your masters have many troubles that you know nothing about if the banks break your masters are sure to lose something if the crops turn out poor they lose by it if one of you die your master loses what he paid for you while you lose nothing now let me exhort you once more to be faithful

often during the delivery of the sermon did snyder cast an anxious look in the direction where carlton was seated  no doubt to see if he had found favour with the stranger huckelby the overseer was also there seated near carlton with all snyders gesticulations sonorous voice and occasionally bringing his fist down upon the table with the force of a sledge hammer he could not succeed in keeping the negroes all interested  four or five were fast asleep leaning against the trees  as many more were nodding while not a few were stealthily cracking and eating hazlenuts  uncle simon you may strike up a hymn said the preacher as he closed his bible a moment more and the whole company carlton excepted bad joined in the well known hymn commencing with  when i can read my title clear to mansions in the sky

after the singing sandy closed with prayer and the following questions and answers read and the meeting was brought to a close

 q what command has god given to servants concerning obedience to their masters â a  servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers hut in singleness of heart fearing god  q what does god mean by masters according to the fleshâa  masters in this world  q what are servants to count their masters worthy ofâa  all honour  q how are they to do the service of their masters  â a  with good will doing service as unto the lord and not unto men  q how are they to try to please their masters â a

 please him well in all things not answering again  q is a servant who is an eyeservant to his earthly master an eyeservant to his heavenly master â a yes  q is it right in a servant when commanded to do any thing to he sullen and slow and answer his master again  â a  no  q if the servant professes to be a christian ought he not to he as a christian servant an example to all other servants of love and obedience to his masterâa yes   and should his master be a christian also ought he not on that account specially to love and obey him  âa

yes  q but suppose the master is hard to please and threatens and punishes more than he ought what is the servant to do â a do his best to please him  q when the servant suffers wrongfully at the hands of his master and to please god takes it patiently will god reward him for it âa yes  q is it right for the servant to run away or is it right to harbour a runaway â a no  q if a servant runs away what should be done with him âa ha should be caught and brought back  q when he is brought back what should be done with him â a whip him well  q why may not the whites be slaves as well rs the blacks â a because the lord intended the negroes for slaves  q are they better calculated for servants than the whitesâa yes their hands are large the skin thick and tough and they can stand the sun better than the whites  q why should servants not complain when they are whipped â a  because the lord has commanded that they should be whipped  q where has he commanded it â a  he says he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many stripes  q then is the master to blame for whipping his servantâa oh no he is only doing his duty as a christian

snyder left the ground in company with carlton and huckelby and the three dined together in the overseers dwelling

no seeming of logic can ever convince the american people that thousands of our slaveholding brethren are not excellent humane and even christian men fearing god and keeping his commandmentsârev dr joel parker

the pious old woman when she heard this forgetful of her sons misery and everything else but the glorious hope of his repentance fell on her knees and prayed as follows â oh lord i thank thee that thou hast at last opened jimmys eyes to the error of his ways and i pray that in thy divine mercy thou wilt send a rattlesnake to bite the old man and another to bite tom and another to bite harry for i am certain that nothing but a rattlesnake or something of the kind will ever turn them from their sinful ways they are so hardheaded when returning home and before i got out of the sand hill district i saw a funeral and thought i would fasten my horse to a post and attend the coffin was carried in a common horse cart and followed by fifteen or twenty persons very shabbily dressed and attended by a man whom i took to be the religious man of the place after the coffin had been placed near the grave he spoke as follows friends and neighbours you have congregated to see this lump of mortality put into a hole in the ground you all know the deceased â a worthless drunken goodforno thing vagabond he lived in disgrace and infamy and died in wretchedness you all despised himâyou all know his brother joe who lives on the hill  hes not a bit better though he has scrapd together a little property by cheating his neighbours his end will be like that of this loathsome creature whom you will please put into the hole as soon as possible i wont ask you to drop a tear but brother bohow will please raise a hymn while we fill up the grave

 i am rather surprised to hear that any portion of the whites in this state are in so low a condition yet it is truereturned snyder

these are very onpleasant facts to be related to ye mr carlton said huckelby  but i can bear witness to what mr snyder has told ye huckelby was from maryland where many of the poor whites are in as sad a condition as the sand hillers of mississippi he was a tall man of iron constitution and could neither read nor write hut was considered one of the best overseers in the country when about to break a slave in to do a heavy task he would make him work by his side all day and if the new hand kept up with him he was set down as an able bodied man huckelby had neither moral religious or political principles and often boasted that conscience was a matter that never  cost  him a thought mr snyder aint told ye half about the folks in these parts continued he  we who comes from more enlightened parts dont know how to put up with em down here i find the people here knows mighty little indeed in fact i may say they arc univarsaly onedicated i goes out among none on em cause they aint such as i have been used to sociate with when i gits a little richer so that i can stop work i tend to go back to maryland and spend the rest of my days  i wonder the negroes dont attempt to get their freedom by physical force it aint no use for em to try that for if they do we puts em through by daylight replied huckelby  there are some desperate fellows among the slaves said snyder

 indeed remarked carlton  oh yes replied the preacher  a case has just taken place near here wherda neighbour of ours mr j higgerson attempted tu correct a negro man in his employ who resisted drew a knife and stabbed him mr h in several places mr j c hobbs a tennessean ran to his assistance mr hobbs stooped to pick up a stick to strike the negro and while in that position the negro rushed upon him and caused his immediate death the negro then fled to the woods but was pursued with dogs and soon overtaken he had stopped in a swamp to fight the dogs when the party who were pursuing him came upon him and commanded him to give up which he refused to do he then made several efforts to stab them mr roberson one of the party gave him several blows on the head with a rifle gun but this instead of subduing only increased his desperate revenge mr it then discharged his gun at the negro and missing him the hall struck mr boon in the face and felled him to the ground the negro seeing mr boon prostrated attempted to rush up and stab him but was prevented by the timely interference of some one of the party he was then shot three times with a revolving pistol and once with a rifle and after having his throat cut he still kept the knife firmly grasped in his hand and tried to cut their legs when they approached to put an end to his life this chastisement was given because the negro grumbled and found fault with his master for flogging his wife veil this is a bad state of affairs indeed and especially the condition of the poor whites said carlton  you see replied snyder  no white man is respectable in these slave states who works for a living no community can he prosperous where honest labour is not honoured no society can be lightly constituted where the intellect is not fed whatever institution reflects discredit on industry whatever institution forbids the general culture of the understanding is palpably hostile to individual rights and to social wellbeing slavery is the incubus that hangs over the southern states  yes interrupted huckelby thems just my sentiments now and no mistake i think that for the honour of our country this slaveiy business should stop i dont own any no how and i would not be an overseer if i wernt paid for it

the separation

 in many ways does the full heart reveal the presence of the love it would conceal but in far more the estranged heart lets know the absence of the love which yet it fain would show

at length the news of the approaching marriage of horatio met the ear of clotel her head grew dizzy and her heart fainted within her but with a strong effort at composure she inquired all the particulars and her pure mind at once took its resolution horatio came that evening and though she would fain have met him as usual her heart was too full dot to throw a deep sadness over her looks and toues she had never complained of his decreasing tenderness or of her own lonely hours but he felt that the mute appeal of her heartbroken looks was more terrible than words he kissed the hand she offered and with a countenance almost as sad as her own led her to a window in the recess shadowed by a luxuriant passion flower it was the same seat where they had spent the first evening in this beautiful cottage consecrated to their first loves the same calm clear moonlight looked in through the trellis the vine then planted had now a luxuriant growth and many a time had horatio fondly twined its sacred blossoms with the glossy ringlets of her raven hair the rush of memory almost overpowered poor clotel and horatio felt too much oppressed and ashamed to break the long deep silence at length in words scarcely audible clotel said   tell me dear horatio are you to be married next week  he dropped her hand as if a rifle ball had struck him and it was not until after long hesitation that he began to make some reply about the necessity of circumstances mildly but earnestly the poor girl begged him to spare apologies it was enough that he no longer loved her and that they must bid farewell trusting to the yielding tenderness of her character he ventured in the most soothing accents to suggest that as he still loved her better than all the world she would ever be his real wife and they might see each other frequently he was not prepared for the storm of indignant emotion his words excited true she was his slave her bones and sinews had been purchased by his gold yet she had the heart of a true woman and hers was a passion too deep and absorbing to admit of partnership and her spirit was too pure to form a selfish league with crime

at length this painful interview came to an end they stood together by the gothic gate where they had so often met and parted in the moonlight old remembrances melted their souls  farewell dearest horatio said clotel  give me a parting kiss her voice was choked for utterance and the tears flowed freely as she bent her lips toward him he folded her convulsively in his arms and imprinted a long impassioned kiss on that mouth which had never spoken to him but in love and blessing with efforts like a deathpang she at length raised her head from his heaving bosom and turning from him with bitter sobs  it is our last to meet thus is henceforth crime god bless you i would not have you so miserable as i am farewell a last farewell  the last  exclaimed he with a wild shriek oh god clotel do not say that and covering his face with his hands he wept like a child recovering from his emotion he found himself alone the moon looked down upon him mild but very sorrowfully  as the madonna seems to gaze upon her worshipping children bowed down with consciousness of sin at that moment he would have given worlds to have disengaged himself from gertrude but he had gone so far that blame disgrace and duels with angry relatives would now attend any effort to obtain his freedom oh how the moonlight oppressed him with its friendly sadness it was like the plaintive eye of his forsaken one like the music of sorrow echoed from an unseen world long and earnestly ho gazed at that cottage where he had so long known earths purest foretaste of heavenly bliss slowly he walked away then turned again to look on that charmed spot the nestlingplace of his early affections he caught a glimpse of clotel weeping beside a magnolia which commanded a long view of the path leading to the public road he would have sprung toward her but she darted from him and entered the cottage that graceful figure weeping in the moonlight haunted him for years it stood before his closing eyes and greeted him with the morning dawn poor gertrude had she known all what a drearylot would hers have been but fortunately she could not miss the impassioned tenderness she never experienced  and horatio was the more careful in his kindness because ho was deficient in love after clotel had been separated from her mother and sister she turned her attention to the subject of christianity and received that consolation from her bible that is never denied to the children of god although it was against the laws of virginia for a slave to be taught to read currer had employed an old free negro who lived near her to teach her two daughters to read and write she felt that the step she had taken in resolving never to meet horatio again would no doubt expose her to his wrath and probably cause her to be sold yet her heart was too guileless for her to commit a crime and therefore she had ten times rather have been sold as a slave than do wrong some months after the marriage of horatio and gertrude their barouche rolled along a winding road that skirted the forest near clotels cottage when the attention of gertrude was suddenly attracted by two figures among the trees by the wayside and touching horatios arm she exclaimed do look at that beautiful child he turned and saw clotel and mary his lips quivered and his face became deadly pale his young wife looked at him intently but said nothing in returning home he took another road but his wife seeing this expressed a wish to go back the way they had come he objected and suspicion was awakened in her heart and she soon after learned that the mother of that lovely child bore the name of clotel a name which she had often heard horatio murmur in uneasy slumbers from gossiping tongues she soon learned more than she wished to know she wept hut not as poor clotel had done  for she never had loved and been beloved like her and her nature was more proud henceforth a change came over her feelings and her manners and horatio had no further occasion to assume a tenderness in return for hers changed as he was by ambition he felt the wintry chill of her polite propriety and sometimes in agony of heart compared it with the gushing love of her who was indeed his wife but these and all his emotions were a scaled book to clotel of which she could only guess the contents with remittances for her and her childs support there sometimes came earnest pleadings that she would consent to see him again but these she never answered though her heart yearned to do so

she pitied his young bride and would not be tempted to bring sorrow into her household by any fault of hers her earnest prayer was that she might not know of her existence she had not looked on horatio since she watched him under the shadow of the magnolia until his barouche passsed her in her rambles some months after she saw the deadly paleness of his countenance and had he dared to look back he would have seen her tottering with faintness mary brought water from a rivulet and sprinkled her face when she revived she clasped the beloved child to her heart with a vehemence that made her scream soothingly she kissed away her fears and gazed into her beautiful eyes with a deep deep sadness of expression which poor mary never forgot wild were the thoughts that passed round her aching heart and almost maddened her poor brain  thoughts which had almost driven her to suicide the night of that last farewell for her childs sake she had conquered the fierce temptation then and for her sake she struggled with it now but the gloomy atmosphere of their once happy home overclouded the morning of marys life clotel perceived this and it gave her unutterable pain

 tis ever thus with womans love true till lifes storms have passed  and like the vine around the tree it braves them to the last

james crawford the purchaser of althesa was from the green mountains of vermont and his feelings were opposed to the holding of slaves but his young wife persuaded him into the idea that it was no worse to own a slave than to hire one and pay the money to another hence it was that he had been induced to purchase althesa henry morton a young physician from the same state and who had just commenced the practice of his profession in new orleans was boarding with crawford when althesa was brought home the young physician had been in new orleans but a few weeks and had seen very little of slavery in his own mountain home he had been taught that the slaves of the southern states were negroes if not from the coast of africa the descendants of those who had been imported he was unprepared to behold with composure a beautiful young white girl of fifteen in the degraded position of a chattel slave the blood chilled in his young heart as he heard crawford tell how by bantering with the trader he had bought her for two hundred dollars less than he first asked his very looks showed that the slave girl had the deepest sympathy of his heart althesa had been brought up by her mother to look after the domestic concerns of her cottage in virginia and knew well the duties imposed upon her mrs crawford was much pleased with her new servant and often made mention of her in presence of morton the young mans sympathy ripened into love which was reciprocated by the friendless and injured child of sorrow there was but one course left that was to purchase the young girl and make her his wife which he did six months after her arrival in crawfords family the young physician and his wife immediately took lodgings in another part of the city a private teacher was called in and the young wife taught some of those accomplishments which arc necessary for ones taking a position in society dr morton soon obtained a large practice in his profession and with it increased in wealthâbut with all his wealth he never would own a slave mrs morton was now in a position to seek out and redeem her mother whom she had not heard of since they parted at natchez an agent was immediately despatched to hunt out the mother and to see if she could be purchased the agent had no trouble in finding out mr peck but all overtures were unavailable he would not sell currer his excuse was that she was such a good housekeeper that he could not spare her poor althesa felt ad when she found that her mother could not he bought however she felt a consciousness of having done her duty in the matter yet waited with the hope that the day might come when she should have her mother by her side

on carltons return the next day from the farm he was overwhelmed with questions from mr peck as to what he thought of the plantation the condition of the negroes huckelby and snyder and especially how he liked the sermon of the latter mr peck was a kind of a patriarch in his own way to begin with he was a man of some talent he not only had a good education but was a man of great eloquence and had a wonderful command of language he too either had or thought he had poetical genius and was often sending contributions to the natchez free trader and other periodicals in the way of raising contributions for foreign missions he took the lead of all others in his neighbourhood everything he did he did for the glory of god as he said he quoted scripture for almost everything he did being in good circumstances he was able to give to almost all benevolent causes to which he took a fancy he was a most loving father and his daughter exercised considerable influence over him and owing to her piety and judgment that influence had a beneficial effect carlton though a schoolfellow of the parsons was nevertheless nearly ten years his junior and though not an avowed infidel was however a freethinker and one who took no note of tomorrow and for this reason georgiana took peculiar interest in the young man for carlton was but little above thirty and unmarried the young christian felt that she would not be living up to that faith that she professed and believed in if she did not exert herself to the utmost to save the thoughtless man from his downward career and in this she succeeded to her most sanguine expectations she not only converted him but in placing the scriptures before him in their true light she redeemed those sacred writings from the charge of supporting the system of slavery which her father had cast upon them in the discussion some days before

georgianas first object however was to awaken in carltons breast a love for the lord jesus christ the young man had often sat under the sound of the gospel with perfect indifference he had heard men talk who had grown grey bending over the scriptures and their conversation had passed by him unheeded  but when a young girl much younger than himself reasoned with him in that innocent and persuasive manner that woman is wont to use when she has entered with her whole soul upon an object it was too much for his stout heart and he yielded her next aim was to vindicate the bible from sustaining the monstrous institution of slavery she said  god has created of one blood all the nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth to claim hold and treat a human being as property is felony against god and man the christian religion is opposed to slaveholding in its spirit and its principles it classes menstealers among murderers and it is the duty of all who wish to meet god in peace to discharge that duty in spreading these principles let us not deceive ourselves into the idea that slavery is right because it is profitable to us slaveholding is the highest possible violation of the eighth commandment to take from a man his earnings is theft hut to take the earner is a compound lifelong theft and we who profess to follow in the footsteps of our redeemer should do our utmost to extirpate slavery from the land for my own part i shall do all i can when the redeemer was about to ascend to the bosom of the father and resume the glory which he had with him before the world was he promised his disciples that the power of the holy ghost should come upon them and that they should be witnesses for him to the uttermost parts of the earth what was the effect upon their minds  they all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women stimulated by the confident expectation that jesus would fulfil his gracious promise they poured out their hearts in fervent supplications probably for strength to do the work which he had appointed them unto for they felt that without him they could do nothing and they consecrated themselves on the altar of god to the great and glorious enterprise of preaching the unsearchable riches of christ to a lost and perishing world have we less precious promises in the scriptures of truth  may we not claim of our god the blessing promised unto those who consider the poor the lord will preserve them and keep them alive and they shall be blessed upon the earth docs not the language inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye did it unto me belong to all who are rightly engaged in endeavouring to unloose the bondmans fetters  shall we not then do as the apostles did  shall we not in view of the two millions of heathen in our very midst in view of the souls that are going down in an almost unbroken phalanx to utter perdition continue in prayer and supplication that god will grant us the supplies of his spirit to prepare us for that work which he has given us to do  shall not the wail of the mother as she surrenders her only child to the grasp of the ruthless kidnapper or the trader in human blood animate our devotions shall not the manifold crimes and horrors of slavery excite more ardent outpourings at the throne of grace to grant repentance to our guilty country and permit us to aid in preparing the way for the glorious second advent of the messiah by preaching deliverance to the captives and the opening of the prison doors to those who are hound

georgiana had succeeded in rivetting the attention of carlton during her conversation and as she was finishing her last sentence she observed the silent tear stealing down the cheek of the newly born child of god at this juncture her father entered and carlton left the room dear papasaid georgiana will you grant me one favour or rather make me a promise i cant tell my dear till i know what it is replied mr peck  if it is a reasonable request i will comply with your wish continued he  i hope my dear answered she  that papa would not think me capable of making an unreasonable request  well well returned he   tell me what it is  i hope said she that in your future conversation with mr carlton on the subject of slavery you will not speak of the bible as sustaining it  why georgiana my dear you are mad aint you exclaimed he in an excited tone the poor girl remained silent the father saw in a moment that he had spoken too sharply and taking her hand in his he said  now my child why do you make that request because returned she  i think he is on the stool of repentance if he has not already been received among the elect he you know was bordering upon infidelity and if the bible sanctions slavery then he will naturally enough say that it is not from god for the argument from internal evidence is not only refuted but actually turned against the bible if the bible sanctions slavery then it misrepresents the character of god nothing would be more dangerous to the soul of a young convert than to satisfy him that the scriptures favoured such a system of sin  dont you suppose that i understand the scriptures better than you  i have been in the world longer  yes said she  you have been in the world longer and amongst slaveholders so long that you do not regard it in the same light that those do who have not become so familiar with its everyday scenes as you i once heard you say that you were opposed to the institution when you first came to the south  yes answered he  i did not know so much about it then  with great deference to you papa replied georgiana  i dont think that the bible sanctions slavery the old testament contains this explicit condemnation of it  he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he be found in his hand he shall surely he put to death and woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that useth his neighbours service without wages and giveth him not for his work when also the new testament exhibits such words of rebuke as these  behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them who have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth  the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for man slayers for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons a more scathing denunciation of the sin in question is surely to be found on record in no other book i am afraid continued the daughter  that the acts of the professed friends of christianity in the south do more to spread infidelity than the writings of all the atheists which have ever been published the infidel watches the religious world he surveys the church and lo thousands and tens of thousands of her accredited members actually hold slaves members in good and regular standing fellowshipped throughout christendom except by a few antislavery churches generally despised as ultra and radical reduce their follow men to the condition of chattels and by force keep them in that state of degradation bishops ministers elders and deacons are engaged in this awful business and do not consider their conduct as at all inconsistent with the precepts of either the old or new testaments moreover those ministers and churches who do not themselves hold slaves very generally defend the conduct of those who do and accord to them a fair christian character and in the way of business frequently take mortgages and levy executions on the bodies of their fellow men and in some cases of their fellow christians

 now is it a wonder that infidels beholding the practice and listening to the theory of professing christians should conclude that the bible inculcates a morality not inconsistent with chattelising human beings  and must not this conclusion be strengthened when they hear ministers of talent and learning declare that the bible does sanction slaveholding and that it ought not to be made a disciplinable offence in churches  and must not all doubt be dissipated when one of the most learned professors in our theological seminaries asserts that the bible  recognises that the relation may still exist salva fide et salva ecclesia without injury to the christian faith or church and that only the abuse of it is the essential and fundamental wrong are not infidels bound to believe that these professors ministers and churches understand their own bible and that consequently notwithstanding solitary passages which appear to condemn slaveholding the bible sanctions it  when nothing can be further from the truth and as for christ his whole life was a living testimony against slavery and all that it inculcates when he designed to do us good he took upon himself the form of a servant he took his station at the bottom of society ho voluntarily identified himself with the poor and the despised the warning voices of jeremiah and ezekiel were raised in olden time against sin let us not forget what followed therefore thus saith the lord â ye have not hearkered unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every one to his neighbourâbehold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine are we not virtually as a nation adopting the same impious language and are we not exposed to the same tremendous judgments  shall we not in view of those things use every laudable means to awaken our beloved country from the slumbers of death and baptize all our efforts with tears and with prayers that god may bless them then should our labour fail to accomplish the end for which we pray we shall stand acquitted at the bar of jehovah and although we may hare in the national calamities which await unrepented sins yet that blessed approval will be oursâ well done good and faithful servants enter yc into the joy of your lord 

 my dear georgiana said mr peck  i must be permitted to entertain my own views on this subject and to exercise my own judgment

believe me dear papa she replied i would not be understood as wishing to teach you or to dictate to you in the least but only grant my request not to allude to the bible as sanctioning slavery when speaking with mr carlton

 well returned he  i will comply with your wish

the young christian had indeed accomplished a noble work and whether it was admitted by the father or not she was his superior and his teacher georgians had viewed the right to enjoy perfect liberty as one of those inherent and inalienable rights which pertain to the whole human race and of which they can never be divested except by an act of gross injustice and no one was more able than herself to impress those views upon the hearts of all with whom she came in contact modest and selfpossessed with a voice of great sweetness and a most winning manner she could with the greatest ease to herself engage their attention

through the persuasion of mr peck and fascinated with the charms of georgiana carlton had prolonged his stay two months with his old schoolfellow during the latter part of the time he had been almost as one of the family if miss peck was invited out mr carlton was as a matter of course she seldom rode out unless with him if mr peck was absent he took the head of the table and to the delight of the young lady he had on several occasions taken part in the family worship  i am glad said mr peck one evening while at the tea table  i am glad mr carlton that my neighbour jones has invited you to visit him at his farm he is a good neighbour but a very ungodly man i want that you should see his people and then when you return to the north you can tell how much better a christians slaves are situated than one who does nothing for the cause of christ  i hope mr carlton said georgiana  that you will spend the sabbath with him and have a religious interview with the negroes  yes replied the parson  thats well thought of georgy  well i think i will go up on thursday next and stay till monday said carlton  and i shall act upon your suggestion miss peck continued he  and try to get a religious interview with the blacks bytheby remarked carlton  i saw an advertisement in the free trader today that rather puzzled me ah here it is now and drawing the paper from his pocket  i will read it and then you can tell me what it means to planters and others â wanted fifty negroes any person having sick negroes considered incurable by their respective physicians their owners of course and wishing to dispose of them dr stillman will pay cash for negroes affected with scrofula or kings evil confirmed hypochondriacism apoplexy or diseases of the brain kidneys spleen stomach and intestines bladder and its appendages diarrhoea dysentery c the highest cash price will be paid as above when i read this today i thought that the advertiser must be a man of eminent skill as a physician and that he intended to cure the sick negroes but on second thought i find that some of the diseases enumerated are certainly incurable what can he do with these sick negroes you see replied mr peck laughing  that he is a doctor and has use for them in his lectures the doctor is connected with a small college look at his prospectus where he invites students to attend and that will explain the matter to you carlton turned to another column and read the following  some advantages of a peculiar character are connected with this institution which it may he proper to point out no place in the united states offers as great opportunities for the acquisition of anatomical knowledge subjects being obtained from among the coloured population in sufficient numbers for every purpose and proper dissections carried on without offending any individuals in the community   these are for dissection then   inquired carlton with a trembling voice yes answered the parson  of course they wait till they die before they can use them they keep them on hand and when they need one they bleed him to death returned mr peck yes but thats muider  oh the doctors are licensed to commit murder you know and whats the difference whether one dies owing to the loss of blood or taking too many pills for my own part if i had to choose i would rather submit to the former  i have often heard what i considered hard stories in abolition meetings in new york about slavery but now i shall begin to think that many of them are true  the longer you remain here the more you will he convinced of the iniquity of the institution remarked georgiana  now georgy my dear dont give us another abolition lecture if you please said mr peek here carlton continued the parson  i have written a short poem for your sisters album as you requested me it is a domestic piece as you will see she will prize it the more for that remarked carlton and taking the sheet of paper he laughed as his eyes glanced over it kead it out mr carlton said georgiana and let me hear what it is i know papa gets off some very droll things at times carlton complied with the young ladys request and read aloud the following rare specimen of poetical genius my little nig

 i have a little nigger the blackest thing alive hell be just four years old if he lives till fortyfive his smooth cheek hath a glossy hue like a new polished boot and his hair curls oer his little head as black as any soot

his lips bulge from his countenanceâhis little ivories shineâ his nose is what we call a little pug but fashioned very fine although not quite a fairy he is comely to behold and i wouldnt sell him pon my word for a hundred all in gold

 he gets up early in the morn like all the other nigs and runs off to the hog lot where he squabbles with the pigsâ and when the sun gets out of bed and mounts up in the sky the warmest comer of the yard is where my nig doth lie and there extended lazily he contemplates and dreams i cannot qualify to this but plain enough it seems until tis time to take in grub when you cant find him there for like a politician he has gone to hunt his share

 i havent said a single word concerning my plantation though a prettier i guess cannot be found within the nation when he gets a little bigger ill take and to him show it and then ill say  my little nig now just prepare to go it ill put a hoe into his handâhell soon know what it means and every day for dinner he shall have bacon and greens

a night in the parsons kitchen

 and see the servants met their daily labours oer and with the jest and song they set the kitchen in a roar

mr peck kept around him four servants besides currer of whom we have made mention of these sam was considered the first if a dinnerparty was in contemplation or any company to be invited to the parsons after all the arrangements had been talked over by the minister and his daughter sam was sure to be consulted upon the subject by  miss georgy as miss peck was called by the servants if furniture crockery or anything else was to be purchased sam felt that he had been slighted if his opinion had not been asked as to the marketing be did it all at the servants table in the kitchen he sat at the head and was master of ceremonies a single look from him was enough to silence any conversation or noise in the kitchen or any other part of the premises there is in the southern states a great amount of prejudice against colour amongst the negroes themselves the nearer the negro or mulatto approaches to the white the more he seems to feel his superiority over those of a darker hue this is no doubt the result of the prejudice that exists on the part of the whites towards both mulattoes and blacks sam was originally from kentucky and through the instrumentality of one of his young masters whom he had to fake to school he had learned to read so as to be well understood  and owing to that fact was considered a prodigy among the slaves not only of his own masters but those of the town who knew him sam had a great wish to follow in the footsteps of his master and be a poet and was therefore often heard singing doggrels of his own composition but there was one great drawback to sam and that was his colour he was one of the blackest of bis race this he evidently regarded as a groat misfortune however he made up for this in his dress mr peck kept his house servants well dressed and as for sam he was seldom seen except in a ruffled shirt indeed the washerwoman feared him more than all others about the house

currer as we have already stated was chief of the kitchen department and had a general supervision of the household affairs alfred the coachman peter and hetty made up the remainder of the house servants besides these mr peck owned eight slaves who were masons these worked in the city being mechanics they were let out to greater advantage than to keep them on the farm however every sunday night pecks servants including the bricklayers usually assembled in the kitchen when the events of the week wore freely discussed and commented on it was on a sunday evening in the month of june that there was a party at mr pecks and according to custom in the southern states the ladies hod their maidservants with them tea had been served in  the house and the servants including the strangers had taken their seats at the tea table in the kitchen sam being a  single gentleman was unusually attentive to the  ladies on this occasion he seldom or ever let the day pass without spending at least an hour in combing and brushing up his hair sam had an idea that fresh butter was better for his hair than any other kind of grease  and therefore on churning days half a pound of butter had always to be taken out before it was salted when he wished to appear to great advantage he would grease his face to make it shiny on the evening of the party therefore when all the servants were at the tabic sam cut a big figure there he sat with his wool well combed and buttered face nicely greased and iris ruffles extending five or six inches from his breast the parson in his own drawingroom did not make a more imposing appearance than did his servant on this occasion  i jist bin had my fortune _ told last sunday night said sam as he helped one of the girls to some weet hash indeed cried halfadozen voices  yes continued he  aunt winny told me i is to hab de prettiest yaller gal in town and dat i is to be free all eyes were immediately turned toward sally johnson who was seated near sam i speck i see somebody blush at dat remark said alfred  pass dem pancakes and molasses up dis way mr alf and none of your insinawaysion here rejoined sam dat reminds me said currer  dat dorcas simpson is gwine to git married  who to i want to know inquired peter to one of mr darbys fieldhands answered currer i should tink dat dat gal would not trow hersef away in dat manner said sally  she good enough looking to get a house servant and not to put up wid a fiel nigger continued she yes said sam dats a wery insensible remark of yours miss sally i admire your judgment wery much i assure you dahs plenty of suspectible and welldressed house servants dat a gal of her looks can get wid out taken up wid dem common darkies is de man black or a mulatto  inquired one of the company  des nearly white

replied currer well den dats some exchuse for her remarked sam  for i dont like to see dis malgemation of blacks and mulattoes no bow continued sam  if i had my rights i would be a mulatto too for my mother was almost as lightcoloured as miss sally said he although sam was one of the blackest men living he nevertheless contended that his mother was a mulatto and no one was more prejudiced against the blacks than he a good deal of work and the free use of fresh butter had no doubt done wonders for his  hare in causing it to grow long and to this he would always appeal when he wished to convince others that he was part of an anglosaxon  i always thought you was not clear black mr sam said agnes you are right dahr miss agnes my hare tells what company i belong to answered sam here the whole company joined in the conversation about colour which lasted for some time giving unmistakeable evidence that caste is owing to ignorance the evenings entertainment concluded by sams relating a little of his own experience while with his first master in old kentucky

sams former master was a doctor and had a large practice among his neighbours doctoring both masters and slaves when sam was about fifteen years of age his old master set him to grinding up the ointment then to making pills as the young student grew older and became more practised in his profession his services were of more importance to the doctor the physician having a good business and a large number of his patients being slaves the most of whom had to call on the doctor when ill he put sam to bleeding pulling teeth and administering medicine to the slaves sam soon acquired the name amongst the slaves of the  black doctor with this appellation he was delighted and no regulur physician could possibly have put on more airs than did the black doctor when his services were required in bleeding he must have more bandages and rub and smack the arm more than the doctor would have thought of we once saw sum taking out a tooth for one of his patients and nothing appeared more amusing he got the poor fellow down on his back and he got a straddle of the mans chest and getting the turnkeys on the wrong tooth he shut both eyes and pulled for his life the poor man screamed as loud as he could but to no purpose sum had him fast after a great effort out came the sound grinder and the young doctor saw his mistake hut consoled himself with the idea that as the wrong tooth was out of the way there was more room to get at the right one bleeding and a dose of calomel was always considered indispensable by the  old boss and as a matter of course sam followed in his footsteps

on one occasion the old doctor was ill himself so us to be unable to attend to his patients a slave with pass in hand called to receive medical advice and the master told sam to examine him and see what he wanted this delighted him beyond measure for although he had been acting his part in the way of giving out medicine as the master ordered it he had never been called upon by the latter to examine a patient and this seemed to convince him that after all he was no sham doctor as might have been expected he cut a rare figure in his first examination placing himself directly opposite his patient and folding his arms across his breast and looking very knowingly he began whats do matter wid you i is sick where is you sick here replied the man putting his hand upon his stomach put out your tongue continued the doctor the man run out his tongue at full length  let me feel your pulse at the same time taking his patients hand in his placing his fingers on his pulse he said  ah your case is a bad one if  dont do something for you and dat pretty quick you ill be a gone coon and dats sartin at this the man appeared frightened and inquired what was the matter with him in answer sam said  i done told you dat your case is a bad one and dats enough on sams returning to his masters bedside the latter said well sam what do you think is the matter with him his stomach is out of order sir he replied what do you think had best be done for him i think i better bleed him and give him a dose of calomel returned sam so to the latters gratification the master let him have his own way we need not further say that the recital of sams experience as a physician gave him a high position amongst the servants that evening and made him a decided favourite with the ladies one of whom feigned illness when the black doctor to the delight of all and certainly to himself gave medical advice thus ended the evening amongst the servants in the parsons kitchen

a slave hunting parson

 tis too much provd â that with devotions visage and pious action we do sugar oer the devil himself

shakspeare  you will no doubt be well pleased with neighbour jones said mr peck as carlton stepped into the chaise to pay his promised visit to the  ungodly man dont forget to have a religious interview with the negroes remarked georgiana as she gave the last nod to her young convert  i will do my best returned carlton as the vehicle left the door as might have been expected carlton met with a cordial reception at the hands of the proprietor of the grove farm the servants in the  great house  were well dressed and appeared as if they did not want for food jones knew that carlton was from the north and a nonslaveholder and therefore did everything in his power to make a favourable impression on his mind  my negroes are well clothed well fed and not over worked said the slaveholder to his visitor after the latter had been with him nearly a week  as far as i can sec your slaves appear to good advantage replied carlton  but continued he  if it is a fair question do you have preaching among your slaves on sunday mr jones no no returned he  i think thats all nonsense my negroes do their own preaching  so you do permit them to have meetings  yes when they wish theres some very intelligent and clever chaps among them

as tomorrow is the sabbath said carlton if you have no objection i will attend meeting with them  most certainly you shall if you will do the preaching returned the planter here the young man was about to decline but he remembered the parting words of georgiana and he took courage and said  oh i have no objection to give the negroes a short talk it was then understood that carlton was to have a religious interview with the blacks the next day and the young man waited with a degree of impatience for the time

in no part of the south are slaves in a more ignorant and degraded state than in the cotton sugar and rice districts

if they are permitted to cease labour on the sabbath the time is spent in hunting fishing or ying beneath the shade of a tree resting for the morrow religious instruction is unknown in the far south except among such men as the rev c c jones john peck and some others who regard religious instruction such as they impart to their slaves as calculated to make them more trustworthy and valuable as property jones aware that his slaves would make rather a bad show of intelligence if questioned by carlton resolved to have them ready for him and therefore gave his driver orders with regard to their preparation consequently after the days labour was over dogget the driver assembled the negroes together and said now boys and gals your master is coming down to the quarters tomorrow with his visitor who is going to give yon a preach and i want you should understand what he says to you now many of you who came of old virginia and kentuck know what preaching is and others who have been raised in these parts do not preaching is to tell you that you are mighty wicked and bad at heart this i suppose you all know but if the gentleman should ask you who made you tell him the lord if he ask if you wish to go to heaven tell him yes remcmber that you are all christians all love the lord all want to go to heaven all love your masters and all love me now boys and gals i want you to show yourselves smart tomorrow be on your ps and qs and monday morning i will give you all a glass of whiskey bright and early agreeable to arrangement the slaves were assembled together on sunday morning under the large trees near the great house and alter going through another drilling from the driver jones and carlton made their appearance  you see said jones to the negroes as lhe approached them  you see heres a gentleman thats come to talk to you about your souls and i hope you ill all pay that attention that you ought jones then seated himself in one of the two chairs placed there for him and the stranger

carlton hud already selected a chapter in the bible to read to them which he did after first prefacing it with some remarks of his own not being accustomed to speak in public he determined after reading the bible to make it more of a conversational meeting than otherwise he therefore began asking them questions  do you feel that you are a christian  asked he of a fullblooded negro that sat near him yes sir was the response you feel then that you shall go to heaven  yes sir  of course you know who made you  the man put his hand to his head and began to scratch his wool and after a little hesitation answered  de overseer told us last night who made us but indeed i forgot the gentmuns name this reply was almost too much for carlton and his gravity was not a little moved however he bit his tongue and turned to another man who appeared from his looks to be more in tell gent do you serve the lord  asked he  no sir i dont serve anybody but mr jones i nebor belong to anybody else to hide his feelings at this juncture carlton turned and walked to another part of the grounds to where the women were seated and said to a mulatto woman who had rather an anxious countenance  did you ever hear of john the baptist  oh yes marser john do baptist i know dat nigger bery well indeed  he libs in old kentuck where i come from carltons gravity here gave way and he looked at the planter and laughed right out the old woman knew a slave near her old masters farm in kentucky and was ignorant enough to suppose that he was the john the baptist inquired about carlton occupied the remainder of the time in reading scripture and talking to them  my niggers aint shown off very well today said jones as he and his visitor left the grounds  no replied carlton  you did not get hold of the bright ones continued the planter so it seems remarked carlton the planter evidently felt that his neighbour parson peck would have a nut to crack over the account that carlton would give of the ignorance of the slaves and said and did all in his power to remove the bad impression already made but to no purpose the report made by carlton on his return amused the parson very much it appeared to him the best reason why professed christians like himself should be slaveholders not so with georgiana she did not even smile when carlton was telling his story but seemed sore at heart that such ignorance should prevail in their midst the question turned upon the heathen of other lands and the parson began to expatiate upon his own efforts in foreign missions when his daughter with a childlike simplicity  send bibles to the heathen on every distant shore from light thats beaming oer us let streams increasing pour but keep it from the millions downtrodden at our door

send bibles to the heathen their famished spirits feed oh  haste and join your efforts the priceless gilt to speed  then flog the trembling negro if he should learn to read

i saw a curiosity while at hr joness that i shall not forget soon said carlton what was it  inquired the parson  a kennel of bloodhounds  and such dogs  never saw before they were of a species between the bloodhound and the foxhound and were ferocious gaunt and savagelooking animals they were part of a stock imported from cuba he informed me they were kept in an iron cage and fed on indian com bread this kind of food he said made them eager for their business sometimes they would give the dogs meat but it was always after they had been chasing a negro  were those the dogs you had papa to hunt harry asked georgiana no my dear was the short reply  and the parson seemed anxious to change the conversation to something else when hr peck had left the room carlton spoke more freely of what he had seen and spoke more pointedly against slavery for he well knew that miss peck sympathised with him in all he felt and said

you mentioned about your father hunting a slave said carlton in an under tone  yes replied she papa went with some slavecatchers and a parcel of those nasty negrodoge to hunt poor harry he belonged to papa and lived on the farm his wife lives in town and harry had been to see her and did not return quite as early as he should and huckelby was flogging him and he got away and came here i wanted papa to keep him in town so that he could see his wife more frequently but he said they could not spare him from the farm and flogged him again and sent him back the poor fellow knew that the overseer would punish him over again and instead of going back he went into the woods  did they catch him  asked carlton  yes replied she  in chasing him through the woods he attempted to escape by swimming across a river and the dogs were sent in after him and soon caught him but harry had great courage and fought the dogs with a big club and papa seeing the negro would escape from the dogs shot at him as he says only to wound him that he might be caught but the poor fellow was killed overcome by relating this incident georgiana hurst into tears

although mr peck fed and clothed his house servants well and treated them with a degree of kindness he was nevertheless a most cruel master he encouraged his driver to work the fieldhands from early dawn till late at night and the good appearance of the houseservants and the preaching of snyder to the field negroes was to cause himself to be regarded as a christian master being on a visit one day at the farm and having with him several persons from the free states and wishing to make them believe that his slaves were happy satisfied and contented the parson got out the whiskey and gave each one a dram who in return had to drink the masters health or give a toast of some kind the company were not a little amused at some of the sentiments given and peck was delighted at every indication of contentment on the part of the blacks at last it came to jacks turn to drink and the master expected something good from him because he was considered the cleverest and most witty slave on the farm

 now said the master as he handed jack the cup of whiskey now jack give us something rich you know continued he  we have raised the finest crop of cotton thats been seen in these parts for many a day now give us a toast on cotton come jack give us something to laugh at the negro felt not a little elated at being made the hero of the occasion and taking the whiskey in his right hand put his left to his head und began to scratch his wool and said  the big bee flies high the little bee make the honey the black folks makes the cotton and the white folks gets the money

a free woman reduced to slavery

althesa found in henry morton a kind and affectionate husband and his efforts to purchase her mother although unsuccessful had doubly endeared him to her having from the commencement resolved not to hold slaves or rather not to own any they were compelled to hire servants for their own use five years had passed away and their happiness was increased by two lovely daughters mrs morton was seated one bright afternoon busily engaged with her needle and near her sat salome a servant that she had just taken into her employ the woman was perfectly white so much so that mrs morton had expressed her apprehensions to her husband when the woman first came that she was not born a slave the mistress watched the servant as the latter sat sewing upon some coarse work and saw the large silent tear in her eye this caused an uneasiness to the mistress and she said salome dont you like your situation here oh yes madam answered the woman in a quick tone and then tried to force a smile  why is it that you often look sad and with tears in your eyes the mistress saw that she had touched a tender chord and continued i am your friend tell me your sorrow and if i can i will help you  as the last sentence was escaping the lips of the mistress the slave woman put her check apron to her face and wept mrs morton saw plainly that there was cause for this expression of grief and pressed the woman more closely  hear me then said the woman calming herself i will tell you why i sometimes weep i was born in german on the banks of the rhine ten years ago my father came to this country bringing with him my mother and myself he was poor and i wishing to assist all i could obtained a situation as nurse to a lady in this city my father got employment as a labourer on the wharf among the steamboats but he was soon taken ill with the yellow fever and died my mother then got a situation for herself while i remained with my first employer when the hot season came on my master with his wife left new orleans until the hot season was over and took me with them they stopped at a town on the banks of the mississippi river and said they should remain there some weeks one day they went out for a ride and they had not been gone more than half an hour when two men came into the room and told me that they had bought me and that i was their slave i was bound and taken to prison and that night put on a steamboat and taken up the yazoo river and set to work on a farm i was forced to take up with a negro and by him had three children a year since my masters daughter was married and i was given to her she came with her husband to this city and i have ever since been hired out

 unhappy woman whispered althesa  why did you not tell me tills before  i was afraid replied salome  for i was once severely flogged for telling a stranger that i was not born a slave on mr mortons return home his wife communicated to him the story which the slave woman had told her an hour before and begged that something might be done to rescue her from the situation she was then in in louisiana as well as many others of the slave states great obstacles are thrown in the way of persons who have been wrongfully reduced to slavery regaining their freedom a person claiming to be free must prove his right to his liberty this it will be seen throws the burden of proof upon the slave who in fill probability finds it out of his power to procure such evidence and if any free person shall attempt to aid a freeman in regaining his freedom he is compelled to enter into security in the sum of one thousand dollars and if the person claiming to be free shall fail to establish such fact the thousand dollars are forfeited to the state this cruel and oppressive law has kept many a freeman from espousing the cause of persons unjustly held as slaves mr morton inquired and found that the womans story was true as regarded the time she had lived with her present owner but the latter not only denied that she was free but immediately removed her from mortons three months after salome had been removed from mortons and let out to another family she was one morning cleaning the door steps when a lady passing by looked at the slave and thought she recognised some one that she had seen before the lady stopped and asked the woman if she was a slave  i am said she were you born a slave no i was born in germany whats the name of the ship in which you came to this country  inquired the lady i dont know was the answer was it the amazon  at the sound of this name the slave woman was silent for a moment and then the tears began to flow freely down her careworn cheeks would you know mrs marshall who was a passenger in the amazon if you should see her inquired the lady at this the woman gazed at the lady with a degree of intensity that can be imagined better than described and then fell at the ladys feet the lady was mrs marshall she had crossed the atlantic in the same ship with this poor woman salome like many of her countrymen was a beautiful singer and had often entertained mrs marshall and the other lady passengers on board the amazon the poor woman was raised from the ground by mrs marshall and placed upon the door step that she had a moment before been cleaning  i will do my utmost to rescue you from the horrid life of a slave exclaimed the lady as she took from her pocket her pencil and wrote down the number of the house and the street in which the german woman was working as a slave

after a long and tedious trial of many days it was decided that salome miller was by birth a free woman and she was set at liberty the good and generous althesa had contributed some of the money toward bringing about the trial and had done much to cheer on mrs marshall in her benevolent object salome miller is free but where are her three children  they are still slaves and in all human probability will die as such

this reader is no fiction if you think so look over the files of the new orleans newspapers of the years  and you will there see reports of the trial

today a mistress tomorrow a slave

 i promised thee a sister tale of mans perfidious cruelty come then and hear what cruel wrong befel the dark indieâcoleridge

let us return for a moment to the home of clotel while she was passing lonely and dreary hours with none but her darling child horatio green was trying to find relief in that insidious enemy of man the intoxicating cup defeated in politics forsaken in love by his wife he seemed to have lost all principle of honour and was ready to nerve himself up to any deed no matter how unprincipled clotels existence was now well known to horatios wife and both her and her father demanded that the beautiful quadroon and her child should be sold and sent out of the state to this proposition he at first turned a deaf ear but when he saw that his wife was about to return to her fathers roof he consented to leave the matter in the hands of his fatherinlaw the result was that clotel was immediately sold to the slavetrader walker who a few years previous had taken her mother and sister to the far south but as if to make her husband drink of the cup of humiliation to its very dregs mrs green resolved to take his child under her own roof for a servant mary was therefore put to the meanest work that could be found and although only ten years of age she was often compelled to perform labour which under ordinary circumstances would have been thought too hard for one much older one condition of the sale of clotel to walker was that she should be taken out of the state which was accordingly done most quadroon women who are taken to the lower countries to be sold are either purchased by gentlemen for their own use or sold for waitingmaids and clotel like her sister was fortunate enough to be bought for the latter purpose the town of vicksburgh stands on the left bank of the mississippi and is noted for the severity with which slaves are treated it was here that clotel was sold to mr james french a merchant

mrs french was severe in the extreme to her servants well dressed but scantily fed and overworked were all who found a home with her the quadroon had been in her new home but a short time ere she found that her situation was far different from what it was in virginia what social virtues are possible in a society of which injustice is the primary characteristic  in a society which is divided into two classes masters and slaves every married woman in the far south looks upon her husband as unfaithful and regards every quadroon servant as a rival clotel had been with her new mistress but a few days when she was ordered to cut off her long hair the negro constitutionally is fond of dress and outward appearance he that has short woollyhair combs it and oils it to death he that has long hair would sooner have his teeth drawn than lose it however painful it was to the quadroon she was soon seen with her hair cut as short as any of the fullblooded negroes in the dwelling

even with her short hair clotel was handsome her life had been a secluded one and though now nearly thirty years of age she was still beautiful at her short hair the other servants laughed miss clo neednt strut round so big she got short nappy hair well as i said nell with a broad grin that showed her teeth  she tinks she white when she come here wid dat long har of hers replied mill yes continued j neil missus make her take down her wool so she no put it up today

the fairness of clotels complexion was regarded with envy as well by the other servants as by the mistress herself this is one of the hard features of slavery today the woman is mistress of her own cottage tomorrow she is sold to one who aims to make her life as intolerable as possible and be it remembered that the house servant has the best situation which a slave can occupy some american writers have tried to make the world believe that the condition of the labouring classes of england is as bad as the slaves of the united states

the english labourer may be oppressed he may be cheated defrauded swindled and even starved hut it is not slavery under which he groans hcannot be sold in point of law he is equal to the prime minister it is easy to captivate the unthinking and the prejudiced by eloquent declamation about the oppression of english operatives being worse than that of american slaves and by exaggerating the wrongs on one side and hiding them on the other but all informed and reflecting minds knowing that bad as are the social evils of england those of slavery are immeasurably worse but the degradation and harsh treatment that clotel experienced in her new home was nothing compared with the grief she underwent at being separated from her dear child taken from her without scarcely a moments warning she knew not what had become of her the deep and heartfelt grief of clotel was soon perceived by her owners and fearing that her refusal to take food would cause her death they resolved to sell her mr french found no difficulty in getting a purchaser for the quadroon woman for such are usually the most marketable kind of property clotel was sold at private sale to a young man for a housekeeper but even he had missed his aim

death of the parson

carlton was above thirty years of ago standing on the last legs of a young man and entering on the first of a bachelor he had never dabbled in matters of love and looked upon all women alike although he respected woman for her virtues and often spoke of the goodness of heart of the sex he had never dreamed of marriage at first he looked upon miss peck as a pretty young woman but after she became his religious teacher he regarded her in that light that every one will those whom they know to be their superiors it was soon seen however that the young man not only respected and reverenced georgiana for the incalculable service she had done him in awakening him to a sense of duty to his soul but he had learned to bow to the shrine of cupid he found weeks after he had been in her company that when he met her at table or alone in the drawingroom or on the piazza he felt a shortness of breath a palpitating of the heart a kind of dizziness of the head but he knew not its cause

this was love in its first stage mr peck saw or thought he saw what would be the result of carltons visit and held out every inducement in his power to prolong his stay the hot season was just commencing and the young northerner was talking of his return home when the parson was very suddenly token ill the disease was the cholera and the physicians pronounced the case incurable in less than five hours john peck was a corpse his love for georgiana and respect for her father had induced carlton to remain by the bedside of the dying man although against the express orders of the physician this act of kindness caused the young orphan henceforth to regard carlton as her best friend he now felt it his duty to remain with the young woman until some of her relations should be summoned from connecticut after the funeral the family physician advised that miss peck should go to the farm and spend the time at the country scat and also advised carlton to remain with her which ho did

at the parsons death his negroes showed little or no signs of grief this was noticed by both carlton and miss peck and caused no little pain to the latter they are ungrateful said carlton as he and georgiana were seated on the piazza  what asked she  have they to be grateful for   your father was kind was he not yes as kind as most men who own slaves but the kindness meted out to blacks would be unkindness if given to whites we would think so should we not yes replied he if we would not consider the best treatment which a slave receives good enough for us we should not think ho ought to be grateful for it everybody knows that slavery in its best and mildest form is wrong whoever denies this his lips libel his heart try him  clank the chains in his ears and tell him they are lor him give him an hour to prepare his wife and children for a life of slavery bid him make haste and get ready their necks for the yoke and their wrists for the coffle chains then look at his pale lips and trembling knees and you have natures testimony against slavery

 lets take a walk said carlton as if to turn the conversation the moon was just appearing through the tops of the trees and the animals and insects in an adjoining wood kept up a continued din of music the croaking of bullfrogs buzzing of insects cooing of turtledoves and the sound from a thousand musical instruments pitched on as many different keys made the welkin ring but even all this noise did not drown the singing of a party of the slaves who were seated near a spring that was sending up its cooling waters how prettily the negroes sing remarked carlton as they were wending their way towards the place from whence the sound of the voices came yes replied georgiana master sam is there ill warrant you hes always on hand when theres any singing or dancing we must not let them see us or they will stop singing  who makes their songs for them inquired the young man oh they make them up as they sing them they are all impromptu songs  by this time they were near enough to hear distinctly every word and true enough sams voice was heard above all others at the conclusion of each song they all joined in a hearty laugh with an expression of dats de song for me  dems dems

 stop said carlton as georgiana was rising from the log upon which she was seated  stop and lets hear this one the piece was sung by sam the others joining in the chorus and was as follows sam

 come all my brethren let us take a rest while the moon shines so brightly and clear old master is dead and left us at last and has gone at the bar to appear

old master has died and lying in his grave and our blood will awhile cease to flow  he will no more trample on the neck of the slave for hes gone where the slaveholders go

chorus

hang up the shovel and the hoe â take down the fiddle and the bowâ old master has gone to the slaveholders rest he has gone where they all ought to go

sam

 i heard the old doctor say the other night as he passed by the diningroom door â perhaps the old m in may live through the nightbut l think he will die about four young mistress sent me at the peril of ray life for the parson to come down and pray for says she your old master is now about to die and says i god speed him on his way  hang up the shovel c

 at four oclock at morn the family was called around the old mans dying bed and oh but i laughed to myself when i heard that the old mans spirit had fled

mr carlton cried and so did i pretend young mistress very nearly went mad  and the old parsons groans did the heavens fairly rend but l tell you i felt mighty glad

 hang up the shovel c

 well no more be roused by the blowing of his horn our banks no longer he will score he no more will feed us on cottonseeds and corn for his reign of oppression now is oer

he no more will hang our children on the tree to be ate by the carrion crow  he no more will send our wives to tennessee  for hes gone where the slaveholders go

 hang up the shovel and the hoe take down the fiddle and the bow well dance end sing and make the forest ring with the fiddle and the old banjo

the song was not half finished before carlton regretted that he had caused the young lady to remain and hear what to her must be anything but pleasant reflections upon her deceased parent  i think we will walk said he at the same time extending his arm to georgians no said she  lets hear them out it is from these unguarded expressions of the feelings of the negroes that we should learn a lesson at its conclusion they walked towards the house in silence as they were ascending the steps the young man said they are happy after all the negro situated as yours are is not aware that he is deprived of any just rights  yes yes answered georgiana   you may place the slave where you please you may dry up to your utmost the fountains of his feelings the springs of his thought you may yoke him to your labour as an ox which liveth only to work and worketh only to live you may put him under any process which without destroying his value as a slave will debase and crush him as a rational being you may do this and the idea that he was horn to he free will survive it all it is allied to his hope of immortality it is the ethereal part of his nature which oppression cannot reach it is a torch lit up in his soul by the hand of deity and never meant to be extinguished by the hand of man

on reaching the drawingroom they found sam snuffing the candles and looking as solemn and as dignified as if he had never sung a song or laughed in his life will miss georgy have de supper got up now asked the negro  yes she replied  well remarked carlton  that beats anything i ever met with do you think that was sam we heard singing i am sure of it was the answer  i could not have believed that that fellow was capable of so much deception continued he  our system of slavery is one of deception and sam you see has only been a good scholar however he is as honest a fellow as you will find among the slave population here if we would have them more honest we should give them their liberty and then the inducement to be dishonest would be gone i have resolved that these creatures shall all be free indeed exclaimed carlton yes i shall let them all go free and set an example to those about me  i honour your judgment said he but will the state permit them to remain   if not they can go where they can live in freedom i will not be unjust because the state is

retaliation

 i had a dream a happy dream i thought that i was free that in my own bright land again a home there was for me

with the deepest humiliation horatio green saw the daughter of clottel his own child brought into his dwelling as a servant his wife felt that she had been deceived and determined to punish her deceiver at first mary was put to work in the kitchen where she met with little or no sympathy from the other slaves owing to the fairness of her complexion the child was white what should be done to make her look like other negroes was the question mrs green asked herself at last she hit upon a plan there was a garden at the back of the house over which mrs green could look from her parlour window here the white slavegirl was put to work without either bonnet or handkerchief upon her head a hot sun poured its broiling rays on the naked face and neck of the girl until she sank down in the corner of the garden and was actually broiled to sleep dat little nigger aint working a bit missus said dinah to mrs green as she entered the kitchen

 shes lying in the sun seasoning she will work better by and by replied the mistress  dees white niggers always tink dey sef good as white folks continued the cook  yes but we will teach them better wont we dinah yes missus i dont like dees mularter niggers no how  dey always want to set dey sef up for something big the cook was black and was not without that prejudice which is to be found among the negroes as well as among the whites of the southern states the sun had the desired effect for in less than a fortnight marys fair complexion had disappeared and she was but little whiter than any other mulatto children running about the yard but the close resemblance between the father and child annoyed the mistress more than the mere whiteness of the childs complexion horatio made proposition after proposition to have the girl sent away for every time he beheld her countenance it reminded him of the happy days he had spent with clotel but his wife had commenced and determined to carry out her unfeeling and fiendish designs this child was not only white but she was the granddaughter of thomas jefferson the man who when speaking against slavery in the legislature of virginia said the whole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions the most unremitting despotism on the one part and degrading submission on the other with what execration should the statesman be loaded who permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other transforms those into despots and these into enemies destroys the morals of the one part and the amor patria of the other for if the slave can have a country in this world it must be any other in preference to that in which he is born to live and labour for another in which he must lock up the faculties of his nature contribute as far os depends on his individual endeavours to the evanishtnent of the human race or entail his own miserable condition on the endless generations proceeding from him and can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of god  that they are not to be violated but with his wrath  indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep for ever that considering numbers nature and natural means only a revolution of the wheel of fortune an exchange of situation is among possible events that it may become probable by supernatural interference  the almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest

what an incomprehensible machine is man  who can endure toil famine stripes imprisonment and death itself in vindication of his own liberty and the next moment be deaf to all those motives whose power supported him through his trial and inflict on his fellow men a bondage one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose  but we must wait with patience the workings of an overruling providence and hope that that is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren when the measure of their tears shall be full â when their tears shall have involved heaven itself in darkness â doubtless a god of justice will awaken to their distress and by diffusing light and liberality among their oppressors or at length by his exterminating thunder manifest his attention to things of this world and that they are not left to the guidance of blind fatality

the same man speaking of the probability that the slaves might some day attempt to gain their liberties by a revolution said  i tremble for my country when i recollect that god is just and that his justice cannot sleep for ever the almighty has no attribute that can take sides with us in such a struggle

but sad to say jefferson is not the only american statesman who has spoken highsounding words in favour of freedom and then left his own children to die slaves

the liberator

we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created free and equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happinessâdeclaration of american independence the death of the parson was the commencement of a new era in the history of his slaves only a little more than eighteen years of age georgiana could not expect to carry out her own wishes in regard to the slaves although she was sole heir to her fathers estate there were distant relations whose opinions she had at least to respect and both law and public opinion in the state were against any measure of emancipation that she might think of adopting unless perhaps she might be permitted to send them to liberia her uncle in connecticut had already been written to to come down and aid in settling up the estate he was a northern man but she knew him to be a tightfisted yankee whose whole counsel would go against liberating the negroes yet there was one way in which the thing could be done she loved carlton and she well knew that he loved her she read it in his countenance every time they met yet the young man did not mention his wishes to her there were many reasons why he should not in the first place her father was just deceased and it seemed only right that he should wait a reasonable time again carlton was poor and georgiana was possessed of a large fortune and his high spirit would not for a moment allow him to place himself in a position to be regarded ns a fortunehunter the young girl hinted as best she could at the probable future but all to no purpose he took nothing to himself true she had read much of  womans rights and had even attended a meeting while at the north which had been called to discuss the wrongs of woman but she could not nerve herself up to the point of putting the question to carlton although she felt sure that she should not be rejected she waited but in vain at last one evening she came out of her room rather late and was walking on the piazza for fresh air she passed near carltons room and heard the voice of sam the negro had just come in to get the young mans boots and had stopped as he usually did to have some talk i wish said sam dat marser carlton an miss georgy would get married den i spec wed have good times i dont think your mistress would have me replied the young man  what make tink dat marser carlton   your mistress would marry no one sam unless she loved them  den i wish she would lub you cause i tink we have good times den all our folks is de same pinion like mo returned the negro and then left the room with the hoots in his hands during the conversation between the anglosaxon and the african one word had been dropped by the former that haunted the young lady the remainder of the nightâ your mistress would marry no one unless she loved them that word awoke her in the morning and caused her to decide upon this important subject love and duty triumphed over the womans timid nature and that day georgiana informed carlton that she was ready to become his wife the young man with grateful tears accepted and kissed the hand that was offered to him the marriage of carlton and miss peck was hailed with delight by both the servants in the house and the negroes on the farm new rules were immediately announced for the working and general treatment of the slaves on the plantation with this huckelby the overseer saw his reign coming to an end and snyder the dutch preacher felt that his services would soon be dispensed with for nothing was more repugnant to the feelings of mrs carlton than the sermons preached by snyder to the slaves she regarded them as something intended to make them better satisfied with their condition and more valuable as pieces of property without preparing them for the world to come mrs carlton found in her husband a congenial spirit who entered into all her wishes and plans for bettering the condition of their slaves mrs carltons views and sympathies wore all in favour of immediate emancipation but then she saw or thought she saw a difficulty in that if the slaves were liberated they must be sent out of the state this of course would incur additional expense and if they left the state where had they better go   lets send them to liberia said carlton  why should they go to africa any more than to the free states or to canada  asked the wife  they would be in their native land he answered is not this their native land  what right have we more than the negro to the soil here or to style ourselves native americans  indeed it is os much their homes as ours and i have sometimes thought it was more theirs the negro has cleared up the lands built towns and enriched the soil with his blood and tears and in return he is to be sent to a country of which he knows nothing who fought more bravely for american independence than the blacks a negro by the name of attucks was the first that felt in boston at the commencement of the revolutionary war and throughout the whole of the struggles for liberty in this country the negroes have contributed their share in the last war with great britain the country was mainly indebted to the blacks in new orleans for the achievement of the victory at that place  and even general jackson the commander in chief called the negroes together at the close of the war and addressed them in the following termsâ  soldiers â when on the banks of the mobile i called you to take up arms inviting you to partake the perils and glory of your white fellow citizens i expected much from you for i was not ignorant that you possessed qualities most formidable to an invading enemy i knew with what fortitude you could endure hunger and thirst and all the fatigues of a campaign i knew well how yon loved your native country and that you as well as ourselves had to defend what man holds most dearâhis parents wife children and property you have done more than i expected in addition to the previous qualities i before knew you to possess i found among you a noble enthusiasm which leads to the performance of great things

soldiers the president of the united states shall hear how praiseworthy was your conduct in the hour of danger and the representatives of the american people will give you the praise your exploits entitle you to your general anticipates them in applauding your noble ardour and what did these noble men receive in return for their courage their heroism  chains and slavery their good deeds have been consecrated only in their own memories who rallied with more alacrity in response to the summons of danger  if in that hazardous hour when our homes were menaced with the horrors of war we did not disdain to call upon the negro to assist in repelling invasion why should we now that the danger is past deny him a home in his native land i see said carlton  you are right but i fear you will have difficulty in persuading others to adopt your views  we will set the example replied she  and then hope for the best for  feel that the people of the southern states will one day see their error liberty has always been our watchword as far as profession is concerned nothing has been held so cheap as our common humanity on a national average if every man had his aliquot proportion of the injustice done in this land by law and violence the present freemen of the northern section would many of them commit suicide in selfdefence and would court the liberties awarded by ali pasha of egypt to his subjects long ere this we should have tested in behalf of our bleeding and crushed american brothers of every hue and complexion every new constitution custom or practice by which inhumanity was supposed to be upheld the injustice and cruelty they contained emblazoned before the great tribunal of mankind for condemnation  and the good and available power they possessed for the relief deliverance and elevation of oppressed men permitted to shine forth from under the cloud for the refreshment of the human race

although mr and mrs carlton felt that immediate emancipation was the right of the slave and the duty of the master they resolved on a system of gradual emancipation so as to give them time to accomplish their wish and to prepare the negro for freedom huckelby was one morning told that his services would no longer be required the negroes ninetyeight in number were called together and told that the whip would no longer be used and that they would be allowed a certain sum for every bale of cotton produced sam whose long experience in the cottonfield before he had been taken into the house and whose general intelligence justly gave him the first place amongst the negroes on the poplar farm was placed at their head they were also given to understand that the money earned by them would be placed to their credit and when it amounted to a certain sum they should all be free the joy with which this news was received by the slaves showed their grateful appreciation of the boon their benefactors were bestowing upon them the house servants were called and told that wages would be allowed them and what they earned set to their credit and they too should be free the nekt were the bricklayers there were eight of these who had paid their master two dollars per day and boarded and clothed themselves an arrangement was entered into with them by which the money they earned should be placed to their credit and they too should be free when a certain amount should be accumulated  and great was the change amongst all these people the bricklayers had been to work but a short time before their increased industry was noticed by many they were no longer apparently the same people a sedateness a care an economy an industry took possession of them to which there seemed to be no bounds but in their physical strength they were never tired of labouring and seemed as though they could never effect enough they became temperate moral religious setting an example of innocent unoffending lives to the world around them which was seen and admired by all mrparker a man who worked nearly forty slaves at the same business was attracted by the manner in which these negroes laboured he called on mr carlton some weeks after they had been acting on the new system and offered ooo dollars for the head workman jim the offer was of course refused a few days after the same gentleman called again and made an offer of double the sum that he had on the former occasion mr parker finding that no money would purchase either of the negroes said  now mr carlton pray tell me what it is that makes your negroes work so  what kind of people are they  i suppose observed carlton that they are like other people flesh and blood  why sir continued parker i have never seen such people building as they are next door to my residence i see and have my eye on them from morning till night you are never there for i have never met you or seen you once at the building why sir i am an early riser getting up before day and do you think that i am not awoke every morning in my life by the noise of their trowels at work and their singing and noise before day and do you suppose sir that they stop or leave off work at sundown  no sir but they work as long as they can see to lay a brick and then they carry up brick and mortar for an hour or two afterward to be ahead of their work the next morning and again sir do you think that they walk at their work no sir they run all day you ee sir those immensely long ladders five stories in height do you suppose they walk up them no sir they run up and down them like so many monkeys all day long

i never saw such people as these in my life i dont know what to make of them were a white man with them and over them with a whip then i should see and understand the cause of the running and incessant labour  but i cannot comprehend it there is something in it sir great man sir that jim  great man i should like to own him carlton hire informed parker that their liberties depended upon their work when the latter replied  if niggers can work so for the promise of freedom they ought to be made to work without it this last remark was in the true spirit of the slaveholder and reminds us of the fact that some years since the overseer of general wade hampton offered the niggers under him a suit of clothes to the one that picked the most cotton in one day and after that time that days work was given us a task to the slaves on that plantation and after a while was adopted by other planters

the negroes on the farm under  marser sam were also working in a manner that attracted the attention of the planters round about they no longer feared huckelbys whip and no longer slept under the preaching of snyder on the sabbath mr and mrs carlton read and explained the scriptures to them  and the very great attention paid by the slaves showed plainly that they appreciated the gospel when given to them in its purity the death of currer from yellow fever was a great trial to mrs carlton  for she had not only become much attached to her but had heard with painful interest the story of her wrongs and would in all probability have restored her to her daughter in new orleans

escape of clotel

the fetters galled my weary soulâ a soul that seemed but thrown away i spurned the tyrants base control resolved at least the man to play

no country has produced so much heroism in so short a time connected with escapes from peril and oppression as has occurred in the united states among fugitive slaves many of whom show great shrewdness in their endeavours to escape from this land of bondage a slave was one day seen passing on the high road from a border town in the interior of the state of virginia to the ohio river the man had neither hat upon his head or coat upon his back lie was driving before him a very nice fat pig and appeared to all who bow him to be a labourer employed on an adjoining farm  no negro is permitted to go at large in the slave states without a written pass from his or her master except on business in the neighbourhood where do you live my boy asked a white man of the slave as he passed a white house with green blinds jist up de road sir was the answer  thats a fine pig  yes sir marser like dis choat berry much and the negro drove on as if he was in great haste in this way he and the pig travelled more than fifty miles before they reached the ohio river once at the river they crossed over the pig was sold  and nine days after the runaway slave passed over the niagara river and for the first time in his life breathed the air of freedom a few weeks later and on the ame road two slaves were seen passing one was on horseback the other was walking before him with his arms tightly bound and a long rope leading from the man on foot to the one on horseback oh ho thats a runaway rascal i suppose said a farmer who met them on the road  yes sir he bin runaway and i got him fast marser will tan his jacket for him nicely when he gets him you are a trustworthy fellow i imagine continued the farmer oh yes sir marser puts a heap of confidence in dis nigger and the slaves travelled on when the one on foot was fatigued they would change positions the other being tied and driven on foot this they called ride and tie after a journey of more than two hundred miles they reached the ohio river turned the horse loose told him to go home and proceeded on their way to canada however they were not to have it all their own way there are men in the free states and especially in the states adjacent to the slave states who make their living by catching the runaway slave and returning him for the reward that may be offered as the two slaves above mentioned were travelling on towards the land of freedom led by the horth star they were set upon by four of these slavecatchers and one of them unfortunately captured the other escaped the captured fugitive was put under the torture and compelled to reveal the name of his owner and his place of residence filled with delight the kidnappers started back with their victim overjoyed with the prospect of receiving a large reward they gave themselves up on the third night to pleasure they put up at an inn the negro was chained to the bedpost in the same room with his captors at dead of night when all was still the slave arose from the floor upon which he had been lying looked around and saw that the white men were fast asleep the brandy punch had done its work with palpitating heart and trembling limbs he viewed his position the door was fast but the warm weather had compelled them to leave the window open if he could but get bis chains off he might escape through the window to the piazza and reach the ground by one of the posts that supported the piazza the sleepers clothes hung upon chairs by the bedside the slave thought of the padlock key examined the pockets and found it the chains were soon off and the negro stealthily making his way to the window  he stopped and said to himself  these men are villains they are enemies to all who like me are trying to be free then why not i teach them a lesson  he then undressed himself took the clothes of one of the men dressed himself in them and escaped through the window and a moment more he was on the high road to canada fifteen days later and the writer of this gave him a passage across lake erie and saw him safe in her britannic majestys dominions

we have seen clotel sold to mr french in vicksburgh her hair cut short and everything done to make her realise her position as a servant then we have seen her resold because her owners feared she would die through grief as yet her new purchaser treated her with respectful gentleness and sought to win her favour by flattery and presents knowing that whatever he gave her he could take back again but she dreaded every moment lest the scene should change and trembled at the sound of every footfall at every interview with her newmaster clotel stoutly maintained that she had left a husband in virginia and would never think of taking another the gold watch and chain and other glittering presents which he purchased for her were all laid aside by the quadroon as if they were of no value to her in the same house with her was another servant a man who had from time to time hired himself from his master william was his name he could feel for clotel for he like her had been separated from near and dear relatives and often tried to console the poor woman one day the quadroon observed to him that her hair was growing out again yes replied william you look a good deal like a man with your short hair oh rejoined she i have often been told that i would make a better looking man than a woman if i had the money continued she i would bid farewell to this place in a moment more she feared that she had said too much and smilingly remarked  i am always talking nonsense william was a tall fullbodied negro whose very countenance beamed with intelligence being a mechanic he had by his own industry made more than what he paid his owner this he laid aside with the hope that some day he might get enough to purchase his freedom he had in his chest one hundred and fifty dollars his was a heart that felt for others and he had again and again wiped the tears from his eyes as he heard the story of clotel as related by herself  if she can get free with a little money why not give her what i have   thought he and then he resolved to do it an hour after he came into the quadroons room and laid the money in her lap and said  there miss clotel you said if you had the means you would leave this place there is money enough to take you to england where you will be free you are much fairer than many of the white women of the south and can easily pass for a free white lady at first clotel feared that it was a plan by which the negro wished to try her fidelity to her owner but she was soon convinced by his earnest manner and the deep fueling with which he spoke that he was honest  i will take the money only on one condition said she and that is that i effect your escape as well as my own  how can that be done   he inquired  i will assume the disguise of a gentleman and you that of a servant and we will take passage on a steamboat and go to cincinnati and thence to canada here william put in several objections to the plan he feared detection and he well knew that when a slave is once caught when attempting to escape if returned is sure to be worse treated than before however clotel satisfied him that the plan could be carried out if he would only play his part

the resolution was taken the clothes for her disguise procured and before night everything was in readiness for their departure that night mr cooper their master was to attend a party and this was their opportunity william went to the wharf to look out for a boat and had scarcely reached the landing ere he heard the puffing of a steamer he returned and reported the fact clotel had already packed her trunk and had only to dress and all was ready in less than an hour they were on board the boat under the assumed name of  mr johnson clotel went to the clerks officio and took a private state room for herself and paid her own and servants fare besides being attired in a neat suit of black she had a white silk handkerchief tied round her chin as if she was an invalid a pair of green glasses covered her eyes and fearing that she would be talked to too much and thus render her liable to be detected she assumed to be very ill on the other hand william was playing his part well in the servants hall he was talking loudly of his masters wealth nothing appeared as good on the boat as in his masters fine mansion  i dont like dees steamboats no how said william  i hope when marser goes on a journey agin he will take de carriage and an hosses mr johnson for such was the name by which clotel now went remained in his room to avoid as far as possible conversation with others after a passage of seven days they arrived at louisville and put up at goughs hotel here they had to await the departure of another boat for the north they were now in their most critical position they were still in a slave state and john c calhoun a distinguished slaveowner was a guest at this hotel they feared also that trouble would attend their attempt to leave this place for the north as all persons taking negroes with them have to give bail that such negroes are not runaway slaves the law upon this point as very stringent all steamboats and other public conveyances are liable to a fine for every slave that escapes by them besides paying the full value for the slave after a delay of four hours mr johnson and servant took passage on the steamer rodolph for pittsburgh it is usual before the departure of the boats for an officer to examine every part of the vessel to see that no slave secretes himself on board  where are you going asked the officer of william as he was doing his duty on this occasion  i am going with marser was the quick reply who is your master  mr johnson sir a gentleman in the cabin  you must take him to the office and satisfy that captain that all is right or you cant go on this boat william informed his master what the officer had said the boat was on the eve of going and no time could be lost yet they knew not what to do at last they went to the office and mr johnson addressing the captain said  i am informed that my boy cant go with me unless i give security that he belongs to me  yes replied the captain  that is the law  a very strange law indeed rejoined mr johnson that one cant take his property with him after a conversation of some minutes and a plea on the part of johnson that he did not wish to be delayed owing to his illness they were permitted to take their passage without farther trouble and the boat was soon on its way up the river the fugitives had now passed the rubicon and the next place at which they would land would be in a free state clotel called william to her room and said to him  we are now free you can go on your way to canada and i shall go to virginia in search of my daughter the announcement that she was going to risk her liberty in a slave state was unwelcome news to william with all the eloquence he could command he tried to persuade clotel that she could not escape detection and was only throwing her freedom away but she had counted the cost and made up her mind for the worst in return for the money he had furnished she had secured for him his liberty and their engagement was at an end

after a quick passage the fugitives arrived at cincinnati and there separated william proceeded on his way to canada and clotel again resumed her own apparel and prepared to start in search of her child as might have been expected the escape of those two valuable slaves created no little sensation in vicksburgh advertisements and messages were sent in every direction in which the fugitives were thought to have gone it was soon however known that they had left the town as master and servant and many were the communications which appeared in the newspapers in which the writers thought or pretended that they had seen the slaves in their disguise one was to the effect that they bad gone off in a chaise one as master and the other as servant but the most probable was an account given by a correspondent of one of the southern newspapers who happened to be a passenger in the same steamer in which the slaves escaped and which we here giveâ one bright starlight night in the month of december last i found myself in the cabin of the steamer rodolph then lying in the port of vicksburgh and bound to louisville i had gone early on board in order to select a good berth and having got tired of reading the papers amused myself with watching the appearance of the passengers as they dropped in one after another and i being a believer in physiognomy formed my own opinion of their characters

 the second hell rang and as i yawningly returned my watch to my pocket my attention was attracted by the appearance of a young man who entered the cabin supported by his servant a strapping negro

the mm was bundled up in a capacious overcoat his face was bandaged with a white handkerchief and its expression entirely hid by a pair of enormous spectacles

 there was something so mysterious and unusual about the young man as he sat restless in the corner that curiosity led me to observe him more closely

 he appeared anxious to avoid notice and before the steamer had fairly left the wharf requested in a low womanly voice to be shown his berth as he was an invalid and must retire early his name he gave as mr johnson his servant was called and he was put quietly to bed i paced the deck until tybee light grew dim in the distance and then went to my berth

i awoke in the morning with the sun shining in my face we were then just passing st helena it was a mild beautiful morning and most of the passengers were on deck enjoying the freshness of the air and stimulating their appetites for breakfast mr johnson soon made his appearance arrayed as on the night before and took his seat quietly upon the guard of the boat

from the better opportunity afforded by daylight i found that he was a slight built apparently handsome young man with black hair and eyes and of a darkness of complexion that betokened spanish extraction any notice from others seemed painful to him  so to satisfy my curiosity i questioned his servant who was standing near and gained the following information

 his master was an invalid â he had suffered for a long time under a complication of diseases that had baffled the skill of the best physicians in mississippi he was now suffering principally with the  rheumatism and he was scarcely able to walk or help himself in any way he came from vicksburgh and was now on his way to philadelphia at which place resided his uncle a celebrated physician and through whose means he hoped to be restored to perfect health

this information communicated in a bold offhand manner enlisted my sympathies for the sufferer although it occurred to me that he walked rather too gingerly for a person afflicted with so many ailments

after thanking clotel for the great service she had done him in bringing him out of slavery william bade her farewell the prejudice that exists in the free states against coloured persons on account of their color is attributable solely to the influence of slavery and is but another form of slavery itself and even the slave who escapes from the southern plantations is surprised when he reaches the north at the amount and withering influence of this prejudice william applied at the railway station for a ticket for the train going to sandusky and was told that if he went by that train he would have to ride in the luggagevan  why  asked the astonished negro  we dont send a jim crow carriage but once a day and that went this morning the jim crow carriage is the one in which the blacks have to ride slavery is a school in which its victims learn much shrewdness and william had been an apt scholar without asking any more questions the negro took his seat in one of the firstclass carriages he was soon seen and ordered out afraid to remain in the town longer he resolved to go by that train and consequently seated himself on a goods box in the luggagevan the train started at its proper time and all went on well just before arriving at the end of the journey the conductor called on william for his ticket i have none was the reply well then you can pay your fare to me said the officer  how much is it  asked the black man  two dollars  what do you charge those in the passengercarriage  two dollars and do you charge me the same as you do those who ride in the best carriages  asked the negro  yes was the answer  i shant pay it returned the naan  you black scamp do you think you can ride on this road without paying your fare no i dont want to ride for nothing i only want to pay whats right  well launch out two dollars and thats right ho i shant i will pay what i ought and wont pay any more  come come nigger your fare and be done with it said the conductor in a manner that is never used except by americans to blacks i wont pay you two dollars and that enough said william  well as you have come all the way in the luggagevan pay me a dollar and a half and you may go i shant do any such thing dont you mean to pay for riding yes but i wont pay a dollar and a half for riding up here in the freightvan if you had let me come in the carriage where others ride i would have paid you two dollars  where were you raised  you seem to think yourself as good as white folks  i want nothing more than my rights  well give me a dollar and i will let you off no sir i shant do it  what do you mean to do thenâdont you wish to pay anything   yes sir i want to pay you the full price what do you mean by full price   what do you charge per hundred weight for goods inquired the negro with a degree of gravity that would have astonished diogenes himself

 a quarter of a dollar per hundred answered the conductor i weigh just one hundred and fiftypounds returned william  and will pay you threeeighths of a dollar  do you expect that you will pay only thirtyseven cents for your ride this sir is your own price i came in a luggagevan and ill pay for luggage after a vain effort to get the negro to pay more the conductor took the thirtysevcn cents and noted in his cashbook received for one hundred and fifty pounds of luggage thirtyseven cents this reader is no fiction it actually occurred in the railway above described

thomas corwin a member of the american congress is one of the blackest white men in the united states he was once on his way to congress and took passage in one of the ohio river steamers as he came just at the dinner hour he immediately went into the dining saloon and took his seat at the table a gentleman with his whole party of five ladies at once left the table  where is the captain cried the man in an angry tone the captain soon appeared and it was sometime before he could satisfy the old gent that governor corwin was not a nigger the newspapers often have notices of mistakes made by innkeepers and others who undertake to accommodate the public one of which we give below

on the th inst the hon daniel webster and family entered edgartown on a visit for health and recreation arriving at the hotel without alighting from the coach the landlord was sent for to see if suitable accommodation could be had that dignitary appearing and surveying hr webster while the hon senator addressed him seemed woefully to mistake the dark features of the traveller as he sat back in the corner of the carriage and to suppose him a coloured man particularly as there were two coloured servants of mr w outside so he promptly declared that there was no room for him and his family and he could not be accommodated thereâat the same time suggesting that he might perhaps find accommodation at some of the huts up back to which he pointed so deeply did the prejudice of looks possess him that he appeared not to notice that the stranger introduced himself to him as daniel webster or to be so ignorant as not to have heard of such a personage and turning away he expressed to the driver his astonishment that he should bring hack people there for him to take in it was not till he had been repeatedly assured and made to understand that the said daniel webster was a real live senator of the united states that he perceived his awkward mistake and the distinguished honour which he and his house were so near missing

in most of the free states the coloured people are disfranchised on account of their colour the following scene which we take from a newspaper in the state of ohio will give some idea of the extent to which this prejudice is carried

the whole of thursday last was occupied by the court of common fleas for this county in trying to find out whether one thomas west was of the voting coloun as some had very constitutional doubts as to whether his colour was orthodox and whether his hair was of the official crisp was it not a dignified business four profound judges four acute lawyers twelve grave jurors and i dont know how many venerable witnesses making in all about thirty men perhaps all engaged in the profound laborious and illustrious business of finding out whether a man who pays tax works on the road and is an industrious farmer has been born according to the republican christian constitution of ohio â so that he can vote and they wisely gravely and judgmaticlly decided that he should not vote what wisdom â what research it must have required to evolve this truth  it was left for the court of common pleas for columbian county ohio in the uuited states of north america to find out what solomon never dreamed ofâthe courts of all civilised heathen or jewish countries never contemplated lest the wisdom of our courts should be circumvented by some such men as might be named who are so near being bom constitutionally that they might be taken for white by sight i would suggest that our court be invested with smelling powers and that if a man dont exhale the constitutional smell he shall not vote this would be an additional security to our liberties

william found after all that liberty in the socalled free states was more a name than a reality that prejudice followed the coloured man into every place that he might enter the temples erected for the worship of the living god are no exception the finest baptist church in the city of boston has the following paragraph in the deed that conveys its scats to pewholders and it is a further condition of these presents that if the owner or owners of said pew shall determine hereafter to sell the same it shall first be offered in writing to the standing committee of said society for the time being at such price as might otherwise be obtained for it and the said commilter shall have the right for ten days after such offer to purchase said pew for said society at that price first deducting therefrom all taxes and assessments on said pew then remaining unpaid and if the said committee shall not so complete such purchase within said ten days then the pew may be sold by the owner or owners thereof after payment of all such arrears to anyone respectable white person but upon the same conditions as are contained in this instrument and immediate notice of such sale shall be given in writing by the vendor to the treasurer of said society

such are the conditions upon which the rowe street baptist church boston disposes of its seats the writer of this is able to put that whole congregation minister and all to flight by merely patting his coloured face in that church we once visited a church in new york that had a place set apart for the sons of ham it was a dark dismal looking place in one corner of the gallery grated in front like a hencoop with a black border around it it had two doors over one was b mâblack men over the other b wâblack women

educated in a free state and marrying a wife who had been a victim to the institution of slavery henry morton became strongly opposed to the system l his two daughters at the age of twelve years were sent to the north to finish their education and to receive that refinement that young ladies cannot obtain in the slave states although he did not publicly advocate the abolition of slavery he often made himself obnoxious to private circles owing to the denunciatory manner in which he condemned the peculiar institution being one evening at a party and hearing one of the company talking loudly of the glory and freedom of american institutions he gave it as his opinion that unless slavery was speedily abolished it would be the ruin of the union  it is not our boast of freedom said he  that will cause us to be respected abroad it is not our loud talk in favour of liberty that will cause us to be regarded as friends of human freedom but our acts will be scrutinised by the people of other countries we say much against european despotism  let us look to ourselves that government is despotic where the rulers govern subjects by their own mere willâby decrees and laws emanating from their uncontrolled will in the enactment and execution of which the ruled have no voice and tinder which they have no right except at the will of the rulers despotism does not depend upon the number of the rulers or the number of the subjects it may have one ruler or many rome was a despotism under nero so she was under the triumvirate athens was a despotism under thirty tyrants tinder her four hundred tyrants under her three thousand tyrants it has been generally observed that despotism increases in severity with the number of despots the responsibility is more divided and the claims more numerous the triumvirs each demanded his victims the smaller the number of subjects in proportion to the tyrants the more cruel the oppression because the less danger from rebellion in this government the free white citizens are the rulersâthe sovereigns as we delight to be called all others are subjects there are perhaps some sixteen or seventeen millions of sovereigns and four millions of subjects

the rulers and the ruled are of all colours from the clear white of the caucasian tribes to the swarthy ethiopian the former by courtesy are all called white the latter black in this government the subject has no rights social political or personal he has no voice in the laws which govern him he can hold no property his very wife and children are not his his labour is anothers he and all that appertain to him are the absolute property of his rulers he is governed bought sold punished executed by laws to which he never gave his assent and by rulers whom he never chose he is not a serf merely with half the rights of men like the subjects of despotic russia but a native slave stripped of every right which god and nature gave him and which the high spirit of our revolution declared inalienableâwhich he himself could not surrender and which man could not take from him is he not then the subject of despotic sway 

the slaves of athens and rome were free in comparison they had some rightsâcould acquire some property could choose their own masters and purchase their own freedom and when free could rise in social and political life the slaves of america then lie under the most absolute and grinding despotism that the world ever saw but who are the despots the rulers of the country â the sovereign people  not merely the slaveholder who cracks the lash he is but the instrument in tho hands of despotism that despotism is the government of the slave states and the united states consisting of all its rulersâall the free citizens do not look upon this as a paradox because you and i and the sixteen millions of rulers are free the rulers of every despotism arc free nicholas of russia is free the grand sultan of turkey is free the butcher of austria is free augustus anthony and lepidus were free while they drenched rome in blood the thirty tyrantsâthe four hundred âthe three thousand were free while they bound their countrymen in chains you and i and the sixteen millions are free while we fasten iron chains and rivet manacles on four millions of our fellowmenâ tear their wives and children from them â separate themâsell them and doom them to perpetual eternal bondage are we not then despotsâ despots such as history will brand and god abhor

 we as individuals are fast losing our reputation for honest dealing our nation is losing its character the loss of a firm national character or the degradation of a nations honour is the inevitable prelude to her destruction behold the once proud fabric of a roman empire â an empire carrying its arts and arms into every part of the eastern continent the monarchs of mighty kingdoms dragged at the wheels of her triumphal chariots her eagle waving over the ruins of desolated countriesâwhere is her splendour her wealth her power her glory extinguished for ever her mouldering temples the mournful vestiges of her former grandeur afford a shelter to her muttering monks where are her statesmen her sages her philosophers her orators generals  go to their solitary tombs and inquire  she lost her national character and her destruction followed the ramparts of her national pride were broken down and vandalism desolated her classic fields then let the people of our country take warning ere it is too late but most of us say to our selves  who questions the right of mankind to he free

yet what are the rights of the negro to me

im well fed and clothed i have plenty of pelfâ ill care for the blacks when i turn black myself  new orleans is doubtless the most immoral place in the united states the theatres are open on the sabbath bullfights horseracing and other cruel amusements are carried on in this city to an extent unknown in any other part of the union the most stringent laws have been passed in that city against negroes yet a few years since the state legislature passed a special act to enable a white man to marry a coloured woman on account of her being possessed of a large fortune and very recently the following paragraph appeared in the city papersâ  there has been quite a stir recently in this city in consequence of a marriage of a white man named buddington a teller in the cana bank to the negro daughter of one of the wealthiest merchants buddington before he could be married was obliged to swear that he had negro blood in his veins and to do this he made an incision in his arm and put some of her blood in the cut the ceremony was performed by a catholic clergyman and the bridegroom has received with his wife a fortune of fifty or sixty thousand dollars  it seems that the fifty or sixty thousand dollars entirely covered the negro womans black skin and the law prohibiting marriage between blacks and whites was laid aside for the occasion

althesa felt proud as well she might at her husbands taking such high ground in a slaveholding city like new orleans

the christians death

o weep ye friends of freedom weep 

your harps to mournful measures sweep

ok the last day of november o on the confines of the grand bank of newfoundland lo we behold one little solitary tempesttost and weatherbeaten ship it is all that can be seen on the length and breadth of the vast intervening solitudes from the melancholy wilds of labrador and new englands ironbound shores to the western coasts of ireland and the rockdefended hebrides but one lonely ship greets the eye of angels or of men on this great thoroughfare of nations in our age next in moral grandeur was this ship to the great discoverers columbus found a continent the mayflower brought the seedwheat of states and empire that is the mayflower with its servants of the living god their wives and little ones hastening to lay the foundations of nations in the occidental lands of the settingsun hear the voice of prayer to god for his protection and the glorious music of praise as it breaks into the wild tempest of the mighty deep upon the ear of god hero in this ship are great and good men justice mercy humanity respect for the rights of all each man honoured as he was useful to himself and others labour respected lawabiding men constitutionmaking and respecting men  men whom no tyrant could conquer or hardship overcome with the high commission sealed by a spirit divine to establish religious and political liberty for all this ship had the embryo elements of all that is useful great and grand in northern institutions it was the great type of goodness and wisdom illustrated in two and a quarter centuries gone by  it was the good genius of america

but look far in the southeast and you behold on the same day in o a low rakish ship hastening from the tropics solitary and alone to the new world what is she  she is freighted with the elements of unmixed evil hark hear those rattling chains hear that cry of despair and wail of anguish as they die away in the unpitying distance listen to those shocking oaths the crack of that fleshcutting whip ah  it is the first cargo of slaves on their way to jamestown virginia behold the mayflower anchored at plymouth rock the slaveship in james river each a parent one of the prosperous labourhonouring lawsustaining institutions of the north the other the mother of slavery idleness lynchlaw ignorance unpaid labour poverty and duelling despotism the ceaseless swing of the whip and the peculiar institutions of the south these ships are the representation of good and evil in the new world even to our day when shall one of those parallel lines come to an end 

the origin of american slavery is not lost in the obscurity of bygone ages it is a plain historical fact that it owes its birth to the african slave trade now pronounced by every civilised community the greatest crime ever perpetrated against humanity of all causes intended to benefit mankind the abolition of chattel slavery must necessarily be placed amongst the first and the negro hails with joy every new advocate that appears in his cause commiseration for human buffering and human sacrifices awakened the capacious mind and brought into action the enlarged benevolence of georgiana carlton with respect to her philosophy â it was of a noble cast it was that all men are by nature equal that they are wisely and justly endowed by the creator with certain rights which are irrefragable and that however human pride and human avarice may depress and debase still god is the author of good to man â and of evil man is the artificer to himself and to his species unlike plato and socrates her mind was free from the gloom that surrounded theirs her philosophy was founded in the school of christianity though a devoted member of her fathers church she was not a sectarian

we learn from scripture and it is a little remarkable that it is the only exact definition of religion found in the sacred volume that pure religion and undefiled before god even the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others remember them that are in bonds as bound with them whatsoever ye would that others should do to you do ye even so to them

this was her view of christianity and to this end she laboured with all her energies to convince her slaveholding neighbours that the negro could not only take care of himself but that he also appreciated liberty and was willing to work and redeem himself her most sanguine wishes were being realized when she suddenly fell into a decline her mother had died of consumption and her physician pronounced this to be her disease she was prepared for this sad intelligence and received it with the utmost composure although she had confidence in her husband that he would carry out her wishes in freeing the negroes after her death mrs carlton resolved upon their immediate liberation consequently the slaves were all summoned before the noble woman and informed that they were no longer bondsmen from this hour said she you are free and all eyes will be fixed upon you i dare not predict how far your example may affect the welfare of your brethren yet in bondage if you are temperate industrious peaceable and pious you will show to the world that slaves can be emancipated without danger remember what a singular relation you sustain to society the necessities of the case require not only that you should behave as well as the whites but better than the whites and for this reason if you behave no better than they your example will lose a great portion of its influence make the lord jesus christ your refuge and exemplar his is the only standard around which you can successfully rally if ever there was a people who needed the consolations of religion to sustain them in their grievous afflictions you are that people you had better trust in the lord than to put confidence in man happy is that people whose god is the lord get as much education as possible for yourselves and your children an ignorant people can never occupy any other than a degraded station in society they can never be truly free until they are intelligent in a few days you will start for the state of ohio where land will be purchased for some of you who have families and where i hope you will all prosper we have been urged to send you to liberia but we think it wrong to send you from your native land we did not wish to encourage the colonization society for it originated in hatred of the free coloured people its pretences are false its doctrines odious its means contemptible now whatever may be your situation in life  remember those in bonds as bound with them you must get ready as soon as you can for your journey to the north

seldom was there ever witnessed a more touching scene than this there sat the liberatorâpale feeble emaciated with death stamped upon her countenance surrounded by the sons and daughters of africa some of whom had in former years been separated from all that they had held near and dear and the most of whoso backs had been torn and gashed by the negro whip some were upon their knees at the feet of their benefactress others were standing round her weeping many begged that they might be permitted to remain on the farm and work for wages for some had wives and some husbands on other plantations in the neighbourhood and would rather remain with them

but the laws of the state forbade any emancipated negroes remaining under penalty of again being sold into slavery hence the necessity of sending them out of the state mrs carlton was urged by her friends to send the emancipated negroes to africa extracts from the speeches of henry clay and other distinguished colonization society men were read to her to induce her to adopt this course some thought they should be sent away because the blacks are vicious others because they would be missionaries to their brethren in africa but said she if we send away the negroes because they are profligate and vicious what sort of missionaries will they make  why not send away the vicious among the whites for the same reason and the same purpose

heath is a leveller and neither age sex wealth nor usefulness can avert when he is permitted to strike the most beautiful flowers soon fade and droop and die this is also the case with man his days are uncertain as the passing breeze this hour he glows in the blush of health and vigour but the next he may be counted with the number no more known on earth

although in a low state of health mrs carlton had the pleasure of seeing all her slaves except sam and three others start for a land of freedom the morning they were to go on board the steamer bound for louisville they all assembled on the large grass plot in front of the drawingroom window and wept while they bid their mistress farewell when they were on the boat about leaving the wharf they were heard giving the charge to those on shore â  sam take care of misus take care of marser as you love us and hope to meet us in de hio ohio and in heben  be sure and take good care of misus and marser

in less than a week after her emancipated people had started for ohio mrs carlton was cold in death mr carlton felt deeply as all husbands must who love their wives the loss of her who had been a lamp to his feet and a light to his path she had converted him from infidelity to christianity from the mere theory of liberty to practical freedom he had looked upon the negro as an illtreated distant link of the human family he now regarded them as a part of gods children oh what a silence pervaded the house when the christian had been removed his indeed was a lonesome position

twas midnight and he sat alone â the husband of the dead that day the dark dust had been thrown upon the buried head

in the midst of the buoyancy of youth this cherished one had drooped and died deep were the sounds of grief and mourning heard in that stately dwelling when the stricken friends whose office it had been to nurse and soothe the weary sufferer beheld her pale and motionless in the sleep of death

oh what a chill creeps through the breaking heart when we look upon the insensible form and feel that it no longer contains the spirit we so dearly loved  how difficult to realise that the eye which always glowed with affection and intelligence â that the ear which had so often listened to the sounds of sorrow and gladness â that the voice whose accents had been to us like sweet music and the heart the habitation of benevolence and truth are now powerless and insensate as the bier upon which the form rests though faith be strong enough to penetrate the cloud of gloom which hovers near and to behold the freed spirit safe for ever safe in its home in heaven yet the thoughts will linger sadly and cheerlessly upon the grave

peace to her ashes she fought the fight obtained the christians victory and wears the crown but if it were that departed spirits are permitted to note the occurrences of this world with what a frown of disapprobation would hers view the effort being made in the united states to retard the work of emancipation for which she laboured and so wished to see brought about

in what light would she consider that hypocritical priesthood who gave their aid and sanction to the infamous  fugitive slave law if true greatness consists in doing good to mankind then was georgiana carlton an ornament to human nature who can think of the broken hearts made whole of sad and dejected countenances now beaming with contentment and joy of the mother offering her freeborn babe to heaven and of the father whose cup of joy seems overflowing in the presence of his family where none can molest or make him afraid oh that god may give more such persons to take the whipscarred negro by the hand and raise him to a level with our common humanity may the professed lovers of freedom in the new world see that true liberty is freedom for all and may every american continually hear it sounding in his ear â shall every flap of englands flag proclaim that all around are free from  farthest ind  to each blue crag that beetles oer the western sea

and shall we scoff at europes kings when freedoms fire is dim with us

and round our countrys altar clings the damning shade of slaverys curse 

we shall now return to cincinnati where we left clotel preparing to go to richmond in search of her daughter tired of the disguise in which she bad escaped she threw it off on her arrival at cincinnati but being assured that not a shadow of safety would attend her visit to a city in which she was well known unless in some disguise she again resumed mens apparel on leaving cincinnati this time she had more the appearance of an italian or spanish gentleman in addition to the fine suit of black cloth a splendid pair of dark false whiskers covered the sides of her lace while the curling moustache found its place upon the upper lip from practice she had become accustomed to highheeled boots and could walk without creating any suspicion as regarded her sex it was on a cold evening that clotel arrived at wheeling and took a scat in the coach going to richmond she was already in the state of virginia yet a long distance from the place of her destination

a ride in a stagecoach over an american road is unpleasant under the most favourable circumstances but now that it was winter and the roads unusually bad the journey was still more dreary however there were eight passengers in the coach and i need scarcely say that such a number of genuine americans could not he together without whiling away the time somewhat pleasantly besides clotel there was an elderly gentleman with his two daughtersâone apparently under twenty years the other a shade above the pale spectacled face of another slim tall man with a white neckerchief pointed him out as a minister the rough featured dark countenance of a stout looking man with a white hat on one side of his head told that he was from the sunny south there was nothing remarkable about the other two who might pass for ordinary american gentlemen it was on the eve of a presidential election when every man is thought to be a politician clay van buren and harrison were the men who expected the indorsement of the baltimore convention  who does this town go for asked the old gent with the ladies as the coach drove up to an inn where groups of persons were waiting for the latest papers  we are divided cried the rough voice of one of the outsiders  well who do you think will get the majority here   continued the old gent  cant tell very well i go for  old tip  was the answer from without this brought up the subject fairly before the passengers and when the coach again started a general discussion commenced in which all took a part except clotel and the young ladies some were for clay some for van euren and others for old tip the coach stopped to take in a real farmerlooking man who no sooner entered than he was saluted with do you go for clay no was the answer do you go for van buren no well then of course you will go for harrison no why dont you mean to work for any of them at the election    no  well who will you work for asked one of the company i work for betsy and the children and i have a hard job of it at that replied the farmer without a smile this answer as a matter of course set the new comer down as one upon whom the rest of the passengers could crack their jokes with the utmost impunity are you an odd fellow asked one  no sir ive been married more than a month  i mean do you belong to the order of odd fellows no no i belong to the order of married men are you a mason  no iam a carpenter by trade are you a son of temperance bother you no i am a son of mr john gosling after a hearty laugh in which all joined the subject of temperance became the theme for discussion in this the spectacled gent was at home he soon showed that he was a new englander and went the whole length of the maine law the minister was about having it all his own way when the southerner in the white hat took the opposite side of the question  i dont bet a red cent on these teetotlars said he and at the same time looking round to see if he had the approbation of the rest of the company  why asked the minister because they are a set who are afraid to spend a cent they are a bad lot the whole on em it was evident that the white hat gent was an uneducated man the minister commenced in full earnest and gave an interesting account of the progress of temperance in connecticut the state from which he came proving that a great portion of the prosperity of the state was attributable to the disuse of intoxicating drinks every one thought the white hat had got the worst of the argument and that he was settled for the remainder of the night but not he he took fresh courage and began again  now said he  i have just been on a visit to my uncles in vermont and i guess i knows a little about these here teetotlars you see i went up there to make a little stay of a fortnight i got there at night and they seemed glad to see tme but they didnt give me a bit of anything to drink well thinks i to myself the jigs up i shant get any more liquor till i get out of the state we all sat up till twelve oclock that night and i heard nothing but talk about the juvinal temperance army the  band of hope the  rising generation the female dorcas temperance society  the none such and i dont know how many other names they didnt have as i had taken several pretty large  cock tails  before i entered the state i thought upon the whole that i would not spile for the want of liquor the next morning i commenced writing back to my friends and telling them whats what aunt polly said well johnny i spose you are given em a pretty account of us all here  yes said i i am tellin em if they want anything to drink when they come up here they had better bring it with em oh said aunty they would search their boxes cant bring any spirits in the state well as i was saying just as i got my letters finished and was going to the post office lor uncles house was two miles from the town aunty says johnny i spose youll try to get a little somthin to drink in town wont you says i  i spose its no use  no said she  you cant it aint to be had no how for love nor money so jist as i was puttin on my hat johnny cries out aunty  what says i  now ill tell you i dont want you to say nothin about it but i keeps a little rum to rub my head with for i am troubled with the headache now i dont want you to mention it for the world but ill give you a little taste the old man is such a teetotaller that i should never hear the last of it and i would not like for the boys to know it they are members of the  cold water army aunty now brought out a black bottle and gave me a cup and told me to help myself which i assure you i did i now felt ready to face the cold as i was passing the barn i heard uncle thrashing oats so i went to the door and spoke to him  come in john says he no said i i am goin to post some letters for i was afraid that he would smell ray breath if i went too near to him yes yes come in so i went in and says he its now eleven oclock thats about the time you take your grog i spose when you are at home  yes said i i am sorry for you my lad you cant get anything up here you cant even get it at the chemists except as medicine and then you must let them mix it and you take it in their presence  this is indeed hard replied i  well it cant be helped continued he and it ought not to be if it could its best for society peoples better off without drink i recollect when your father and i thirty years ago used to go out on a spree and spend more than half a dollar in a night then heres the rising generation  theres nothing like settin a good example look how healthy your cousins areâtheres benjamin he never tasted spirits in his life oh john i would you were a teetotaller  i suppose said i ill have to be one till i leave the state now said he john i dont want you to mention it for your aunt would go into hysterics if she thought there was a drop of intoxicating liquor about the place and i would not have the boys to know it for anything but i keep a little brandy to rub my joints for the rheumatics and being its you ill give you a little dust so the old man went to one corner of the barn took out a brown jug and handed it to me and i must say it was a little the best cogniac that i had tasted for many a day says i  uncle you are a good judge of brandy yes said he  i learned when i was young so off i started for the post office in returnin i thought id jist go through the woods where the boys were chopping wood and wait and go to the house with them when they went to dinner i found them hard at work but as merry as crickets well cousin john are you done writing  yes answered i have you posted them yes  hope you didnt go to any place inquiring for grog  no i knowed it was no good to do that  i suppose a cocktail would taste good now well i guess it would says i the three boys then joined in a hearty laugh  i suppose you have told em that we are a dry set up here   well  aint told era anything else  now cousin john said edward if you wont say anything we will give you a small taste for mercys sake dont let father or mother know it they are such rabid teetotallers that they would not sleep a wink tonight if they thought there was any spirits about the place  i am mum says i and the boys took a jug out of a hollow stump and gave me some firstrate peach brandy and during the fortnight that i was in vermont with my teetotal relations i was kept about as well corned as if i had been among my hot water friends in tennessee

this narrative given by the white hat man was received with unbounded applause by all except the pale gent in spectacles who showed by the way in which he was running his fingers between his cravat and throat that he did not intend to give it up so the white hat gent was now the lion of the company

 oh you did not get hold of the right kind of teetotallers said the minister  i can give you a tale worth a dozen of yours continued he  look at society in the states where temperance views prevail and you will there see real happiness the people are taxed less the poor houses are shut up for want of occupants and extreme destitution is unknown every one who drinks at all is liable to become an habitual drunkard yes i say boldly that no man living who uses intoxicating drinks is free from the danger of at least occasional and if of occasional ultimately of habitual excess there seems to be no character position or circumstances that free men from the danger i have known many young men of the finest promise led by the drinking habit into vice ruin and early death i have known many tradesmen whom it has made bankrupt i have known sunday scholars whom it has led to prisonâteachers and even superintendents whom it has dragged down to profligacy i have known ministers of high academic honours of splendid eloquence nay of vast usefulness whom it has fascinated and hurried over the precipice of public infamy with their eyes open and gazing with horror on their fate i have known men of the strongest and clearest intellect and of vigorous resolution whom it has made weaker than children and foolsâgentlemen of refinement and taste whom it has debased into brutesâpoets of high genius whom it has bound in a bondage worse than the galleys and ultimately cut short their days i have known statesmen lawyers and judges whom it has killedâkind husbands and lathers whom it has turned into monsters i have known honest men whom it has made villainsâelegant and christian ladies whom it has converted into bloated sots

but you talk too fust replied the white hat man you dont give a feller a chance to say nothin i heard you continued the minister and now you hear me out it is indeed wonderful how people become lovers of strong drink some years since before i became a teetotaller i kept spirits about the house and i had a servant who was much addicted to strong drink he used to say that he could not make my boots shine without mixing the blacking with whiskey so to satisfy myself that the whiskey was put in the blacking one morning i made him bring the dish in which he kept the blacking and poured in the whiskey myself and now sir what do you think   why i spose your boots shined better than before replied the white hat no continued the minister he took the blacking out and i watched him and he drank down the whiskey blacking and all

this turned the joke upon the advocate of strong drink and he began to put his wits to work for arguments you are from connecticut are you   asked the southerner yes and we are an orderly pious peaceable people our holy religion is respected and we do more for the cause of christ than the whole southern states put together  i dont doubt it said the white hat gent you sell wooden nutmegs and other spurious articles enough to do some good you talk of your  holy religion   but your robes righteousness are woven at lowell and manchester your paradise is high per centum on factory stocks your palms of victory and crowns of rejoicing are triumphs over a rival party in politics on the questions of banks and tariffs if you could you would turn heaven into birmingham make every angel a weaver and with the eternal din of looms and spindles drown all the anthems of the morning stars ah i know you connecticut people like a book no no all hoss you cant come it on me this last speech of the rough featured man again put him in the ascendant and the spectacled gent once more ran his fingers between his cravat and throat you live in tennessee i think aid the minister  yes replied the southerner  i used to live in orleans but now i claim to be a tennessean  your people of new orleans are the most ungodly set in the united states said the minister taking a new orleans newspaper from his pocket he continued  just look here there are not less than three advertisements of bull fights to take place on the sabbath you people of the slave states have no regard for the sabbath religion morality or anything else intended to make mankind better here clotel could have borne ample testimony had she dared to have taken sides with the connecticut man her residence in vicksburgh had given her an opportunity of knowing something of the character of the inhabitants of the far south  here is an account of a grand bull fight that took place in new orleans a week ago last sunday i will read it to you and the minister read aloud the following  yesterday pursuant to public notice came off at gretna opposite the fourth districtthe long heralded fight between the famous grizzly bear general jackson victor in fifty battles and the attakapas bull santa anna

 the fame of the coming conflict had gone forth to the four winds and women and children old men and hoys from all parts of the city and from the breezy banks of lake pontchartrain and borgne brushed up their sunday suit and prepared to see the fun long before the published hour the quiet streets of the rural gretna were filled with crowds of anxious denizens flocking to the arena and before the fight commenced such a crowd had collected as gretna had not seen nor will be likely to see again

 the arena for the sports was a cage twenty feet square built upon the ground and constructed of heavy timbers and iron bars around it were seats circularly placed and intended to accommodate many thousands about four or five thousand persons assembled covering the seats as with a cloud and crowding down around the cage were within reach of the bars

 the bull selected to sustain the honour and verify the pluck of attakapas on this trying occasion was a black animal from the opelousas lithe and sinewy as a four year old courser and with eyes like burning coals his horns bore the appearance of having been filed at the tips and wanted that keen and slashing appearance so common with others of his kith and kin otherwise it would have been  all day with bruin at the first puss and no mistake

 the bear was an animal of note and called general jackson from the fact of his licking up everything that came in his way and taking the responsibility on all occasions he was a wicked looking beast very lean and unamiable in aspect with hair all standing the wrong way he had fought some fifty bulls so they said always coming out victorious hut that either one of the fifty had been an attakapas bull the bills of the performances did not say had he tackled attakapas first it is likely his fifty battles would have remained un fought

about half past four oclock the performances commenced

 the bull was first seen standing in the cage alone with head erect and looking a very monarch in his capacity at an appointed signal a cage containing the bear was placed alongside the arena and an opening being made bruin stalked into the battle ground â not however without sundry stirrings up with a ten foot pole he being experienced in such matters and backwards in raising a row

 once on the battlefield both animals stood like wary champions eyeing each other the hear cowering low with head upturned and fangs exposed while attakapas stood wondering with his eye dilated lashing hie sides with his long and bushy tail and pawing up the earth in very wrath

 the bear seemed little inclined to begin the attack and the bull standing a moment made steps first backward and then forward as if measuring his antagonist and meditating where to plant a blow bruin wouldnt come to the scratch no way till one of the keepers with an iron rod tickled his ribs and made him move seeing this attakapas took it as a hostile demonstration and gathering his strength dashed savagely at the enemy catching him on the points of his horns and doubling him up like a sack of bran against the bars bruin sung out at this and made a dash for his opponents nose

 missing this the bull turned to the about face and the bear caught him by the ham inflicting a ghastly wound but attakapas with a kick shook him off and renewing the attack went at him again head on and with a rush this time he was not so fortunate for the bear caught him above the eye burying his fangs in the tough hide and holding him as in a vice it was now the bulls turn to sing out and he did it bellowing forth with a voice more hideous than that of all the bulls of bashan some minutes stood matters thus and the cries of the hull mingled with the hoarse growls of the bear made hideous music fit only for a dance of devils then came a pause the hear having relinquished his hold and for a few minutes it was doubtful whether the fun was not up but the magic wand of the keeper the ten foot pole again stirred up bruin and at it they went and with a rush

 bruin now tried to fasten on the bulls back and drove his tusks in him in several places making the red blood flow like wine from the vats of luna but attakapas was pluck to the back bone and catching bruin on the tips of his horns shuffled him up right merrily making the fur fly like feathers in a gale of wind bruin cried  nutff in bear language but the bull followed up his advantage and making one furious plunge full at the figure head of the enemy struck a horn into his eye burying it there and dashing the tender organ into darkness and atoms blood followed the blow and poor bruin blinded bleeding and in mortal agony turned with a howl to leave but attakapas caught him in the retreat and rolled him over like a ball over and over again this rolling over was enacted and finally after more than an hour bruin curled himself up on his back bruised bloody and dead beat the thing was up with california and attakapas was declared the victor amidst the applause of the multitude that made the heavens ring

 there said he can you find anything against connecticut equal to that   the southerner had to admit that he was beat by the yankee during all this time it must not be supposed that the old gent with the two daughters and even the young ladies themselves had been silent clotel and they had not only given their opinions as regarded the merits of the discussion but that sly glance of the eye which is ever given where the young of both sexes meet bad been freely at work the american ladies are rather partial to foreigners and clotel had the appearance of a fine italian the old gentleman was now near his home and a whisper from the eldest daughter who was unmarried but marriageable induced him to extend to  mr johnson  an invitation to stop and spend a week with the young ladies at their family residence clotel excused herself upon various grounds and at last to cut short the matter promised that she would pay them a visit on her return the arrival of the coach at lynchburgh separated the young ladies from the italian gent and the coach again resumed its journey

during certain seasons of the year all tropical climates are subject to epidemics of a most destructive nature the inhabitants of new orleans look with as much certainty for the appearance of the yellowfever smallpox or cholera in the hotseason as the londoner does for fog in the month of november in the summer of  the people of new orleans were visited with one of these epidemics it appeared in a form unusually repulsive and deadly it seized persons who were in health without any premonition sometimes death was the immediate consequence the disorder began in the brain by an oppressive pain accompanied or followed by fever the patient was devoured with burning thirst the stomach distracted by pains in vain sought relief in efforts to disburden itself fiery veins streaked the eye the face was inflamed and dyed of a dark dull red colour the ears from time to time rang painfully now mucous secretions surcharged the tongue and took away the power of speech now the sick one spoke but in speaking had a foresight of death when the violence of the disease approached the heart the gums were blackened the sleep broken troubled by convulsions or by frightful visions was worse than the waking hours and when the reason sank under a delirium which had its seat in the brain repose utterly forsook the patients couch the progress of the heat within was marked by yellowish spots which spread over the surface of the body if then a happy crisis came not all hope was gone soon the breath infected the air with a fetid odour the lips wore glazed despair painted itself in the eyes and sobs with long intervals of silence formed the only language from each side of the mouth spread loam tinged with black and burnt blood flue streaks mingled with the yellow all over the frame all remedies were useless this was the yellow fever the disorder spread alarm and confusion throughout the city on an average more than oo died daily in the midst of disorder and confusion death heaped victims on victims friend followed friend in quick succession the sick were avoided from the fear of contagion and for the same reason the dead were left unburied nearly ooo dead bodies lay uncovered in the burialground with only here and there a little lime thrownover them to prevent the air becoming infected

the negro whose home is in a hot climate was not proof against the disease many plantations had to suspend their work for want of slaves to take the places of those carried off by the fever henry morton and wife were among the thirteen thousand swept away by the raging disorder that year like too many morton had been dealing extensively in lands and stocks and though apparently in good circumstances was in reality deeply involved in debt althesa although as white as most white women in a southern clime was as we already know born a slave by the laws of all the southern states the children follow the condition of the mother if the mother is free the children are free if a slave they are slaves morton was unacquainted with the laws of the land and although he had married althesa it was a marriage which the law did not recognise and therefore she whom he thought to be his wife was in fact nothing more than his slave what would have been his feelings had he known this and also known that his two daughters ellen and jane were his slaves yet such was the fact after the disappearance of the disease with which henry morton had so suddenly been removed his brother went to new orleans to give what aid he could in settling up the affairs james morton on his arrival in new orleans felt proud of his nieces and promised them a home with his own family in vermont little dreaming that his brother had married a slave woman and that his nieces were slaves the girls themselves had never heard that their mother had been a slave and therefore knew nothing of the danger hanging over their heads an inventory of the property was made out by james morton and placed in the hands of the creditors and the young ladies with their uncle were about leaving the city to reside for a few days on the banks of lake ponchetain where they could enjoy a fresh air that the city could not afford but just as they were about taking the train an officer arrested the whole party the young ladies as slaves and the uncle upon the charge of attempting to conceal the property of his deceased brother morton was overwhelmed with horror at the idea of his nieces being claimed as slaves and asked for time that he might save them from such a fate he even offered to mortgage his little farm in vermont for the amount which young slave women of their ages would fetch but the creditors pleaded that they were an extra article and would sell for more than common slaves and must therefore be sold at auction

they were given up but neither ate nor slept nor separated from leach other till they were taken into the new orleans slave market where they were offered to the highest bidder there they stood trembling blushing and weeping compelled to listen to the grossest language and shrinking from the rude hands that examined the graceful proportions of their beautiful frames

after a fierce contest between the bidders the young ladies were sold one for oo dollars and the other for ooo dollars ave need not add that had those young girls been sold for mere house servants or field hands they would not have brought one half the sums they did the fact that they were the granddaughters of thomas jefferson no doubt increased their value in the market here were two of the softer sex accustomed to the fondest indulgence surrounded by all the refinements of life and with all the timidity that such a life could produce bartered away like cattle in smithfield market ellen the eldest was sold to an old gentleman who purchased her as he said for a housekeeper the girl was taken to his residence nine miles from the city she soon however knew for what purpose she had been bought and an educated and cultivated mind and taste which made her see and understand how great was her degradation now armed her hand with the ready means of death the morning after her arrival she was found in her chamber a corpse she had taken poison jane was purchased by a dashing young man who had just come into the possession of a large fortune the very appearance of the young southerner pointed him out as an unprincipled profligate  and the young girl needed no one to tell her of her impending doom the young maid of fifteen wa immediately removed to his country seat near the junction of the mississippi river with the sea this was a most singular spot remote in a dense forest spreading over the summit of a cliff that rose abruptly to a great height above the sea but so grand in its situation in the desolate sublimity which reigned around in the reverential murmur of the waves that washed its base that though picturesque it was a forest prison here the young lady saw no one except an old negress who acted as her servant the smiles with which the young man met her were indignantly spurned but she was the property of another and could hope for justice and mercy only through him

jane though only in her fifteenth year had become strongly attached to volney lapuc a young frenchman a student in her fathers office the poverty of the young man and the youthful age of the girl had caused their feelings to be kept from the young ladys parents at the death of his master volney had returned to his widowed mother at mobile and knew nothing of the misfortune that had befallen his mistress until he received a letter from her but how could he ever obtain a sight of her even if he wished locked up as she was in her masters mansion after several days of what her master termed  obstinacy on her part the young girl was placed in an upper chamber and told that that would be her home until she should yield to her masters wishes there she remained more than a fortnight and with the exception of a daily visit from her master she saw no one but the old negress who waited upon her one bright moonlight evening as she was seated at the window she perceived the figure of a man beneath her window at first she thought it was her master but the tall figure of the stranger soon convinced her that it was another yes it was volney  he had no sooner received her letter than he set out for new orleans and finding on his arrival there that his mistress had been taken away resolved to follow her there he was but how could she communicate with him  she dared not trust the old negress with her secret for fear that it might reach her master jane wrote a hasty note and threw it out of the window which was eagerly picked up by the young man and he soon disappeared in the woods night passed away in dreariness to her and the next morning she viewed the spot beneath her window with the hope of seeing the footsteps of him who had stood there the previous night evening returned and with it the hope of again seeing the man she loved in this she was not disappointed for daylight had scarcely disappeared and the moon once more rising through the tops of the tall trees when the young man was seen in the same place as on the previous night he had in his hand a rope ladder as soon as jane saw this she took the sheets from her bed tore them into strings tied them together and let one end down the bide of the house a moment more and one end of the ropeladder was in her hand and she fastened it inside the room soon the young maiden was seen descending and the enthusiastic lover with his arms extended waiting to receive his mistress the planter had been out on an hunting excursion and returning home saw his victim as her lover was receiving her in his arms at this moment the sharp sound of a ride was heard and the young man fell weltering in his blood at the feet of his mistress jane fell senseless by his side for many days she had a confused consciousness of some great agony but knew not where she was or by whom surrounded the slow recovery of her reason settled into the most intense melancholy which gained at length the compassion even of her cruel master the beautiful bright eyes always pleading in expression were now so heartpiercing in their sadness that he could not endure their gaze in a few days the poor girl died of a broken heart and was buried at night at the back of the garden by the negroes and no one wept at the grave of her who had been so carefully cherished and so tenderly beloved

this reader is an unvarnished narrative of one doomed by the laws of the southern states to be a slave it tells not only its own story of grief but speaks of a thousand wrongs and woes beside which never see the light all the more bitter and dreadful because no help can relievo no sympathy can mitigate and no hope can cheer

the arrest

the fearful stormâit threatens lowering which god in mercy long delays slaves yet tnay see their masters cowering while whole plantations smoke and blaze

carter it was late in the evening when the coach arrived at richmond and clotel once more alighted in her native city she had intended to seek lodgings somewhere in the outskirts of the town but the lateness of the hour compelled her to stop at one of the principal hotels for the night she had scercely entered the inn when she recognised among the numerous black servants one to whom she was well known and her only hope was that her disguise would keep her from being discovered the imperturbable calm and entire forgetfulness of self which induced clotel to visit a place from which she could scarcely hope to escape to attempt the rescue of a beloved child demonstrate that overwillingness of woman to carry out the promptings of the finer feelings of her heart true to womans nature she had risked her own liberty for another

she remained in the hotel during the night and the next morning under the pica of illness she took her breakfast alone that day the fugitive slave paid a visit to the suburbs of the town and once more beheld the cottage in which she had spent so many happy hours it was winter and the clematis and passion flower were not there but there were the same walks she had so often pressed with her feet and the same trees which had so often shaded her as she passed through the garden at the back of the house old remembrances rushed upon her memory and caused her to shed tears freely clotel was now in her native town and near her daughter but how could she communicate with her how could she see her  to have made herself known would have been a suicidal act betrayal would have followed and she arrested three days had passed away and clotel still remained in the hotel at which she had first put up and yet she had got no tidings of her child unfortunately for clotel a disturbance had just broken out amongst the slave population in the state of virginia and all strangers were eyed with suspicion

the evils consequent on slavery are not lessened by the incoming of one or two rays of light if the slave only becomes aware of his condition and conscious of the injustice under which he suffers if he obtains but a faint idea of these things he will seize the first opportunity to possess himself of what he conceives to belong to him the infusion of anglosaxon with african blood has created an insurrectionary feeling among the slaves of america hitherto unknown aware of their blood connection with their owners these mulattoos labour under the sense of their personal and social injuries and tolerate if they do not encourage in themselves low and vindictive passions on the other hand the slave owners are aware of their critical position and are ever watchful always fearing an outbreak among the slaves

true the free states arc equally hound with the slave states to suppress any insurrectionary movement that may take place among the slaves the northern freemen are bound by their constitutional obligations to aid the slaveholder in keeping his slaves in their chains yet there are at the time we write four millions of bond slaves in the united states the insurrection to which we now refer was headed by a fullblooded negro who had been born and brought up a slave he had heard the twang of the drivers whip and saw the warm blood streaming from the negros body he had witnessed the separation of parents and children and was made aware by too many proofs that the slave could expect no justice at the hand of the slave owner he went by the name of  nat turner he was a preacher amongst the negroes and distinguished for his eloquence respected by the whites and loved and venerated by the negroes on the discovery of the plan for the outbreak turner fled to the swamps followed by those who had joined in the insurrection here the revolted negroes numbered some hundreds and for a time bade defiance to their oppressors the dismal swamps cover many thousands of acres of wild land and a dense forest with wild animals and insects such as are unknown in any other part of virginia here runaway negroes usually seek a hidingplace and some have been known to reside here for years the revolters were joined by one of these he was a large tall fullblooded negro with a stern and savage countenance the marks on his face showed that he was from one of the barbarous tribes in africa and claimed that country as his native land his only covering was a girdle around his loins made of skins of wild beasts which he had killed his only token of authority among those that he led was a pair of epaulettes made from the tail of a fox and tied to his shoulder by a cord brought from the coast of africa when only fifteen years of age to the island of cuba he was smuggled from thence into virginia he had been two years in the swamps and considered it his future home he had met a negro woman who was also a runaway and after the fashion of his native land had gone through the process of oiling her as the marriage ceremony they had built a cave on a rising mound in the swamp this was their home his name was picquilo his only weapon was a sword made from the blade of a scythe which he had stolen from a neighbouring plantation his dress his character his manners his mode of lighting were all in keeping with the early training he had received in the land of his birth he moved about with the activity of a cat and neither the thickness of the trees nor the depth of the water could stop him he was a bold turbulent spirit and from revenge imbrued his hands in the blood of all the whites he could meet hunger thirst fatigue and loss of sleep he seemed made to endure as if by peculiarity of constitution his air was fierce his step oblique his look sanguinary such was the character of one of the leaders in the southampton insurrection all negroes were arrested who were found beyond their masters threshhold and all strange whites watched with a great degree of alacrity

such was the position in which clotel found affairs when she returned to virginia in search of her mary had not the slaveowners been watchful of strangers owing to the outbreak the fugitive could uot have escaped the vigilance of the police for advertisements announcing her escape and offering a large reward for her arrest had been received in the city previous to her arrival and the officers were therefore on the lookout for the runaway slave it was on the third day as the quadroon was seated in her room at the inn still in the disguise of a gentleman that two of the city officers entered the room and informed her that they were authorised to examine all strangers to assure the authorities that they were not in league with the revolted negroes with trembling heart the fugitive handed the key of her trunk to the officers to their surprise they found nothing but womans apparel in the box which raised their curiosity and caused a further investigation that resulted in the arrest of clotel as a fugitive slave she was immediately conveyed to prison there to await the orders of her master for many days uncheered by the voice of kindness alone hopeless desolate she waited for the time to arrive when the chains were to he placed on her limbs and she returned to her inhuman and unfeeling owner

the arrest of the fugitive was announced in all the newspapers but created little or no sensation the inhabitants were too much engaged in putting down the revolt among the slaves  and although all the odds were against the insurgents the whites found it no easy matter with all their caution every day brought news of fresh outbreaks without scruple and without pity the whites massacred all blacks found beyond their owners plantations the negroes in return set fire to houses and put those to death who attempted to escape from the flames thus carnage was added to carnage and the blood of the whites flowed to avenge the blood of the blacks these were the ravages of slavery no graves were dug for the negroes their dead bodies became food for dogs and vultures and their bones partly calcined by the sun remained scattered about as if to mark the mournful fury of servitude and lust of power when the slaves were subdued except a few in the swamps bloodhounds were put in this dismal place to hunt out the remaining revolted among the captured negroes was one of whom we shall hereafter make mention

death is freedom

 i asked but freedom and ye gave chains and the freedom of the grave â swelling

there are in the district of columbia several slave prisons or negro pens us they are termed these prisons are mostly occupied by persons to keep their slaves in when collecting their gangs together for the new orleans market some of them belong to the government and one in particular is noted for having been the place where a number of free coloured persons have been incarcerated from time to time in this district is situated the capitol of the united states any free coloured persons visiting washington if not provided with papers asserting and proving their right to be free may he arrested and placed in one of these dens if they succeed in showing that they are free they are set at liberty provided they are able to pay the expenses of their arrest and imprisonment if they cannot pay these expenses they are sold out through this unjust and oppressive law many persons born in the free states have been consigned to a life of slavery on the cotton sugar or rice plantations of the southern states by order of her master clotel was removed from richmond and placed in one of these prisons to await the sailing of a vessel for new orleans the prison in which she was put stands midway between the capitol at washington and the presidents house here the fugitive saw nothing but slaves brought in and taken out to be placed in ships and sent away to the same part of the country to which she herself would soon bo compelled to go she had seen or heard nothing of her daughter while in richmond and all hope of seeing her now had died if she was carried back to new orleans she could expect no mercy from her master

at the dusk of the evening previous to the day when she was to be sent off as the old prison was being closed for the night she suddenly darted past her keeper and ran for her life it is not a great distance from the prison to the long bridge which passes from the lower part of the city across the potomac to the extensive forests and woodlands of the celebrated arlington place occupied by that distinguished relative and descendant of the immortal washington mr george w curtis thither the poor fugitive directed her flight so unexpected was her escape that she had quite a number of rods the start before the keeper had secured the other prisoners and rallied his assistants in pursuit it was at an hour when and in a part of the city where horses could not be readily obtained for the chase  no bloodhounds were at hand to run down the flying woman and for once it seemed as though there was to be a fair trial of speed and endurance between the slave and the slavecatchers the keeper and his forces raised the hue and cry on her pathway close behind but so rapid was the flight along the wide avenue that the astonished citizens as they poured forth from their dwellings to learn the cause of alarm were only able to comprehend the nature of the case in time to fall in with the motley mass in pursuit as many a one did that night to raise an anxious prayer to heaven as they refused to join in the pursuit that the panting fugitive might escape and the merciless soul dealer for once bo disappointed of his prey and now with the speed of an arrowâhaving missed the avenue â with the distance between her and her pursuers constantly increasing this poor hunted female gained the  long bridge as it is called where interruption seemed improbable and already did her heart begin to beat high with the hope of success she had only to pass threefourths of a mile across the bridge and she could bury herself in a vast forest just at the time when the curtain of night would close around her and protect her from the pursuit of her enemies

but god by his providence had otherwise determined he had determined that an appalling tragedy should be enacted that night within plain sight of the presidents bouse and the capital of the union which should be an evidence wherever it should be known of the unconquerable love of liberty the heart may inherit as well as a fresh admonition to the slave dealer of the cruelty and enormity of his crimes just as the pursuers crossed the high draw for the passage of sloops soon after entering upon the bridge they beheld three men slowly approaching from the virginia side they immediately called to them to arrest the fugitive whom they proclaimed a runaway slave true to their virginian instincts as she came near they formed in line across the narrow bridge and prepared to seize her seeing escape impossible in that quarter she stopped suddenly and turned upon her pursuers on came the profane and ribald crew faster than ever already exulting in her capture and threatening punishment for her flight for a moment she looked wildly and anxiously around to see if there was no hope of escape on either hand far down below rolled the deep foamy waters of the potomac and before and behind the rapidly approaching step and noisy voices of pursuers showing how vain would be any further effort for freedom her resolution was taken she clasped her hands convulsively and raised them as she at the same time raised her eyes towards heaven and begged for that mercy and compassion there which had been denied her on earth and then with a single bound she vaulted over the railings of the bridge and sunk for ever beneath the waves of the river

thus died clotel the daughter of thomas jefferson a president of the united states a man distinguished as the author of the declaration of american independence and one of the first statesmen of that country

had clotel escaped from oppression in any other land in the disguise in which she fled from the mississippi to richmond and reached the united states no honour within the gift of the american people would have been too good to have been heaped upon the heroic woman but she was a slave and therefore out of the pale of their sympathy they have tears to shed over greece and poland they have an abundance of sympathy for  poor ireland  they can furnish a ship of war to convey the hungarian refugees from a turkish prison to the  land of the free and home of the brave they boast that america is the  cradle of liberty  if it is i fear they have rocked the child to death the body of clotel was picked up from the bank of the river where it had been washed by the strong current a hole dug in the sand and there deposited without either inquest being held over it or religious service being performed such was the life and such the death of a woman whose virtues and goodness of heart would have done honour to one in a higher station of life and who if she had been born in any other land but that of slavery would have been honoured and loved a few days after the death of clotel the following poem appeared in one of the newspapers  now rest for the wretched the long day is past and night on yon prison descendeth at last

now lock up and bolt ha jailor look there

who flies like a wild bird escaped from the snare

a woman a slaveâup out in pursuit while linger some gleams of day

how eager she drinks the free air of the plains  every limb every nerve every fibre she strains from columbias glorious capitol columbias daughter flees to the sanctuary god lias givenâ the sheltering forest trees

 now she treads the long bridgeâjoy lighteth her eye â beyond her the dense wood and darkening sky â wild hopes thrill her heart as she neareth the shore o despair there are men fust advancing before

shameshame on their manhood they hear they heed the cry her flight to stay and like demon forms with their outstretched arms they wait to seize their prey 

 she pauses she turns ah will she flee back 

like wolves her pursuers howl loud on their track  she lifteth to heaven one look of despairâ her anguish breaks forth in one hurried prayerâ hark her jailors yell like a bloodhounds bay on the low night wind it sweeps 

now death or the chain  to the stream she turns and she leaps o god she leaps 

the dark and the cold yet merciful wave receives to its bosom the form of the slave she risesâearths scenes on her dim vision gleam yet she struggleth not with the strong rushing stream  and low are the deathcries her womans heart gives as she floats adown the river faint and more faint grows the drowning voice and her cries have ceased for ever

 now back jailor back to thy dungeons again to swing the red lash and rivet the chain

the form thou wouldst fetterâreturned to its god the universe holdeth no realm of night more drear than her slaveryâ more merciless fiends than here stayed her flight â joy the hunted slave is free

we left mary the daughter of clotel in the capacity of a servant in her own fathers house where she had been taken by her mistress for the ostensible purpose of plunging her husband into the depths of humiliation at first the young girl was treated with great severity but after finding that horatio green had lost all feeling for his child mrs greens ownheart became touched for the offspring of her husband and she became its friend mary had grown still more beautiful and like most of her sex in that country was fast coming to maturity

the arrest of clotel while trying to rescue her daughter did not reach the ears of the latter till her mother had been removed from richmond to washington the mother had passed from time to eternity before the daughter knew that she had been in the neighbourhood horatio green was not in richmond at the time of clotels arrest had he been there it is not probable but he would have made an effort to save her she was not his slave and therefore was beyond his power even had he been there and inclined to aid her the revolt amongst the slaves had been brought to an end and most of the insurgents either put to death or sent out of the state one however remained in prison he was the slave of horatio green and had been a servant in his masters dwelling he too could boast that his father was an american statesman his name was george his mother had been employed as a servant in one of the principal hotels in washington where members of congress usually put up after georges birth his mother was sold to a slave trader and he to an agent of mr green the father of horatio george was as white as most white persons no one would suppose that any african blood coursed through bis veins his hair was straight soft fine and light his eyes blue nose prominent lips thin his head well formed forehead high and prominent and he was often taken for a free white person by those who did know him this made his condition still more intolerable for one so white seldom ever receives fair treatment at the hands of his fellow slaves and the whites usually regard such slaves as persons who if not often hogged and otherwise ill treated to remind them of their condition would soon forget that they were slaves and  think themselves as good as white folks georgeb opportunities were far greater than most slaves being in his masters house and waiting on educated white people he had become very familiar with the english language he had heard his master and visitors speak of the downtrodden and oppressed poles he heard them talk of going to greece to fight for grecian liberty and against the oppressors of that illfated people george fired with the love of freedom and zeal for the cause of his enslaved country men joined the insurgen ts and with them had been defeated and captured ho was the only one remaining of these unfortunate people and he would have been put to death with them but for a circumstance that occurred some weeks before the outbreak the court house had by accident taken fire and was fast consuming the engines could not be made to work and all hope of saving the building seemed at an end in one of the upper chambers there was a small box containing some valuable deeds belonging to the city a ladder was placed against the house leading from the street to the window of the room in which the box stood the wind blew strong and swept the flames in that direction broad sheets of fire were blown again and again over that part of the building and then the wind would lift the pall of smoke which showed that the work of destruction was not yet accomplished while the doomed building was thus exposed and before the destroying element bad made its final visit as it did soon after george was standing by and hearing that much depended on the contents of the box and seeing no one disposed to venture through the fiery element to save the treasure mounted the ladder and made his way to the window entered the room and was soon seen descending with the much valued box three cheers rent the air as the young slave fell from the ladder when near the ground the white men took him up in their arms to see if he had sustained any injury his hair was burnt eyebrows closely singed and his clothes smelt strongly of smoke but the heroic young slave was unhurt the city authorities at their next meeting passed a vote of thanks to georges master for the lasting benefit that the slave had rendered the public and commended the poor boy to the special favour of his owner when george was on trial for participating in the revolt this meritorious act as they were pleased to term it was brought up in his favour his trial was put off from session to session till he had been in prison more than a year at last however he was convicted of high treason and sentenced to he hanged within ten days of that time the judge asked the slave if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed on him george stood for a moment in silence and then said as i cannot speak as i should wish i will say nothing  you may say what you please said the judge you had a good master continued he and still you were dissatisfied you left your master and joined the negroes who were burning our houses and killing our wives  as you have given me permission to speak remarked george  i will tell you why i joined the revolted negroes i have heard my master read in the declaration of independence that all men are created free and equal and this caused me to inquire of myself why i was a slave i also heard him talking with some of his visitors about the war with england and he said all wars and lightings for freedom were just and right if bo in what am i wrong the grievances of which your fathers complained and which caused the revolutionary war were trifling in comparison with the wrongs and sufferings of those who were engaged in the late revolt your fathers were never slaves ours are your fathers were never bought and sold like cattle never shut out from the light of knowledge and religion never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters for the crime of having a dark skin my people suffer the pangs of hunger the infliction of stripes and the ignominy of brutal servitude we are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make our instruction a criminal offence what right has one man to the bones sinews blood and nerves of another  did not one god make us all  you say your fathers fought for freedomâso did we you tell me that i am to be put to death for violating the laws of the land did not the american revolutionists violate the laws when they struck for liberty  they were revolters but their success made them patriots â we were revolters and our failure makes us rebels had we succeeded we would have been patriots too success makes all the difference you make merry on the th of july the thunder of cannon and ringing of bolls announce it as the birthday of american independence yet while these cannons arc roaring and hells ringing onesixth of the people of this land arc in chains and slavery you boast that this is the land of the free but a traditionary freedom will not save you it will not do to praise your fathers and build their sepulchres worse for you that you have such an inheritance if you spend it foolishly and are unable to appreciate its worth sad if the genius of a true humanity beholding you with tearful eyes from the mount of vision shall fold his wings in sorrowing pity and repeat the strain  o land of washington how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate this is all i have to say i have done nearly every one present was melted to tears even the judge seemed taken by surprise at the intelligence of the young slave but george was a slave and an example must be made of him and therefore he was sentenced being employed in the same house with mary the daughter of clotel george had become attached to her and the young lovers fondly looked forward to the time when they should bo husband and wife

alter george had been sentenced to death mary was still more attentive to him and begged and obtained leave of her mistress to visit him in his cell the poor girl paid a daily visit to him to whom she had pledged her heart and hand at one of these meetings and only four days from the time fixed for the execution while mary was seated in georges cell it occurred to her that she might yet save him from a felons doom she revealed to him the secret that was then occupying her thoughts viz that george should exchange clothes with her and thus attempt his escape in disguise but he would not for a single moment listen to the proposition not that he feared detection but he would not consent to place an innocent and affectionate girl in a position where she might have to suffer for him mary pleaded but in vainâgeorge was inflexible the poor girl left her lover with a heavy heart regretting that her scheme had proved unsuccessful

towards the close of the next day mary again appeared at the prison door for admission and was soon by the side of him whom she so ardently loved while there the clouds which had overhung the city for some hours broke and the rain fell in torrents amid the most terrific thunder and lightning in the most persuasive manner possible mary again importuned george to avail himself of her assistance to escape from an ignominious death after assuring him that she not being the person condemned would not receive any injury he at last consented and they began to exchange apparel as george was of small stature and both were white there was no difficulty in his passing out without detection  and as she usually left the cell weeping with handkerchief in hand and sometimes at her face he had only to adopt this mode and his escape was safe they had kissed each other and mary had told george where he would find a small parcel of provisions which she had placed in a secluded spot when the prisonkeeper opened the door and said  come girl it is time for you to go george again embraced mary and passed out of the jail it was already dark and the street lamps were lighted so that our hero in his new dross had no dread of detection the provisions were sought out and found and poor george was soon on the road towards canada but neither of them had once thought of a change of dress for george when he should have escaped and he had walked but a short distance before he felt that a change of his apparel would facilitate his progress but he dared not go amongst even his coloured associates for fear of being betrayed however he made the best of his way on towards canada hiding in the woods during the day and travelling by the guidance of the north star at night

with the poet ho could truly say  star of the north  while blazing day pours round me its full tide of light and hides thy pule but faithful ray i too lie hid and long for night

one morning george arrived on the banks of the ohio river and found his journey had terminated unless he could get some one to take him across the river in a secret manner for he would not be permitted to cross in any of the ferry boats it being a penalty for crossing a slave besides the value of the slave he concealed himself in the tall grass and weeds near the river to see if he could embrace an opportunity to cross no had been in his hiding place but a short time when he observed a man in a small boat floating near the shore evidently fishing his first impulse was to call out to the man and ask him to take him over to the ohio side but the fear that the man was a slaveholder or one who might possibly arrest him deterred him from it the man after rowing and floating about for some time fastened the boat to the root of a tree and started to a neighbouring farmhouse

this was georges moment and he seized it running down the bank he unfastened the boat jumped in and with all the expertness of one accustomed to a boat rowed across the river and landed on the ohio side

being now in a free state he thought he might with perfect safety travel on towards canada he had however gone but a very few miles when he discovered two men on horseback coming behind him he felt sure that they could not be in pursuit of him yet he did not wish to be seen by them so he turned into another road leading to a house near by the men followed and were but a short distance from george when he ran up to a farmhouse before which was standing a farmerlooking man in a broadbrimmed hat and straightcollared coat whom he implored to save him from the  slavecatchers the farmer told him to go into the barn near by he entered by the front door the farmer following and closing the door behind george but remaining outside and gave directions to his hired man as to what should be done with george the slaveholders by this time had dismounted and were in front of the barn demanding admittance and charging the farmer with secreting their slave woman for george was still in the dress of a woman the friend for the farmer proved to be a member of the society of friends told the slaveowners that if they wished to search his barn they must first get an officer and a search warrant while the parties were disputing the farmer began nailing up the front door and the hired man served the back door in the same way the slaveholders finding that they could not prevail on the friend to allow them to get the slave determined to go in search of an officer one was left to see that the slave did not escape from the barn while the other went off at full speed to mount pleasant the nearest town george was not the slave of either of these men nor were they in pursuit of him but they had lost a woman who had been seen in that vicinity and when they saw poor george in the disguise of a female and attempting to elude pursuit they felt sure they were close upon their victim however if they had caught him although he was not their slave they would have taken him back and placed him in jail and there he would have remained until his owner arrived

after an absence of nearly two hours the slaveowner returned with an officer and found the friend still driving large nails into the door in a triumphant tone and with a corresponding gesture he handed the searchwarrant to the friend and said  there sir now i will see if i cant get my nigger  well said the friend thou hast gone to work according to law and thou canst now go into my barn  lend me your hammer that i may get the door open said the slaveholder let me see the warrant again and after reading it over once more he said i see nothing in this paper which says i must supply thee with tools to open my door if thou wishest to go in thou must get a hammer elsewhere the sheriff said  i will go to a neighbouring farm and borrow something which will introduce us to miss dinah and he immediately went in search of tools in a short time the officer returned and they commenced an assault and battery upon the bam door which soon yielded and in went the slaveholder and officer and began turning up the hay and using all other means to find the lost property but to their astonishment the slave was not there after all hope of getting dinah was gone the slaveowner in a rage said to the friend  my nigger is not here  i did not tell thee there was any one here yes but i saw her go in and you shut the door behind her and if she was not in the bam what did you nail the door for   cant i do what i please with my own barn door  now i will tell thee thou need trouble thyself no more for the person thou art after entered the front door and went out at the back door and is a long way from here by this time thou and thy friend must be somewhat fatigued by this time wont thou go in and take a little dinner with me we need not say that this cool invitation of the good quaker was not accepted by the slaveholders george in the meantime had been taken to a friends dwelling some miles away where after laying aside his female attire and being snugly dressed up in a straight collared coat and pantaloons to match was again put on the right road towards canada

the fugitive now travelled by day and laid by during night after a fatiguing and dreary journey of two weeks the fugitive arrived in canada and took up his abode in the little town of st catherines and obtained work on the farm of colonel street here he attended a nightschool and laboured for his employer during the day the climate was cold and wages small yet he was in a land where he was free and this the young slave prized more than all the gold that could be given to him besides doing his best to obtain education for himself he imparted what he could to those of his fellowfugitives about him of whom there were many

the mystery george however did not forget his promise to use all the means in his power to get mary out of slavery he therefore laboured with all his might to obtain money with which to employ some one to go back to virginia for mary after nearly six months labour at st catherines he employed an english missionary to go and see if the girl could be purchased and at what price the missionary went accordingly but returned with the sad intelligence that on account of marys aiding george to escape the court had compelled mr green to sell her out of the state and she had been sold to a negro trader and taken to the new orleans market as all hope of getting the girl was now gone george resolved to quit the american continent for ever he immediately took passage in a vessel laden with timber bound for liverpool and in five weeks from that time he was standing on the quay of the great english seaport with little or no education he found many difficulties in the way of getting a respectable living however he obtained a situation as porter in a large house in manchester where he worked during the day and took private lessons at night in this way he laboured for three years and was then raised to the situation of clerk george was so white as easily to pass for a white man and being somewhat ashamed of his african descent he never once mentioned the fact of his having been a slave he soon became a partner in the firm that employed him and was now on the road to wealth

in the year  just ten years after george green for he adopted his masters name arrived in england he visited france and spent some days at dunkirk it was towards sunset on a warm day in the month of october that mr green after strolling some distance from the hotel de leon entered a burial ground and wandered long alone among the silent dead gazing upon the many green graves and marble tombstones of those who once moved on the theatre of busy life and whose sounds of gaiety once fell upon the ear of man all nature around was hushed in silence and seemed to partake of the general melancholy which hung over the quiet restingplace of departed mortals after tracing the varied inscriptions which told the characters or conditions of the departed and viewing the mounds beneath which the dust of mortality slumbered he had now reached a secluded spot near to where an aged weeping willow bowed its thick foliage to the ground as though anxious to hide from the scrutinising gaze of curiosity the grave beneath it mr green seated himself upon a marble tomb and began to read roscoes leo x a copy of which he had under his arm it was then about twilight and he had scarcely gone through half a page when he observed a lady in black leading a boy some five years old up one of the paths and as the ladys black veil was over her face he felt somewhat at liberty to eye her more closely while looking at her the lady gave a scream and appeared to be in a fainting position when mr green sprang from his seat in time to save her from falling to the ground at this moment an elderly gentleman was seen approaching with a rapid step who from his appearance was evidently the ladys father or one intimately connected with her he came up and in a confused manner asked what was the matter mr green explained as well as he could after taking up the smelling bottle which had fallen from her hand and holding it a short time to her face she soon began to revive during all this time the ladys veil had so covered her face that mr green had not seen it when she had so far recovered as to be able to raise her head she again screamed and fell back into the arms of the old man it now appeared quite certain that either the countenance of george green or some other object was the cause of these fits of fainting and the old gentleman thinking it was the former in rather a petulant tone said  i will thank you sir if you will leave us alone the child whom the lady was leading had now set up a squall and amid the deathlike appearance of the lady the harsh look of the old man and the cries of the boy mr green left the grounds and returned to his hotel

whilst seated by the window and looking out upon the crowded street with every now and then the strange scene in the graveyard vividly before him mr green thought of the book he had been reading and remembering that he had left it on the tomb where he had suddenly dropped it when called to the assistance of the lady he immediately determined to return in search of it after a walk of some twenty minutes he was again over the spot where he had been an hour before and from which he had been so unceremoniously expelled by the old man he looked in vain for the book it was nowhere to be found  nothing save the bouquet which the lady had dropped and which lay halfburied in the grass from having been trodden upon indicated that any one had been there that evening mr

green took up the bunch of flowers and again returned to the hotel

after passing a sleepless night and hearing the clock strike six he dropped into a sweet sleep from which he did not awake until roused by the rap of a servant who entering his room handed him a note which ran as follows â sirâi owe you an apology for the inconvenience to which you were subjected last evening and if you will honour us with your presence to dinner today at four oclock i shall be most happy to give you due satisfaction my servant will be in waiting for you at halfpast three i am sir your obedient servant j devenant october  to george green esq

the servant who handed this note to mr green informed him that the hearer was waiting for a reply he immediately resolved to accept the invitation and replied accordingly who this person was and how his name and the hotel where he was stopping had been found out was indeed a mystery however he waited impatiently for the hour when he was to see this new acquaintance and get the mysterious meeting in the graveyard solved

 mans love is of mans life a thing apart tis womans whole existenceâbyron

the clock on a neighbouring church had scarcely ceased striking three when the servant announced that a carriage had called for mr green in less than half an hour ho was seated in a most sumptuous barouche drawn by two beautiful iron greys and rolling along over a splendid gravel road completely shaded by large trees which appeared to have been the accumulating growth of many centuries the carriage soon stopped in front of a low villa and this too was embedded in magnificent trees covered with moss mr green alighted and was shown into a superb drawing room the walls of which were hung with fine specimens from the hands of the great italian painters and one by a german artist representing a beautiful monkish legend connected with  the holy catherine an illustrious lady of alexandria the furniture had an antique and dignified appearance high backed chairs stood around the room a venerable mirror stood on the mantle shelf rich curtains of crimson damask hung in folds at either side of the large windows and a rich turkey carpet covered the floor in the centre stood a table covered with books in the midst of which was an oldfashioned vase filled with fresh flowers whose fragrance was exceedingly pleasant a faint light together with the quietness of the hour gave beauty beyond description to the whole scene

mr green had scarcely seated himself upon the sofa when the elderly gentleman whom he had met the previous evening made his appearance followed by the little boy and introduced himself as mr devenant a moment more and a ladyâa beautiful brunette â dressed in black with long curls of a chesnut colour hanging down her cheeks entered the room her eyes were of a dark hazel and her whole appearance indicated that she was a native of a southern clime the door at which she entered was opposite to where the two gentlemen were seated they immediately rose and mr devenant was in the act of introducing her to mr green when he observed that the latter had sunk hack upon the sofa and the last word that he remembered to have heard was  it is her after this all was dark and dreamy how long he remained in this condition it was for another to tell when he awoke he found himself stretched upon the sofa with his boots off his neckerchief removed shirt collar unbuttoned and his head resting upon a pillow by his side sat the old man with the smelling bottle in the one hand and a glass of water in the other and the little boy standing at the foot of the sofa as soon as mr green had so far recovered as to be able to speak he said  where am i and what does this mean wait a while replied the old man and i will tell you all after a lapse of some ten minutes he rose from the sofa adjusted his apparel and said  i am now ready to hear anything you have to say  you were born in america said the old man yes he replied and you wore acquainted with a girl named mary continued the old man  yes and i loved her as i can love none other the lady whom you met so mystcriously last evening is mary replied mr devenant george green was silent but the fountains of mingled grief and joy stole out from beneath his eyelashes and glistened like pearls upon his pale and marblelike cheeks at this juncture the lady again entered the room hr green sprang from the sofa and they fell into each others arms to the surprise of the old man and little george and to the amusement of the servants who had crept up one by one and were hid behind the doors or loitering in the hall when they had given vent to their feelings they resumed their scats ana each in turn related the adventures through which they had passed  how did you find out my name and address asked mr green   after you had left us in the graveyard our little george said o mamma if there aint a book  and picked it up and brought it to us papa opened it and said the gentlemans name is written in it and here is a card of the hotel de leon where i suppose he is stopping papa wished to leave the book and said it was all a fancy of mine that i had ever seen you before but i was perfectly convinced that you were my own george green are you married no i am not then thank god exclaimed mrs devenant and are you single now inquired mr green yes she replied this is indeed the lords doings said mr green at the same time bursting into a flood of tears mr devenant was past the age when men should think upon matrimonial subjects yet the scene brought vividly before his eyes the days when he was a young man and had a wife living after a short interview the old man called their attention to the dinner which was then waiting we need scarcely add that mr green and mrs devenant did very little towards diminishing the dinner that day

after dinner the lovers for such we have to call them gave their experience from the time that george left the jail dressed in marys clothes up to that time mr greens was substantially as we have related it mrs devenants was as follows â  the night after you left the prison said she  i did not shut my eyes in sleep the next morning about eight oclock peter the gardener came to the jail to see if i had been there the night before and was informed that i had and that i had left a little after dark about an hour after mr green came himself and i need not say that he was much surprised on finding me there dressed in your clothes this was the first tidings they had of your escape  what did mr green say when he found that i had fled oh  continued mrs devenant  he said to me when no one was near i hope george will get off but i fear you will have to suffer in his stead i told him that if it must be so i was willing to die if you could live at this moment george green burst into tears throw his arms around her neck and exclaimed i am glad i have waited so long with the hope of meeting you again

mrs devenant again resumed her storyâ i was kept in jail three days during which time i was visited by the magistrates and two of the judges on the third day i was taken out and master told me that i was liberated upon condition that i should be immediately sent out of the state there happened to be just at the time in the neighbourhood a negrotrader and he purchased me and i was taken to new orleans on the steamboat we were kept in a close room where slaves arc usually confined so that i saw nothing of the passengers on board or the towns we passed we arrived at new orleans and were all put into the slavemarket for sale i was examined by many persons but none seemed willing to purchase me as all thought me too white and said i would run away and pass as a free white woman on the second day while in the slavemarket and while planters and others were examining slaves and making their purchases i observed a tall young man with long black hair eyeing me very closely and then talking to the trader i felt sure that my time had now come but the day closed without my being sold i did not regret this for i had heard that foreigners made the worst of masters and i felt confident that the man who eyed me so closely was not an american

 the next day was the sabbath the bells called the people to the different places of worship methodists sang and baptists immersed and presbyterians sprinkled and episcopalians read their prayers while the ministers of the various sects preached that christ died for all yet there were some twentyfive or thirty of us poor creatures confined in the negro pen awaiting the close of the holy sabbath and the dawn of another day to be again taken into the market there to be examined like so many beasts of burden i need not tell you with what anxiety we waited for the advent of another day on monday we were again brought out and placed in rows to be inspected and fortunately for me i was sold before we had been on the stand an hour i was purchased by a gentleman residing in the city for a waitingmaid for his wife who was just on the eve of starting for mobile to pay a visit to a near relation i was then dressed to suit the situation of a maidservant and upon the whole i thought that in my new dress i looked as much the lady as my mistress

 on the passage to mobile who should i see among the passengers but the tall longhaired man that had eyed me so closely in the slavemarket a few days before his eyes were again on me and he appeared anxious to speak to me and i as reluctant to be spoken to the first evening after leaving new orleans soon after twilight had let her curtain down and pinned it with a star and while i was seated on the deck of the boat near the ladies cabin looking upon the rippled waves and the rejection of the moon upon the sea all at once i saw the tall young man standing by my side i immediately rose from my seat and was in the act of returning to the cabin when he in a broken accent said  stop a moment i wish to have a word with you i am your friend i stopped and looked him full in the face and he said i saw you some days since in the slavemarket and i intended to have purchased you to save you from the condition of a slave i called on monday but you had been sold and had left the market i inquired and learned who the purchaser was and that you had to go to mobile so i resolved to follow you if you are willing i will try and buy you from your present owner and you shall be free although this was said in an honest and offhand manner i could not believe the man to he sincere in what he said  why should you wish to set me free i asked i had an only sister he replied who died three years ago in france and you are so much like her that had i not known of her death i would most certainly have taken you for her however much i may resemble your sister you are aware that i am not her and why take so much interest in one whom you never saw before    the love said he which i had for my sister is transferred to you i had all along suspected that the man was a knave and this profession of love confirmed me in my former belief and i turned away and left him

 the next day while standing in the cabin and looking through the window the french gentleman for such he was came to the window while walking on the guards and again commenced as on the previous evening he took from his pocket a bit of paper and put it into my hand at the same time saying  take this it may some day be of service to you remember it is from a friend and left me instantly i unfolded the paper and found it to be a oo dollars bank note on the united states branch bank at philadelphia my first impulse was to give it to my mistress but upon a second thought i resolved to seek an opportunity and to return the hundred dollars to the stranger

 therefore i looked for him but in vain and had almost given up the idea of seeing him again when he passed me on the guards of the boat and walked towards the stem of the vessel it being now dark i approached him and offered the money to him he declined saying at the ame time  i gave it to youâkeep it i do not want it i said now said he you had better give your consent for me to purchase you and you shall go with me to france  but you cannot buy me now i replied for my master is in new orleans and he purchased me not to sell but to retain in his own family would you rather remain with your present mistress than be free   no said i  then fly with me tonight we shall be in mobile in two hours from this and when the passengers are going on shore you can take my arm and you can escape unobserved the trader who brought you to new orleans exhibited to me a certificate of your good character and one from the minister of the church to which you were attached in virginia  and upon the faith of these assurances and the love i bear you i promise before high heaven that i will marry you as soon as it can be done this solemn promise coupled with what had already transpired gave me confidence in the man  and rash as the act may seem i determined in an instant to go with him my mistress had been put under the charge of the captain and as it would be past ten oclock when the steamer would land she accepted an invitation of the captain to remain on board with several other ladies till morning i dressed myself in my best clothes and put a veil over my face and was ready on the landing of the boat surrounded by a number of passengers we descended the stage lending to the wharf and were soon lost in the crowd that thronged the quay as we went on shore we encountered several persons announcing the names of hotels the starting of boats for the interior and vessels bound for europe among these was the ship utica captain pell bound for havre now said mr devenant  this is our chance the ship was to sail at twelve oclock that night at high tide and following the men who were seeking passengers we went immediately on board devenant told the captain of the ship that i was his sister and for such we passed during the voyage at the hour of twelve the utica set sail and we were soon out at sea

 the morning after we left mobile devenant met me as i came from my stateroom and embraced me for the first time i loved him but it was only that affection which we have for one who has done us a lasting favour it was the love of gratitude rather than that of the heart we were five weeks on the sea and yet the passage did not seem long for devenant was so kind on our arrival at havre we were married and came to dunkirk and i have resided here ever since

at the close of this narrative the clock struck ten when the old man who was accustomed to retire at an early hour rose to take leave saying at the same time  i hope you will remain with us tonight air green would fain have excused himself on the ground that they would expect him and wait at the hotel but a look from the lady told him to accept the invitation the old man was the father of mrs devenants deceased husband as you will no doubt long since have supposed a fortnight from the day on which they met in the graveyard mr green and mrs devenant were joined in holy wedlock so that george and mary who had loved each other so ardently in their younger days were now husband and wife

a celebrated writer has justly said of woman a womans whole life is a history of the affections the heart is her world it is there her ambition strives for empire it is there her avarice seeks for hidden treasures she sends forth her sympathies on adventure she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection and if shipwrecked her case is hopeless for it is a bankruptcy of the heart

mary had every reason to believe that she would never see george again  and although she confesses that the love she bore him was never transferred to her first husband we can scarcely find fault with her for marrying mr devenant but the adherence of george green to the resolution never to marry unless to his mary is indeed a rare instance of the fidelity of man in the matter of love we can but blush for our countrys shame when we recal to mind the fact that while george and mary green and numbers of other fugitives from american slavery can receive protection from any of the governments of europe they cannot return to their native land without becoming slaves

mr narrative has now come to a close i may bo asked and no doubt shall are the various incidents and scenes related founded in truth  i answer yes i have personally participated in many of those scenes some of the narratives i have derived from other sources  many from the bps of those who like myself have run away from the land of bondage having been for nearly nine years employed on lake erie i had many opportunities for helping the escape of fugitives who in return for the assistance they received made me the depositary of their sufferings and wrongs of their relations i have made free use to mrs child of new york i am indebted for part of a short story american abolitionist journals are another source from whence some of the characters appearing in my narrative are taken all these combined have made up my story having thus acknowledged my resources i invite the attention of my readers to the following statement from which i leave them to draw their own conclusions  â it is estimated that in the united states members of the methodist church own  slaves members of the baptist church own ooo slaves  members of the episcopalian church own ooo slaves members of the presbyterian church own ooo slaves members of all other churches own oooo slaves in all o slaves owned by members of the christian church in this pious democratic republic 

may these facts be pondered over by british christians and at the next anniversaries of the various religious denominations in london may their influence be seen and felt the religious bodies of american christians will send their delegates to these meetings let british feeling be publicly manifested let british sympathy express itself in tender sorrow for the condition of my unhappy race let it be_ understood unequivocally understood that no fellowship can be held with slaveholders professing the same common christianity as yourselves and until this stain from americas otherwise fair escutcheon be wiped away let no christian association be maintained with those who traffic in the blood and bones of those whom god has made of one flesh as yourselves finally let the voice of the whole british nation be heard across the atlantic and throughout the length and breadth of the land of the pilgrim fathers beseeching their descendants as they value the common salvation which knows no distinction between the bond and the free to proclaim the year of jubilee then shall the earth indeed yield her increase and god even our own god shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall fear him
