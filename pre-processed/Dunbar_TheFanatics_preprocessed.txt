the warmth of the april sunshine had brought out the grass and mary waters and bob van doren trod it gleefully beneath their feet as they wended their way homeward from the outskirts of the town where mary had gone ostensibly to look for early spring blossoms and where bob had followed her in quest of a pet setter that was not lost

the little town was buzzing with excitement as the young people entered it but they did not notice it for a sweeter excitement was burning in their hearts

bob and mary had been engaged for three months a long time in those simple days in ohio where marriages were often affairs of a glance a word and a parents blessing the parents blessing in this case had been forthcoming too for while the two widowed fathers could not agree politically stephen yan doren being a staunch democrat and bradford waters as staunch a kepublican yet they had but one mind as to the welfare of their children

they had loud and long discussions on the question of slavery and kindred subjects but when it came to shaking hands over the union of bob and mary they were as one they had fallen out over the missouri compromise and quarrelled vigorously over the fugitive slave law but stephen had told his son to go in and win for there was not a better girl in the village than mary and bradford had said  yes  to bob when he came

on this day as the young people passed down main street oblivious of all save what was in their hearts some people who stood on the outskirts of a crowd that was gathered about the courthouse snickered and nudged each other

 curious combination old man thorne said to his nearest neighbor who was tiptoeing to get a glimpse into the middle of the circle

 whats that  

 look athere and he pointed to the lovers who had passed on down the street

 geewhillikens said the onlooker  what a pity somebody didnt call their attention wouldnt it a been a contrast though 

 it would  a been worse than a contras it would  a been a broken engagement an perhaps a pair o broken hearts well of all fools as the say in is a ol fool is the worst

 an a southern fool up north who has grown old in the south said johnson who was somewhat of a curbstone politician

 oh i dont know said thorne placidly different people has different ways o thinkin

 but when youre in rome do as rome does returned johnson

 most men carries their countries with them the dutchman comes over here but he still eats his sauerkraut

 oh plague take that america for the americans i say and ohio for the ohioans old waters is right

 how long you been here from york state  

 oh that aint in the question

oh certainly not its alius a matter o whose ox is gored

the matter within the circle which had awakened mr johnsons sense of contrast was a hot debate which was just about terminating two old men their hats off and their faces flushed were holding forth in the midst of the crowd one was stephen yan doren and the other was bradford waters

the former had come up from virginia sometime in the forties and his ideas were still the ideas of the old south he was a placid gentlemanly old man with a soldierly bearing and courtly manners but his opinions were most decided and he had made bitter enemies as well as strong friends in the ohio town the other was the typical yankee pioneer thin wiry and excitable he was shouting now into his opponents face  go back down south go back to virginia and preach those doctrines 

 theyve got sense enough to know them down there its only up here to gentlemen like you that they need to be preached

 you talk about secession you you  id like to see you build a fence unless the rails would all stand togetherâone rail falling this way and another pulling that

the crowd laughed

 id like you to show me a hand where one finger wasnt independent of another in an emergency

 build a fence shouted waters

 pick up a pin   answered van doren

youre trying to ruin the whole country youre trying to stamp on the opinions that the country has lived for and fought for and died for

 seven states have seceded and i think in some of those seven wore mon who lived and fought and even died for their country yes sir i tell you yankee as you are to your face the south has done for this country what you buying and selling making and trading yankees have never done you have made goods but the south has produced men the old man was warmed up

 men men we can equal any you bring

 calhoun 

 sumner 

 clay 

 webster 

 we shall claim douglass  

 lincoln  

 i should have said the south produced gentlemen not railsplitters we dont make statesmen of them

we produce men and wed make soldiers of them if it was necessary

well it may be

 oh no it wont even the state that gave birth to men like you stephen yan doren wouldnt dare to raise its hand against the union

 wait and see

 wait and see  i dont need to wait and see i know

 bah youre all alike dreamers dreamers dreamers

 dreamers maybe but my god dont wake us

the crowd began to break as it saw that the argument was over and the bystanders whispered and laughed among themselves at the vehemence of the two men

 windbags

 time wasted listening

 warâpshaw 

just then a newsboy tore into the square shouting  paper paper  and every heart stood still with ominous dread at the next words fort sumter fired on   the crowd stood still and then with one accord formed around the old men

a slow smile covered stephen yan dorens lips as he stood facing bradford waters

well theyve done it he said

yes replied the other wavering from the shock  now what are you going to do about it

the old man straightened himself with sudden fire he took off his hat and his thin white hair blew hither and thither in the cool spring breeze

 ill tell you what im going to do about it ill tell you what im going to do when the call comes im going down there and ill help whip them out of their bootsâand if they wont take me ill send a son now what are you going to do

 likewise

bradford waters was known as a religious man but now he turned and raising his hand to heaven said  god grant that wo or our sons may meet where the right will win you damned copperhead you 

in an instant yan dorens fist shot out but some one caught his arm waters sprang towards him but was intercepted and the two were borne away by different crowds who were thunderstruck at the awful calamity which had fallen upon the nation

the two old men sweated to be loosed upon each other but they were forcibly taken to their homes

over the gate of the waters cottage bob yan doren leaned and marys hand was in his

 dont you think a little cottage down by the river would be the best thing mary   asked bob

 and then youd be away from me every minute you could spare fishing i know you bob yan doren

from the inside of the house marys brother tom  twitted  the two unmercifully

 i say there bob he called  youd better let mary come in and help about this supper if you dont therell be a death when father comes home

marys father was gentle with her and this remark of her brothers was so obviously hyperbolic that she burst out laughing as she flung back  oh i guess youve kept nannie woods from her work many a time and there havent been any deaths in that family yet

but there may be in this if luke sharpies catches you sparking around nannie interposed bob

 oh i can attend to luke any day

 thats so luke isnt a very fast runner tom threw a corncob out of the door and it struck bobs hat and knocked it off  theres an answer for you he called

they were still laughing and marys face was flushed with love and merriment when bradford waters came up and strode silently through the gateway

 i must go in now said mary

 so soon  why its hardly time to put the potatoes on yet

 suppose sometimes yon should come home and find your supper not ready  

 oh i wouldnt mind if you were there

just then bradford waters voice floated angrily out to them whats that young whelp hanging around my gate for  

the girl turned pale and her heart stood still but the young man only laughed and shouted back whats the matter mr waters you and father been at war again  

 yes weve been at war and soon we shall all be at war some of your dirty kinsmen have fired on fort sumter

 what 

yes and therell be hell for this days work you mark my words the old man came to the door again and his son stood behind him holding his arm  get away from my gate there mary come in the house ive got better business for you than skylarking with copperheads the girl stood transfixed  what is it father what is it   cried tom

 i tell you those southern devils have fired on fort sumter and it means war getaway from here bob van doren there is a time when men must separate on the ground of their beliefs and this house has no dealing with the enemies of the union marv

but the girls eyes were flashing and her lips compressed  go in mary said bob and he dropped her hand his face was red and pale by turns she turned and went into the house and her lover left the gate and walked down the street

 let this be the last time i catch you talking with one of the van dorens we are two families on opposite sides of a great question we can have no dealings one with the other

 but father you gave bob the right to love me and you cant take it back you cant

 i can take it back and i will take it back id rather see you marry nigger ed the town crier than to cross my blood with that van doren breed today stephen van doren rejoiced because his flag had been fired upon the flag hes living under the flag that protects him wherever he goes 

 that wasnt bob father

like father like son broke in tom passionately

 why tom  wary turned her eyes grieffilled to overflowing upon her brother you and he were such friends  

 i have no friends who are not the friends of my country since i know what i know i would not take bob yan dorens hand if he were my brother

 if he were nannie woods brother   nannie woods is a good loyal girl and her affections are placed on a loyal man there is no division there

bob is right mary we have come to the parting of the ways those who hold with the south must go with the south those who hold with the north must stand by the flag we are all either union men or we are rebels

but father what of vallandigham  you have always said that ho was a noble man vallandigham let me never hear his name again  in this house it spells treason i can make some allowance for the southerner living among his institutions and drawing his life from them but for the man who lives at the north represents northern people and fills his pockets with the coin which northern hands have worked for for him i have only contempt such men hide like copperheads in the grass and sting when we least expect it weed them out i say weed them out 

the old man shook with the passion of his feelings and his face was ashen with anger there had been a time when vallandigham was his idol he had gone against his party to help vote him into congress and thenit was a strangely silent meal to which the three sat down that night tom was feverishly anxious to be out for news and mary with tearstained face sat looking away into space there was a compression about her lips that gave her countenance a wonderful similarity to her fathers she could not eat and she could not talk but her thoughts were busy with the events that were going on about her how she hated it allâthe strife the turmoil the bickerings and disagreements the union confederacy abolition slavery the north the south  one the upper the other the lower millstone and between them love and the women of the whole country why could not they be let alone  was there not enough to be sacrificed that even the budding flower of love must be brought too  it was hard too hard she loved bob van doren what did she care with which side he sympathized  she loved bob not his politics what had she to do with those black men down there in the south it was none of her business for her part she only knew one black man and he was bad enough of course nigger ed was funny they all liked him and laughed at him but he was not exemplary he filled with equal adaptability the position of town crier and town drunkard really if all his brethren were like him they would be none the worse for having masters anyhow her father had not been always so rigid for he laughed when somebody stole the bible from the colored folks meetinghouse and wondered what they could do with a bible anyhow

her reverie was broken by her brothers rising from the table

 im going out to see whats going on he announced

 ill walk up the street with you said his father

they took their hats and went out and with a grey face but set lips the daughter went about her evenings work

when they reached the courthouse a crowd was gathered there and rumors and stories of all kinds were passing from lip to lip another crowd was gathered on the opposite side of the street hooting and jeering while now and then some selfappointed orator harangued it the assembly was composed of some of the worst elements of the town reinforced by the young sports of some of the best families altogether it was a combination of hot blood and lawlessness

an old friend of the waters who had been listening to the noisier crowd brushed against the two men and said under his breath  come on home theres hells work brewing here tonight

 then ill stay and be in it said the older man

 theres nothing you can help about replied the friend  youd better come

 no well stay

the lawless element emboldened at the news of sumters disaster determined to have some fun at the expense of their opponents with one accord they surged towards the office of the republican armed with horns and whistled hooted and jeered themselves hoarse

this is childs play said bradford waters to his son if this is all theyre going to do we might as well go home

they went back to the house where for hours they could hear the horns and whistles of the crowd

it was near midnight when they were awakened by the clanging of a bell and they heard nigger ed as he sped past the house crying  fiab fiah  de publican buildin on fiah tun out 

the waters were dressed and out of the house in a twinkling and had joined the crowd of men and boys who with shouts and grunts were tugging at the old hosecart then they strained and tore their way to the republican office where the fire had made terrible headway the hose was turned on the building and the pumps started the flames crackled and the water hissed and like an echo there floated to the ears of the toiling men the cry of the rioters far away in another part of the town they had done their work it had perhaps come about unintentionally they had only met to jeer but finally some one threw a stone the sound of crashing glass filled them with the spirit of destruction a rioter cried fire the damned shanty   there were cries of  no no   but the cry had already been taken up and a brand had been flung then madness seized them all and they battered and broke smashed and tore fired the place and fled singing with delirious joy

the work of the firemen was of no avail and in an hour the building and its contents were a confused mass of ashes charred beams and molten metal

when the waters reached home mary wideeyed white and shivering sat up waiting for them she hurried to give them each a cup of coffee but asked no questions though her hungry eyes craved the news she sat and stared at them as they eagerly drank

then her father turned to her  well he said  heres another sacrifice to the spirit of rebellion in the north a man ruined his property destroyed they have burned the republican but they cant burn the principle it stood for and the fire they lighted tonight will leave a flame in the heart of loyal citizens that will burn out every stock and stubble of secession and disloyalty then woe to the copperheads who are hiding in the grass when the flames have driven them out we will trample on them trample on them  the old man rose and ground his heel into the floor

mary gave a cry and shivering covered her face with her hands

there were many other men in dorbury no less stirred than was bradford waters over the events of the night and the news from charleston harbor the next day saw meetings of the loyal citizens in every corner of the little town which at last melted into one convention at the courthouse those who had no southern sympathies had been stung into action by the unwarranted rashness of the rioters which brought the passions of the time so close to themselves

the one question was asked on all sides  how soon would the president call for troops to put down this insurrection and even as they asked it the men were organizing recruiting drilling and forming companies to go to the front the light guards the local organization donned their uniforms and paraded the streets already drums were heard on all sides and the shrill cry of the fifes in that portion of the town where lived a number of wealthy southerners there was the quiet and desolation of the grave

their doors were barred and their windows were shut even they could not have believed that it would come to this but since it had come it was too soon for them to readjust themselves to new conditions too soon to go boldly over to the side of the south or changing all their traditions come out for the north and the union which in spite of all they loved so they kept silent and the turmoil went on around them the waves of excitement rolled to their very doors receded and surged up again through their closed blinds they heard the shouts of the men at the public meeting a few blocks away they heard the tramping of feet as the forming companies moved up and down the men knew that many of their employees were away mingling with the crowds and that work was being neglected but they kept to their rooms and to their meditations

ah said one its a hard thing to make us choose between the old home and the old flag we love both which the better god only knows

the children came home from school and told how one of the teachers was preparing to go to war and it brought the situation up to their very faces those were indeed terrible times when preceptors left their desks for the battlefield but still their hearts cried within them  what shall we do 

in the afternoon of the day following the convention nannie woods came over for a chat with mary waters they were close friends and as confidential as prospective sisters should be

 do you think they will fight   asked nannie the south yes they will fight i am sure of it they have already shown what is in them father and tom think it will be easy to subdue them but i feel somehow that it will be a long struggle

but we shall whip them cried the other girl her eyes flashing

i dont know i dont know i wish we didnt have to try

 why mary are you afraid  

 oh no im not afraid but there are those i love on both sides and in the coming contest whichever wins i shall have my share of sorrow

 whichever wins  why you havent a single friend in the south  

i have no friend in the southânow

oh you mean rob van doren well if he didnt think enough of me to be on my side id send him about his business

a man who didnt have courage enough to hold to his own opinions wouldnt be the man id marry

 a man who didnt have love enough to change his opinions to my side wouldnt be the man for me

very well nannie we cant agree

 but were not going to fall out mary and nannie threw her arms impulsively around her friends neck but oh i do long to see our boys march down there and show those rebels what were made of what do you think  father says they claim that one of them can whip five yankees meaning us well id like to see them try it

 spoken like a brave and loyal little woman cried tom rushing in

 eavesdropping said nannie coquettishly but mary turned her sad eyes upon him

i am no less loyal than nannie she said and if the worst comes i know where my allegiance lies butâbutâi wish it wasnt necessary i wish it wasnt necessary to take sides

never you mind mary its going to be all right well whip them in a month or two

we cried nannie oh tom youre never going  

 why what should i be doing when men are at war

 but will there be war  

 there is war the south has fallen out of step and we shall have to whip them back into line but it wont be long two or three months at most and then all will be quiet again it may not even mean bloodshed i think a display of armed force will be sufficient to quell them

 god grant it may be so

tom turned and looked at his sister in an amused way oh you neednt be afraid mary bob van doren wont go copperheads only talk they never fight ha ha

tom waters thats mean of you nannie exclaimed  and its very little of you for a day or two ago bob was your friend she held mary closer as she spoke but tom waters was imbued with the madness that was in the air

what he burst out bob van doren my friend  i have no friend except the friends of the union i tell you and mark my words when the others of us march away you will find him skulking with the rest of his breed in the grass where all snakes lie

bob van doren is no coward said mary in tensely and when the time comes he will be found where his convictions lead either boldly on the side of the union or fighting for the cause which his honor chooses you she broke down and burst into tears

oh dry up mary tom said with rough tenderness  i didnt mean to hurt your feelings robs a good enough fellow but oh i wish he was on our side dont cry mary hes a firstrate fellow and iâill be friends with him

 tom you go away cried nannie  youre just like all men a great big blunderingâdont cry mary dont cry mind your own business tom waters nobody wants you officiating around here youve put your foot in it and if you get smart mary and i will both turn rebel take your arm away

a pretty rebel youd make

 id make a better rebel than you would a soldier

all right ill show you and the young man went out and slammed the door behind him

now youve hurt his feelings said mary suddenly drying her tears

i dont care it was all your fault mary waters then they wept in each others arms because they were both so miserable

just then the negro known as nigger ed came running down the street  laws have mussy on us deys hangin mistah vlandiham  the hearts of the two girls stood still with horror for the moment and they clutched each other wildly but the taint of eve conquered and they hurried to the door to get the news

nigger ed nigger ed   they called and the colored man came breathlessly back to them

 what did you say as you passed the house  theyre hanging mr vallandigham  

 yesm deys hangin him up by de cothouse a whole crowd o mens ahangin him yo fathahs mongst em missy he said turning to mary

my father helping to hang vallandigham oh what are we coming to  isnt it a terrible thing  why its murder  

nannie called across to a friend who was passing on the other side of the street  oh mr smith can it be true that they are hanging vallandigham  

the friend laughed  only in effigy he said

get along with you ed said nannie indignantly running around here scaring a body to death theyre only hanging him in effigy effigy effigy dats whut dey said but hit dont mek no diffunce how a mans hung des so hes hung

go along you dunce its a stuffed vallandigham theyre hanging

 stuffed   cried ed  i tought effigy meant his clothes lawd bless yo soul missy an me brekin my naik runnin fom a stuffed copse i reckon i larmed half de town and ed went on his way

 and its for those people our brothers and fathers are going to war  

 oh no not at all said nannie  its for the union and against states rights andâandâ everything like that

 those people are at the bottom of it all i know it i knew when that book by mrs stowe came out theyre at the bottom of all this trouble i wish theyd never been brought into this country

why how foolish you are mary what on earth would the south have done without them  you dont suppose white people could work down in that hot country  

 white people will work down in that hot country and they will fight down there and oh my god they will die down there  

 mary you cry now at the least thing i believe youre getting a touch of hysteria if you say so ill burn some feathers under your nose

 it isnt hysterics nannie unless the whole spirit of the times is hysterical but it is hard to see families that have known and loved each other for so long suddenly torn asunder by these dissensions

 but the women folks neednt be separated they can go on loving each other just the same

 no the women must and will follow their natural masters it only remains for them to choose which shall be their masters the men at home or those whom they love outside

 well with most of us that will be an easy matter for our lovers and the folks at home agreeâforgive me mary i mean no reflection upon you and i am so sorry

 we are not all so fortunate but however it comes our womens hearts will bear the burdens the men will get the glory and we shall have the grief

 hooray   toms voice floated in from the street and he swung in at the gate singing gaily his cap in his hand

 oh what is it tom   cried nannie  whats the news  

 the bulletin says it is more than likely that the president will call for volunteers tomorrow and im going to be the first lieutenant in the company if the light guards go as a body

 oh my poor brother  

 poor nothing boom boom ta ra ra boom forward march and tom tramped around the room in an excess of youthful enthusiasm he was still parading much to nannies pride and delight when his father entered and stood looking at him his eyes were swollen and dark and there were lines of pain about his mouth

 ah tom he said presently  therell be something more than marching to do i had expected to go along with you but they tell me im too old and so i must be denied the honor of going to the front but if you go my son i want your eyes to be open to the fact that you are going down there for no childs play it will be full grown mens work there will be uniforms and shining equipments but there will be shot and shell as well you go down there to make yourself a target for rebel bullets and a mark for southern fevers there will be the screaming of fifes but there will also be the whistling of shot the flag that we love will float above you but over all will hover the dark wings of death

 oh father father cried mary

 it is a terrible business daughter

tom had stood silent in the middle of the floor while his father was speaking and now he drew up his shoulders and answered  dont be afraid of me father i understand it all if i go to the war i shall expect to meet and endure all that the war will bring hardships maybe worse im not going for fun and i dont think youll ever have reason to be ashamed of me

mary flung herself on her fathers breast and clung to him as if fearful that he also might be taken from her but nannie with burning face ran across and placed her hand in toms

 thats right tom and im not afraid for you the young man put his hand tenderly upon the girls head and smiled down into her face

youre a brave little woman nannie he said the deep menace of the approaching contest seemed to have subdued them all

 im not afraid for my sons honor said bradford waters proudly  but we must all remember that war brings more tears than smiles and makes more widows than wives

 we know that said nannie  but we women will play our part at home and be brave wont we mary  

the girl could not answer but she raised her head from her fathers shoulder and gripped her brothers hand tightly

it was strange talk and a strange scene for these selfcontained people who thought so little of their emotions but their very fervor gave a melodramatic touch to all they did that at another time must have appeared ridiculous

the scenes that were taking place in dorbury were not different from those that were being enacted over the whole country while the north was thunderstruck at the turn matters had taken there had yet been gathering there a political force which only needed this last act of effrontery to galvanize its intention into action everywhere men were gathering themselves into companies or like dorbury already had their light guards then like the sound of a deep bell in the midst of potential silence came the presidents proclamation and the waiting hosts heard gladly lincolns call for troops could hardly do more than was already done volunteering was but a word in effect thousands of men were ready and the call meant only marching orders the enthusiasm of the time was infectious old men were vying with youths in their haste and eagerness to offer their services to the country as bradford waters had said it was a time for sharp divisions and men who had been lukewarm in behalf of the northern cause before now threw themselves heart and soul into it

this state of affairs effected southern sympathizers in the north in two ways it reduced the less robust of spirit to silence and evasion the bolder and more decided ones were still also but between the silence of one and that of the other was a vast difference of motive one was the conceding silence of fear  the other was a sullen repression that brooded and bided its time

among those who came out strongly on the side of the south was old colonel stewart one of the oldest citizens of the town he had served with distinction throughout the mexican war and was the close friend of vallandigham he had come of good old virginia blood and could not and would not try to control his utterances so when the crisis came his family fearing the heat and violence of the time urged him to go south where his words and feelings would be more in accordance with the views of his neighbors but he angrily refused

no said he i will not run from them a single step i will stay here and thrust the truth of what i believe down their throats

 but it will do no good said his old wife plaintively these people are as set in their beliefs as you are in yours and you have no more chance of turning them than of stemming the ohio river

 i am not here to stem the current let them go on with it and be swept to destruction by their own madness but they shall not move me  all of your friends are keeping silent colonel although they feel as deeply as you do  all the more reason for him who feels and dares speak to speak

 then too you owe it to your family to leave this place your views make it hard for us and they will make it worse as the trouble grows

 i hope i have a family heroic enough to bear with me some of the burdens of the south

his wife sighed hopelessly it seemed a throwing of her words into empty air to talk to her husband but emily stewart took up the cause she had the subtlety of the newer generation which in argument she substituted for her mothers simple directness

 it seems to me father she said that you owe the most not to your family but to yourself

 what do you mean   he said turning upon her

 that if you are going to bear the burdens of the south you should bear them not halfheartedly but in full

 well am i not  

 let me explain if trouble should come to the south if disaster or defeat it would be easy for you for any man to raise his voice in her behalf while he himself rides out and beyond the stress of the storm if you are on the side of the south she has a right to demand your presence there  the strength of your personality thrown in with her strength

the old man thought deeply and then he said  i believe you are right body as well as soul should be with the south now yes we will go south but i am sorry about walter he has been so bound up in his work it will be a great disappointment for him to go away and leave it all but then he may in fact i hope he will find consolation for whatever he loses in defending the birthplace of his father against the invasion of vandals

the two women were silent they were keener than the man women always are and these knew or felt with a vividness that bordered on knowledge that walter would not think as his father thought or go his fathers way and here the breach would come but the colonel never once thought but that his son would enter heartily into all his plans and he prided himself upon the step he was about to take his wife and daughter went out and left him anxiously awaiting walters coming

they were apprehensive when they heard the young mans step in the hall and afterwards heard him enter the library where the colonel always insisted that any matter of importance should be discussed

heroism real or fancied is its own reward its own audience and its own applause with continued thought upon the matter colonel stewarts enthusiasm had reached the fever pitch from which he could admit but one view of it he had bade the servant send his son to him as soon as he came in and he was walking back and forth across the floor when he heard the young mans step the old man paused and threw back his head with the spirited motion that was reminiscent of the days when he was a famous orator

the boy he was the colonels only son was not yet twentyfourâa handsome fellow tall wellmade and as straight as an arrow as they stood there facing each other there was something very much alike in them age experience and contact with the world had hardened the lines about the old mans mouth which as yet in the boys only indicated firmness

 sit down walter said the colonel impressively  i have something of importance to say to you  something that will probably change your whole life his son had dropped into a chair opposite to the one which his father had taken his face was white with the apprehension that would tug at his heart but his eye was steady and his lips firm

alexander stewart could never quite forget that for two sessions he had been a speaking member of the ohio legislature and whenever he had anything of importance to say he returned involuntarily to his forensic manner

walter my son he began we have come upon startling times i have known all along that this crisis would come but i had not expected to see it in my day it was inevitable that the proud spirit of the south and the blind arrogance of the north should some day clash the clash has now come and with it the time for all strong men to take a decided stand we of the south âthe boy winced at the wordsâ  hold to our allegiance though we have changed our homes and this is the time for us to show our loyalty the south has been insulted her oldest institutions derided and her proudest names dragged in the dust by men who might have been their owners overseers but she does not bear malice she is not going to wage a war of vengeance but a holy war for truth justice and right i am going back home to help her the old mans own eloquence had brought him to his feet in the middle of the floor where he stood with eyes blazing  back home he repeated and you my sonâ he held out his hand

father walter also arose his face was deadly pale he did not take the proffered hand his father gazed at him first in amazement then as the truth began to reach his mind a livid flush overspread his face his hand dropped at his side and his fingers clenched

 you he half groaned half growled between his teeth

father listen to me

 there is but one thing i can listen to from you

 you can never hear that the north is my home i was born here i was brought up to revere the flag you taught me that

 but there is a reverence greater than that for any flag there is a time when a flag loses its right to respect

you never talked to me of any such reverence or told me of any such time and now i choose to stand by the home i know

this is not your home your home is the home of your family and the blood in your veins is drawn from the best in the south

 my blood was made by the streams and in the meadows  on the hills and in the valleys of ohio here where i have played from babyhood and father i cantâi cant may we not think differently and be friends  

no if you had the blood of a single yankee ancestor in you i would impute it to that and forgive the defection i could understand your weakening at this time but

it is not weakening walter flashed back if anything it is strengthening when a man stands up for his flag for the only flag he has ever known when it is attacked by traitors

 traitors   the old man almost shouted the word as he made a step towards the boy

 traitors yes traitors said the son unflinchingly

you cur you mongrel cur neither northern nor southern 

 father

 silence i wish the north joy of your acquisition the south is well shed of you you would have been like to turn tail and skulked in her direst extremity it is well to know what you are from the start

let me say a word father

 dont father me ill father no such weakkneed renegade as you are from today you are no son of mine i curse youâcurse you  the door opened softly and mrs stewart stood there transfixed gazing at the two men she was very pale for she had heard the last words

husband walterâ she said tremulously i have intruded but i could not help it

neither man spoke

 alexander she went on  take back those words i felt all along it would be so but you and walter can disagree with each other and yet be father and son walter come and shake hands with your father the boy took a reluctant step forward without raising his head but his father drew himself up and folded his arms

 alexander 

 i have no son he said simply

walter raised his eyes and answered  and i no father and seizing his mother in his arms he covered her face with kisses and rushed from the room presently they heard the front door close behind him

 call him back husband call him back for gods sake he is our son the only one leftâ call him back  

the colonel stood like a statue not a muscle of his face quivered and his folded arms were like iron in their tenseness  he has chosen his faith he said he relaxed then to receive his wifes fainting form in his arms he laid her gently on a couch and calling his daughter and the servants went to his own room

it is an awful thing to have to answer to a mother for her boy to see her eyes searching your soul with the question in them where is my child   but it is a more terrible thing to a fathers conscience when he himself is questioner accuser and culprit in one colonel stewart walked his room alone and thought with agony over his position he knew walters disposition it was very like his own and this was not a matter in which to say i have been hasty and then allow it to pass over how could he meet his wifes accusing eyes  how could he do without walter  the old man sat down and buried his face in his hands the fire and enthusiasm of indignation which had held him up during his interview with his son had left him and he was only a sad broken old man if he could but stay in his room forever away from everybody

as soon as his wife recovered from her swoon she sent for him he went tremblingly and reluctantly to her fearful of what he should see in her eyes the room though was sympathetically darkened when he went in he groped his way to the bed a hand reached out and took his and a voice said let us hurry let us go away from here alexander there was no anger no reproach in the tone only a deep lingering sadness that tore at his heartstrings

 margaret margaret  he cried and flinging his arms about her held her close while sobs shook his frame

his wife patted his grey hair  dont cry beloved she said this is war but let us go away from here let us go away

yes margaret he sobbed we will go away

preparations for the departure of the stewarts began immediately mrs stewart busied herself feverishly as one who works to drive out bitter thoughts but the colonel kept to his room away from the scenes of activity his trouble weighed heavily upon him his enthusiasm for the war seemed suddenly to have turned its heat malignantly upon him to consume him except when circumstances demanded his presence he kept away from the rest of the family no longer through the mere dread of meeting them for it was the spirit of his conscience to press the iron into his soul but because he felt that this was a trouble to be borne alone no one could share it no one could understand it

for several days no one outside of the house knew of the breach that had occurred in the stewart family nor of their intention to go south then they made the mistake of hiring the negro ed to help them finish their packing

the servant is always curious the negro servant particularly so and to the negro the very atmosphere of this silent house the constrained attitude of the family were pregnant with mystery then he did not see the son about it took but a little time for his curiosity to lead to the discovery that the son was boarding in the town this with scraps of information got from the other servants he put together and his imagination did the rest ed had a picturesque knack for lying and the tale that resulted from his speculations was a fabric worthy of its weaver

according to the negros version the colonel though long past the age for service was going down south to be a general and wanted to take his son walter along with him to be a captain walter had refused and he and his father had come to fisticuffs in which the young man was worsted for ed added admiringly by way of embellishment  do ol cunnel is a mighty good man yit after this the young man had left his fathers house because he thought he was too old to be whipped

this was the tale with which ed regaled the people for whom he worked about dorbury but be it said in vindication of their common sense that few if any believed it that there was some color of fact in the matter they could not doubt when it was plainly shown that walter stewart was not living at his fathers house there must have been a breach of some kind they admitted but eds picture must be reduced about onehalf

the story however threw young stewart into an unenviable prominence as modest as it is natural for a young man of twentythree to be it gave him no pleasure to have people turn around to look after him with an audible  there he goes 

at first his feeling towards his father had been one not so much of anger as of grief but he had no confidant and the grief that could not find an outlet hardened into a grief that sticks in the throat that cannot be floated off by tears or blown away by curses that will not melt that will not move that becomes rebellion it was all unjust he thought of the ideas of independence that his father had inculcated in him how he had held up to him the very strength of manhood which he now repudiated how he had set before him the very example upon which be now modeled his conduct and then abased it he had built and broken his own idol and the ruins lay not only about his feet but about his sons it was a hard thought in the boys mind and for a time he felt as if he wanted to hold his way in the world asking of nothing is it right or wrong  leaning to no beliefs following no principles this was the first mad rebellion of his flowering youth against the fading ideals against the rerelation of things as they are but with the rebound which marks the dividing line between youth and manhood he came back to a saner view of the affair

it came to him for the first time that now was a period of general madness in which no rule of sane action held good and yet he could not wholly forgive his father his unnecessary harshness the understanding of his unmerited cruelty came to him but his condemnation of it did not leave only once did he ask himself whether the cause for which he stood was worthy of all that he had sacrificed for it home mother comfort and a fathers love then there came back to him the words his father had uttered on a memorable occasion walter principle is too dear to be sacrificed at any price and his lips closed in a line of determination resolutely he turned his face away from that path of soft delight he was no longer his fathers son  but he was enough of a stewart to believe strongly

he felt sorely hurt though when he found that eds story while failing to find a restingplace in the ears of the sensible had percolated the minds of the lower classes of the town he heard ominous threats hurled at the old copperhead which he knew to be directed at his father all that lay in his power to do he did to stem the tide of popular anger but he felt it rising steadily and knew that at any moment it might take the form of open violence or insult to his family this must be avoided he determined and night after night after he had left home he patrolled the sidewalk in front of his fathers house and the griefstricken mother reaching out her arms and moaning for her son in her sleep did not know that he was there watching the low flicker of the night lamp in her room

it was nearly a week after the memorable evening interview between walter and his father that the young man received by the hands of the gossiping ed a note from his mother it ran we expect to go tomorrow evening at seven will you not come and tell me goodbye walter was brave and he gulped hard this was from his mother and neither principle nor anything else separated him from her lie would go he wrote  i will come in by the side gate and wait for you in the arbor

the evening found him there a half hour before the time set but a mothers fond eagerness had outrun the hours and mrs stewart was already there awaiting him she embraced her son with tears in her eyes and they talked long together from the window of his room colonel stewart watched them his eyes lingered over every outline of his sons figure once he placed his hand on the sash as if to raise it then he checked himself and took a turn round the dismantled room when he came back to the window walter was taking his leave the old man saw his wife clinging about the boys neck he saw the young fellow brush his hand hastily across his eyes again his hand went out involuntarily to the window but he drew it back and ground it in the other while a groan struggled up from under the weight of his pride and tore itself from his pale lips gone gone walter was gone and with him his chance of reconciliation he saw his wife return but he locked his door and sat down to battle with his pride and grief until it was time to go

it was a wornlooking old man that came down to step into the carriage an hour later but colonel stewart never looked more the soldier walter was at a safe point of vantage watching to get a last glimpse of his family he was heavy of heart in spite of his bravery but suddenly his sadness flamed into anger a crowd had been gathering about his fathers house but he thought it only the usual throng attracted by curiosity as his father stepped into the carriage he heard a sudden huzza the people had surrounded the vehicle a band appeared and there floated to his ears the strains of the rogues march a red mist came before his eves but through it he could not help seeing that they were taking the horses from the shafts he waited to see no more but dashed down the street he forgot his sorrow he forgot the breach he forgot everything but his fury it was his father his father

they were drawing the carriage toward him now and the band was crashing out the hateful music he reached the crowd and dashed into it like a young bull knocking the surprised rioters and musicians right and left he was cursing he was pale and his lip was bleeding where he had bitten it the music stopped those who held the shafts dropped them they were too astonished by the sudden onslaught to move then a growl rose like the noise of wild beasts and the crowd began to surge upon the young man forward and back they swept him struggling and fighting then the carriage door opened and colonel stewart stepped out his face was the face of an angel in anger or perhaps of a very noble devil

 stop he thundered and at his voice the uproar ceased  take up the shafts my fellowcitizens he said sneeringly  this act is what i might have expected of you but go on it is meet that i should be drawn by such cattle

then turning to his son he said  sir i need no defence from you there was a joyous cry at this though it was the young mans salvation some one hurled a stone which grazed the old mans head walter was at the cowards side in an instant and had felled him to the ground for an instant something that was not contempt gleamed in the old mans eye but walter turned and lifting his hat to his father backed from the crowd they took up the shafts again the musicians gathered their courage and with a shout they bore the colonel away to the station

walter stood looking after the carriage he had caught a glimpse of his mothers face from the window for a moment and to the day of his death he never forgot the look she gave him it was to be a help to him in the time of his trouble and strength when the fight was hottest his anger at his father had melted away in the flash of action but he could not help wonder if the colonels insult to him had been sincere or only for the purpose of accomplishing what it did the diversion of the crowd he knew that he had been saved rough handling and that his father had saved him and he went home with a calmer spirit than he had known for many days

despite the intolerance which kept stephen van doren always at loggerheads with bradford waters he was in reality a fairly reasonable man he was as deep and ardent a partisan of the south as colonel stewart and if he was not less anxious that his son should espouse her cause at least he had more patience and more faith to wait for his boy to turn to the right path

from the time that robert van doren was driven from his sweethearts gate there had been a silence between father and son as to the latters intentions but as the feverish preparations went on stephen van doren grew more and more uneasy and excited it was hard not to speak to his son and find out from him where he stood in regard to the questions which were agitating his fellows but a stalwart pride held the old man back there were times when he told himself that the boy only waited for a word from him but that word he determined never to say the south did not need the arm of any one who had to be urged to fight for her

the struggle and anxiety which possessed his fathers mind was not lost on the young man and he sympathized with the trouble while he respected the fine courtly breeding which compelled silence under it as for himself he must have more time to think this was no light question which he was now called upon to decide

the times were asking of every american in his position  are you an american or a southerner first   the answer did not hang ready upon his lips where foes from without assailed it was the country the whole country could there arise any internal conditions that would make it different 

finally he could not stand the pained question in his fathers eyes any longer a word would let him know that at least his son was thinking of the matter which agitated him

father he said you are worrying about me

the old man looked up proudly you are mistaken was the reply i have no need to worry about my son he is a man

robert gave his father a grateful glance and went on  you are right you need not worry i am looking for the right when i find it you may depend upon me to go that way

 i am sure of it bob  exclaimed the old man grasping his sons hand  i am sure you will you are a man and must judge for yourself i have confidence in you bob

 thank you father

they pressed each others hands warmly the cloud cleared from van dorens brow and the subject was dropped between the two

between tom waters and his father from the very first there had been only harmony there was a brief period of silence between them when bradford waters first fully realized that his age put him hopelessly beyond the chance of being beside his son in the ranks at the first intimation that he was too old he had scouted the idea and said that it often took a grey head to manage a strong arm rightly but when he saw the full quota of militia made up and his application denied it filled him with poignant grief

 i had so hoped to be by your side tom in this fight he said

 its best father as it is though for theres mary to be taken care of

yes the fever in our blood makes us forget the nearest and dearest nowadays but im glad that you will be there to represent me anyway

from that time all the enthusiasm which waters had felt in the northern cause was centred upon his son he watched him on the parade ground with undisguised pride and when tom came home in the glory of his new uniform with the straps upon his square shoulders bradford waters voice was husky and there was a moisture in his eyes as he said  im glad now that its you who are going tom for i understand what a poor figure i must have made among you young fellows

the son was too joyous to be much affected by the sadness in his fathers tone and he onlj laughed as he replied  i tell you father those steel muscles of yours would have put many a young fellow to the blush when it came to endurance

well it isnt my chance youre the soldier

the young fellow would have felt a pardonable pride could he have known that his father was saying over and over again  lieutenant thomas waters lieutenant thomas waters why not captain or colonel   and his pride would have been tempered could he have known also that back of this exclamation was the question  will he come back to me  

for so long a time had bradford waters been both father and mother to his son that he had come to have some of the qualities of both parents and if it were true as mary said that in this war the womens hearts would suffer most then must he suffer doubly with the womans heart of the mother and the mans heart of the father the ache had already begun for the struggle was on between the tenderness of the one and the pride of the other  between the mothers love and the fathers ambition at the barracks or on the parade ground in the blare of the trumpets where lieutenant waters strode back and forth ambition conquered but in the long still nights when his boy tom was in his thoughts and dreams only love and tenderness held him

the shifting scenes in the panorama of the opening war brought about the day of departure the company to which tom waters belonged was to leave on an afternoon train for columbus and dorbury was alert to see them off friend and foe swayed by the same excitement the town took on the appearance and spirit of a gala day the streets were full of sightseers pedestrians riders and drivers for the event had brought in the farmers from surrounding townships here and there the blue of a uniform showed among the crowd and some soldier made his way proudly the centre of an admiring crowd a troop of little boys fired by the enthusiasm of their elders marched to and fro to the doubtful tune of a shrill fife and an asthmatic drum people who lived a long distance away and who consequently had been compelled to start long before sunrise now lolled lazily around munching gingerbread or sat more decorously in the public square eating their delayed breakfasts

about the barracks which were the quarters of the militia was gathered a heterogeneous crowd within there was the sound of steady tramping as the sentinels moved back and forth over their beats their brothers without were doing a more practical duty for it took all the bravery of their bristling bayonets to keep back the curious there was a stir among them like the rippling of the sea by the wind when a young man in the uniform of a private of the light guards hastened up and elbowed his way towards the door there was a buzz a single shout and then a burst of cheers as the young man flushed and hot leaped up the steps and entered the door some who had been his enemies were in the crowd some who had laid violent hands on him only a few days before but they were all his friends now it was walter stewart he had followed the leadings of his own mind and stayed with his company but somehow the applause of these people who were all his fathers enemies was very bitter to him

after stewart came a figure that elicited a shout from the throng and a burst of laughter it was the town crier negro ed who was to go as servant to the militia captain horace miller

hi ed called one aint you afraid theyll get you and make you a slave and dont forget to stop at dorbury when you get to running  

ed was usually goodnatured and met such sallies with a grin but a new cap and a soldiers belt had had their effect on him and he marched among his deriders very stern dignified and erect as if the arduous duties of the camp were already telling upon him the only reply he vouchsafed was nemmine you people nemmine you got to git somebody else to ring yo ol bell now the crowd laughed there came a time when they wept at thought of that black buffoon  the town nigger the town drunkard when in the hospital and by deathbeds his touch was as the touch of a mother when over a bloodswept field he bore a womans dearest and nursed him back to a broken life but no more of that the telling of it must be left to a time when he who says aught of a negros virtues will not be cried down as an advocate drunk with prejudice

to the listeners outside the barracks came the noise of grounding arms and the talk of men relieved from duty they were to go to their homes until time to form in the afternoon the authorities were considerate if men must go to war goodbyes must be said women must weep and children cling to their fathers the last sad meal must be taken the net of speculation must be thrown out to catch whatever motes of doubt the wind of war may blow and the questions must fly  will he come back  shall i see him again  

yes women must weep in spite of all the glory of war they will cling to the neck of the departing husband brother or son poor foolish creatures they have no eye then for the brave array the prancing charger and the gleaming arms they have no ear for the inspiring fife and drum

the men were soberer than they had yet been when they filed out of the barracks at last the reality of things was coming home to them it was all very well this drilling on the common in the eyes of the town but now for the result of their drills

midway among them came tom and walter side by side lieutenant and private  they had not yet come to feel the difference in their positions

well well be on the way in a few hours said walter as they passed out beyond the borders of the crowd  and im glad of it

im glad too now that were in it walt and im glad to be in it myself but it means a whole lot doesnt it  

of course youre leaving your family replied walter tentatively

 more than that

both young men smiled walter a little bit sheepishly he had been toms rival for nannie woods affections and had taken defeat at his hands

 oh pursued tom  if the fight is going to be as short as many people think a mere brush in fact we shant be gone longâbut

 the people who think this is going to be a mere brush dont know the temper of the south

 i believe you therell be a good many of us who wont come back

 oh well its one time or another and walter smiled again as they came to the corner and tom turned up the street towards nannies house  so long

 so long until this afternoon and then the young lieutenant found himself staring straight into the eyes of robert van doren for a moment the feeling of antagonism which had shown in his conversation with mary surged over him but in the next he remembered his promise he held out his hand

 hello bob he said  i guess its hello and goodbye together

bob grasped his hand warmly well i reckon nobodyll be gladder to say howdyedo to you again than i tom good luck

 thanks bob

 give my regards to mary

 i will tom started on suddenly he turned and found van doren watching him with a strange expression on his face he went back and impulsively seized the others hand  say bob whats what  

the blood went out of van dorens face  god knows he said in a pained voice  thats just what ive been asking myself and i dont know yet tom

the young man paused ashamed of this show of feeling then he said  well anyway bob good luck and they went their ways

in his heart tom believed that robert van doren would eventually go to the confederacy and he resented what to him seemed flagrant disloyalty ohio was van dorens adopted home and a tender mother she had been to him out of her bounty she had given him well now to go over to her enemies the fight in toms mind as to his manner of meeting van doren had been brief but sharp the result was less the outcome of generosity than the result of a subtle selfishness it was as all putting ones self in anothers place is the sacrifice which we make to the gods of our own desires the concession we make to our weakness he forgave robert not because mary loved and was about to lose him but because he himself loved nannie and for a time at least was about to lose her the grasp which he gave bobs hand meant pity for himself as well as for his sister

there was a flash of pride on nannies face though tears stood in her eyes as she saw her lover approaching she had been expecting him and was at the gate the soft april sunshine was playing on her goldbrown hair and in her simple pink dimity gown she looked akin to the morning glories that blossomed about her she opened the gate and took the young mans hand and together they passed around the side of the house to a rustic bench among the verbenas and sweetwilliams

there was a simplicity and frankness about nannies love that was almost primitive it was so natural so spontaneous so unashamed it looked you as squarely in the face as did her coquetry but there was no sign of coquetry now gone were all her whims and quips her airs and graces there had come into her life the transmuting element that suddenly makes a maid a woman

for a time the two sat in silence on her flowersurrounded bench tom afraid to trust his voice and nannie finding a certain satisfaction in merely pressing the hand she held

finally he broke silence  well the time is about here nannie

yes she replied drawing his hand closer and caressing it  youâyoure glad of course   glad well thats a hard question im glad of course butâbut â he struggled to grasp the elusive idea that was floating in his brainâ  but there is more than one kind of being glad i am glad to be sure as a citizen and im sorry as a man

 youre sorry because

you know why little girl im sorry to leave you im sorry to take any chance of never being able to call you wife it may be cowardly but at such a time the thought is forced irresistibly upon a man

 it isnt cowardly tom it isnt its manly i know it is because youre thinking about me oh but i shall miss you when you are gone but ill pray for you and ill try to be as brave up here as you are down there you are wrong tom you are very brave braver than the men who do not think to sorrow for the women but go rushing into this war with a blind enthusiasm that will not let them feel youre brave youre brave and im going to be but i cant help it  he caught her in his arms and strained the weeping face to his breast

 darling darling my brave little girl dont cry a man is so helpless so wordless in these times he can do nothing but stammer and exclaim and lavish caresses

after the first gust of weeping was over she raised her tearstained face and said with a rainy smile  i want you to understand tom im not crying all for grief its just as much pride as it is sorrow oh ive been spoiling your uniform there was somewhat of a return of her old coquetry of manner and her lover was unspeakably cheered he had felt in that brief moment of passion as he had never felt before how near the ocean of tears lay to the outer air and how strong was their surge against the barriers of manhood but her change of manner gave him the courage to say the tender goodbyeâthe farewell too sacred to be spied upon ah how his heart ached within him how his throat swelled and she smiled and smiled though her eyes grew moist again and he went on inspired by the heroism of a womans smile the smile she gives even when she sends her dear ones forth to face death

he bade goodbye to nannies family and went home to a sad meal and a repetition of his leavetakings

the sister hardly succeeded as well as the sweetheart in hiding her emotions her heart was already heavy and she wept not only at the fear of death but with the pain of love at the very last when he was going to take his place in the ranks she broke down and clung sobbing to her brother tom gulped and the father wringing his sons hands took away her arms and comforted her as best he could his eyes were bright and hard with the stress of the fight he was having with his feelings but his voice was firm bradford waters showed the mettle of his pasture a new englander born and reared in that section of the country which has produced the most and the least emotional people men the most conservative and the most radical the wisest philosophers and the wildest fanatics he did not disgrace his breeding

it was easier for tom when he was once more in the ranks then he felt again the infectious spirit of enthusiasm which swayed his comrades his heart beat with the drums he heard the people cheering as they went down the street handkerchiefs were waving from windows and balconies and there was a following that half walked half trotted to keep up with the swinging stride of the soldiers the train that was to bear them away stood puffing in the station they crowded on here and there a man dropped into his seat and buried his head in his hands but most of the heads were out of the windows nodding goodbyes there was an air of forced gayety over it all young fellows with flashed cheeks laughed hard laughs and bit their lips the moment after it was as if no one wanted to think and yet thought would come children were held up to be kissed their mothers weeping openly as is a mothers right fathers would start a reassuring sentence and suddenly break off to laugh brokenly short skeleton laughs that were sadder than tears then the bell gave warning and with a last rousing shout they were off for the state capital and the chances of war

tom caught the last glimpse of the family and nannie as they stood together on the platform they were waving to him and he waved back nannie and mary stood with clasped hands watching the long line of cars on the formers face there was sorrow and pride sorrow for her lover pride for her soldier but with the latter was only grief for she could not be thoroughly loyal to her brother without feeling disloyalty to her lover bradford waters walked with the crowd but the two girls stood still until they heard the train whistle and slacken speed as it crossed the railroad bridge then they turned and walked back to the town a few moments before the place had been all movement and life now it was left to silence and tears

there was one man whom the moving glory of the departing troops filled with no elation from a distant point bob van doren saw the blue lines swinging down the streets of dorbury and heard the shriek of the fifes but there was in him no inclination to join in the shouting or to follow the admiring crowd he was possessed neither by the joyous nor the sorrowing interest of the citizen nor yet by the cowardly shame of the stayathome while he could not go as far as his father and stay within the closed and shuttered house yet he felt that he was not a part of the flagflying drumbeating throng many of the young fellows there were his friends who had eaten and drunk with him they had laughed and sported together both as men and boys but now suddenly it seemed that something had arisen to make them entirely different and to put him as far apart from them and their sympathies as if they had been born at opposite poles what was this impalpable something  he asked himself was it in him in them or outside and beyond them both  or to get at the bottom of things did it really exist  their training and his had been very much the same they had gone to the same schools read the same books and adored the same heroes what then was the subtle element that had entered into life to divide them

these were the questions he was asking himself as he heard the farewell shouts of the departing troops and the clanging of the train bell then he turned and with his mind full of harassing inquiries took his way home

well theyre off to help rob the south of its niggers are they   said his father

 they are gone replied robert laconically he was not in the mood to talk

 humph southern buzzards will be the fatter for them

dont father thats horrible there are a good many of the fellows we both knew and liked among them

stephen van doren flashed a quick suspicious glance at his son as he remarked  so much the worse for them

 i wish it might have been settled some other way pursued robert drearily  id rather have let the south secede than institute this orgie of unnatural bloodshed brother against brother friend against friend

again his father flashed that white questioning look at him then he rose abruptly and left the room robert hardly noticed the movement so absorbed was he in his own thoughts but sat staring blankly before him he was momentarily aroused from his reverie by the reentrance of his father who laid an old miniature upon the table before him and went out again without a word robert picked up the picture it was the portrait of a beautiful young woman painted in the style of forty years beforeâhis motherâ and her name was written on a piece of yellow paper stuck in the frame  virginia helson fairfax courthouse virginia he gazed at the picture and read and rere d the inscription  fairfax courthouse what a quaint oldfashioned southern sound it had it seemed redolent of magnolias and jessamine and soft as the speech of its own citizens but was that home or this the place where his youth and early manhood had been passed which was home the place of memories or the place of action  what makes home dreams or labor the hopes of boyhood or the hard reality of later life

to young van doren the memory of his mother who had lived only two years after coming north had been as a guiding star and he knew that it was to recall this that his father had brought him the picture it was apparent that he must have been strongly moved for that little worn and faded miniature seldom left the old mans desk his father felt deeply  so did he his mothers eyes were pleading with him sentiment said his mind truth said his heart

finally he laid the picture face downward on the table he told himself it must not enter into his thoughts at all but his mind would not let it go eellike his consciousness wrapped itself about it and would not let it go he felt guilty when the thought assailed him that perhaps the face of another woman which was graven on his heart argued more strongly than the pictured one  mary mary his heart said  is my love for you blinding me to right and justice  while other men decide and do i stand still here waiting and asking what to do he thought of walter stewart and the apparent ease with which he had made a bard decision and his anger flashed up against his own impotence  but still his inclination wavered weakly back and forth the union the confederacy the place of his boyhood and the home of his manhood

at last he asked himself the question which he had so long shunned what he believed  and he was compelled to answer that his convictions leaned to the side of those who were in arms against the general government then there was but one thing to do he stood up very pale and sad of countenance trembling on the verge of a decision but suddenly as out of nowhere a voice seemed to sound into his very being  has love no right    good god he cried aloud  shall i go on this way forever wavering shall i go on being a coward i who hate cowardice   his heart was burning with pain misery and anger and shame at himself and yet he could not he dared not say where he stood the fact that he tried to fight out of recognition and herein lay his greatest cowardice was that he did not feel the southern cause deeply enough to risk losing the woman he loved by its espousal nor could he leap openeyed into the northern movement for which he had no sympathy had he felt either as deeply as did bradford waters or his own father he would not have hesitated where to take his place

the struggle in his mind had not just begun from the very moment that the atmosphere had become electric with the currents of opposing beliefs he had felt himself drawn into the circuit but by nature always inexpressive he had said nothing and left those who thought of him to the conviction that he was unmoved by passing events but the lone nights and the grey dawns knew better many a time had he gone to bed after a period of earnest selfsearching satisfied at last and saying  it is true i shall take my stand only to wake and find that everything was changed in the light of day many a time had morning found him in his chair where he had sat all night trying to wrench order out of the chaos of his mind and now now it was no better

there was a step in the hall and his father looked in on him for a moment and passed on robert knew that he was going through an ordeal no less terrible than his own and he wished that it might be ended even if it brought strife and separation between them as it had done between walter stewart and his father the thought had hardly left his brain when it was occupied by another was he to be watched like a child who was likely to get into mischief  this was too much too much he had borne with his father as long as he could now he would show him that he was his own master to go his own way anyway it was his concern alone with whichever side he went he must be shot for himself if he stayed at home it was he who must bear the sneers and jokes who must live down the contumely whose right was it then to institute an annoying surveillance over him  not even his fathers it had come to a pretty pass when a man might not think without interruption bah he could not call his soul his own it was only the sign of his nervous condition that he should fall into this state of petulant anger

then unaccountably his whole mental attitude changed and the appearance of his fathers questioning face in the door struck him only with a ludicrous aspect he thought of himself as some coquettish but wavering maiden who bade her lover wait outside until she could answer the momentous question yes or no and he burst out laughing

but his mirth was short and unnatural

 i am either a fool or a brute he said  i know that father and mary are both watching me but they have a right to watch and they have the right to demand from me the answer in their hearts

he paused as if a new thought had struck him then he rose and took his hat  ill do it he exclaimed passionately  ill go to her and let her help me why havent i thought of it before   he passed out and called to his father as he went  im going out for a while father

 all right was the answer but the words that followed solemnly were  the boy is driven out into the street even as the men possessed of devils spirit were driven to the rocks and the tombs it is the evil spirit of northern narrowness working in him

it was with a heart somewhat lightened by the hope of relief that robert van doren hastened along the street towards the waters home so much had passed in the days since he had last stood at the gate that the little difference between him and the father of the woman he loved appeared as a very small thing when two great sections of a nation are arrayed against each other there is no time for the harboring of petty angers two thoughts held him he would see mary again she would help him and his honor should come to its own these thoughts left no room in his mind for malice

no misgiving touched him even when he stood at the door and his knock brought mary to the door she looked at him with a frightened face and turned involuntarily to glance at her father who sat within

 is anything the matter   she said in a low hurried voice

 nothing only i want your advice and help said van doren stepping across the threshold

at the voice and step bradford waters rose and faced the visitor and his face began working with growing anger  what do you mean by invading my house again robert van doren

 i came to see mary

waters took his daughter by the hand as if he would put himself between the girl and her lover  mary can have no dealings with you or your kind we do not want you here i have told you that before your way and ours lie apart  they have not always lain apart and need not now van dorens surprise was stronger than his resentment as he looked into the old mans passionate face could a few days work such a change in a man 

 they must and shall lie apart waters took him up hotly  what you have been to this family you cannot be again

 what have i done to forfeit your respect  

 it isnt what youve done but what you are

how do you know what i am

 thats it at least your father has the courage to come out and say what he is you havent at least he is a man

father father cried mary  dont say any more  

 im sorry to see a daughter of mine said waters turning upon her pleading for one of those whom her brother has gone south to kill the girl put her hands up quickly as if she would check the words upon her fathers lips van doren had turned very white he stood as one stunned all his hopes of help had been suddenly checked and instead of sympathy he had received hard words but a smile curved his lips

 have i not said enough robert van doren  

yes was the reply still with a quiet smile  you have said enough and he turned towards the door

mary sprang away from her father  robert robert dont go she cried  he doesnt mean it this great trouble has made him mad bradford waters started to speak but stopped as the young man put off the girls detaining hand  i must go mary he said  your fathor is right we have come to the parting of the ways i have not had the courage to say where i stood but i have it now i came for help to decide a momentous question i have got it goodbye mary goodbyeâmr waters the confederacy may thank you for another recruit

he opened the door and passed out the old mans voice ringing after him  better an open rebel than a copperhead a hard look came into the girls eyes

you neednt worry said her father its good riddance she made no reply

in spite of all that passed robert van doren went home in a lighter frame of mind

 im going to leave tomorrow he said to his father

you have made your choice  

 the south needs me returned the young man evasively his father came to him and kissed him on both cheeks then he took the miniature from the table and placed it on his breast

i knew that your mother would not plead with you in vain he said and robert smiled bitterly

there is a tragic quietness about a town whose best and bravest have gone to a doubtful battlefield the whole place seems hushed and on tiptoe as if listening for some sound from the field the cry of a cricket shivers the silenee into splinters of sound and each one pierces the ear with a sharpness which is almost pain it was under such a pall of stillness that dorbury lay immediately after the departure of the troops it was not altogether the torpor that succeeds an upheaval part of it was the breathless silence of expectancy as when from a height some one hurls a boulder into space and waits to hear it fall of course it would be some time before they could expect to hear from the new soldiers and yet dorbury listened expectant hand to ear

the spring sunshine not yet strong nor violent enough to destroy its own sweetness fell with a golden caress on the quiet streets to some who went to and fro bowed with anxiety it seemed strange that in such a time nature should go on performing her processes as she had always done their hearts seemed to stand still but time went on the flowers bloomed the grasses sprung and the restless river sang to the silent town

the tension of suspense had told greatly upon bradford waters character from being a gentle father he had grown to be short almost harsh to mary his love and fear for his soldier son had made him blind to the pain his daughter suffered

he was so far gone in the earnestness of his views that ho could see nothing but a perverse disloyalty in his daughters feeling towards robert van doren his friendship for the young fellow had changed with the changing of the times and he could not understand that a womans love may be stronger than her politics her heart truer to its affections than her head to its principles

it can hardly be said of mary that she felt more than she thought but her emotions were stronger than her convictions it was the worse for her state of mind that for two widely different reasons the taking of her brother and the estrangement from her lover she was placed in a resentful position against the cause that she naturally would have espoused

still at first she kept a certain appearance of loyalty and when some of the girls with impetuous enthusiasm started a sewing circle for the soldiers she joined with them and began to ply her needle in the interest of the union troops but among these friends of undivided interests it was not always pleasant for mary all about her she heard sentiments that did not comport with the feelings of one who had loved ones on both sides of the great question over the lint and flannels that passed through the sewers hands were made several hot and thoughtless speeches that seared the very soul of one poor girl they were not intentional most of them had they known that one among them suffered from their unthinking remarks would have held their tongues others not more than one or two be it said knew that every sneer they cast at the army of the south every hard wish they expressed tore like an arrow through the tender heart of the pale sad girl in the corner who bent so silently over her work

 i do wish said little martha blake one day  that the whole southern army was drowned in the depths of the sea they are so troublesome

 what would their sisters do   asked mary quietly

 oh really they seem such monsters to me that i never thought of their having sisters

mary smiled  and yet they have she said  some of them perhaps making just as foolish a wish about our brothers as you have made about them

 i know its foolish martha pursued  but it has never seemed to me that those people down there who have done so much to tempt the northern government are quite the same as we are

unconsciously mary took the defensive and stepped over into the point of view of the man whom in her heart she was defending

 but why she exclaimed  do you say the northern government the very mention of the word denies the principle for which we claim we are fightingâthat there is no north no south but one country inseparable into sections

 i had never thought of that said martha

 i dont think any of us have thought of it put in anice crowder  except those who have very dear friends among the traitors

mary turned deadly pale for she knew that bob van dorens decision had just become generally known she turned a pair of flashing eyes on anice as she replied no man is a traitor who fights for what he believes to be right

 any man is a traitor who lives under one flag and leaves it to fight under another

 a man is accountable only to his conscience and his god

yes when he has proved traitor to every other tie only then

the words cut mary like a knife she rose work in hand and stood quivering with passion as she looked down on her insulter

 then the woman who cares for such a man who dares stand up for him is a traitor too   she cried as she flung her work to the floor

yes said anice acidly

mary started towards the door but a chorus of girls voices checked her

 dont go mary they cried  we know we dont blame you but the girls heart was overburdened and bursting into tears she fled from the room she heard the hubbub of voices as she went hastily out of the house and even in that moment of grief she was glad that some of the girls there would be quick to defend her she knew who must have been foremost in this defence when she heard a light step behind her and felt nannie woods arm about her waist

dont cry mary said nannie soothingly

 no one minds anice crowder or anything she says anyway i gave her a good piece of my mind before i left there and so did some of the rest of the girls i just told her right to her face that shed have more feeling for people if she had a lover on either side

mary was forced to smile a little at her friends impetuosity but from her heart she thanked the girl and drew her arm tighter about her waist

 i suppose a nice thinks that i can send my love where i will and that i am to blame if it does not go in the right or what she thinks the right direction

 shes a cat was the emphatic rejoinder  and i for one will never go to their old sewingcircle well sew together just you and i mary and while im making things for tom theres no reason why you shouldnt make a keepsake for bob to take with him

mary gasped

 oh thats all right i know if i lived down south and it was tom id

hush nannie said mary hurriedly you mustnt say those things

 i will say them and i dont care

they reached the waters gate and the girls parted there for nannie the incident closed but it was destined to cause mary waters even more suffering

womens sewing circles are not usually noted for their reticence and the institution at dorbury was no exception within an hour after it happened the whole affair was out to the town and the story in a highly embellished form reached bradford waters ears

he went home in a white passion mary had got supper and was sitting idly by the window when her father burst into the room she looked up and saw on the instant that he had heard

what is this i hear of you at the sewingcircle  

 i suppose you have heard the truth or part of it

 so it has come to the pass where my daughter must defend a former copperhead and now an avowed rebel 

the man whom i defended if defence it could be called was to me neither copperhead nor rebel he was my lover i have nothing to do with his politics the war has nothing to do with my love

she was calmer than usual and her very quietness exasperated her father the more

 ill have no more of it he cried passionately ill have no more of it love or no love a house divided against itself cannot stand my house must be with me and if my daughter feels called upon to go over to the enemys side she must go over to the enemys house my house shall not shelter her

 father

enough i have said my say you must abide by it ill have no more such stories as i have heard today poured into my ears either give up that renegade or take your love for him to another roof

he flung himself petulantly into a chair and fell to his supper mary did not answer him only a look of bard defiance came into her gentle eyes it might have struck bradford waters had he seen it but he did not look at her again

a little kindness might have done much to soften the rigor of marys feelings and so changed the course of events for she was easily swayed through her affections she would not have given up van doren his hold upon her was too strong but she would have repressed herself even to the hiding of her feelings had she not been driven into the open revolt to which her fathers harsh treatment goaded her now the determination to be true to her lover at all hazards came upon her so strongly that her attitude really became one of aggression

it was now that the remembrance of nannies thoughtless words came to her and she asked herself why not why should she not make and give van doren a keepsake to take into the ranks with him  she had suffered sorrow for his sake  in effect she had been forcibly almost involuntarily cast on his side she had to withstand contempt and reviling would this one show of affection be so much more 

that evening mary was very busy sewing and so part of the next day until the time when her father came home then she hastened to leave her stitching to go about her supper for in the absorption of her new idea she had neglected it

bradford waters looked at the work which had stood between him and his meals with an illconcealed exasperation why couldnt women sew at the proper time and leave off properly  maybe though it was something for her brother tom if that were so he did not care he would go without his meals any time that tom might have a single comfort bless the brave boy his face softened and he looked with filling eyes as his mind dwelt on tender memories of the soldier son suddenly the bit of embroidery there on the shelf seemed to take on a new interest for him

mary was crossing the floor with a plate in her hand when he rose and going to the shelf picked up the work she made an involuntary motion as if to stop him and take it away then she paused rigid

he stood smiling down on the sewing  something for tom he began and then the smile froze and the words died on his lips as he turned it over it was only a little maroon housewife such as any soldier might need in the emergencies of camp life but on its front were embroidered the letters  r v d

he stood gazing at them for a moment as if they were cabalistic and the mystery was just filtering through his mind then with trembling hands he threw it across the room

my god he cried  and i thought it was for her brother and it is for the comfort of the enemy 

 it is only a keepsake said mary faintly she was frightened and weakened by his agitation

he looked at her as if he saw her but dimly then he said in a hard voice  this is the end of all pick it up pointing to the housewife  now go take the visible evidence of your treason and go and may god and your poor brother forgive you i never shall

at another time mary might have pleaded with him but she was dazed and before she had recovered her presence of mind her father had left the house then she too as if still in a dream picked up the offending gift and went out

she could not understand her father she did not know what the gift to the enemy meant to him how he felt as if a serpent had stung him from his own hearth

she went mechanically at first scarce knowing which way she tended then thought came to her and with the keepsake still in her hand she turned dryeyed towards nannie woods house

 it was such a little thing she murmured as she went into the house and then suddenly unconsciousness came to her when mary recovered consciousness it was to find herself lying in nannies own bed and her friend beside her for a moment she did not remember what had happened and then the full flood tide of recollection swept over her mind she buried her head on nannies bosom and sobbed out her story

never mind said nannie never mind youre going to come here and stay with me thats what you are going to do no hardhearted fathers are going to bother you thats what theyre not

say what you will there is always something of the child left in every woman and though the softhearted girl talked and cooed to mary as she would have done to a restless child the heart broken woman was soothed by it

 dont you think father ought to understand nannie  it isnt because robert is a copperhead or a rebel whichever he is that i love him but in spite of it

 mary said nannie and her voice was meditative and her face dreamy  dont you know there never was a man yet who knew how or why a woman loved a new wisdom a half playful wisdom though it was seemed to have come to the girl some women never grow clearsighted until their eyes are opened to the grey form of an oncoming sorrow nannie was of this class  but she went on laughing its all the fault of father adam men are so much the sons of their fathers and it all comes of giving him the first woman while he was asleep and not letting him know when nor how

 and yet men do love said mary seriously

oh of course they love butâ the girls eyes met and both of them blushed  it wont last long anyhow mary so whats the use of being sad  lets talk about them nannie cuddled down close to the bed

 about whom   was the deceitful question

 oh you minx you know whom whats the use of asking  i wonder where tom is tonight  

its hard telling theyve been delaying them so much along the road

 i dont think its right at all they rushed them off toward washington and i think they ought to be allowed to get there hows a man going to distinguish himself if he cant get anywhere within sight of the enemy  

 i havent your spirit nannie i wish i had i forget all about distinction i only wonder how its all going to turn out and if those i love are coming back to me

 oh mary dont be like that of course theyre coming back tom and rob and all of them and were going to be happy again and there wont be any such names called as copperhead and rebel and abolitionist let me show you what ive made for tom id have given it to him before he went away but it was all so sudden oh my   and for an instant the girl dropped her chin upon her hands and sat staring into marys eyes without seeing her then she sprang up and darted away in a few minutes she returned bearing with her some mysterious piece of feminine handiwork over which the two fell into the sweet confidences so dear to their age and sex

nannie light and frivolous as she seemed had a deep purpose in her mind she saw clearly that the serious not to say morbid cast of marys character would drive her to lay too much importance upon her fathers act and so perhaps let it prove more injurious to her than was necessary without marys depth she saw more clearly than bradford waters daughter that a little space of madness was at hand and every deed had to be judged not by its face alone but by its face as affected by the surrounding atmosphere just as the human countenance shows ghastly in one light and ruddy in another without really changing so she strove to draw her companions thought away from her sorrows and to avert the dangers she anticipated she succeeded only in part after awhile mary fell into a light sleep but on the morrow she awoke with a raging fever the strain on her nerves had been too great and she had succumbed to it

at the first intimation of danger to his daughter nannie had bid her father hasten to notify bradford waters

its no use said nathan woods waters is more set in his views than any man i ever saw if he believes that he had reason to send her out of his house not even death itself could take her back there unless those reasons were destroyed i know bradford waters and hes a hard man but the young woman insisted and as usual had her way her father went to waters there was not much tact or finesse about his approach he found his neighbor sitting down to a lonely breakfast and depositing his hat on the floor after an embarrassed silence he began

 kind of lonesome eh  

 these are no times for men to be lonesome

the lord makes every loyal man a host in himself

 thats good and yet it isnt the kind of host that crowds on each others toes and cracks jokes to keep the time agoing

youre irreverent nathan and besides this is no time to be cracking jokes the hour has come when the cracking of rifles is the only thing

 i didnt mean to be irreverent and im afraid you dont understand ive come for your own good waters the little girl sent me dont you think youre doing wrong  

no as the god of battles is my judge no   waters eyes were blazing and he had forgotten his breakfast

 your daughter is at my house and she is sick very sick

 i have no daughter

 god gave you one

 ho also said that a house divided against itself cannot stand

 what of that  

 my house is my son tom and myself

 what of your daughter mary  

waters turned upon him his sad bright eyes sad in spite of their hardness

 if thy right hand offend thee cut it off he said with a slashing gesture

 thats not right said nathan woods  its not right i say to be using the scripture to stand between you and your daughter

 i have no daughter the daughter i had has gone out after other gods than mine

the old new england fanaticism the puritanical intolerance was strong in the man

 my god exclaimed his opposer  quit mutilating the bible to bolster up your own pride marys sick shes sick enough to die maybe

 if she die away from home it is gods will perhaps his punishment said waters solemnly is it jepthah and his daughter

no it is david and absalom

nathan woods got up he looked long and hard at his old friend then taking his hat from the floor he started for the door there he paused

 and the war has done this he said slowly well bradford i say damn the war

the lonely father sat down again to his breakfast but the food disgusted him

mary sick and away from home what would tom say what would tom have done but then the memory of the whole wrong she had done him and her brother came back upon the old man and he shut his teeth hard it was a crime it was treason let her go her way and die among the people who were willing to condone her faults he could not it was not flesh and blood but soul and spirit that counted now it was not that the south had touched his body and that mary had sided with them it was that a rebellious section had touched not his soul but the soul of his country and his daughter had bade them godspeed this was the unforgivable thing this was the thing that put the girl outside the pale of parental pardon so thinking he rose from the table and went out of the disordered house

dorbury was a town of just the size where any ones business is every ones else so it was an impossibility that the breach between mary and her father should long remain a secret a halfdozen neighbors knew the story an hour after the doctor had left nathan woods door and had told it in varying degrees of incorrectness

one gossip said that waters daughter had sought to elope with robert van horen had even got as far as the railway station when her father had found her and brought her back she was now imprisoned at the woods with nannie to watch her

another knew on good authority that mary had denounced the union declared her intention of doing all she could to aid the confederacy and had then fled from home to escape from her fathers just wrath anice crowders story of the affair in the sewingcircle gave color to this view of the case

still another however told how robert van dorens sweetheart mad for love of him and crazed at the choice he had made went wandering about the streets until friendly hands took her to nannies door one man had helped to take her there

so the rumors flew from lip to lip like shuttlecocks and the story grew with the telling of it

it would have been strange then if it had not reached the ears of the van dorens indeed it came to them on the first morning stephen van doren chuckled

 youre making a great stir for one poor copperhead he said to his son  youve made the wolfs stir in the waters sheepfold if youll only cause the yankees as much trouble when you have a musket in your hand i shall have reason to be proud of my son

robert turned angrily upon his father

 i wish you wouldnt talk that way about the matter father i dont like all this talk about mary and i wish i could stop it if the girl is suffering on account of loyalty to me god bless her its as little as my father could do to speak respectfully of her sacrifice

you do not understand me robert i do not laugh at the girl it is at her father and his folly that i laugh

 my love for his daughter makes the father sacred to me

 it must be a very strong love that makes bradford waters sacred

 my love for mary is deeper and stronger than any political prejudice that you or i might have

 very well bob very well go your own way my business is not with your love but with your politics if the latter be all right i shall not worry about the former

robert van doren spent little time after hearing of marys illness but betook himself immediately to her door hannie met him and drew him inside

 i am so sorry she began before he could tell his errand  but you cannot see her she is very sick and excitable oh robert isnt it awful this war and all that it is bringing to us  

 i wish it were over is mary delirious  

 at times and when she isnt we could almost wish she were she is so piteous

 her father has been hard upon her

 yes thats because hes delirious too every one is mad you and i and all of us when shall we come to our senses  

 god knows will you give mary this   he drew off his glove and laid it in nannies hand  tell her it is forbidden me to say goodbye to her but i leave this as a pledge and when i may i shall come back and redeem it

there were tears on nannies face as he turned toward the door with an impulsive movement she sprang forward and laid her hand on his arm  you may kiss me she said  and i will bear it to her and place it on her lips as you would have done

robert paused and bent over her lips as he might have done over marys and then with a wave of his hand he was gone and the door behind him closed nannie turned and went to marys room where she laid the glove on the pillow beside the pale face of the unconscious girl her brow was fevered and her hair dishevelled and every now and then incoherent words forced themselves between her parched lips

 i might have let him see her for a minute but it was better not to he would only have gone away with the misery of it in his heart then nannie stooped and kissed her friends lips  there mary she said  its from him oh my dear dear girl if your father could see you now i believe even his heart would melt towards you

but bradford waters was not to see her then

with bowed head and slow steps eaten by grief anger and anxiety he made his way towards the tobacco warehouse where he spent a large part of the day among his employees the place had never seemed quite the same to him since the first day tom had been absent from his desk he was thinking of him now as he went cheerlessly along what a head for business the boy had how much more of a success he would be than ever his father had been how the men loved him already it was no wonder that mary âbut maryââ he checked his thoughts and set his teeth hard there was no mary no sister any more she had broken the tie that bound her to tom and him he said this to himself because he did not know how women wrench and tear their hearts to keep from breaking ties that war with each other

he was absorbed in such thoughts when some one hailed him from a doorway

 what news   said a gentleman stepping out and joining him in his walk

no news except of delay said waters in a dissatisfied tone

where is the gallant first now 

they were already the  gallant first  although they had not yet got within powdersmelling distance of the enemy

 the gallant first is being delayed and played with somewhere between columbus and washington

 why should that be  

 it all comes of electing a gentleman governor

why now waters said davies smilingly  there is surely no objection to a governors being a gentleman  

 theres some objection to his being nothing else

 you remind me a good deal of the methodists and the devil whatever badhappens they are never at a loss to know where to put the blame i sometimes think that maybe the devil is painted a little black and likewise maybe dennison isnt to blame for everything that goes wrong in the handling of this situation

waters took this sally wdth none too good a grace davies was suspected of being lukewarm in the union cause and some had even accused him of positive southern sympathies he was a wealthy polished easygoing man and his defence of governor dennison whose acts every one felt free to blame at that time was more because he sympathized with that gentlemans aristocratic tastes and manners than because he wished delay to the progress of the unions forces

 so you think its dennison whos delaying the troops do you   he went on in a light bantering tone

 i think nothing about it i only know that our boys went rushing away to the state capital and under the impression that washington was menaced were sent flying east half equipped and totally unprepared for the conflict and i do know that despite their haste they have not reached their destination yet

 for which of course the devil is to blame  

 whoever is to blame this is no time for a banqueting bowing speechmaking governor we need a man of action in the chair now if we ever did look how things are going at columbus troops flocking there no provision made for them half of them not knowing whether they are to be accepted or not and the dandy who calls himself the chief executive sits there and writes letters my god what have we come to  

 have you ever thought that even a governor needs time to adjust himself to a great crisis  is it not true that the authorities of the general government insisted on the regiment in which your sons company is placed going directly to washington  

 then why are they not there instead of dallying about heaven knows where while a lot of other fellows are being quartered at the columbus hotels at extortionate prices which the taxpayers must pay  

 are you measuring your patriotism by dollars and cents  

 im measuring my patriotism by the greatest gift that any one could make to his country his only son have you an equal measure  

 no but i have some confidence in my state and my countrys officers and that is worth something in a time like this how dont get hot in the collar waters but you wait awhile and give dennison and the government time

yes wait wait thats been the cry right along wait until every road this side the capital of the country is blocked and from maryland and virginia the rebels march victorious into washington dont talk to me of waiting davies we have waited too long already thats whats the matter

davies laughed lightly as he turned down the street which led to his own office

bradford waters intemperance was a great index of the spirit of the time as it was manifested in ohio governor dennison was too slow for the radicals  too swift for the conservatives and incompetent in the opinion of both nothing could happen except what was good nothing could go wrong but that he was blamed for it all the men who volunteered could not be accepted and dennison was to blame the soldiers were delayed enroute and dennison was to blame rations were scarce and prices high and dennison was to blame and so all the odium that attaches to a great war which strikes a people unprepared for it fell upon the head of the hapless executive

in the days which followed the separation between mary and himself bradford waters was indeed a lonely man he was harassed not only by the breach with the child he loved and the public comments upon it but torn with anxiety for tom he spent his days and nights in brooding that made him harder and bitterer as time went on his fanatical dislike for stephen van doren grew because this man and his family seemed to him the author of all his woes he was not only just a copperhead now with a son in the confederate army he stood as the personification of the whole body of rebellion that had taken waters son and daughter and broken up his home he could have no pride in his soldier boy without cursing van doren for being one of those who had driven him into danger he could not grieve for the loss of mary without sending his imprecations flying in the same direction always to his distorted vision his oldtime enemy appeared as some relentless monster grinning in terrible glee at his distress

despite his moroseness however there was a wistful almost plaintive attitude in waters conduct towards his acquaintances he hovered between moods of grief anxiety and pride but always at the last the innate hardness of his nature triumphed there were times when his heart cried out for mary for some one of his blood to share his grief with him but he closed his lips and uttered no word to bring her back to him always a simpleliving man accustomed to no service save that of his own family he was compelled to employ a servant and this galled him not out of penuriousness but because he could not bear an alien in his home he felt her eyes upon him at moments when it seemed that the struggle in his heart must be written large upon his face and it filled him with dumb helpless anger

a change too was taking place in van doren how that he had a son in the field he had a new feeling for his friend and enemy besides being a partisan he was a father and the paternal instinct prompted him to change his actions towards waters had the two old men let themselves they would have poured out their fears hopes and anxieties to each other and found relief and sympathy both affectionate fathers similarly bereft of sons and similarly alone they might have been a comfort to each other but that their passions forbade their fraternizing often they met upon the streets and van doren would look at waters with a question in his eyes it would have been such a natural thing to say  any news of tom   and to be asked in the same tone what of bob but waters always scowled fiercely although he kept his head averted so each smothering down the yearning in his heart for companionship and sympathy passed on his way with a curb bit on his emotions

it was about this time that dispatches from the front gave warning that a sharp though brief encounter had taken place between the rebels and a detachment of troops under general schenck the news ran like wildfire through dorbury for it was at first rumored and then assured that the first to which the home company belonged had been engaged and had lost several men every home out of which a husband son or father had gone waited with breathless expectancy longing yet dreading to hear more definite tidings from the field the people about every fireside clustered closer together with blanched faces wondering if their circle had been touched this was war indeed and with the first fear for their loved ones came the first realization of what it really meant

at first bradford waters tried hard to restrain himself he gripped his hands hard and paced up and down the room but finally he could stand it no longer the house had grown close and unbearable its walls seemed to be narrowing in upon him like the sides of a torture chamber he hurried out into the street and into the telegraph office there was no further news then to the office of the one remaining paper their bulletin furnished nothing further for two hours he paced back and forth between these two places feverish and disturbed van doren saw him pass back and forth on his anxious tramp and his own heart interpreted the others feelings once the impulse came to him to speak to waters and he rose from the window where he had been sitting and went to the door but the crazed man turned upon him such a grey haggard face and withal so fierce and unfriendly that he retreated from his good intentions and let him pass on unchallenged

the next day the news was better the papers said that the casualties had been almost nothing

waters hopes rose and he showed a more cheerful face to those who saw him maybe tom was safe after all maybe he had been gallant in action and would be promoted his heart throbbed with joy and pride as if what he wished were already a fact it is a strange thing about home people in war time that after the first pang of anxiety is over the very next thought is one of ambition they seem all to see but two contingencies for their loved ones death or promotion it happened that there was not a single engagement of the war however small or insignificant but it gave some home circle a thrill of hope that one who was dear to them might have moved up a notch in the notice and respect of his country it was not narrowness nor was it the lust for personal advancement it was rather the desire of those who give of their best to serve a beloved cause to have them serve it in the highest and most responsible position possible

meanwhile to mary slowly recovering her strength and balance had come much of the anxiety which racked her father with the inconsistent faith of a woman she said that god could not have let her brother fall in this first fight and she prayed that he might be restored to them safe and even before the breath of her declaration and prayer had cooled on her lips she wept as she pictured him dead on the roadside

later it is true these peoples hearts came to be so schooled in the terrible lessons of civil war that they let such light skirmishes as this one at vienna give them little uneasiness but then they did not know

bradford waters great joy came to him two days after the papers had lightened his care there was a list of the wounded and killed and toms name was not among them then came his letter

 dear father it ran  i suppose youve been in horrible suspense about me and a good deal of it is my fault but when a fellow is learning entirely new things among them how to write without any sort of writing materials under the sun it isnt easy is it  then too ive been trying to learn to be a soldier its awfully different this being a militiaman and a soldier in the first place a militiaman may curse his governor a soldier must not its been hard refraining but i havent cursed dennison as i wanted to some of the fellows say hes all right but weve been delayed on the way here by first one thing and then another until the patience of all of us is worn out if it isnt governor dennisons fault whose is it  i wish youd find out we fellows dont know and cant find out anything the generals just take us wherever they please and never consult us about anything but im used to that now

 of course youve heard about the trouble at vienna and i was afraid youd be considerably worried it wasnt anything much only it was different from a muster day some rebels fired on our train unexpectedly but we tumbled out helterskelter and fired back at them and so they let us alone it didnt seem quite fair to jump on a fellow when he wasnt looking but i guess this is war

there isnt a thing to do about washington these days its as safe as a meetinghouse there are some new york troops here that i have got acquainted with but we dont any of us do anything but look pretty some of the fellows are already looking forward to the mustering out day but mustered out or not im going to hang around here for theres no telling when things are going wrong and for my part i expect more trouble a set of fellows who will fire on their own flag as they did at sumter are perfectly capable of lying low until they quiet our suspicions and then raising the very dickens

 give mary my love and tell her she ought to see washington and all the pretty girls here that cheer us as we go along the streets tell her to read this part of the letter to nannie im going to write her anyway in a day or two but now its all go go go learn learn learn take care of yourself father or rather let mary take care of you for you would never think of it ill write you again when i get a chance

 your son tom

bradford waters could have wept for joy over his sons letter but that he felt weeping to be unworthy of a soldiers father the battle of vienna had been fought and his son had come out safe he thought of it as a thermopylae when it was only a petty skirmish a few rebels fired at a few unionists who lined themselves up against their cars and returned the fire this was all but he preferred to think of his son as one of a band of heroes who at great odds had repelled the assailants of their countrys flag and held the day against armed treason

one thing grieved him greatly the reference to mary he could not tell her nor talk it over with her she take care of him  what would her brother think if he knew how they were living and he was going to write to nannie  would she not tell him all and what encouragement would this be to the boy in the field when he knew how matters were going at home bradford waters hand trembled and the letter burned in his fingers

notwithstanding his perplexity when waters appeared on the streets that day stephen van doren seeing him did not need to inquire to know that the unionist had received a welcome letter from his son and secretly he rejoiced at it knowing as he did that the time would come when anxiety for his own boy would tear at his heart he could not begrudge the other man his joy he was pleased too because as he passed waters and looked into his beaming face there seemed almost an inclination on his part to stop and speak

indeed the old unionist did want to stop and say  stephen ive heard from tom and hes all right he did not and the repression only made him long the more for mary he wanted her to see his letter to know that her brother was being cheered by the women of washington and to feel what he felt but would she feel so  had not her heart already gone too strongly to the other side  the question came again to him and he hardened again in face of it

he would not tell her nor send the letter to her she was a traitor but he would let her know that he had received it so that afternoon he talked much of his letter in the places where men congregate and told what tom had said and mary heard of it from others and burned with eagerness

that night as soon as darkness had fallen eluding nannies vigilance she crept out of the house she made her way to her own home and back and forth before the door she walked and kept vigil maybe her father would see her and come out and tell her more of tom maybe he would understand and forgive her and she could go back to him again but she wished in vain and after a time her heart unsatisfied she went back to nannies and silently let herself in

it was after midnight when waters crept out of his house and with feverish steps made his way to the woods door for a long time he walked up and down before the place even as mary had done and then as if struck with a sudden determination he opened the gate and going to the door slipped the letter under it then he turned away home feeling lighter and better because he had shared his joy with his daughter

it was of a piece with the proverbial blindness of man that nathan woods should have stepped over the letter as he went out in the morning without taking note of it just as it was natural to the keen sight of woman that nannie should see it the first thing as she came down in the morning she ran swiftly towards it and cast her eye over the address at first she gasped then she awoke the echoes with a joyous shriek and went flying up to marys room mary sat up in bed in dumb amazement which was only increased when the enthusiastic girl threw her arms about her and began sobbing and laughing alternately

 oh mary she cried  its come its come and hes all right

 what is it nannie  whats come and whos all right  

 your fathers been here oh 

 my father  when  what did he say  

nothing oh i didnt see him he didnt say anything

i dont understand you nannie you say my father didnt say anything at all  

 why how could he  he came at night and he didnt say anything because he couldnt you know we were all asleep but he left this she broke off her violent demonstrations long enough to thrust the letter into marys hand then she immediately resumed them with such a degree of fervor that her friend found it impossible to get a glimpse of the missive she held in her hand gently at last she put her hand aside and then trembling with anticipation glanced at the letter her face fell

 but this is not addressed to me she said

 oh you great goose dont you see that its to your father and from tom and that he wanted you to know  else why should he have slipped it under the door  

 do you think he did it really  

 of course he did who else  he couldnt lose it crawling into our hallway and thats the only other way it could have got there

 i wonder if i ought to read it   mused mary fingering the envelope eagerly but nervously

mary waters   exclaimed nannie if you dont read that letter this instant ill take it from you and read it myself

thats right do nannie youre braver than i am and mary proffered the letter but nannie sprang back with sudden timidity

 no i wont she said  its for you but if it were my brothers letter id have read it long before now

well ill read it if youll stay and hear it and she took the penciled sheets out and began the perusal of the words which had brought so much joy to her fathers heart as she read the color came back to her faded cheeks and the light to her eyes her bosom heaved with pleasure and pride nannie was no less delighted as the reading went on she continued to give mary little encouraging hugs and she was radiant

then came the passage about the girls

 humph said nannie  is that all a soldier has to write about i should think hed be thinking more about the safety of his country than about the girls he sees

 oh you know hes only funning nannie and then he says washingtons as safe as a meetinghouse

 i dont believe it i believe the rebels are waiting to swoop down on the city at any time and capture all our state papers and archives and things wherever they keep them while our soldiers go around looking pretty for the girls to cheer humph 

mary kissed her and laughed and the rest of the reading proceeded without demonstrations from toms sweetheart at its close she made no comment whatever but sat upon the bed swinging her feet with pronounced indifference

 arent you glad to hear from him   said mary merrily  and to find him in such good spirits  dear old tom and wasnt it good of father to bring his letter to me  didnt i tell you nannie that my father didnt mean half he said   

no you didnt mary waters you thought the end of everything had come even after i tried to convince you that it hadnt and as for being glad to be sure im glad youve heard from your brother any one with relatives in the field must be very anxious

but you know he said he was going to write to you nannie

 its very kind in him i wonder he can take time from his washington girls to write

then mary laughed  it cant be that you are jealous nannie girl she said affectionately taking her friend in her arms  you know tom is teasing you

 i jealous   oh how the little woman sniffed  i can assure you that im not jealous but i have the interests of my country at heart and i cannot but feel sorry to see our soldiers giving themselves up to trivial amusements when she is in danger ofâoh just the most awful things im not jealous oh no but im ashamed of tom why nannie how can you said mary reddening

well i am and i mean it and its awful thats what it is

im sorry my brother has offended you oh mary nannie was always inarticulate in her emotion but mary understood the burst of tears as nannie threw herself on her bosom and forgave her disparagement of tom

what a little silly you are you know he was only joking

joking such a letter isnt any joke its brutal thats what it is pretty girls cheering him i hate those washington girls i just know theyre bold brazen things and they didnt look at another man but tom

never you mind youll have a letter soon

 i dont want it

 all right maybe it wont come the mails are very irregular now

 mary waters how can you say such a mean thing  

i didnt think youd mind it

but i do mind it you know the mails are regular here its not the mails that im worrying about

she must have worried about something though for when her father came in with the morning paper she was eager to know if he had been to the post office and on receiving a negative answer was downcast for fully five minutes

 the mail wouldnt have been sorted yet anyhow said her father  and baness boys going to bring it when he goes for theirs

 the mail is very slow in dorbury isnt it   nannie proffered a little later and was angry because mary laughed again

the promise of a letter was at least two days away but nannie ate very little that morning she fastened her eyes upon the window which commanded the walk up which the banes boy must come finally when he hove in sight she sprang away from the table with a cry of  oh there he is   and every one knew why her appetite had lapsed

fate was kind it was kind two days ahead of promise a strange thing but this was her off day there was a letter and it was for nannie and from tom she came directly to the table with it because she didnt know any better and there were no daws about to peck at an exposed heart she read and smiled and bridled and blushed while the rest of the assembly neglected their eggs

 oh give us some of it said her father banteringly

 i wont she answered and it was a good thing tom couldnt see her smile and blush for if he had been any sort of man he would have deserted at once

isnt there anything he says that we may hear  

 oh do let me alone she answered andâ well its hard to tell but she giggled

 what a softy he must be said her little brother just writing about noaccount things when youd think hed be saying something about fighting taint polite to read letters before folks anyhow

you hush up reuben said nannie indignantly dont you suppose a soldier can talk about anything but the horrors of war  

 i knew it was from tom said reuben jeeringly

 keep quiet reuben said his father  no telling when youll be putting on fresh ties every night an tryin to find out an excuse to be out to a literary  or a singing school

reuben grew red and was silent his particular tone of red was what is denominated turkey and it was relieved by freckles

well ill just read you a little of it said nannie finally  im not going to tell you what lie calls me in the beginning thats none of their business is it mary   and she ran over and kissed toms sister for toms sake then she looked at the letter again

well he says dear little â  no im going to leave that out he sends his love to you papa but of course thats at the last

 would it hurt you to be consecutive   asked nathan woods drily

 oh now dont tease just listen he says oh mary he doesnt say another word about those washington girls it was only a joke dont you think it was  i knew tom couldnt be thinking very seriously just of girls when there was something very very important to do you know i told you so mary

 ho said mary tantalizingly  i dont think that you did tell me just that

and of course said her father you may not know it isnt but this is not i maintain this is not hearing the letter

 oh well he says hes in washington how perfectly charming it must be in washington i know that must be a great town with the government and senators and such things about you dear how i should like to be there and oh mary dont you remember about the potomac in the geography just think toms seen the potomac 

i know about the potomac said reuben

 thats not the letter yet was her fathers comment

well if youd only stop father id get to it said nannie

we are dumb

 oh papa now please dont joke its really very very serious

 has one among them been taken  

 thats just it thats just it the rebels tried to take them and they didnt and tomâtomâ i think he ought to be promoted for it its wonderful

 what did tom do  save his whole brigade  

well i dont know that he did that but he says that ho shot and shot and that the bullets spit up against the car behind him think of it 

 it would have been a good deal worse if they had spit up against him said woods he had been in the mexican war and unfortunately had lost his romance now daughter for the letter

 all right you wont mind omissions will you  

 no if youll only omit your pauses and exclamations

we are here at last at the capital and i tell you its a great place i dont wonder in the least that men want to be congressmen when they can live in a town like this why id be willing to take all the cares of the government on my shoulders just to live in a town like this but you know the voters have never pressed upon my shoulders the affairs of state and so my willingness to be unselfish goes for nothing  now isnt that bright of tom  

 oh nannie for heavens sake go on nathan woods was both short and impatient  what we want is news news about the troops and their condition there

 im afraid papa said nannie ruefully  that there isnt much news but never mind listen  i got to see lincoln the other day and i dont think much of him hes a big rawboned fellow with a long face and an awfully serious look but for any kind of polish ill bet old dennison could give him a good many lessons although i dont think much of dennison my own oh no theres where ive got to make an omission but he goes on to say  people are saying that the rebellion is going to be a good deal bigger thing than we think and that three months service is hardly going to begin the fighting others say different well i dont care im in it to stay and you neednt expect to see me until weve licked the boots off these fellows do you know what they say  they boast that one southerner can lick five yankees

well id like to see them try it oh isnt that just like tom  he always was in for experiments

 go on nannie and omit comment

  but as old man wilson used to say in geometry class if they proceed upon this hypothesis they will be wrong oh mary dont you remember old mr wilson and how often tom used to tell us about his funny expressions how awfully clever of him to think of it now but i know youre waiting to hear the rest oh i cant read this papa not a bit of it nor the rest oh i wouldnt read that for anything tom is so enthusiastic you know how he is thats just what is going to make a good soldier out of him he says  ive seen general schenck and hes just what you would expect from the schenck family it seems as if those people kept themselves busy making decent men the boys all like him although they have not got generally trained into liking generals yet say nannie â  and thats all said the young girl with a guilty blush

how abruptly your brother ends his letters said nathan woods turning to mary with a quizzical smile  it may be striking but its not a good literary style

you must always consider the collaborator mr woods said mary

 in this case im not sure that it has been collaboration it may have been interpretation or even heaven help us expurgation

 papa said nannie with a very red face then she gathered up the loose sheets of her letter and fled from the table

 mary said nathan woods  what has happened this morning has made me very happy but dont count too much upon it no man respects your father more than i do but the oyster opens his shell for a little and then shuts it as tight as ever so i would advise you to stay with us a while longer had he wanted you at home now this is plain he would have come to you openly but in putting the letter under the door he only made a sacrifice on account of his love for tom dont cry little girl

 no im going to be brave for i am glad even of this kindness from himâbut

 arent we treating you pretty well  

 yes but mr woods you know dont you yes i believe i do understand how you feel about it but just keep on waitin your timell come

with the incidents that immediately succeeded the skirmish at vienna this story has little to do notwithstanding the enlistment of only threemonthsmen the country had begun to settle down to the realization of war not insurrection not only rebellion any longer but war stern implacable and perhaps to last longer than had at first been expected as the days passed there was talk of reorganization the first was not behindhand in the matter and by the august following work among the men had begun

on the day that the men came home dorbury complacent because no casualty had as yet attacked her ranks was out in full force to meet them they too recognized the state of war but as yet it was only a passive condition and when they saw their unbroken lines come back three months veterans their pride and joy knew no bounds that many of their men would return to the field would go back to soldiers deaths and soldiers graves did not disturb them then

sufficient into the day is the evil thereof so they put away all thought of further disaster and revelled only in the present

among those who came back proud and happy none was more noticeable than nigger ed the sight of camps the hurry of men and the press of a real responsibility had evoked a subtle change in the negro and though his black face showed its accustomed grins and he answered with humor the sallies made at him he capered no more in the public square for the delectation of the crowd that despised him he walked with a more stately step and the people greeted him in more serious tones as if his association with their soldiers light though it had been had brought him nearer to the manhood which they still refused to recognize in him

perhaps the least joyous of them all was walter stewart who had given up his family for a principle while the other boys returned to eager relatives he came home to no waiting mothers arms and no sweetheart was there to greet him with love and pride in her eyes there were friends of course who gave him hearty handclasps but what were friends compared with ones own family 

his mood was not improved when less than two days after the return there came a telegram calling him to the bedside of his dying father

it was a great blow to the young fellow and coming as it did seemingly as a reproof of his career it may be forgiven him if in his grief his heart grew lukewarm towards the cause he had espoused as soon as he was able he hastened away to virginia and his fathers bedside torn with conflicting emotions of remorse love and sorrow

on an open space topping a hill near dorbury the white tents of the reorganizing regiment had begun to settle like a flock of gulls on a green sea most of the men who had been out were going back again and the town took on a military appearance it came to bo now that the girl who had not a military lover or relative was one to be pitied and the one who had stood up with complacent phariseeism and thanked her creator that she was not as other maidens were

it was now that the sewingcircle exerted itself to the utmost both in their natural province and in entertainment for the soldiers everything now had the military prefix to it there were soldiers balls soldiers teas soldiers dinners and soldiers concerts indeed the sentiment bade fair to run to a foolish craze and those who felt most deeply and looked forward with fear to what the days might bring forth beheld this tendency deprecatingly

many of the volunteers from being decent sensible fellows had developed into conceited prigs the pride of their families and the adulation of indiscreet women and nonetwowell balanced men combined to turn their thoughts more upon the picturesqueness of their own personalities than upon the seriousness of what was yet to be done they were blinded by the glare of possible heroism and sometimes lost sight of the main thing for which they had banded themselves together it would be entirely false to say that at their first realization of what they had gone into they did not rise to all that was expected of them but such was for a time the prevailing spirit and for a while it called forth the sneers of old men who had not forgotten  and  at these three months soldiers

there were others too who smiled at the behavior of the young soldiers with less generous thoughts among them stephen van doren who watched from behind closed blinds their comings and goings

 do they expect to whip the south which is all fire and passion with their stripling dandies who go about the streets posing for a childs wonder and a womans glance  bah the men who have gone into the field from the states of rebellion have gone to fight for a principle not to wear a uniform they are all earnestness and selfsacrifice and thats whats going to take the south to victory

his old housekeeper who was alone with him on the place heard with admiration and belief for she shared her masters opinion of the relative worth of the two sections of the country neither one of them knew that the young men of the south were taking their valets into the service with them  entering it as gallants with the traditionary ideas of the day and leaving college for the field because they believed it would be a famous lark

it was perfectly true of both sections that neither looked upon the contest at first with a great amount of seriousness but it is equally true that the fact might have been forgiven the youth of a country whose sons hitherto had made a common cause against a general enemy

unlike van doren who stayed between walls and chuckled at the coming discomfiture of the union arms bradford waters was much upon the streets and at camp corwin as if the sight of these bluecoated defenders of the flag gave him courage and hope he had a good word for every soldier he met and his eyes sparkled as they told him of tom and the few experiences they had had together

tom true to his promise had not returned with the rest but had preferred to remain near the seat of war and to join his regiment after its reorganization the old man took pride even in this fact to him it was as if tom were staying on the field where he could guard the safety of his country in an hour of laxity on the part of his comrades he longed to see him of course but there was joy in the pain he felt at making a sacrifice of his own desires he had not loaned his son to the cause he had given him freely and fully

the difference in attitude between van doren and waters was the difference between regard for traditions and a personal faith the southerner said  what my people have done the yankee what a man must do said one  coming from the stock he does bob must fight well said the other  if they all fight like tom were bound to whip it all came to the same thing at last but the contrast was very apparent then

at news of the safety of his enemys son the copperhead had lost any sympathy he may have had for his union antagonist and the other no longer looked wistfully at his foremans face when they chanced to meet

it was not unnatural that the two girls nannie and mary should be affected by the heroworshipping spirit of the town and being deprived of the objects of their immediate affection enter heartily into the business of spoiling all the other young men they could to nannie it was all very pleasant and something of coquetry entered into her treatment of the soldiers but with mary it was different her thoughts and motives were serious and her chief aim was to do something for toms old associates for toms sake

there was no abatement of the rigor of the estrangement between her and her father for although after the incident of the letter she had expected him to call her home he had made no further sign nor had she she had yielded not one whit in her devotion and loyalty to robert van doren but she took pleasure in doing little kindnesses for the men whom she knew hated him for the choice he had made the time soon came when even this pleasure gentle as it was was denied her

the story went round among the soldiers that old waters daughter was the sweetheart of a rebel soldier and that in spite of all her good work she had left home for love of him and his cause and they grew cold towards her some were even rude

it hurt the girl but she continued her ministrations nevertheless then one day as she passed through the camp where the girls sometimes went she heard a voice from a tent singing derisively  father is a unionist so is brother tom but i im making lots o things to keep a rebel warm

mary flushed and hurried on but the voice sang after her never mind my union home nevermind my flag whats the glorious stars and stripes beside jeff davis rag

damn my home and family damn my northern pride so you let me go my way to be a rebels bride

the song which some scalawag had improvised cut mary to the heart but though no man would have dared sing it openly she never took the chance of hearing it again in spite of nannies pleadings she would not go again where soldiers were congregated nor would she tell her reason not that she felt shame in her love but that there seemed some shade of truth in the song she did want to go her way and she did want to be roberts bride even though they called him by such a name as rebel she loved him and what had the stars and stripes or love of country to do with that  what he believed was nothing to her it was only what he was

she had heard from robert but once since his departure a brief but brave and loving letter in which he told her that he was safe within the confederate lines and spoke of john morgan whom he had already begun to admire now in the dark moment of her sorrow when every hand seemed turned against her because she loved this man she dreamed over his letter as if it were a sacred writing and so dreaming kept to herself whenever she could even old nathan woods began to look askance at her when her visits and ministrations to the soldiers ceased but he comforted himself with the philosophy that  a woman is an unreasonable creature and never is responsible for her actions and however false this may be in fact it satisfied him towards mary and kept him unchanged to her he was influenced too by nannies stalwart faith while she could not understand mary could not enter into the secret chambers of her soul and see what was within there she believed in her and faith is stronger than knowledge

never mind she said one day after roundly scolding her friend for remaining so close to the house  i know youve got some good reason though im sure its something fanciful its so like you mary this may have been a bit inconsistent in the young girl but it was expressive of her trust in mary and the burdened girl was grateful for it

so with bicker prejudice adulation discontent and a hundred other emotions that must come to human beings the stream of days went on and the reorganization of the first was an accomplished fact still from the south there came news of battle and from cincinnati there were tidings of kentuckys threatening attitude west virginia had been rescued for the union but what if this even more powerful state went over to the confederacy men were of many minds some were wondering at the president for his tardiness and others cursing dennison for his rashness it became the fashion to damn lincoln on sunday and dennison on monday it was from such a hotbed of discontent that the first finally tore itself and left dorbury on the last day of october for the southernmost city of the state

the condition of mind in which young walter stewart left dorbury was not calculated to bring him back hastily for the reorganization of his old regiment his thoughts were more of seeing his father alive and of settling their differences than of the righteousness of his cause indeed as the train sped southward his busy mind sometimes questioned if he had done right if the north and south were one people as he claimed would not neutrality have been the better course  surely two brothers have the right to differ without the whole familys putting in is the love of country which we call patriotism a more commendable trait than filial affection and obedience and can one deficient in the latter be fully capable of comprehending the former  had he not by the very act of disobeying his fathers wishes and refuting his wisdom in a case where right and wrong were so nearly related demonstrated his inability for a high devotion and obedience to his country  these and like sophistries raced through the young mans mind in the first heat of his remorse and for the time he forgot that his choice meant not less love for his father but a broader devotion to his country it was not for the sake of disobedience that he had cast his lot with the north but in pursuance of an idea of a larger allegiance but this he could not see and as he worried and speculated his distress grew

when he reached washington he had anticipations of some difficulty in securing passage through the lines there was every possibility of his being taken for a spy or an informer by one side or the other and the fact that he was a lately mustered out soldier would make him an object of suspicion to both unionist and confederate for the time being his anxiety to be away across the potomac and into virginia drove every other thought out of his head fortunately for him he was known in washington and influential friends procured for him passes through the union lines his progress after he reached the rebel outposts was less speedy but foreseeing this he conceived that discretion would be the better part of valor and so waited for night and then the laxity of the few pickets scattered about helped him and the stables of falls church were kind to him and within an hour after darkness had fallen he was galloping down the road towards rockford

the night was dark and the road none too oven but he rode as speedily as caution would allow the way was unfamiliar to him but he followed the directions he had received trusting somewhat to the instincts of his horse to keep the path row and then as the animals hoofs clattered over the wooden bridge of river or streamlet he held his breath lest he should rouse some lurking foeman once as he sped along a road besides which the trees grew thickly a voice called to him to halt but he only dug his spurs into the mares flank and leaning low over her neck urged her on two shots spit vainly in the darkness as the road fell away under his horses feet

 suppose i should miss the path he said to himself and daylight and me still upon the way well its only a thing to chance now and i must see father before he dies i must see him  the cry died away between clinched teeth and leap after leap the blackness swallowed him and vomited him forth again the branches of the trees underneath which he passed reached out and caught at him as if they would detain him from his errand the wind and the cricket and all the voices of the night called to him the horse stumbled and her rider lurched forward but the good steed was up and on again with scarcely a break in her pace as if she knew that the man upon her back was crying in an agony of fear  father father live till i come  

as the distance lessened walters mind was in a tumult of emotions again and again the picture of his father already dead came before him the white covering of the bed the stark form and the weeping women all were vivid to him as actuality he saw a light ahead of him and checking the speed of his horse he rode towards it but he found that it came from a house up one of two roads which forked before him he paused and looked helplessly at the diverging paths he knew there was no time to be lost and chafed at the delay his indecision however did not last long he turned the animals head up the road on which the light was shining

proceeding cautiously he found that the rays which had guided him came from the curtained but unshuttered window of a little house standing back from the roadside on a terrace the place itself did not look formidable but there was no telling what elements of further delay were behind the closed door nevertheless he reined in and bringing his horse just inside the side gateway hastened up the terrace and knocked at the door there was the shuffling of feet within and then the soft swift scurrying as of some one hastening from the room a moment later the back door slammed and a horse and rider clattered around the side of the house and out of the gate

in spite of his haste and anxiety walter could but smile at the grim humor of the situation that he who stood there on the threshold dreading what he should encounter beyond should prove a source of terror to any one else was but an illustration of the intermittent comedy which treads upon the heels of tragedy in the stern melodrama of war

his reflections took but a moment all that had passed had hardly taken more time but before the impressions were out of his mind he found himself again knocking at the door

 who is there   came a womans voice

astranger but a friend

 how do i know that you are a friend  

 you need not know you need not even open the door only answer my question i am hunting the house of colonel stewart and am not sure that i am on the right road can you direct me  

 you have missed your way said the hidden woman in a voice that bespoke relief from some fear you should have taken the road to the right at the forks the house is about two miles beyond on the right side you can tell it without trouble it is a large house and there will be lights about it for the colonel is very sick

walter did not wait to hear the womans closing words but with a hearty word of thanks hurried away towards the gate he was almost blithe with the thought that his journey would soon be over and hope rose again in his heart his father might be alive he would be alive he must be so he went from hope to certainty as he passed with flying steps across the lawn and terrace to the gate there he stopped with a gasp of alarm his horse was no longer there gone and the distance between him and his father lessened by many minutes when every second counted

it all came to him in a flash the frightened rider who had dashed away from the house in a flash fearing pursuit had taken the horse with him or the animal itself had become frightened and followed involuntarily

walter halted hardly a moment but turned swiftly back to the house to his knock came the womans voice again in question

 some one has taken my horse he cried

 it is not so far to walk from here to colonel stewarts said the woman coldly

 but i cannot walk i am pressed for time

 i do not know you was the reply  nor do i know your business but i warn you that i am armed and you had better go away

my god cried walter i mean you no harm but cant you help me to a horse or must i take one wherever i can find it i am colonel stewarts son and my father is dying i must see him a dry sob broke in his throat

an exclamation was uttered from within something that was very like the thud of a gun butt sounded on the carpeted floor the bolts were shot and a woman stood in the flood of yellow light

in the first instant walter saw the form of a tall young woman with fair hair and behind her the room disordered as by hasty movements a gun stood against the wall further details he did not take note of

 come in for a moment said the woman you need have no fear i can help you to a horse she was hastening into a wrap and hood as she spoke  we already know of you my brother and i you are colonel stewarts unionist son

walter flushed but raised his head defiantly

the young woman laughed as she hastened out of the room and came back with a lantern and key you need have no fear there are no ambushes here come she led the way around the house where walter could see the low outlines of the outbuildings

 you gave us quite a fright i may tell you now that i know who you are brother is suspected of unionist sentiments and has been looking to be arrested every moment tonight we took you for a confederate officer come to exercise that unpleasant commission and it was he who must have frightened off your horse as he rode away hes on blue grass and if your horse keeps up with him theyre farther away now than you would care to follow

during the last words she was unlocking the barn door then she handed the lantern to walter and called softly  come beth come a whinny answered her and she went forward and quickly took the halter from a sleek brown mare walter started in to put the bridle on but the girl waved her hand

 ho she said  ill do it myself beth is my own particular pet and is somewhat averse to strangers youll have to ride bareback too as there isnt another mans saddle about but shell carry you safe when shes once on the road and shell turn in the right gate for she knows the way

the young man was stammering his thanks as the girl led the horse out he would have walked with her back to the house but upon an assurance that she was not afraid he leaped to the mares back and was off

but it was not written that the object of his heart should be so easily obtained he had scarcely gone half way to the crossroads when the ominous word  halt  sounded again in his ears and several mounted men rose as from the road before him again he gave spur to his horse but this time it was only for a moment that he moved and then he came crash into another horseman and felt the cold muzzle of a pistol pressed against his face while a hand seized his bridle

 steady my boy steady unless you want to get hurt we dont want to do you any harm but you mustnt move

 are you hurt sergeant   asked a voice from the darkness

 no capn not particular i may be a little strained and this horse may be a little bruised up but i was ready for the shock i knew the youngster was game

just now the man addressed as captain rode up

 well youngster he said  weve got a little business with you and i reckon were just in time

walters head was whirling with the shock of his collision and he had a mean pain in the leg that had struck the other mans saddle but he spoke up hotly

whats the meaning of this outrage ho asked  cannot a man and a virginian at that ride his own roads in safety by night and by day 

hoitytoity not so fast my young union peacock not so fast any virginian may go his way in virginia until he becomes dangerous to virginias cause then he comes with us as you do

 what right have you to take me in this highhanded way  

we neednt bandy words but i can say that we have the right that any state has to arrest within its borders any citizen who is suspected of working or attempting to work against its interest and safety we have been watching you for a long time etheridge and we know what your plans are

they had been standing for the few moments that they talked but now the company started to move off

 stop cried walter as the name was called  whom do you take me for  

we know who you are said the captain grimly

 but my name is not etheridge you are mistaken

what is this sergeant   asked the officer in charge of the party and who had done most of the talking

 i know the horse captain its his sisters

 come on then dont delay any further its no use denying your identity

 but i can prove to you that im not the man youre seeking nor is this horse mine having lost my own i borrowed it at a house a little way up the road here

 a very likely story

but if there is any one here who knows etheridge let him look at me and see

the sergeant leaned forward and striking a match looked into walters face

 whew captain he whistled  its true weve caught the wrong bird this is not nelson etheridge hes a stranger

well who the devil are you asked the captain shortly  strangers without credentials are not very welcome about here these times my name is walter stewart and my father is colonel stewart who lives about two miles from here

 stewartâwalter stewart hurrah boys   cried the captain  weve lost one good bird but caged another this is colonel stewarts yankee soldier son youll do come on

 but captain im not in the service now and my father is dying a few minutes delay may keep me from ever seeing him alive

 i am sorry was the captains reply  but you have been a union soldier we take you leaving a suspected house and find you as you tacitly admit within our lines and without credentials it may be hard for you but you are our prisoner

 very well but cannot i be paroled at once  if necessary send a soldier with me to my house and keep me under guard

the captain halted  i know your father he said coldly and he is a brave man and a southern gentleman who has not forsaken the south for his sake i will do as you say even though i exceed my authority i will send two men with you you will remain under guard until i secure your parole if that may be done

i thank you said walter

 sergeant davis   the sergeant saluted

you and private wilkins will take charge of the prisoner when his parole has been secured you will be relieved until then the closest vigilance

 i am a soldier and a gentleman said walter calmly

the officer vouchsafed no answer but with his remaining associates spurred on into the darkness leaving the prisoner to ride away with his captors

as walter approached his fathers house he saw lights moving about in the upper chambers and he began to fear the worst

 have you heard any news of my father   he asked the sergeant

hone except that he is a pretty sick man and not expected to last long

 how did the captain and all of you come to know about me  

 the servants will talk and its few family secrets they dont know and tell your father invested in some niggers as soon as he got here in order to show his contempt for the yankees invasion but theyre too new to have any of the family pride that the old ones used to have why an old family servant would rather die than tell any of the happenings at the big house but these darkies of your fathers have blown his business broadcast

walter shivered at the mans tone and his revelations

in order not to alarm the house unduly they dismounted at the gate and left the private to lead the horses around to the stables while the sergeant went with walter their ring brought a servant to the door who stood in whiteeyed astonishment as he saw the young man worn and haggard with anxiety and beside him an officer in grey

 wy wy gentmen dis hyeahs a confedeate house

 shut up and let us in make as little stir as possible and bring my mother to the parlor sergeant this will be a family meeting

 you know my orders sir

i do and i am enough of a soldier not to want you to disobey them but i prefer seeing my family alone examine the room where i shall talk with my mother and have the places of egress guarded i think the windows let out on a veranda

 there may be more than one outlet and i have not enough men to guard them if there is  you forget sergeant said walter haughtily  that i am a soldier and a gentleman

 im not much of either yet returned the noncommissioned officer calmly  but im learning enough of a soldiers business to know how to obey orders

 you are right said the younger man blushing  come lets examine the room together and see what dispositions we can make

at this period private wilkins came in from his errand they stationed him outside and passed into the room it was a large apartment with three long windows opening as walter had surmised on the veranda

you see pursued the sergeant its just as i said you have too many places by which to leave though i do not doubt your honor

let us see said walter going to the door  ah this will serve you and he held up a key  lock this door that shuts off one outlet one of you patrol the veranda and the other hold the hall will that suit you  

perfectly and the sergeant proceeded to do as directed he stationed wilkins in the hall and then as he was about to step out upon the veranda turned and on a sudden impulse saluted the young private as if he were an officer

he had hardly left the room when mrs stewart came rushing in

walter walter my boy  

 dear little mother

 oh you are well you are well arent you   in body yes mother butâbutâam i in time  

thank god yes

the young man bowed his head and the gesture itself was a prayer of thanksgiving that god understood

 i have so much that i want to say to you mother but take me to him at once i am afraid that it will be too late you shall have a talk with me afterwards he put his arm affectionately about his mothers waist

wait a moment walter she said he is yet conscious oh walter walter humor him humor him in his dying moments promise whatever he asks

 whatever he asks  why what can he ask   perhaps one great thing your father has not changed even in the hands of death

 i shall promise what i can without lying

 if necessary my son lie to ease your fathers heart have i ever given you such advice before  will you do it  

he looked at her fondly for a moment and then answered firmly  i will lie if need be take me to him

they started out but walter turned back to call the sergeant

 i am going to my fathers room he said

 i will come as far as the door he said  for the rest i leave that to you go on

as they passed up the broad steps mrs stewart asked in some agitation what does the presence of those soldiers mean  

 dont disturb yourself mother but i was taken on the way here after i had passed the reb âthe confederate lines and i am a prisoner

she grasped him by the arm a prisoner she gasped

 dont be alarmed he went on soothingly  i shall be paroled the captain has as good as promised it and then i shall be here with you

that is almost good she replied and you will have less to promise

the light was turned low in the sick room and a nurse glided out as they entered walters sister passed out also and in passing pressed his hand

mrs stewart left her son at the door and went forward to the bed a shadowy gliding form in the dim room

here is walter she said softly

the sick man opened his eyes and said weakly but with some of his old coldness  raise the light and let me see him

 father  the boy stood over the bed

the eyes that even then death was glazing grew brighter as the colonel looked upon his son but the words that he whispered huskily were  thank god he does not wear their uniform walter

the young man threw his arms about his father and held him close to his heaving breast his eyes were tearless but his bronzed face was pale and his throat throbbed convulsively  father i am so sorry to have grieved you so sorry

 youre a stewart said the old man weakly but dotingly  they always wereâthey always were strongheaded but you wont go back to them will you walter will you for your fathers sake for the sake of virginia you wont go back to theâyankees  

 i cannot lie to you father now the filming eye formed a new light and his mother started forward

 what 

 i could not go back to them if i would i was taken on the way here and am a prisoner in the hands of our own people

the old man settled back with a glad sigh  this is very good he said  very good they can never have your services again better a prisoner in the camp of our peopleâour people âyou said walter than a general of thoseâ aliens now i am content

would you not better rest now asked his son gently

yes yes i will rest and he relaxed again upon his pillow

walter was easing his arms from underneath the grey head when the muscles of the dying man took on strength again his eyes opened

would you he said almost fiercely would you go back to them again if you could  

walter cast one agonizing look at his mothers appealing eyes then he answered firmly  no father not if i could

his father smiled  i knew it he murmured  he is a stewart and a stewart must come back to his own now i shall rest

he sank into a soft slumber and mother and son left the room on tiptoe

 come you will go and see emily now said his mother

 let them come to my room he said  wherever you have placed me we must make it as easy for sergeant davis as possible

the morrow proved that the colonel had been right he had rested and the rest was one that should be eternally unbroken

as soon as he found that the home was a place of death and mourning the sergeant be it said to his credit relaxed some of his vigilance and walter was allowed to attend to the duties connected with his fathers funeral with greater freedom the same day his parole was granted and the house given over again to privacy

in spite of a natural sorrow for his fathers loss walter felt a sense of peace even joy at the reconciliation the words  now i shall rest rang in his head with soothing cadence it was so much better this way than that his father should have gone from him in anger and reproach

the joy walter felt in coming back into the family circle proved how much his heart must have been hungering for it drawn by a strong enthusiasm for what he deemed the right he had gone off into the wilderness to face death but he had not ceased to look back with longing eyes towards the fleshpots of egypt being back to them he was not prone to question why he came the fact in itself was sufficiently pregnant of content somehow he did not feel ashamed of the satisfaction he felt in having the parole solve a vexing problem he had lied to his father had he not in saying that he would not go back if he could  and then he began to quibble with himself had he lied after all  was it not merely the premature assertion of a condition of mind that was to be would he go back if he could  he was not sure his father had called him a stewart and that meant much it was sweet to be there with his own family in the great old place going to the window his eyes swept the surrounding landscape with restful satisfaction

there was the broad sweep of lawn and across that rugged against the sky the dark row of outbuildings the kitchen the stables and the negro cabins and beyond that the woods it was fine and manorial and appealed to the something in walter which is in every anglosaxon the love of pomp and circumstance and power after all it was for this he had been dragged from the camp and from the hardships of war and was it not a pleasant change  fate had been kind to him there were many young fellows who would envy him so why should he repine 

while he was still in the midst of his meditations his mother came into the room

 brooding again   she said  you must not do this my son

he blushed and raised his hand in protest but his mother went on i know you were influenced by a strong principle my son a principle so deeply rooted that you were willing to give up everything for it and you are longing to be back again but yours are after all only the common fortunes of war

the young mans face was burning and all the thoughts that had just passed through his mind came surging back in an accusing flood he saw that he had weakened on the side of his affections and that for a little while he had put home and ease and motherlove before the cause for son etheridge has not returned but has gone over to the union lines

how do you know that cried walter starting up

 we sent cassar with the horse this morning

 oh i wanted to take it over myself and thank miss etheridge in person

 you will have many chances to thank her said his mother she is a great friend of emilys and is often here

 i am very glad he stammered  that is on emilys account

when his mother left him he too went from the room and sought the room where his father lay he drew back the cloth and looked at the calm face as stern and white as a figure in marble even in death the lips had found their old line of compression and the chin had not lost its decision

oh my father said walter i am a weaker man than you but i am more your son than i knew he replaced the cloth and went sadly away

the funeral of colonel stewart was a piteous affair the remnants of the families about came to pay their respects to the dead but mostly they were women or old men the army had taken the rest the clergyman who conducted the services wore the grey under his gown and as soon as his work was done left his vestments and rode back to the regiment of which he was chaplain

people looked askance at walter or did not look at him at all to them he had the shame of being a unionist on parole but within him there was a greater shameâthat he was neither with them nor against them

it was now that a new unpleasantness began to harass the already burdened people of ohio the decree of general butler making all slaves who came into camp contraband of war affected the negroes not only in his immediate vicinity but wherever there was a union camp drunk with the dream of freedom at the first intimation of immunity they hastened to throw off their shackles and strike for the longcoveted liberty women children young ablebodied men and the feeble and infirm all hastened towards the union lines thence it was usually an easy matter or at least one possible of accomplishment to work their way north to the free states

hardly a camp hardly a column in which the officers were not reputed vigorously to oppose the admission of slaves but presented a strange and varied appearance in the rear but keeping close to their saviors always straggled a lot of halfclad eager negroes of all ages and conditions bearing every conceivable form of movable propertyâbags bundles bedclothes cooking utensils and even an occasional calf or sheep trailed along many indeed found employment as the servants of officers where their traditional qualifications as cooks or valets came into full play but for the most part they simply hung on worrying and embarrassing the soldiers with their importunities sickening and dying from fatigue and exposure and conducting themselves altogether like the great helpless irresponsible children that they were

to those who only a few years ago primed with the prejudices of their masters had looked upon the yankees as monsters there had come a great change and every man who wore the blue had become as gods own vicegerent they had been told that the yankees had horns and many of them believed it but on contact the only horn that they had found was the horn of plenty and their old faith in their masters infallibility died

they were not all a burden though in the gloom of the dark hours their lightheartedness cheered on the march  their pranks their hymns and their ditties made life and light through the still watches of the night the lonely sentinel on his beat heard their singing and sometimes he thought of home with a choking at his throat and had a vision of a tender mother singing to the babe upon her breast and he looked up to the stars and was alone no more

the poor blacks wandering in the darkness of their ignorance were as frightened children in the night they had lost faith in their masters but it was not lost to them entire only transferred to these new beings who mastered them by the power of love is it any wonder that they shouted and sang and that often their songs were  out of old egypt  de promised lan and  go down moses  

one of the principal songs they sang ran thus a low minor melody at first then breaking in the improvisation into a joyous shout  in egypt i sang a mounful song oh lawd de life was had dey said yo bondage wont be long ob lawd de life was had

dey preached an dey prayed but de time went on oh lawd de life was had de night was black wen dey talked of dawn oh lawd de life was had we fought twas day in de lightin flash oh lawd de life was had but night come down wid de mastahs lash oh lawd de life was had

and then some clear voice would break into further improvisation  but de yankees come and dey set us free tank gawd hits bettah now de yankee man is de man fu me tank gawd hits bettah now â he gi me braid an he gi me meat tank gawd hits bettah now eatin nevah did seem so sweet tank gawd hits bettah now

for them it was better now though they toiled and struggled and fell by the wayside the abstract idea of freedom which they did not yet understand had become a fetich to them and over the burning sands or through the winters snow where they trudged with bleeding feet they kept their stalwart faith in it they were free at last and being free no evil thing could hurt them

it was strange that most of them should not have become discouraged and gone back to the fleshpots still in egypt the union officers did not understand these great children who flocked so insistently about their heels some were harsh to them and others who would have been kind did not know how but they staid on and on clinging to the garments of the army going from camp to camp until they swept like a plague of locusts into some northern town

ohio placed as she was just on the border of the slave territory was getting more than her share of this unwelcome population and her white citizens soon began to chafe at it was their free soil to become the haven for escaped negroes was this to be the stopping ground for every runaway black from the south  would they not become a menace to the public safety  would they not become a public charge and sorely strain that generosity that was needed to encourage and aid the soldiers in the field  these and a thousand such conjectures and questions were rife about the hapless blacks the whole gamut of argument that had been used in   and  was run again the menace of maryland with her free negroes was again held up the cry rose for the enforcement of the law for the restriction of emancipated negroes while others went to the extreme of crying for the expulsion of all blacks from the state

since  there had been a gradual change for the better in the attitude of ohio towards her colored citizens but now all over the state and especially in the southern counties and towns there had come a sudden revulsion of feeling and the people rose generally against the possibility of being overwhelmed by an influx of runaway slaves their temper grew and ominous mutterings were heard on every side the first great outburst of popular wrath came when negro men began offering themselves for military service and some extremists urged the policy of accepting them

take them said the extremists and you break the backbone of the souths power while the southern men are in the field fighting against the government their negro slaves are at home raising supplies for them and caring for their families when we enlist them whom have they to leave for such duties  

but all the north held up its hands and cried  what put black men beside our boys to fight  let slaves share with them the honor and glory of military service  never  

the army itself hurled back its protest we are fighting for the union  we are not fighting for niggers and we will not fight with them from none of the states came a more pronounced refusal than from ohio she had set her face against men of color what wonder then that their coming into the state aroused all her antagonistic blood here for the time all party lines fell away and all the people were united in one causeâresistance to the invasion of the black horde it was at this time that butlers proclamation struck through the turmoil like a thunderbolt and the word  contraband  became a menace to the whites and a reproach to the blacks

the free blacks of dorbury themselves took it up and even before they could pronounce the word that disgusted them they were fighting their unfortunate brothers of the south as vigorously as their white neighbors  contraband  became the fighting banter for black people in ohio but the stream kept pouring in in spite of resistance abuse and oppression there was a certain calm determination about these fugitive slaves that was of the stuff that made the puritans as far north as oberlin and cleveland they did not often make their way if it was their intention to stop in ohio at all they usually ended their journey at the more southern towns while the spirit in the northern towns was calmer it was perhaps just as well that they were not overrun in cleveland especially numerous masters of the south averse to making slaves of their own offspring had colonized their discarded negro mistresses and their illegitimate offspring and these people blinded by god knows what idea of their own position in the eyes of the world had made an aristocracy of their own shame

in dorbury the negro aristocracy was not one founded upon mixed blood but upon free birth or manumission before the war even the church whose broad wings are supposed to cover all sorts and conditions of men turned its face against the poor children of a later bondage

after much difficulty the negro contingent in dorbury had succeeded in establishing a small house of worship in an isolated section known as  the commons here according to their own views they met sunday after sunday to give praise and adoration to the god whom they as well as the whites claimed as theirs and hither impelled by the religious instincts of their race came the contrabands on reaching the town but were they received with open arms  no the god that fostered black and white alike rich and poor was not known to father these poor fugitives so lately out of bondage the holy portals were closed in their faces and darkskinned pastors not yet able to put the  h  in the educational shibboleth drew aside their robes as they passed them

opposition was even expressed to their fellowship with the christian body it reached its height when on a memorable sundayâa quarterly meeting day in fact three families of the despised presented themselves for membership in the wesleyan chapel the spirit had been running high that day and there had been much shouting and praising the lord for his goodness but at this act of innocent audacity the whole tone of the meeting changed from violent joy it became one of equally violent anger and contempt these outcast families seeking god had stepped upon the purple robes of these black aristocrats and they were as one for defiance

one aged woman trembling with anger and religious excitement tottered up and starting for the door hurled this brief condemnation of the culprits who dared desire membership in her church   wy befo id see dis chuch dis chuch dat we free people built give up to dese conterbands id see hit to down brick by brick

she hurried down the stairs and a number followed her but some stayed to remonstrate with the unreasoning contrabands they were told to form a church of their own and to worship together

 but said their spokesman who had preached down on the plantation  whynt we jes ez well woship wid you  âes all coloed togethah the pastor tried in vain to show them the difference between people who had been freed three or four years before and those just made free but somehow the contraband and none of his company could see it and the meeting was broken up the rejected christians seeking their poor shanties in amazement and the aristocrats gathering to talk among themselves over the invasion of their temple

with both white and black against them it could not be long before the bad feeling against these poor people must break out into open attack theirs was a helpless condition but they were not entirely alone in all the town they had no stronger friend than stephen yan doren a southerner by birth and education he understood these people who had for two centuries been the particular wards of the south while he had no faith in the ultimate success of the union arms and believed that all these blacks must eventually go back into slavery whence they had come yet he reasoned that they were there and such being the case all that was possible ought to be done for them

the negroes were quick to recognize a friend and his house soon became the court to which they took all their grievances he had been keeping indoors but now he began to circulate among his southern friends and to do what he could to help his poor proteges

it was then that the first inklings of a contemplated attack upon them came to his ears some of the citizens of dorbury inspired by the public spirit which barroom speeches arouse had determined to rise and throw off the stigma of negro invasion the embers of the peoples passions had long smouldered and when a pseudopolitician in the glow of drink had advised them to rise and drive the black plague beyond their borders they had determined to do so

the conduct of the whole matter had been put into the hands of raymond stothard for the politician declined to lead such an assault upon the plea that it was hardly the proper thing for a man who aspired to the legislature

stothard was chosen first because he was the brother of the prosecuting attorney which would give the movement prestige and next because he was capable of doing anything when he was drunk he usually was drunk or becoming so he was drunk when he made the speech which instantly made him the leader of the aggressive movement

 genlemen he said  you all know me and you know that i aint the man to try to lead you into an unjust fight now am i   he was almost plaintive and the crowd about him cried  ho no  

 thank you he went on swaying at his table  thanks im glad to see that you perâ preciate my motives you all know my brother hes a straightâstraight man aint he  you all know philip stothard now im a peaceable man i am but tonight i say our rights and liberties are being invaded thats what they are all the niggers in the south are crowding in on us and pretty soon we wont have a place to lay our heads theyll undercharge the laborer and drive him out of house and home they will live on leavings and the men who are eating white bread and butter will have to get down to the level of these black hounds

i dont like em anyhow none of us like em the whole war is on their account if it hadnt been for them wed have been friends with the south today but theyve estranged us from our brothers rent the country asunder and now theyre coming up here to crowd us out of our towns gentlemen i wont say any more it shall never be said that ray stothard was instrumental in beginning a revolt against law and order my brothers prosecuting attorney you know and we stand for the integrity of the law but if i had my way id take force and clear this town of every nigger in it gentlemen drink with me

his final remark was the most eloquent plea he could have made the gentlemen drank with mr stothard and voted his plan for saving their homes and workshops a good one

one man in passing had heard the sound of speechmaking within and out of idle curiosity had paused at the saloon door in time to hear stothards stirring remarks stephen van doren listened with horror to what the drunken rowdy proposed and then went with all speed to his brother

youre too sensible a man van doren said the prosecuting attorney  to believe that i have anything to do with this matter or would countenance it but i can do nothing whatever with this brother of mine there is only one thing to do and that is to warn the negroes

 they are not used to fighting for themselves they would be as helpless as children and could be killed like sheep in a pen

 they have their freedom taken as you and i both believe illegally let them rise to the occasion which liberty demands and so the lawyer dismissed the subject although van doren gave back the answer that what these blacks had to meet was not the result of liberty but the mockeryof it

leaving philip stothards house stephen yan doren went his way torn between conflicting opinions as to his duty would he be proving a traitor to his fellowcitizens if he told the negroes of the designs against them  but were these men of the lowest social stratum loafers ignoramuses and fanatics his fellowcitizens  was it not right that these poor fellows slaves as they had been and would be again doubtless should be allowed the chance of defending themselves against assault  he argued with himself long and deeply that night and in the end he decided that the blacks must be warned he did not know when the attack would take place indeed he felt sure that it would wait upon inspiration and opportunity but the intended victims could be put upon their guard and then be left to look out themselves he could do no more perhaps he had already done too much

on the morrow he saw some of the blacks and after cautioning them to secrecy as to what they should hear told them of their danger they heard him with horror and lamentation they were bitterly disappointed was this the freedom for which they had toiled  was this the welcome they received from a free state  they already knew how the church had greeted them but they were the more shocked because they found out for the first time that politics could be as hard as religion

one advantage which the negroes were to have was that in the sudden passion against their race the whites made no distinction as to bond or free manumitted or contraband this of necessity drew them all together and they grew closer to each other in sympathy than they had yet known

the drawing together was not one of spirit only but of fact they began to have meetings at night after the warning and a code of signals was arranged to call all of them together at the first sign of danger

meanwhile stothard and his confederates believing that all their workings had been done in profoundest secrecy only waited an opportunity to strike effectively and finally

the leaders first open act occurred one day when he seemed to have found an audience of sympathizers he was strolling along busy with his usual employment of doing nothing when he noticed a crowd gathered at a point upon the street that led from the railway station he sauntered towards it but quickened his pace when he found that the centre of the group was a small family of black folk who had just arrived from some place south of the river there were a father and mother both verging on old age a stalwart stronglimbed son apparently about twenty and two younger children they were all ragged barefoot and unkempt they had paused to inquire the way to the negro portion of the town and immediately the people some with animosity some with amusement had gathered around them

 whats all this   asked the attorneys brother as he reached the group none of the whites vouchsafed him an answer and he turned his attention to the negroes

 more niggers he exclaimed  why in hell dont you people stay where you belong  

the blacks eyed him in silence

 why dont you answer when i talk to you   he took a step forward and the outcasts cowered before him all save the son he did not move a step and there was a light in his eye that was not good to see it was the glare of an animal brought to bay stothard saw it and advanced no further but went on

 if i had you across the line id teach you manners the old woman began to cry

we come up hyeah said the young negro  cause we hyeahed it was a free state

 its free for white people not for niggers we hyeahed it was free fu evahbody dats de reason we come me an mammy an pappy an de chillun we aint a bothahin nobody we jes wants to fin some of ouah own people  theres enough of your people here now and too many and we dont want any more youd better go back where you come from

we caint go back thaih hits been a long ways a cornin an wes bout wo out

 thats none of our business back you go gentlemen unless we put our foot down now we shall be overrun by these people i call you to act now turn them back at the portals of the city ohio as a state and dorbury as a town does not want these vagabonds

unseen by stothard another man attracted by the gathering had joined the crowd and now his voice broke the silence  who made you ray stothard the spokesman for the people of ohio

the aristocratic loafer turned to meet the eye of stephen van doren and his face went red in a second

 i dont know what right youve got to speak van doren youve done everything you could to hurt the union

 it is to the unions greatest discredit that it has such men as you on its side

 so youre in favor of letting the niggers overrun the town  

 im in favor of fair play and i intend to help these people find their fellows  humph what are you anyhow  first a copperhead then a rebel then the champion of contrabands youre neither fish flesh fowl nor good red herring

 whatever i may be im not a conspirator stothard blanched at the word nor went on the old man  am i a barroom orator and leader of ruffians come boys he said addressing the negroes and they grinned broadly and hopefully at the familiar conduct and manner of address of the south which they knew and loved away they went behind van doren

go on steve van doren stothard crowed after the old man like a vanquished cock  but you may have more work to do before you get through with your nigger pets

 all right was the sturdy answer  whenever you and your hounds come for me youll find me waiting and by heaven youll leave me weightier men by a few ounces than youve ever been before

the younger man attempted to raise a jeer as the other man passed down the street but the crowd refused to join him there was something too majestic in the carriage of the old copperhead he commanded an inevitable if reluctant respect the same independent habit of thought and sturdy disregard of consequences that made him a copperhead made him a friend to these poor helpless blacks

stothard however was not done he was inflamed with anger at his defeat and the shame put upon him he hurriedly left the crowd and went at once to the rendezvous of his confederates all that day and night he harangued them as they came in one by one setting before them the alleged dangers of the case and painting the affair of the afternoon in lurid colors by midnight drunken men who mistook intoxication for patriotism talked solemnly to each other of the  black invasion and shook hands in the unity of determination to resent this attack upon the dignity of the state

all the next day there was an ominous quiet in dorbury men who had no other occupation than lounging about the courthouse corner and in the barrooms were not to be seen there were no violent harangues in the livery stables and groceries mr raymond stothard was not out

about dusk the clans began to gather one by one they came from their holes and hidingplaces and made their way to the rendezvous over their drinks they talked in whispers and the gaslight flared on drawn swollen terrible faces their general had found the wherewithal to buy liquor and he plied them well

meanwhile on old mc lean street where stood the house of one of dorburys free black citizens another gathering equally silent equally stealthy and determined was taking place the signal had gone forth the warning had been received and free negro and contraband were drawing together for mutual protection not a word was spoken among them it was not the time for talk but they huddled together in the halflit room and only their hard labored breathing broke the silence to the freemen it meant the maintenance of all that they had won by quiet industry to the contrabands it meant the life or death of all their hopes of manhood now all artificial lines were broken down and all of them were brothers by the tie of necessity contraband and the man who a few days ago had looked down upon him with supreme contempt now pressed shoulder to shoulder a common greyness in their faces the same black dread in their hearts in the back room sick with fear waited the women and children upon the issue of the night depended all that they had prayed for was it to be peace and home or exile and slavery  their mother hearts yearned over the children who clustered helpless about their feet  if not for us god for these our little ones they prayed their minds went back to the plantation its pleasures and its pains they remembered all there had been the dances and the frolics and the meetings but these paled into insignificance before the memory of the field the overseer and the lash often oh too often they had bared their backs to the cruel thongs day by day they had toiled and sweated under the relentless sun but must these the products of their poor bodies do likewise  must they too toil without respite and labor without reward  they clasped their children in their arms with a hopelessness that was almost aggression

the little black babies that night did not know why their mothers hugged them with such terrible intensity or hushed them with such fierce tenderness when they cried

it was nearly midnight when the whisper ran round the circle in the front room  they are coming they are coming  and the men drew themselves closer together the sound of the shuffling of many feet and the noisy song of a drunken mob awoke the echoes of the quiet street then of a sudden the songs ceased as if some authoritative voice had compelled silence nearer and nearer moved the feet softer now but with drunken uncertainty they paused at the gate the lock clicked the men within the room were tense as bended steel then came a thunderous knock at the door no answer

there was a pause and apparently a silent conference the rioters had sought several other suspected houses the chapel among them and found them empty here then was the place which they had definitely settled as the negroes stronghold

 open in the name of the law came a voice

the blacks huddled closer together then came a blow upon the door as from the stock of a gun

 gently said the voice  gently but the spirit of violence having once been given rein could not be controlled and blow after blow rained upon the none too strong door until it yielded and fell in with a crash but here the mob found themselves confronted by a surprise instead of a cowering crowd of helpless men they found themselves confronted by a solid black wall of desperate men who stood their ground and fought like soldiers at first it was fist stave club and the swift silent knife and only the gasp of forced breath and the groan of some fallen man told that the terrible fight went on then a solitary shot rang out and the fusillade began the blacks began to retreat because they had few weapons putting their womenfolks behind them gradually the white horde poured into the room and filled it

now boys said stothards voice from the rear  rush them   and he sprang forward but a black face confronted him its features distorted and its eyes blazing it was the face of the contraband boy whom he had abused the day before a knife flashed in the dim light and in a moment more was buried in the leaders heart the shriek half of fear half of surprise which was on his lips died there and he fell forward with a groan while the black man sped from the room the wildeyed boy who went out into the night to be lost forever killed stothard not because he was fighting for a principle but because the white man had made his mother cry the day before his ideas were still primitive

the rout of the negroes was now complete and they fled in all directions some ran away only to return when the storm had passed others terrified by the horror of the night went never to return and their homes are occupied in dorbury today by the men who drove them from them

the whites too had had enough and their leader being killed they slunk away with his body into the night which befriended them

in the days that ensued after the mustering out of toms regiment neither he nor dorbury had time for idleness the events attending the conflict both in the field and at home had followed each other too swiftly for that tom had found military service under the government in a capacity that gave him larger experience in the world of men his letters had given his father exceeding joy and mary and nannie were inordinately proud of him his messages to them were read over and over again as the girls prepared themselves for sleep or sat halfrobed upon their bedsides

the gossips had still spared the brother the story of the breaking up of his home and he went on with his work happy in his unconsciousness when the final reorganization of the first took place in november he relinquished his other duties and joined his comrades at louisville whence they set out on their journey further south

in the meantime dorbury had continued to seethe as before with the conflicting elements within its narrow borders patriotism and prejudice ran riot side by side and it was a hard race between them one set of men talked of the glory of righteous war while another deplored the shedding of fraternal blood the war republicans hurled invectives at the peace advocates and the latter hurled back invectives and reproaches

before the first went back into the field an incident occurred which showed the temper of both parties a meeting was being held in the square in front of the courthouse its object was to protest against what the opponents of the war called the attempted coercion of free citizens mr vallandigham whose position both as a prominent citizen and former congressman gave weight to whatever he said had spoken and the hearts of his hearers were inflamed with bitterness another speaker halfhearted and little trusted rose to address the assembly he was a fiery demagogue and depended for his influence upon his power to work upon the passions of the lower element his audience knew this he knew it and for an instant paused in embarrassment

just at that moment  nigger ed  strolled up and joined the crowd the eye of the orator took him in and lighted with sudden inspiration here was all the text he needed raising his tall spare form he pointed in silence until every face was turned upon the negro then he said  gentlemen it is for such as that and worse that you are shedding your brothers blood without another word he sat down it was the most convincing speech he had ever made the unhappy advent of the negro had put a power into the words of a man who otherwise would have been impotent it was the occasion and the man to take advantage of it it may have been claptrap but in the heated spirit of the time it was a shot that went straight to the mark the crowd began to murmur and then broke into hisses and jeers rude jests with more of anger than humor in them were bandied back and forth

one side was furious that blood should be spilled for such as the negro bellringer while the other was equally incensed at being accused of championing his cause

higgerstealers abolitionistsshoutedone

 copperheads  shouted the other while some of them tried fruitlessly to explain that they had no interest in niggers

 he even wears your army cap   some one cried  why dont you give him a gun  

the stentorian voice of bradford waters rose over the storm your friends the rebels he said  have got the niggers digging trenches and tilling the fields at home to help them in food

 ah thats their business was the reply

 i dont know that a gun is any better than a spade

back and forth the controversy raged each party growing hotter and hotter negro ed stood transfixed at the tempest he had raised he looked from face to face but in none of them found a friend both sides hated him and his people he was like a shuttlecock he was a reproach to one and an insult to the other

 gentmen gentmen he began to stammer to the men about him who were hustling him

 knock him down hes been serving the men who fought our brothers

 tear off his cap the black hound its the same our soldiers wear

 kill him if it wasnt for his kind wed have had no trouble  

whats he doing here anyhow this is a white mans union down with niggers 

and so the bewildered black man was like to be roughly handled by both parties but that an opportune interruption occurred the gavel sounded sharp and harsh and some one was speaking

 let ed alone the speaker said  he has done nothing to you he has rung our bells followed our fires amused our children and always been harmless

the crowd began to remember that all this was true

 he is not his people nor the father of them the trouble is not with him but with us its not without its within its not what he is but what we believe

stephen van dorens voice had arrested the activities of the mob and they gave him absolute attention in the respite the negro glad of his release slipped away with the insulted cap in his hand what he felt is hardly worth recording he was so near the animal in the estimation of his fellows perhaps too near in reality that he could be presumed to have really few mental impressions he was frightened yes he was hurt too but no one would have given him credit for that much of human feeling they had kicked a dog and the dog had gone away that was all yet ed was not all the dog his feeling was that of a child who has tried to be good and been misunderstood he should not have felt so though for he knew dorbury and the times by an instinct that was truer than conscious analysis and he should have known if he did not that the people who mistreated him were not sane and accountable but the under dog does not stop to philosophize about his position so ed went his way in anger and in sorrow

after van dorens interruption the meeting went on in a somewhat more moderate strain though the speeches that were made were bitter enough a new but vigorous and efficient governor was in the chair and at times the people chafed under the enforcement of measures which in a state of war he deemed necessary no great disaster had yet come to their own troops to unite the people in one compact body or to make them look farther than themselves or their fancied personal grievances the sight of the wounded and the news of the dead had not yet thrilled them into the spirit for selfsacrifice this was to come later it was to come when the soil of the state was threatened by hostile invasion  when pittsburg landing had told its bloody story and the gloom of death hung over their homes

but now all was different after the first enthusiasm for war had passed a reaction had set in recruiting went on slowly while the citizens looked on with but languid interest on the other hand they flamed with anger at every hint that their personal rights were being trampled on when men lacking both honor and loyalty wrote seditious letters when others more earnest than prudent talked in the public highways or harangued from platforms it was all free speech the fetich so dear to american worshippers and they resented any attempt to restrain or abridge it

a man might live and work under the flag whose soldiers he counselled to desert that was all within his private right another might assail the motives and powers of the government under which he lived sneer at its chief executive and pour out the vials of his wrath against the unholy war which the union was waging and still it was only his right any attempt to check disaffection within its borders was construed into coercion where now and then some too bold speaker was arrested by the authorities war democrat and peace democrat united in denouncing the act as highhanded and unwarranted and republican joined with them or was silent

upon one thing they were all united and that was their hatred and disdain for the hapless race which had caused the war upon its shoulders fell all the resentment and each individual stood for his race if their boys suffered hardships in the field they felt that in some manner they avenged them by firing a negros home or chasing him along the dark streets as he made his way home from church it became an act of patriotism to push a black woman from the sidewalks

it only needed the knowledge that free men of color had offered their services to the state to bring out a storm of invective and abuse against the  impudent niggers there were some who expressed fear that the governor might yield to their plea and threatened if he did that they would call their sons and brothers from the army and resent the insult by withholding all aid from the union arms but they need have had no fear of their governor strong as he was and independent he was too wise a man not to know and to respect the trend of popular sentiment and he heard with unyielding heart the prayer of the negroes to be put in the blue but the time did come when the despised race was emancipated and they were accepted in the field as something other than scullions the time came yes but this governor was not one of the men who helped to hasten it it may have been his personal feeling rather than his acquiescence to the will of the people that prompted his reply to the massachusetts recruiting agent the new england commonwealth was recruiting her black regiments and was drawing men of color from every state when the chief executive of ohio was consulted he was so far from objecting to the use of his negroes by another state that he expressed himself to the effect that he would be glad if they would take  every damned nigger out of the state it may have been irritation at the anxiety and annoyance that this unwelcome population had caused the good governor which brought forth this strong expression whether it was this or not the fact remains that many black men of ohio went into the massachusetts regiments and when they had made for themselves a record that shamed contempt it was to that state that popular belief gave the honor of their deeds

this forecasting of events would be entirely out of place but that it serves in some manner to show the spirit of the times in a loyal and nonslaveholding state at a crucial moment of the nations life it was a moment when only a spark was needed to light the whole magazine of discontent and blow doubt and vacillation into a conflagration of disloyalty

the spark was near being supplied on a monday night in may upon the flint of dorburys public pride and prejudice the blow was struck and for a time the flash seemed imminent for a long time a brave and rugged citizen of the little town a man having the courage of his convictions and deeply trusted by his fellowmen had been outspoken in his denunciation of the war wherever he was he did not fear to express his belief in its illegality and unrighteousness he was a strong man and an earnest one and in his strength and earnestness lay his power over his fellowmen he had represented them in congress and he had done well they believed in him and now when he dared to say of the nation struggling for its very life that it was wrong he found many followers though some like bradford waters had already fallen from vallandighams side for a while he went his way unmolested until one speech a thought too bold in expression brought down upon him the wrathâa wrath rather restraining than vindictiveâof the government

it was near midnight when a small company of soldiers from cincinnati went to the door of vallandighams dorbury home the inmates of the house were abed and all was darkness and silence there was no reply to the thunderous summons on the panels some inkling of the object of this midnight visit having leaked out or been suspected the summons was repeated and while the men talked in low whispers below a head was put out of an upstairs window and a voice called aloud some apparently meaningless words which however were construed into a signal for aid from this time the soldiers delayed no longer for in the present state of feeling the approach of reinforcements to those within would possibly result in bloodshed this they were anxious to avoid so making their way into the house they went from room to room frequently having to break open locked and barred doors until they found the object of their search and in spite of threat and protest hurried away with him to a waiting train

a small crowd collected and followed the soldiers to the station but with the exception of a stone occasionally hurled it confined itself to threats and abuse

 this will be heard from said one

 it will do more to make ohio fight against the war than anything else

 kidnappers kidnappers  was the cry

on the morrow the excitement in dorbury was intense but history has dealt sufficiently with all that was done then with the speeches that were made the bombastic letters that were writtenâthe damage that was inflicted upon private property

the town ironclad in its personal pride gave itself up to an orgy of disloyalty a tempest in a teapot some one will say but the spirit that raged in the teapot showed the temper of the larger cauldron which seethed over the same fire

 what do you think of this later bit of work   asked davies on the way to the office the morning after the arrest

i think what i have always thought that whatever is good for the union is right but his tone was not so assured as usual

 you used to think a great deal of vallandigham though

 in such a time as this i have no time for personal feelings i have said that before

 yes it seems about true we all seem to have taken leave of our senses and to have suspended the operations both of our countrys constitution and of our natural affections

 it is a strange time and we must change with the times

 it is a horrible a fanatical time and i shall thank god when it is over however the end may come through union or peaceful separation

 i would rather see the country drenched in blood than the latter

waters said davies slowly as if the light were just dawning upon him  im afraid youre a fanatic im afraid youre a fanatic

but waters went on moodily and did not reply

down there in virginia where walter had now settled into staying with a certain selfsatisfaction the tides of war flowed with vigor but did not reach and submerge the house where he kept the even tenor of his days there were of course midnight visits at times from the soldiers of both sides but the place enjoyed a peculiar exemption from molestation by either confederate or unionist to the one it was the home of old colonel stewart an ardent southerner to the others it was the place of abode of a paroled union prisoner walters position was anomalous and although he was forced into it he felt keenly that he was playing a double role he no longer yearned to be with the northern forces but would it not be foolish to proclaim his defection from the house tops  the southern soldiers and his neighbors looked upon him as a unionist chafing at restraint and they laughed at him for a caged bantam had their surmises been true he would have scorned their laughter but as it was it cut him like a whip because to his shame what they laughed at did not exist nor could he tell them this they would have thought even less of him as a renegade who changed his allegiance and views under the stress of imprisonment

now and then rather too frequently than he cared to own he felt a thrill of envy for nelson etheridge who had flung himself body and soul into the union cause and from whom he heard occasionally when he rode over to see miss etheridge or when she and his sister emily exchanged visits  heres a man for you he would say to himself  one who has not only dared but continues to dare one who placed as i am placed would feel the galling bonds of his restraint and do something besides feel ridiculously comfortable

perhaps it was because he was so youngâand youth takes itself seriously being in its own eyes either god or devil hero or cravenâthat walter was so hard upon his own failings sometimes however the truth that his position was not of his own seeking forced itself upon his mind but unwilling to accept this excuse he questioned himself if he were not glad that things had turned out as they had to this he must answer yes and so he fell again to cursing his own complacency

it is not to be supposed however that he lived constantly in a state of selfcondemnation other moods were frequent and lasting it took him a very short time to fall into the ways of a gentleman farmer and he took a boyish pleasure in directing the work of the negroes about the place his moments of greatest happiness were when he was riding about the fields on some duty or other and he would be joined by emily or miss etheridge but his greatest moments of depression would follow when he saw or thought he saw a question or a reproach in the girls eyes

since his arrival at his fathers house he had come to see more and more of this radiant southern beauty and a frank friendship had grown up between them friendship he called it for cherishing in his heart the memory of his regard for nannie he did not dream that love could touch him but slowly and reluctantly he began to compare the image in his heart with the fair girl at his side and the image suffered finally he began to say that nannie had appealed strongly to his boyish fancy while this woman reached his maturer manhood in spite of his selfquestionings walter failed to see the humor implied in the fact that without any great moral mental or spiritual cataclysm this maturer manhood had come to him in a very short time after he had looked into dollys grey eyes

she often rallied him about their first romantic meeting and she would laugh the most musical of laughs as he told her about his trepidation as he approached the house when she forgot herself and was merry among friends she had the habit of falling into the softsouthern manner of speech

its right down mean she said to walter in one of her bantering moods  that you didnt let a body know you were coming i reckon you and my brother nelson would have had a mighty nice time together but you were entirely too startling

 if i had known that i was going to find friends behind those doors he bent his gaze tenderly upon her  i should have acted differently knocked easily or roared me as gently as a sucking dove

poor nelson i dont reckon many folks would have stayed on and dared capture like he did but nelson always was such a daring boy

walter winced he thought he saw the question in her eyes and something veiled in what she said

did she despise him after all and only give him the semblance of friendship for his sisters sake  the thought made him miserable although he never stopped to tell himself what logical reason there was for his being miserable if the girl whom he had known but a few weeks did despise him

 the union has gained a gallant man in your brother he said because his head was in a tumult and he could not say anything else she did not recognize the commonplaceness of his remark however it was praise for her brother and so sublime

 oh i wish you could have known him she went on youd have been sure to love him dont you know she said with a sudden impulse  since ive known you ive always thought of you and him in the same company marching and fighting together i dont care in what uniform blue or grey there there now she added gravely ive made you feel bad but dont lets think of it yours is the fortune of war just as whatever happens to him will be

walter was pale from forehead to lips and it was the knowledge of this that checked the girl with the belief that she had pained him by touching the subject of his detention

 im afraid youre not a very good unionist said the young man somewhat recovering himself

im a woman mr stewart and i reckon youre too young to know just what that implies im in favor of the union because nelsons fighting for it and he wouldnt do anything that he didnt think was right but i am a southern girl and i love the south now what am i going to do you dont know though for its only women who let their affections run against principle

he gave her a quick suspicious glance she was unconscious he was on the rack

 it isnt only women he said

you only say that to be polite and because its so different with you but i know better

he rose quickly and on the plea of some obligation moved away leaving her to emilys company and conversation

the rest of the day was a trying time for walter it was now unmistakable dolly etheridge had seen through him had seen his weakness and his defection and in her contempt for him delighted to stab him with her quiet sarcasm what a thing he must be to call forth the girls disgust how she must look down upon him when she compared him with her brother such a brother and in fancy he saw nelson etheridge sweeping the enemy before him to the huzzas of a great nation well anyway dolly could not think less of him than he thought of himself

he would rather not have seen her any more that night but he had promised to go with emily to take her home he appeared at supper with the best grace possible and when it was over joined the girls for the ride in the moonlight it would have been pleasant to him this cantering by dollys side with the moon a silver globe above them and the scent of magnolias coming sweetly to their senses but that his mind was sadly busy with what she must be thinking of him he kept a moody silence while the girls chattered on sometimes even in his desperation he thought of violating his parole but his face grew hot with shame and the thought went as quickly as it came

dolly and emily because they both believed walter immersed in sad thoughts respected his silence and when he had helped the girl alight at her door and given the horse to a black servant aroused from somewhere the former gave him her hand with a little sympathetic pressure that made his heart leap but then the next moment he was saying  bah she is only sorry for having stabbed me so cruelly but the reason for the stabbing remains

as they turned their horses homeward again walter seemed in no better mood for talking than before but the moonlight and the sweetness of the soft night seemed to have got into his sisters tongue she drew her horse close to her brothers and laid her hand gently on his

im afraid youre not well tonight walter whats the matter  

 oh nothing nothing im really very well  but you have been so silent and i really believe dolly expected you to talk to her

 i hardly think she could have cared much either one way or the other he said bitterly

 if you can say that you know very little about dolly or in fact about women at all you must know that she likes you and likes you very well

i dont believe it said walter doggedly but something he did just at the moment to the horse he was riding made her arch her neck and step out as daintily as a lady

 but she does like you and if she didnt you would soon know it shes very peculiar and as open as the day she can never conceal her thoughts and feelings some people call it a fault but i call it a virtue

 one would think at times that she was sarcastic or spoke under a veil he was making a great effort to be indifferent but the bridle in his hand grew tense

 why shes as innocent of such things as a child how stupid you are walter i never knew you to be so before and i did so hope you would be good friends

 well well havent we been  

 it seemed so for awhile but you were so different tonight

was i did she notice it the question was eager

 being a woman she could scarcely help noticing it

well i was thinking he said lamely and then burst out  what a glorious night it is and how sweet those magnolias are i didnt notice it before why emily its good to be alive

 one wouldnt have thought it of you a little while ago you were so quiet and subdued

 oh well there are times when the beauty of a night sinks into our souls too deep for words walter winced in spirit at his own hypocrisy

 there i told dolly that you felt more than you said

you told her that she talks about me to you  

 oh sometimes you come up in the course of conversation

 what a wonderful girl she is

 youâdo you think so  

 that is she shows a deep affection for her brother which is commendable

 ohâbutâdont most sisters  

 there are very few such sisters as i imagine miss etheridge and know you to be

she forgave him instantly you dear old walter

 and you think she likes me   it was sweet to him to say it after his bitter thoughts

 i know she does and you should have known it too

 her brother must be a fine fellow

you would like him i know

 lets sit out and talk awhile its altogether too lovely to go in said the young man as they turned in at the gate

i shall like it said emily and giving their horses to a groom they sat down on the veranda steps fr a few moments there was a silence between them and both sat gazing at the starry heavens then waiter said falteringly  iâiâreallyâi am very much interested in miss etheridges brother tell me more about him

then his sister laughed not teasingly nor banteringly as some sisters would have done but with a little satisfied note and she said  brother mine there is only one thing more transparent than glass and her brother caught her about the waist and kissed her for some reason not quite clear to himself so they sat together long that night and talked of the etheridges brother and sister

in the young man his fellowsoldier walter evinced a polite and conservative interest but he was apt to bring the conversation back to the sister when it seemed to have a tendency to remain too long away from her if he found no more pertinent remark to make he would turn to emily and say  so you think she likes me   and this was sufficient to start the stream of talk flowing in the proper channel

when finally they sought their rooms that night and the young man dropped asleep there was a smile on his lips and the words on his tongue  she likes me she likes me

what surprised walter when the morning brought with waking a review of the nights happenings was that emily simple emily who had never had a love affair in her life that he knew should have discovered to him his own secret or maybe she had discovered nothing that really existed at the time perhaps the train had been laid the fuse set and her remark only been the match to set the whole agoing however it made no matter at all how or when it happened it was true now to let dolly know it was remarkable how soon and how easily all his fears and misgivings had disappeared it was as if this state of exultation had been waiting for him and he had but to step into it why had he delayed so long 

the days that followed were filled with softer sounds than the sounds of war and doings that had no shadow or show of the harshness of the camp walter dazzled by the glory of the new world that had opened up before him forgot the hardness of his lot forgot perhaps even the deeper sympathy that should have gone from him to the men in the fieldâfor love is a jealous mistress he walked and rode much with his sweetheart by the grassgrown bridle paths and under the ancient trees his heart sang a song to hers and hers replied in kind emily like a good sister knew when to be judiciously absent and dolly understood all that he would say to her long before he dared speak

it was not until the warm southern november was painting the hills and valleys that he told her of his love and his hope

 it seems somehow dolly that i have no right to speak to you placed as i am but what am i to do  the message beats at my heart until at times i think you must hear it i love you and have loved you from the very first night that we met

 are you sure   she asked quietly but with just a suspicion of mirth

 i was never surer of anything in my life

 did you always know that you loved me  

 i did not always say it to myself as i say it now sometimes tremblingly sometimes with exultation but i must always have known it else why should your lightest word have had the power of making me happy or miserable  

they were walking slowly over the crisp pine needles in the copse not far from the house she drew closer to his side and her hand slipped into his

poor walter she said i used to make you miserable i never wanted to do that because 

 because   he said eagerly

 because i do love you

he took her in his arms and held her close to him his head bowed humbly

 what am i to be worthy of this   he said at last

you are walter my walter my hero

even in that moment of ecstasy he winced at the word hero he was not of the material of which heroes are made and he knew it but he would not shadow their happiness now let her think well of him if she could later he would try to deserve her and after all what man is so good so upright as the woman who loves him believes 

later when the deep solemnity of the first betrothal had given way to a gayer mood she asked him  what will my virginia friends say to my marrying a yankee  

 what can they say when you are more than half yankee yourself

 i declare im not im southern clear through

he took her hands and laughed down into her eyes no youre not youre justâjust a woman and im only a man and were both more lovers than anything else so let your friends say what they will and the answer seemed to satisfy her walter himself was very well satisfied and when two young people are perfectly satisfied with themselves and each other the world is shut from their vision and time trips a merry pace

 let us keep our sweet secret for awhile she said when the lengthening shadows warned them that it was time even for a lovers tãªteã tãªte to be done

 let us he assented  if we can it seems so much more our own but can we  

 oh i can i know and you can of course for its only women who are untrustworthy with secrets

yes thats true but there are secrets and secrets there never was such a one as this before so we have no foundation upon which to make a conclusion

you are a goose she said and then paid him for being one walter was right though they went into supper and had not been at table five minutes before every one knew something in their faces or manner or the way they played with the food laughed inconsequently cast glances at each other told more plainly than words what had happened love had put on them his subtle sign

of course walter being a man thought that he was carrying off his part with wonderful grace and shrewdness but when emily teased dolly as they were passing out on the veranda the newly betrothed hid her blushing face and cried oh emily how did you know

it was within a few days after this that reports began to come to the residents in and about fairfax of the presence of guerillas foraging and marauding bands in the neighborhood and frequently greatly exaggerated accounts were given of their depredations walter heard them all with a sinking at the heart for the safety of his betrothed she was alone there with only three or four black servants in whose valor or faithfulness he had little or no belief the first night or two that the rumors were current he contented himself with getting to horse and in silence and secrecy patroling the road in front of the etheridge cottage nothing occurred but as the rumors grew darker his state of mind became more perturbed and he decided upon more vigorous measures but dollys danger had not occurred to him alone and before he could break the subject to his sister she had come to him with a troubled face

walter she said wont you excuse meâi âhavent been spying on you but ive guessed where youve been the last two nights

a thrill half of shame and half of pride in himself shook him

 well wasnt i right emily   he asked

 of course you were for the time being but do you think it is enough you know we had word from miss mason that the guerillas visited her place last night and if it hadnt been for the servants they would have been rude or worse now dolly is poor and has so few negroes about her

 well what can we do 

i wouldnt trust those black folks anyhow since theyve got notions of freedom in their heads

nor i but i cant go over there and stay dolly could come here

 would she  do you think she would  

 of course she would mother and i both agree that this is altogether the best plan and we wondered if youd mind riding over for her tonight

 would i mind  

the tone was quite sufficient and nothing more was needed to be said

the moon was at the full and flooded the landscape with silvery light when accompanied by sam a slave boy to whom he had become greatly attached and bearing the invitation from his mother and sister walter set out for dollys house for a time they went their way in silence and then sam with the uncontrollable desire of his race for lyric expression broke into a song that woke the echoes the young man he was hardly yet a master even in his thoughts listened with pleasure until he saw a dark form beside the road rise up gaze at them for a moment and then disappear into the surrounding wood

 sh said walter without mentioning what he had seen  i dont believe id sing any more sam theres no telling what we might start up

 wisht to de lawd it ud be a possum said sam chuckling with easy familiarity but he hushed his song

if we started up anything it might not be something so pleasant for you as a possum

not pleasant fu me replied sam huh uh you do know dis hoss

 so youd leave me would you you rascal  well youre a great one

 specs id have to leave you ef i couldnt tek you erlong

as they approached their destination walter suddenly drew rein and laid his hand on his companions bridle he pointed quickly and silently to the form of a man clearly outlined in the moonlight he was standing at the front of the cottage window attempting to peer into the room through a crack between the lower blind and the sill so intent was he upon his spying that he had not noticed the approach of the others

dismount here said walter and tie the horses under the shadow of that mulberry tree i believe theres mischief going on

the negro did as he was bidden and hastened back to his companions side just as the intruder walked up and began knocking at the door after some delay the voice of a negro from within questioned  whos dat  

never mind was the answer you open up

the silent watcher was breathless with interest but he kept cool enough to say  sam you slip around to the cabins and rouse what negroes you can be ready for whatever happens for theres no telling how many of them there are without a thought of his joke about desertion sam slipped away leaping across the moonlit places from shadow to shadow while walter crept nearer to the man at the door

it had not been opened but a negro came from a side entrance and confronted the intruder

 why dont you open the door   was the harsh question fired at the dark cerberus

well suh i didnt jes know who you was an i tought mebbe i could tell you whutevah you wanted to know

 its none of your damn business who i am im here in the name of the law and youd better open up allfired quick or itll be the worse for you

the negro went back around the house and in a few minutes the door opened as he passed the light walter saw that he wore the uniform of a confederate officer

the door closed behind him but stewart becoming spy in turn came near enough to hear what was said within

 where is your mistress   in the officers voice

 she done retahed suh

 tell her i wish to see her

 she done retahed

very well let her get up tell her that her brother is supposed to be skulking within the lines and that i am sent to search the house for him

 you kin such de house

 i shall begin with her room

 dey is no one in huh room but huh suh

 how dare you talk back to me you black hound  

the harsh voice was suddenly checked and then walter heard another that made his heart leap within his throat

never mind mingo it said i am out of my room now lieutenant forsythe went on dolly calmly  you are at liberty to begin there now and search where you please the tone reeked with scorn

you will go with me was the reply

a trusted servant may accompany you

you will go with me i said

 as you will lieutenant but this is the way you pay your scoresâcome when there is no man in the house save a servant to take revenge for a womans no

we will not discuss that matter now miss etheridge

walter had pushed the door open and he saw that the mans face went red and white at dollys words he saw too the fierce eyes of the black servant fixed on forsythe and for one instant he wondered if he were needed in the next he had flung the door open and stepped into the room every eye turned upon him and he said clearly and why lieutenant forsythe must the lady go with you  

 oh walter dolly cried and then checked herself with a sigh of relief the lieutenant was livid

 and who in hell are you   he asked in a tense voice

i am walter stewart at your service lieutenant

the paroled yankee eh oh i see he said in a tone that put murder in walters heart  it is thus that you are protected miss etheridge

 you may go on with your search lieutenant that you have a perfect right to do but miss etheridge protected or not will not leave this room

the two men stood glaring into each others faces while mingo relaxed from his vigilance was chuckling in a corner on a sudden there was a rush of feet without and four brawny men sprang into the room the open door and the loud voices had attracted forsythes minions who had been placed at a convenient distance the lieutenant smiled grimly as his men surrounded walter

 i reckon mr stewart he said with a sneer  that youll go a bit slower now

 im not so sure of that lieutenant said walter and as he spoke four negroes led by sam and bearing stout clubs swept into the room the soldiers if such the ragged guerillas whom forsythe had taken as his accomplices could be called w tere completely taken by surprise and wilted as the threatening blacks now man to man lined up beside them

while the disappointed officer stood there chewing his mustache with rage walter had time for a few reflections upon the fidelity of a people whom he so little trusted because their fidelity militated against themselves and it settled something in his mind that made his eyes flash and his lips press close together

you may proceed with your search now lieutenant said dolly sweetly

 it is unnecessary now i suppose our bird has flown and i shall not put myself to the trouble of searching your empty rooms

 are you sure that you did not know before you came lieutenant that you would not find my brother here  

 i am sure that i have found out some things that i did not know before he answered glancing meaningly at the girls protector and then the devil which is in every man became strong in walter it overcame him his fist shot out and lieutenant forsythes lips spilled blood the officers eyes grew green and his hand went quickly to his holster and then the veneering that had cracked and shown the brute in him closed again and wiping the blood from his mouth he said with the calmness of intense anger what this calls for mr stewart is entirely beyond the limits of my present official duty will you grant me the pleasure of a few minutes private conversation   they stepped outside and a brief whispered conversation ensued they were equally placid when they returned

 attention  about face  forward march   and without further word or sign forsythe and his minions marched away

 follow them quietly sam and see that they are up to no mischief and you miss etheridge get your things on for you must go with me he had forgotten all about the formal invitation

 when is it to be   she asked in reply

he would have tried to evade but she looked at him so steadfastly and earnestly that he could not

 tomorrow morning he said simply  but it is to be taken up as a merely personal matter so i beg that you say nothing about it now go

she pressed his hand quickly

come long miss dolly said mingo still chuckling with glee  hyeah mandy stanin behime de do wid a flatiron i reckon ef mas stewat hadn a come shed a to dat game roostah up fo i could a said jack robinson

when sam had returned and reported all well they got to saddle and started on their way two of the negroes mounting and coming behind to prevent treachery dolly and walter rode side by side and sam who rode before had neither eyes nor ears

do you really believe he was looking for nelson  she asked

 do you  

 oh walter he has a grudge and he is relentless he proposed to me once and he has pursued me ever since

 for that reason if no other i shall try to kill him tomorrow and the shadow being convenient he kissed her

there was some commotion in the house when the party reached home and the story was told in its entirety but nothing save praise fell to walters lot for his action dolly respected his wishes and said nothing of the impending duel though her heart ached for her lover

 i shall see you before you go in the morning she said when they were alone for a moment before parting that night

 i shall be leaving very early before you are up

 before i am up  walter what can you be thinking of me  why i shall not go to bed

 you must dear for i shall and i shall sleep well

 as you say but i shall see you in the morning nevertheless

walter called sam to him as he went up to his room

the arrangements for the meeting between walter stewart and lieutenant forsythe were as simple as the brevity of their conversation indicated the whole matter was to be kept a profound secret as much on account of walters position as a paroled prisoner as because of the others place in the army they were to face each other in a small open space under the trees that lined a little creek about three miles from the etheridge cottage they were both familiar with the place and agreed upon it with equal readiness because of the secrecy which they wished maintained there were to be no witnesses beside the two seconds but each might bring with him a trusted friend or servant thus promptly they arranged the affair leaving only to the assistants yet to be chosen the task of marking the ground and giving the signal pistols were the weapons

when after parting with dolly walter called sam to his room it was to dispatch him on a delicate and doubtful errand recognizing the peculiar attitude of his neighbors towards him he had formed but few friendships and these only of the most tentative kind now in this emergency he needed a friend and a confidant his mind turned to but one person a young dr daniel whose frank manner had won him as much as he dared yield himself he now sent the servant to bring to him this man upon the plea of most pressing business

in less than an hour the young physician was with him he was an openfaced breezy looking young man of nineandtwenty or thereabouts with the assured manner of perfect selfpossession and selfreliance

he came into the room with a soft though brisk step but stopped in surprise to see walter pacing up and down the room

 come in doctor

 why why man from the expression of that rascal of yours i expected to find you in bed tossing with a raging fever or laid up with a broken leg

 i shall not be your patient tonight doctor tomorrow who can say  

eh whats this not thinking of suicide are you  

 im thinking of how good a shot my opponent may be the fact is dr daniel i called you here on a business that is almost if not wholly impertinent but i hope you will pardon and help me for there is no one else to whom i may turn he then recounted to him the events of the night the physicians face already inclined to ruddiness growing redder and angrier as he went on

 now doctor concluded walter i am sure that forsythes intentions were neither honest nor official and i have only tried to do my duty is it too much to ask you to forget what i am politically and to be my friend and second in this matter  

 forget what you are  damn what you are stewart ill tell you what ill do man ill change places with you ill let you be my second

 its my fight

 but dont you see its a nasty business and might get you into complications

 i am willing to risk all that

 oh come now be sensible the ladys brother is a good friend of mine

 the lady is a good friend of mine

 but i know the whole story how he has tried to annoy that girl ever since she rejected him two years ago as any girl of decency and spirit would have done i know he has always kept just outside the limit that would give her brother the right to fill his carcass full of lead he has overstepped it now and i want a chance to get a shot at the dirtiest hound in all virginia give it to me

 wish i could old man but i want it myself

 oh well i always was a selfish dog its your say and if you wont you wont but anyhow im with you and ill be in at the death if i cant have the brush

 thank you doctor your kindness is even greater than i could have hoped for even from you

 yours isnt or youd have given me a shot at that cur but remember if he happens to hit you and god forbid that i get the next chance at his hide

 i wouldnt want to leave the business to a better man and now let us complete our arrangements and then you may get to bed

they talked for a short time longer and then walter conducted the physician to his room while he gave his attention to one or two other duties the last words the buoyant young southerner said to him as he began to undress were  um youre a lucky dogâa shot at forsythe  

it was before the darkness of the night had given way to the mornings grey that the men were up and ready for the saddle dr daniel had already reached the lawn where sam was holding the horses walter loitered down the hallway half expecting yet half doubting that he should see dolly

 shes asleep of course he told himself  and im glad of it how could i expect her to get up after such a night as she has had i was a brute to think of it nevertheless there was a dissatisfied feeling tugging at his heart as he stepped out on the veranda but his foot had scarcely touched the floor when his eye caught the flash of a womans white shawl up under some vines that overhung the porch his heart suddenly relieved from its tension gave a great leap as he hastened towards her

 dolly he said  i was afraid you wouldnt come indeed i didnt want you to dear

 i had to come if only to bid you godspeed walter come back to me you will wont you  

 to answer that lies beyond me my darling but i will try if i dont

 dont say thatâyou will

 goodbye now

 goodbye walter goodbye and strength to you and a safe return goodbye

she went back and he hastened down and swung into the saddle

we must not keep the gentlemen waiting he said to the doctor as they rode away slowly until out of earshot of the house

 it will be enough to leave him lie waiting afterwards and i hope you will leave him for a long wait after its all over

well its a chance you know and im willing to take it if he leaves me instead i guess sam here can take me home across his horse sam was trailing along carrying the pistol case but he caught the words and spurred up to his master

mas waltah he said solemnly  ef dat man hits you dey kin bun me er hang me but he ain gwine leave dis place alive

the doctor suddenly halted horse and turned on the negro

now look here sam he said its all right for you to be protecting your master but whatever happens if you raise a hand against john forsythe ill kill you on the instant when your master is done with him hes my meat and hell hardly take the reckoning of us both

sam looked appealingly to his master

 thats right the latter replied  youre not in this part of it sam but you did your share last night anyhow im not counting on leaving work for anybody this morning

for the rest of the journey they rode in silence but walters thoughts were busy with the events that had filled his life in the weeks since he had left ohio he reviewed the change that had come to him in his feelings towards the cause ho had espoused he saw how remorse for the disagreement with his father his affection for his family and the glamour of the south had all combined to win him from a righteous allegiance and made him lukewarm or indifferent to what he had once felt to be the absolute right he saw that in spirit if not in deed he was as much a deserter as the veriest renegade who stole from the marching ranks to hide in the thickets and by ways until his comrades had passed on he saw how much weaker a man he was now than on the day when he had gone out from his fathers house in dorbury though he did not see that the weakening process had been excusable even inevitable though he held himself mercilessly up to his own criticism the very fact that he was able to see these things in himself clearly was evidence of the approach of a new state of mind a change subtler than either of the others had been he had begun to get back to himself to be a man stronger than his surroundings with a spirit independent of his affections

at first contact with it to him as to many others beyond his years the condition of the south its life and its people had seemed all chivalry and romance the events of the past and the present days business had done more to tear aside this veil than anything else could have done it was clear to him now that they were not all gods and goddesses in dixieâthat if it were an eden at least it was not free from serpents he had received a royally good shaking up and now he began to perceive that some hasty conclusions which he had reached were not based upon fact one of these was that the north was eaten up by commercialism while the south was free from it another that northern honor and southern honor were two essentially different things both these beliefs died an early death as he reflected that here too men bought and bartered sold and intrigued the occurrences which had taken place within the last few months under his eyes now reacted one upon the other with the result of placing him surely strongly and logically where his first enthusiasm had placed him and for the first time since he had been paroled the irksome hatefulness of his situation was borne in upon him now he chafed to be in the field again now he felt the thrill of fighting for a great cause his eyes were flashing and his teeth clenched hard when the voice of the doctor called him to the business at hand

 here we are he cried as gaily as though they were a party reaching the picnic grounds  and were the first here of course

they dismounted and tied their horses and then began examining the ground it was a plot of greensward well surrounded by trees and sloping with a slow incline to a little creek that ran gurgling pastâa quiet pretty enough place but its very seclusion had made it the recipient of many a bloody secret in those days when men settled affairs of honor according to the code two trees stood opposite each other about twenty paces apart and these had won the name of the  duelling trees because the distance between them being paced the principals were usually placed one under each and many a deadly combat had been waged beneath their softly sighing branches

the grey dawn had given way to the warmer hues of morning when two other riders cantered into the circle of trees and halted

 its forsythe said the doctor

 and he only brings one of his troopers with him as second

 if it is true that he went on that errand last night without authority it is just as well that he does not have too many in his secret was the rejoinder

the men greeted each other with the utmost formality though there was a touch of brusqueness in the physicians recognition of the lieutenant while the two principals walked apart their seconds paused for a brief conference as to conditions in a little while dr daniel came to walter

 are you ready and steady old man  

 both was the calm reply

 the conditions are these  you are to be stationed at twenty paces back to back at the word you are to turn and fire where you stand then each has the privilege of advancing firing until one or the other is hit are you satisfied  

 perfectly

very well we are ready said the doctor to forsythes trooper and together they paced off the ground already so well known then the men were put in their places and each second saw to the condition of his principals weapon dr daniel stationed himself to the left and midway the ground while the trooper took a like position to the right

 are you ready gentlemen   said the latter

wo are ready

 one

then the clatter of horses hoofs broke the morning stillness and he paused both men waited with manifest impatience but neither spoke

 go on said the doctor  quick  

 two

forsythe half turned but it was too late a squad of horsemen in grey uniform burst into the enclosure and rode between the men

 walter stewart said the sergeant  i arrest you upon the charge of violating your parole

 can you not wait just one moment until this business can be dispatched said walter calmly

but the officer spurred away from him with a curt your business is not ours

never mind forsythe screamed daniel  ill take the job off of stewarts hands

 lieutenant forsythe is also under arrest said the sergeant

forsythe went very white but stood calm as a statue

you took a miserable cowardly way to save yourself he said when he and walter were brought together

you are mistaken lieutenant said the sergeant breaking in  one of your own men was the informant

the lieutenant bit his lip the three prisoners for the trooper was also put under arrest mounted their horses and were surrounded by a close guard

 why am i too not arrested   stormed the doctor

we had no orders regarding you sir was the reply and the little cavalcade cantered away leaving the physician swearing with feeling and distinction

never mind he said at last lets go home sam if that old trooper had been a bit quicker virginia might have been rid of the meanest sneak that ever scourged her but instead of that the party is broken up and nobody gets out of the mess but the doctor and the darky neither one worth arresting come lets go home

after the arrest of walter the doctor and sam rode back over their tracks one as disconsolate as the other it was not a pleasant duty that loomed up before them in the all too near future walter was gone he would be missed and questions would be asked then what 

 oh lord sighed the doctor  sam what are we going to do  what are we going to say to them when they ask for him  

well hit don seem deys nuffin else fu me to do but to tell de trufe

 my lord you are in desperate straits thats always a mans last resort how for my part id a good deal rather lie if it would do any good but the devils going to be raised and theyll be sure to find out biff there goes my reputation i tried to persuade your master to let me take this business on my hands it would have been a good deal better to have faced forsythe and have shot him or been shot than to face these bereaved women but im in for it now so come along sam you take a hint from me if i decide to tell the truth you tell it if i decide to lie you fall in and outlie the devil and stick to it

as they neared the stewart home the spirits of both of them sank lower still the sun was now overhead and was fast drying the dewladen grass by the roadside the day was clear and bright or they might have taken for an apparition the white faced figure that stepped out in the road before them

the doctor drew in his horse with an exclamation and sams eyes threatened to leave their sockets

 where is he  where is he   cried dolly  what has happened to him  

the dumbfounded men gazed first at the miserydistraught woman and then helplessly at each other

 oh dont keep me in suspense tell me where is walter she had thrown aside all reserve and false modesty and stood before them selfconfessed a woman distressed for the safety of her lover

 whyâwhyâmiss etheridge stammered daniel

you tell me sam i command you to tell me the truth i see in dr daniels eyes his intention to hide something from me

the slave looked at his companion for guidance but getting no help from him he mumbled mas walter wy he went wid de lootenant

 went with him  what do you mean  was he hurt  have you deserted him  oh doctor please please tell me it was for me that he went into this

daniel dismounted and throwing his bridle over his arm he began leading the girl towards the house

 ill tell you the truth he said and as briefly and gently as possible he related what had taken place

she heard him through in silence and then asked  what will they do with him  

 that i cannot tell miss etheridge but i dont see how they can do much when the truth is known

 but will the truth be known  

 i cannot vouch for that either but whatever i can do to make it known shall be done i am going up home to arrange my affairs so that i may be away and then i shall start for colonel braxtons headquarters whither he will be taken

 will you take a letter for me  

 with pleasure

 thank you doctor thank you for your kindness to him and to me i will have the letter ready when you return goodbye until then

she was hastening away but he detained her  i am going up to the house he said

 you must not i will break it to them as you cannot

 but do you think it quite right   he asked with a look of relief that belied his anxious tone

 i can do it better than you so do not wait for me mount and lose no time she hurried on and he rejoined sam

 its all right sam just keep your mouth shut the telling will be done for us better than we can do it

 by jove he said later as he left the servant at the gate and rode on past  if i could find a woman who loved me like that ill be hanged if i wouldnt risk it i would

with swift but reluctant steps dolly made her way homeward and sought out emily and her mother her face was pale and drawn with pain and her girlcompanion saw at once that something was wrong

 what is it dolly   she asked hastening to her

 let me sit down i dont know what you will say to me mrs stewart and you emily how you will feel towards me

 nothing can ever change us towards you dolly so be calm said emily putting her arms around her

i should have told you last night but he wouldnt let me he was afraid you would be worried

 is it about walter   exclaimed his mother  what has happened to him  

he is at colonel braxtons headquarters under arrest

 under arrest   cried the two women

 but dolly said emily  how could they arrest him  he was paroled

 oh you will think that i am a wicked heartless girl for it is all my fault

your fault how emilys tone was colder and she withdrew her arm from dollys waist

 dont leave me emily till you understand there was a personal encounter last night between walter and lieutenant forsythe and it resulted in a meeting between them this morning

 a duel  

 it would have been but they were both arrested by a squad this morning and taken away

 why did you not tell us this before dolly so that we might have stopped it   said mrs stewart sternly

walter forbade me and i could not violate his confidence

 there are times when even a violation of confidence might be justifiable

the girl raised her tearstained face to the older womans you do not understand she said  he was involved on my account and he trusted me suppose i had violated this trust told you and the matter had been stopped by you  what would they have said   his mother intervened to save him mrs stewart walters honor is as dear to me as to you or emily and i could not do that

 forgive me child you are right but this is very hard

 i know it but though i could not save him then without dishonor i shall try to help him now by writing the whole story to colonel braxton

 who will take it  

 dr daniel is going to the camp to intercede for walter and will call for my letter soon i will go now and write it do try to be calm they cant be hard upon him when they know what a hero he has been

mrs stewart patted the girls hand gently and said  his mother and sister will try to be as brave as

 his sweetheart cried dolly blushing and taking the greyhaired woman in her arms she kissed her and sped from the room emily laughed

 why daughter how can you laugh at such a time   asked her mother

 because i feel so sure that walter is safe and will come back to us unharmed and without dishonor

 dont be sanguine dear the conditions of war are very different from those of peace

 i know mother but would you have had him do less  

 i dont know and yes i do your fathers son could have done no less

it was not long before dr daniel came hastening back but quick as he was dolly etheridge was ready with her letter

i want you to forgive me he said for my part in this affair but you must understand that i am not greatly to blame i begged stewart to let me chip in but hes an awfully proud fellow you see and he wouldnt let me do it i was particularly anxious to get a chance at forsythe but your son mrs stewart said it was his quarrel and i could only play second fiddle to be sure i might have locked him in his room and gone as proxy but i didnt think hed like it

 why that would have been horrible exclaimed emily

yes but youd have had your brother with you now

 we should not have wanted him at that cost was the sisters reply

no walter has been perfectly right added the mother

 perhaps i did the best thing after all said the doctor ruefully   but its pretty hard to see such a chance escape never to return

 had you any quarrel with lieutenant forsythe

 oh no no special quarrel it was just general principles with me i really believe the confederate army would have voted your son a medal if he had rid them of a hound who gained his position through the worst influence and holds it through duplicity but i mustnt stand here chattering all morning i am quite ready to take your letter miss dolly and i am sure it will do as much good as you want it to do

miss etheridge handed him her missive with a blush  bring him back with you she said

well i wont promise to do just that but if i dont ill bring you good news anyhow and i wont spare any time in getting this into the proper hands goodmorning to you ladies and good cheer and the good doctor leaped into his saddle and cantered away leaving behind him a cheerier household than he had found

it was ten miles to his destination but he made short work of it sent his message through the lines and received safe conduct to the colonel this officer was a grizzled veteran who had seen service in the mexican war and who was bent on doing for the raw material that he had in hand what years of service had done for him he was as kind of heart as he was brusque of manner to him dr daniel came with his own story and dollys letter which the colonel read grimly

you are a friend of the prisoners i suppose yes i havent known him long but i have learned to like him right well

 do you know that this liking of yours and your connection with the affair is likely to involve you in difficulty 

well now i hadnt thought of that but it doesnt matter in the least

the colonel bent industriously over the paper in his hand and a smile flickered through his grey mustache

 are you acquainted also with lieutenant forsythe  

daniel straightened himself up angrily  i know forsythe

 i said lieutenant forsythe

 beg pardon colonel but

 enough suh who is this miss etheridge   shes a daughter of old nelson etheridge of rockford sir

 who was related i believe to the etheridges of mecklenbug county  

 well sir im not just up on genealogy and all that sort o thing but i dare say youre right most all virginians are related you know its become a state habit

again the colonel had recourse to the papers to hide his amusement when he looked up again he said  i shall have to detain you dr daniel until i look further into this case discipline has been altogether too lax here of late and while disaffection has not become common in virginia there is altogether too great a tendency towards it

 i hope you dont feel any doubt about me colonel  

 it isnt a matter of personal feeling

 of course not i ought to have known that in fact i did know it and yet i feel that you are saying  what is an ablebodied fellow like that doing at home   well im not home for choice or for all time yet there are some things to bo done before i can go where the rest of the fellows of my age are there are women and children to bo looked after and dosed until now there have been things outside of the army that i could do for virginia but as soon as a breathing time comes i shall be where i should be

the colonels eyes were very bright as he looked at the young man but he only said no doubt and called an officer to take daniel away

 theres a man who would make a good fighter but a damned bad soldier was the veterans mental comment  hes too free and easy

 bring in the prisoner stewart was his command to the orderly

the appearance of walter was hardly that of a felon when he came into the presence of the commanding officer his eyes were clear his head high and his step firm there was no sign of fear in the manner in which he met his judges gaze

 your name is 

 walter stewart

and you were until first taken a soldier of the northern army  

 i was

 you were taken when within the confederate lines and were paroled when you might have been dealt with as a spy

 my business within your lines was perfectly clear

that does not alter the case you were paroled and violated the parole

 i do not feel that the latter is the case sir  what   cried the colonel sternly  do you dare to deny it  

 i deny none of the facts of the case sir i only question their construction

 you have no right to question suh you are a prisoner to be judged the case to my mind is perfectly clear against you

 you are the judge said walter calmly you were found suh in the very act of an encounter with a confederate officer after having assaulted him on the night before we consider suh that you have violated your parole and broken your word of honor

 when virginia thinks that by protecting a defenceless woman a man tarnishes his honor or forfeits his word i begin to feel sorry for my fathers state

 suh you are not the gyardian of virginias honah

 i am the custodian of my own though

 then you should have seen better to it than to have broken your parole you know the consequences

 i am not afraid of the consequences i am willing to abide by them but i do not think that i have violated my parole i have not taken up arms against the confederate states unless they are warring against their own defenceless women nor have i given aid or comfort to your enemies unless you consider as an enemy a woman who has never by word or deed shown anything but allegiance to the south she loves

 ahem   said the colonel

 furthermore my quarrel my encounter was not against your government but against the injustice of one man it was not an encounter involving national views but a purely personal encounter

 in troublous times like these no encounter with an officer of ours can be considered as personal

 i hope sir that you have not also suspended the rule in regard to respect for women

 you are pleased to be impertinent and yet i answuh that i hope virginia will never be guilty of that walter bowed

 i understand that you are a son of the late colonel stewart a virginia gentleman

 i was never more his son than now

 i doubt that i knew your father

 my father placed in the same position i was would i believe have acted as i did

 without doubtâi beg your pardon the colonel checked himself  but yours are rules of civil life and your laws are for civilians at present we are under military rule

having been a soldier i understand that i am in your hands

sergeant of the guard you will hold the prisoner under arrest until further orders i will look into your case and consider it further retire a moment sergeant the noncommissioned officer paused just out of earshot of walter and the colonel whispered  treat him well sergeant hes a stewart cleah through

after the dismissal of walter lieutenant forsythe was brought into the colonels presence the conference between him and his superior officer was short and decisive

 lieutenant forsythe you gave as your reason for entering the house of miss etheridge that you were on a search for her brother

i did

you were not aware that her brother had been for some time in the union army  

 i had received reliable information that led me to believe that he had returned and was in hiding at home

 after gaining entrance into the house why did you insist upon miss etheridges accompanying you in your search  

forsythe hesitated and turned color under the colonels glance

 i wished to be able to watch her face and so tell when i was upon the scent

 why when you had the chance to search the house without her did you not do it  

 i was sure her brother had been given time and opportunity to escape

now lieutenant forsythe will you tell me by whose orders you went upon this search for nelson etheridge  

 i thought that the capture of an enemy

 will you answer my question  

 upon no ones specific orders but

no buts about it i am ansvvuhed were you ever a suitor for miss etheridges hand  

 i consider that a personal question sir forsythe saw that the hope for him was gone and he could be no worse off by taking a stand on dignified effrontery

 oh you consider it a personal question  

 i do and one that has nothing to do with my service

 and as such you refuse to answuh it  very well you have no doubt understood the rules of this command in regyard to the treatment of women  

 yesâbut

 that will do lieutenant forsythe a courtmartial will attend to your case

the lieutenant saluted and was taken away under guard walter and dr daniel were then summoned

 young man said the colonel to the former  i regret that i find cause neither to hold nor to punish you i regret too that you have chosen a course alien to your fathers traditions and beliefs but that of course is not my affair i advise you in the future however to keep cleah of collisions with our officers or the next time you may not get off so easily

walter felt it the part of wisdom to make no reply and so merely bowed

 you dr daniel said the colonel turning to the physician  will always find a welcome here and whenever if ever you choose to throw your lot in with us i hope to have you in my command

thank you colonel thank you sir

the two men were conducted safely away from camp and set on their homeward way

 by jove stewart said the doctor heartily  i wish you werent a yankee  

im hardly a yankee doctor as you use the term but knowing ohio and knowing virginia through such men as you i am more than ever for the union that will keep two such states together let that union be bought at whatever price it may

the two men clasped hands across their saddle bows the physician took walters praise as ingenuously as a child

i wish he said that more northerners knew us southerners

 if the two sections did know each other better a deal of blood might be saved

it was a grave ride home but the rejoicings at the end of the journey compensated for all the serious thought along the way

bless you dr daniel said mrs stewart fervently

 oh dont thank me mrs stewart im not a drop in the bucket it was miss dollys letter that fixed everything

 dollys letter   cried walter

the girl blushed and the doctor added  maybe im telling tales out of school

 you shall tell me about it dolly said walter with glowing eyes this was perhaps only an excuse to lead her away from the rest for a walk in the arbor what excuse dr daniel gave for leading emily in an opposite direction matters not but it must have been satisfactory for mrs stewart found the housewifes excuse of her work to leave them and the doctor stayed to supper

despite the apparent cheerfulness with which mary waters went her way in the woods household she was not entirely her own old self there was an air about her not so much of sadness as of repression she tried as well as the circumstances of the household allowed to be alone although nannie feeling that brooding over her experiences must be unprofitable to her friend attempted to correct this tendency in her she was not always successful for notwithstanding the pliancy of her disposition with those whom she loved bradford waters daughter had something of a will of her own and there were times when she would elude nannies vigilance or repel her advances and wander away to indulge her moods to herself

as the midsummer approached she grew restless and preoccupied and often she would awake nannie at night by starting up with cries of terror but on being questioned the only reply she would make was that she had been dreaming her dreams she would not tell at first

finally the fancy so grew upon her that nannie began to tax her with keeping something back mary continued reticent but worn and weak she at last surrendered to her friends stronger nature

 youve just got to tell me what it is mary waters said nannie  something is troubling your mind and you are troubling mine

but its such a foolish thing nannie

 i dont care folly is none the worse for being shared with some one

do you believe in dreams  

 i dont know tell me yours and ill see if i believe it means anything ill tell you honestly i will

 well i have the vision of a black rider that continually comes to me in a sort of stupor that i experience between sleeping and waking i cannot describe what i mean nor the feeling of it but i know i am not asleep nor yet awake the rider is always going along a dark road and he comes up and holds out his arms to me his face is covered but i know him it is the form of robert van doren but before i can touch his hand he is gone and when i call out after him everything grows utterly black and i am awake with a terrible misgiving at my heart

oh i am afraid something has happened to him

the girl seldom let herself out so fully and nannie saw that she was terribly wrought up

 it is nothing mary she said  youve been brooding too much and it has made you nervous and sleepless it will all come right if you try not to worry and wonder too much

 i knew you would say that and i would rather not have told you

 dont be offended dear what i say is only for the best it is what tom would say to you if he were here

 yes thats true for he would understand no better than you nannie there is with me something more than the dreamâa feeling here she pressed her hand to her breast  a peculiar ache that isnt so much an ache as a premonition of one you dont know what i mean but i do

 i think i almost understand its the same feeling that i have in my feet just before i step on the jack in your fathers warehouse

mary looked up quickly to see if her friend was joking but the eyes that met her own were perfectly serious and though she could not vouch for the correctness of the likeness she felt that somehow nannie understood

but the latter pursued i never let the feeling in my foot get the better of me and neither must you give way to that in your heart it may be there and it may seem something but just keep on going

 thats hardly necessary advice smiled mary  its the one thing that we have to do in life keep on going iso matter how many presentiments you have youve got to go on to their fulfillment thats one thing that gives me the horrors at times until i want to shriek aloud âthis unending forward movement if one could only stop sometimesâbut we cant

 dont mary dont there are some things that we must neither think nor talk about some things that we must leave to a higher intelligence than ours

 but suppose that one does think about them that one cannot help itâthat everything suggests these thoughts  

 oh in that case one goes out into the open air with me walks down to the shop and as she has a quick eye helps me match some goods and seeking to divert her mind from the gloomy thoughts that were taking possession of it nannie hurried mary into her hat and out upon the streets

the day was full of sunshine but the air was limpid with the suggestion of rain and a soft breeze blew up from the river the town was humming and drowsing comfortably and there was nothing in its appearance to indicate that just a little below the surface there smouldered volcanic fires of discontent and unrest the whole place was the embodiment of peace the blinds of the houses were closed to keep out the garish sunlight and the most active sign of life upon the resident streets was the young children playing in the gutters and on the pavements

something of the restfulness of the scene possessed mary and for the time drove the clouds from her mind the bright day and her forebodings did not set well together could it be true that on such a morning as this with such a sky overhead men could be hating each other and seeking each others lives  her mind rejected the incongruity after all the darkest hour is just before dawn she had been going through her dark hour and now all the brightness and beauty about her were but the promise of the better time coming she went into the shop with nannie stepping lightly and with a smile on her face

though poetry has told us that coming events cast their shadows before them science has not troubled itself to deal largely with this subject of premonition nor is it believable that those shadows are cast upon all hearts but there is little doubt that to some there is given the added sorrow of feeling the approach of catastrophe some time before the fact call it presentiment or what you will there are those who are capable of feeling disaster before it comes of these was mary waters and bright as her face had been when she entered the shop with nannie the clouds had settled upon it again when she emerged

 let us walk up main street she said and her companion agreed

nannie chatted on cheerfully because she had not noted marys return to her former depression had she only looked at her companions gloomy face her flow of talk would have been checked marys eyes were fastened upon a knot of people surrounding a bulletin board in front of the diurnal office

 something is wrong said mary suddenly breaking in on her friends talk

 why do you think so   asked the surprised girl

 look at the crowd up there let us go and see

reluctantly nannie complied and they were soon on the outskirts of the growing crowd they could not get near enough to see the words on the board but some one read aloud for the benefit of the late comers the words that made mary pale with terror and turn hastily way

john morgan with his cavalry has crossed the river and is advancing into ohio

 john morgan is in ohio and robert is with himâmy vision the black rider the disjointed words beat time to the throbbing of her heart  john morgan is in ohio and robert is with him

the news spread like wildfire and already the town was alive with people hastening to the centre of intelligence the drowsy summer quiet had gone from the streets as if by magic and instead there were the shuffling of feet and the babble of many tongues but mary did not speak and nannie gave her the sympathy of silence only when they were in the house again did she say  i shall never question your feelings again never then with rare good sense she left mary to herself

the shock coming as it had as a confirmation of her fears and holding in it unknown possibilities for trouble had a severe effect upon the girl she was distressed for the safety of her lover but not only that for a new element had entered into her feelings heretofore she had had little or no doubt as to the righteousness of her loyalty to robert but now it was a very different thing he was no longer a brave man exiled and driven into the army of the enemy he was now the invader of his own home and hers

as long as he fought on the soil of his fathers state against invasion he might still have her love and sympathy but did he not by this last act forfeit both reasoning with a womans narrow vision she admitted his right to defend himself and those he loved against the government but questioned his privilege to attack it it is not to be denied that sentiment had much to do with marys point of view in one role robert was the prince in the other the ogre and she could not quite reconcile herself to sympathy with the ogre it was rather a nice question to ask her to decide whether the right of defence did not carry with it the right of attack there was something of horror in the picture she drew of him riding a marauder over the fields of the state that had so long sheltered him in her mind the whole invasion was narrowed down to one man it was not morgan and his menâit was robertârobert for whom she had left home for whom she had suffered contempt what did it matter to her that john morgan was with him  what did it matter to her that he was one of two thousand  then her trend of thought began to change had he not been forced to go where he was she remembered his words to her father on that memorable night  the confederacy may thank you for another recruit  must he not do then as his comrades did would it not be cowardice in him to refuse to go where they went would he do wrong consciously she could not believe it after all she loved him and she would trust him blindly whatever happened the inevitable thing occurred her love triumphed she need have asked herself no perplexing questions had she only begun with is my love for him strong enough to overlook all shortcomings with nannie in the same case it would have been different there would have been no questions at all she would merely have said  well if he does it it must be right and gone on with a contented mind even mary was happier for her decision though she reached it after much doubt

dorbury heard of the rebel generals daring dash into ohio with an astonishment that was only equalled by its anger and terror there had been threats and rumors of some danger from kentucky but the possibility of it had been beyond belief how that the thing had really come men stood aghast men who had scoffed before now became suddenly serious men who had wavered in their allegiance now spoke out boldly for the union when their homes were menaced on every side was the cry  the home guards the home guards and old men middleaged men and beardless youths went flocking into the armory be sure said some  if he dares cross into ohio there are more behind him and it means that they intend to overwhelm the state   others said  they will burn cincinnati strike here unless we can check them march on and destroy the capital

on any corner sane men fanatics and demagogues could secure audiences to listen to their oratory in which they adjured their hearers to rise in their might and drive the invader from their sacred soil

there were some men in the town who smiled and added it is a feint let morgan come he will not come far there were not many of them there were others who gathered behind the closed blinds of stephen van horens house to talk of this new development to them yan horen spoke confidentially  i deplore this move he said  it will take away sympathy from the cause of the south although morgan is only doing what lincoln has done in the south it is a sorry matter all through for we have been plunged into a war that might have been averted by able statesmanship if worst comes to worst we have only our government to thank and yet it is a bad thing for nothing will do more to cement a feeling of clannishness in the north and give these fanatics something to point to than this same attempt to fight the devil with fire

among all the crowding men the believers in different creeds walked bradford waters like an elijah among the prophets of baal the news was to him as the battlesmoke to the nostrils of the warhorse he seemed like one inspired and it was as if the things that he had longed for had been done there was a look of exaltation on his face but his was an emotion too deep for words though none who saw him needed speech of him

in her bedroom his daughter sat staring silently out of her window not thinkingâhardly dreamingâand so night fell on dorbury

it is doubtful how long mary would have sat staring out into the darkness had not the entrance of nannie and her preparations for bed disturbed her revery she also disrobed and was soon lying in bed her eyes wide open and her thoughts busy with the events of the day she did not want to talk and so made but brief replies to nannies proffers of conversation finally from feigning sleep she fell into a light doze from which she started crying  the black rider the black rider 

the experiences of the last few hours had exhausted nannie and though it was yet early in the evening she was sleeping soundly mary recovered herself and finding that she was not observed crept stealthily from the bed she paused for awhile beside the window and then dressed with feverish haste as if spurred by a definite purpose when she was fully clothed she stepped quietly down the stairway and past the sittingroom where some of the family were still up and glided out of the house why she  was doing so she herself could not have told but something was dragging or driving her on on towards the station she had yet no fixed idea where she was going but she felt in her pocket for money and it never occurred to her until she found the amount of her fare that from the beginning she had intended to go to cincinnati though that she did not yet know the tendency towards a definite act being rather subconscious than apprehended there was just time to catch the halfpast ten train she reached the station bought her ticket and sank breathless and dazed into a seat

there was a moments delay and then the train sped away into the darkness the sum of all her impressions was that the black rider whose face was still concealed from her flitted ever by the side of the coach and just at her window the lights of the town faded from view and the river lay behind her a line of sinuous silver the sky overhead was besprent with pale stars but she saw only the cloaked and muffled man riding riding as one rides in a nightmare the train whistled wheezed and paused at stations and then went panting on and mary knowing as little feeling hardly more than the dumb mechanism that carried her went on upon a vague unknown quest for what she could not have told

prompting her action there was apparently no cause or intelligence scarcely was there even volition some force stronger and wiser than she good or malignant impelled her forward whether she would or no she went on not because she would but because she must

the night became suddenly overcast the sky darkened the stars went out and as the train flew on its way southward a peal of thunder broke from the heavens and sharp rain began pattering against the window she crouched lower in her seat and stared ever out through the pane where she could see the mantled figure riding riding she could hear his horses hoofbeats above the sound of the storm and her eyes sought vainly his face though she knew and could not be deceived in the form

when the coach drew into cincinnati she alighted and still blind dazed and apparently without direction hastened out and took a car the night was one of inky blackness the rain was coming down in torrents while intermittent flashes of lightning showed her the wet and shining streets and the roadways through which she was passing at the call avondale she left the car and went on blindly into the night

terror now seized her terror of the unknown of the darkness of the mystery in her own wild act but she could not stop nor turn back was she fleeing from or to something  once in a moment of consciousness she asked herself the question but hurried on without answering or attempting to answer it on through the little suburban village and out upon a country road a mile out the last house had been passed the last light had flickered out of her sight and then drenched exhausted she paused under a huge oak and turned her eyes back over the way she had come it was not weariness that made her stop it was a sense of waiting waiting for something the thing for which she had come it was perhaps a half hour that she had stood there and then the sound of clattering hoofs struck her ear she pressed closer to the tree a company of cavalrymen were approaching they came at a smart canter breathlessly she awaited they were near to her they were passing first close together then with gaps between then scatteringly with her physical ear she heard the sound of their hoofbeats in the soft slushy mud but with her inner sense she heard the sound of one horse on dry ground and her eyes saw but one rider still the black mantled figure of her dreams she heard him saw him coming nearer nearer then a flash of lurid lightning lit the whole scene and starting forward from the tree she cried  robert robert 

as if but one man had heard her as if her voice had been intended to reach but one a figure shrouded in a dark cloak whirled and rode from the straggly ranks up to the side of the road and dismounted she stretched her arms out another flash of lightning showed the trooper the white face of the girl beside the tree and with a cry he caught her to him as she fell forward

 mary mary he cried  can it be you  are you flesh or spirit my god what does it mean   but she was lying cold in his arms the cavalry passed on stragglers and all he stood there helplessly holding her one hand clutching his horses bridle the rain from the leaves dripped in her face and she revived

 robert she said faintly

 what are you doing here   he asked

 iâiâdont know i dreamed of you and i came where am i  

 on the road out of cincinnati about two miles from avondale who came with you  

 i came alone

 where are you going  

 i dont know something sent me to you you are very weak he said

 i must go back now she replied

 where will you go  

 i dont know

the power that had driven her out that had guided her seemed suddenly to have left her helpless and without direction

the men now were entirely passed and without a word he lifted her to his saddle and springing up behind her turned his horses head back towards the town

 god knows what brought you here darling he whispered close to her ear  but it was something stronger and wiser than us both it has been a long hard ride with me and i was losing hold but you have given me strength again people have heard our horses and are aroused but i will take you back where you will be safe another day he bent over and kissed her brow  when all of this is over you shall tell me how and why you came to me love of my heart

she nestled closer to him and did not answer there was nothing for her to say she did not understand he did not understand he rode straight into the town dark forms were gathering upon the corners here and there a torch flared

 i must leave you now mary he said  the power that brought you will care for you i must join my company god bo with you

he set her down and was wheeling away when a torch beside him flared a man cried  heres one of them  

van doren struck spurs to his horse and the animal dashed away a hue and cry arose there was a volley of shots and the night swallowed the black rider a crowd surrounded mary and led her speechless and confused to the nearest house a few of the bolder spirits followed the rider on foot until the sound of his horses hoofs had died away into the distance

the girl could not give any clear account of herself except that she had come from dorbury and had wandered out of her way kind matrons put her to bed where she fell asleep like a child though she would have rested less easily had she known that robert was swaying whitefaced in his saddle his arm shattered by a bullet

all night long men full of alarm patroled the streets of the village fearing and expecting an attack while women stayed up and brewed tea and talked of their night visitor when mary awoke in the morning the events of the night before were like a dream to her and though the women questioned her closely and eagerly she was able to give them little or nothing of the satisfaction for which they longed it was all so strange so unbelievable that she did not dare tell them all that had really happened there were some who said that she must be a spy and there were threats of detaining her but she made it clear where she lived mentioning the names of people whom several of them knew and so they put her down as some demented or halfwitted creature who had lost her way and been rescued by the trooper in grey

well the hound will have one thing to his credit said the husband of the woman at whose house she had slept

her head clear the girl was anxious now to return to her home the busy little matron still suspecting her sanity insisted on going with her as far as the train where with many headshakes and mysterious comments she put mary in charge of the conductor and went away trembling for the safety of her protegee

the whole woods household was in an uproar of excitement and nannie was blaming herself keenly for negligence when mary walked in

 oh mary mary cried her friend at sight of her where have you been youve given us such a fright weve searched everywhere for you

but mary only smiled and kept her counsel  i had to go away she said

 what time did you leave  

mary smiled again a little later a message came from bradford waters saying  have you found mary yet  

nannie blushed  we thought you had gone home and so we went there

 i was not at home was the only answer

whatever it may have meant the girl herself was never able to explain it but mary saw no more visions and she was happier

the puzzle was deep in roberts mind as he rode away from the girl leaving her to the mercies of the gaping townspeople he had no doubt that they would treat her kindly and send her home in safety but the thought that held him and made him forget even the pain in his arm that grew and grew was how she had come there how had she known where to find him when even the troopers themselves did not know whither they were tending  who gave the simple emotional girl the information that the governor of ohio would have given so much to have  there was nothing in the range of roberts experience to explain the phenomenon so although he hugged the memory of her presence to his consciousness he gave up speculation to wait for that later day when he had said she would tell him his thoughts now had time to revert to his wound and he found that his sleeve was soaked with blood that was fast stiffening in spite of the constant downpour the absorption of his attention no longer kept his misery in subordination he began to feel fainter and fainter but clenched his teeth and laid his head upon the neck of his good mare a mile more and the sound of moving men came to his ears

then he gained upon them faster and knew that they had halted for the night his head was ringing like a chime of bells his heart throbbed painfully and his tongue was parched heavier and heavier he lay upon the mares neck and when finally the animal halted in the hastily improvised camp it was an inert body that had to be lifted from her back

already mary was quietly sleeping in the friendly house and no dream or vision told her of the lover who was to ride no more with john morgan but unknown was to be nursed back to life by a goodhearted farmer and his wife

through the newspapers and an occasional letter from the field bradford waters was kept advised of the movements of his son with his regiment he had taken part in the engagements at pittsburg landing and in all the active operations of the army of ohio or as it was finally rechristened the army of the cumberland he had distinguished himself in the terrible fight of the th of july and it was as a captain that he lay with his company at chattanooga creek encouraging his men by example not to flinch under the awful fire which the confederate batteries poured upon them

dorbury knew the privations through which her boys were going the long marches when both rest and refreshment were denied the hardships of camp and field and the heroism of patient endurance then began that gradual turn of sentiment and feeling for which the battle of pittsburg landing and morgans raid had proved the cue another wave of enthusiasm for her patriotic sons swept over the town and this time had permanent effect even davies scoffed no longer and spoke of  our boys  in a tone that led waters to forgive all his past transgressions

tom had always been a favorite at home but men spoke his name now with a new affection after each new engagement in which his regiment was known to have taken a part there were numerous inquiries at the waters house as to how the captain had fared he was no longer a family idol he had become a public hero

this pride in a young mans success is after all of the vanity which is human something of credit seems to accrue to the man himself when he can say  what captain why i knew him when he was a boy  

behind closed doors stephen van doren sat and read the papers he had the largeness of heart that made him respect a brave man wherever placed and now he felt a real pride in the son of his enemy to be sure in his heart he had misgivings and wished time and again that he might read something of his own son of whose whereabouts he knew nothing there had come one brief letter some time before the raid and since that nothing why couldnt his bob be a captain too  his anxiety was shared in some degree by mary but the pride which she took in her brother and which nannie constantly nourished left her little time for brooding

the summer wore away amid rumors of battles reconnoissances and skirmishes the golden autumn came and although so many of the husbandmen were away reaping strange harvests in a strange land the land smiled with the fullness of things and the ring of scythes could be heard afield over the little town over the fair meadows that surrounded it the sun of plenty hung and drove away the darkness that the preceding summer had known morgan had come and gone and they felt no fear of another such invasion terror was dead and the people bent themselves joyously to the task of supplying whatever wants those at the front expressed they rested in a content and security that even the imminence of a battle at mission ridge in which their own might be engaged failed wholly to destroy orchard knob had dealt kindly with them and they began to think of their soldiers as each an achilles with the vulnerable heel secure then like a tempest from a cloudless sky came the news of the battle of november th and dorbury was silent from sheer amazement could this thing really have happened to them and theirs  they looked down the list of the dead and wounded again so many of the names were familiar so many were those whom they thought to see again tom waters captain tom could it be  their young hero  they began to awake and with the awakening the place became as a house of mourning the bulletin boards were surrounded by hushed awestricken men while women with white faces hastened up to hear the latest from the field

it was davies who having heard the news went over to break it to bradford waters he had not left his office at the warehouse and only knew from vague rumors that a battle had taken place he was hastening through to get out and hear the particulars when davies entered his white face speaking for him before his lips could utter a sound waters sprang to his feet and then sank back into a chair

 there has been a battle they tell me he said

yes said davies with dry lips

wasâwasâtoms name mentioned he asked the question mechanically as if he already knew the answer that was coming

davies was trembling the tears filled his eyes as he went over and laid his hand on the others shoulder

yes he answered tomâthe captains name waters is among the killed

an ashen pallor spread over waters seamed face and his hard hands gripped the desk in front of him fiercely he breathed heavily but did not speak

 come bradford come out in the air with me

waters rose but there was a knock at the door and opening it a messenger confronted him it was a telegram from toms colonel the old man could hardly read the words his hand trembled so but he made out that they were sending him home then davies saw the mans form straighten up and his eye flash as with a clear voice he read  killed while leading a gallant charge  thank god davies he died like a soldier

there was not a tear in waters eye though pride and grief struggled for mastery in bis voice davies who under all his cynical indifference was as softhearted as a woman was weeping like a child

 i gave him unreservedly the bereaved father went on  and he has given me nothing to regret come on i must go home i must set my house in order to receive my son the captain

they went out of the house together bradford waters face set and firm men looked at him shyly upon the street and greeted him briefly they knew how deeply he had loved his son and feared a break down of his selfcontrol men are always cowards in the face of grief but their caution was unnecessary waters returned their civility with a poise of manner almost stern what had he to weep for  he had laid his son upon the altar and be had proven an acceptable sacrifice other men might weep for craven sons who had left the fighting to others or who had trembled under fire as for him he must be strong he must walk among men with a high head and a step that showed him worthy to be the father of such a son

davies left him at the door of his house he heard him say as he entered you must look sharp martha and have everything in good order the captain is coming home

the light was fast fading from the room where waters sat down but a ray of gold came in through the window and touched the pictured face of the dead soldier in its place on the mantel the father rose and taking it down held it close to his breast  i gave you to them boy he murmured  and they took you but they cannot they can never take the memory of you from me

some one knocked and a moment later martha came in saying  a gentleman to see you mr waters

with perfect selfpossession he passed into the next room where in the dimness a man stood awaiting him

 i have dared to come bradford said stephen van dorens voice because i knew and we both loved the boy i thought maybe we could shake hands over the memory of a brave soldier

waters form trembled like an aspen he paused in silence and the moment was full of import it was to say what the course of his whole future life would be whether the iron of his nature would be melted or annealed by the fire through which he was passing he took a step forward and grasped van dorens outstretched hand

 i am glad you came stephen he said   he was a brave boy and you loved him too

ho one could help loving him he was one man among a thousand who was fine enough for the sacrifice whether my son be alive or dead may i always have as little right to sorrow for him as you have for yours tonight

stephen van dorens voice was low earnest and impressive and it broke down something that had stood up very hard and stern in bradford waters spirit the tears welled up into his eyes and fell unheeded down his cheeks he wrung van dorens hand

 you must stay and talk to me of him of both of them our boys fought on different sides stephen but they were both ours

 in a time like this before an example of bravery we forget sides and differences and only remember our boys and our love for them

for awhile they sat and talked of the dead and of him of whose whereabouts they as yet knew nothing and waters heart was lightened and softened

yon must go away he said at last to his visitor i have another thing that i must do maybe after all stephen there is a deeper meaning in this sacrifice than either of us yet sees

 may god grant it was the fervent response

 when you hear from bob let me know at once you know he was toms friend he added almost joyously

as soon as van doren was gone he gave the servant some directions and then set out for nathan woods house which was no less than his own a place of bereavement the entire household was griefstricken the two girls had mingled their tears and sought vainly to comfort each other in their sorrow mary was fairly exhausted from her grief and nannie seeing that recovered herself sufficiently to minister to the weaker girl

when mary found out that her father was below and asking for her she sprang up with wild eyes and fluttering heart

 oh he has come to reproach me she said  he will never forgive me

 there is no reproach in his face mary i think he wants you to be with him when tom comes home

nannies voice reassured her and together they went down hand in hand when his daughter came into the room bradford waters held forth his arms and with a cry that was half grief half joy she flung herself into them

 father father she sobbed  what shall we do without him  

 what would his country have done without him my dear  it has taken him and we must give him ungrudgingly

nannie was leaving the room but with a new softness a quality his voice had never known he put out his hand to her

come my other daughter he said you loved him too

for the three then there was no past no difference no wrong they were all members of one family bound more strongly by a great love and a great grief there was a strange similarity apparent in the attitude of nannie and bradford waters towards toms death while mary thought almost solely of the brother she had lost they both seemed to say we are glad to give him since we may give him thus

come let us go home said waters there is much to do mary come nannie you must go with us we must go and make ready to receive the captain

and together they went with him to receive the captain

the strange idea took bradford waters to prepare for his sons homecoming as if the dead could know perhaps there did remain to him some of the mysticism to which his new england birth and ancestry gave him right it would not have assorted illy with his bleak nature perhaps he believed that tom would know however it was he had determined that all should be quite as the young man would have liked it had he come home with conscious eyes to see and light with pleasure at what he saw

to mary the house was very desolate and a rush of sad emotions swept over her as she looked at the familiar things arranged by an alien hand

 tom would hardly know the place now if he could see it she told her father

but he replied never mind never mind it shall all be set right before he comes he shall find nothing to his distaste

the saddest duty they had was the arrangement of his room the old man still followed his strange whim and had the chamber arranged as if a living guest were to occupy it the bed was laid as tom would have had it laid and the fresh sheets turned back as if to receive his tired form in the vases was the late goldenrod always a great favorite with him but on his pillows were the marks of tears which nannie had shed as she smoothed their soft whiteness and knew that his brown head would never press them again

to her a great change had come in spite of the pride and fortitude which bore her up the light and spontaneity had gone out of her life she might laugh again but it would never be with the old free ring in spirit she was already toms wife and she was now as much widowed as any woman who had followed her husband to the grave that she bore her burden better than mary was largely due to the practical strength of her love for tom had he lived she would have been glad to welcome and help him as he was dead she was no less his and waited the time when she might join him mary might weep for him but she would wait for him believing that no such love as hers was given to mortals to wither and die without fruition this love held her so utterly above ordinary opinions and conventions that she did not think to ask what would be said of her entering her lovers house as one of the family it was nothing to her it was a matter of course there was a certain joy in feeling that she had the right to help and in seeing hour after hour that toms father and sister leaned more and more upon her strength

it was on the third day after the news of the battle that toms body was brought home one mute mourner accompanying itânigger ed those were strenuous times and there was no opportunity for fine courtesies for escorts and officer pallbearers even for that brave one but the flag was wrapped around him the flag he had fought and died for

his father was very calm as he looked at the boyish face so cold and still before him death had been kind to the soldier and had come quickly leaving him almost unaltered he lay as if he had fallen asleep with bright dreams of a purposeful tomorrow there was none of the horror or dread of battle impressed upon his marble countenance nothing that could cause the woman who loved him best of all to shrink from him

bradford waters stooped and kissed his sons brow there was a smile on his own lips even mary forgot to weep this was the majesty the beauty of death nannie hovered over him as she would over a flower they were alone togetherâthese three when a knock soft and hesitating fell upon the door bradford opened it to find without the negro ed he silently motioned him to enter

 dey tol me to gin you dis when you was settled he said he handed waters a letter it was from colonel bassett toms commanding officer and ran  dear sir i wish i knew how to pay tribute to the finest man and most gallant gentleman i ever knewâyour son i wish i might have shown him the respect that i feel and come with his body to see it laid in its last restingplace but this is war i would condone with you sir but that i know the father of such a son must be proud to have had him die where and as he did

it was a soldiers letter and though waters read it with trembling voice his eyes glowed and he looked at the still form as if to say  i would not have had it otherwise

ed was still standing waiting for the father to speak but waters said nothing the negro shifted uneasily then he said anxiously  is you mad at me mistah watahs  has de cunnel said anythin  dey wouldnt have sont me home wid him but i baiged cause i kinder thought youd ravah have somebodyâdat knowed himâ bring him back

waters reached out and grasped the black mans hand  why god bless you forever and ever he said

the privacy of the family even with its dead could not long be maintained dorbury had suspended business this hero was theirs as well as his familys they filled the sidewalks they surged at the doors they would see him they would bring their flowers to lay beside his bier he belonged to them to them who had helped to send him forth and had cheered his departure bradford waters should not be selfish in his grief the boys from the factories and warehouses came and also from the shops those who had known him and those who had not all men know a hero and the father said let them come in he will be glad to see them

and so  the captain  came home

for a long time curiosity was rampant in a little country district not very far from cincinnati it was the proverbial rural locality where every one knows or wishes to know the business of every one else and is offended if he doesnt in this particular place the object of interest was a white farmhouse set forward on the road and fronting ample grounds both of field and garden it was the home of john metzinger a prosperous german husbandman and his good wife gretchen they were pleasant easygoing people warmhearted and generous their neighbors had always looked upon them with favor until one dayâit was early in august the eye of suspicion fell upon the house those who had lived near the metzingers and those who merely passed upon the road to and from town began to point questioning fingers at the place and to look askance at it the gossips shook their heads and whispered together

it all began with one woman who had unceremoniously  dropped in  on the couple  dropping in  consisting of pushing open the door and entering unannounced by the formality of a knock the easygoing neighbor had pursued this course only to find the door of an inner room hastily closed and the good wife profuse in embarrassed expostulations mrs metzinger was not good at dissimulation and her explanation that the room was all torn up for she was housecleaning served but to arouse her visitors suspicion in her own words as she told it many times later she said with fine indignation  think o her sayin to me that she was cleanin house an she with as spick an span a white apern on as ever you see says i to her  aint you pickin out a funny time to clean mrs metzinger and she says with that dutch brogue o hers  oh i cleans anydimes de place gets dirty then i says cam like because ive alius liked that woman i should think youd get yer apern dirty an all of a sudden she jerked it off an stood there grinnin at me but that was what give her away for lo an behold her dress was as clean as my bran new calico then i says well never min ill just come in an help you an would you believe it that woman got right in my way an wouldnt let me go in that room all the time jabbering something about nod troublin me right then an there thinks i theres something wrong in that room

she closed her remarks as one who says  theres murder behind that door

her hearers were struck by her tragic presentation of the case and they too began to watch for signs of guilt in the germans these were soon plentiful hone was more convincing than that a room that had always been open to the light had now its blinds closed some one had said too that they had seen the doctors gig at the door one night and had waited for him to come out but on questioning him as any man has a right to do  whos sick doctor   he had sprung into his vehicle put whip to his horse and dashed away without answering this in itself looked dark for why should a doctor of all men refuse to be questioned about his patients  the little scattered community for three or four miles and even further up and down the road was awestruck and properly indignant such communities have no respect for reticence

meanwhile the trouble went on and the metzingers grew in disfavor what had been friendly greetings degenerated into stiff nods or grew into clumsily veiled inquiries while their neighbors lost sleep asking each other what horror was going on behind those closed doors the simple couple went on about their duty and kept their counsel it was really not so much the horror that the community resented but that the particulars of it were being kept from them

if the metzingers could have told their story it would have proved after all a very short and simple one it would have been to the effect that late one night towards the end of july they had been awakened by the tramping of feet and a knocking upon their door going thither they had found four men unkempt and mudstained who bore between them another evidently wounded they had brought him and laid him upon the sofa and then with promises that were half threats had left him in their care they came then to know who their visitors were some of  morgans terrible men their promises to respect the farmers stock had not been needed to secure attention for their wounded comrade for the good wifes heart had gone out already to the young fellow who lay there so white and drabbled with blood

john metzinger would have told though his good wife would never have mentioned it how all that night and the next day gretchen had hovered over the wounded man bandaging his arm bathing it and doing what she could to ease the pain while the sufferer muttered strange things in his sleep and tossed like a restless child

they could not get a doctor until the next night for they knew that all must proceed with secrecy and when the physician came the fever had already set in and the chances for the mans recovery seemed very slight

they could have told too of the doctors long fight with the fever and what the gossips did not know how one night two physicians came and amputated the wounded arm at the elbow then of the long fight for life through the hot august days of the terrible nights when death seemed crowding into the close room and the sufferer lay gasping for breath but they told nothing silently they went their way grieved by the distrust of those about them but unfaltering in their course and when van doren first looked up weakly enough into the german womans face his eyes full of the gratitude he could not speak both she and her john were repaid for all that they had suffered

the woman fell upon her knees by the bedside saying dank got dank got he vill gid vell now shon and  shon who was very big and very much a man pressed his wifes hand and went behind the door to look for something that was not there

with the cooler weather of autumn came more decided convalescence to the young trooper but the earliest snows had fallen before he was able to creep to the door that looked out upon the road he was only the shadow of his former self mrs metzinger looked at him full of pity

i guess you petter led de toctor wride by your home now dey vill vant to hear from you

 hot yet not yet he protested  it would cause my father too much anxiety and some others perhaps too much joy to know how i am faring

your poor fader dough he vill be vorried aboud you

father knows the chances of war and he will not begin to worry yet it would grieve him so much more to know that i am out of it all so soon

mister robertsaid the woman impressively you dont know faders dey vas yoost like modders pretty near und modders alvays vants to know if he is veil she is glad und she dank got for dat if he is det she vants to gry und gry ofer dose leedle shoes dot he used to vear

 he shall know he shall know mrs metzinger and very soon for i am going home to him and his joy will make him forget how long he has waited

 yes i guess maype dot is so

robert had divined more by instinct than by any outward demonstration of his hosts that his secret stay in the house had aroused in their neighbors some sort of feeling against these people he was perfectly sure that should he write to his father he would come to him in spite of everything and at any stir or unusual commotion about the house what was only smouldering now might burst into flame so although it wrung his heart to do so living within sixty miles of his father he kept his lips closed and gave no sign his heart had gone out to these people who had sacrificed so much for him and he wanted to do something in return for them at first because of his very weakness they had forborne to question him about his home and people and when he was strong enough to act he had unconsciously accepted this silence as his sacrifice without divining that he was not the real sufferer not the real bearer of the burden

he had promised that he would go home soon but the case had been a severe one and it was december before he dared to venture out beyond the gate sometimes when the days were warm and bright he would sit wrapped up on the porch at the side for the need of secrecy gone the metzingers were openly and humanly unhumble they bowed proudly even jauntily to their detractors while the priest and the levites passed by on the other side there were no good samaritans about save the metzingers themselves and their little devices might have gone unobserved but that the priest and the levites were curious people and at last came over to question

 who is the sick young man   they questioned

 he iss a friend of ours from do var mrs metzinger answered them

 wed like to talk to him they volunteered

ho he must not talk to beoples not yet was the answer

 why dont he wear his uniform   eobert wore a suit of  shons  jeans

it was yoost ruint and all spoilt mit blood

but they looked at robert askance and the gossip which for awhile from inaction had faltered sprang up anew who was he  why so little about him  why had they kept the secret so long 

the good people saw with dismay what they had done they had only aroused the trouble which they had hoped to allay van doren saw their trouble and determined immediately to relieve them

 i am going home now he told them one day

 you are not yet so strong

oh yes i am im quite a giant now

vat you dinks shon iss he strong enough  

 i dinks he gan stay here so long as he vants

 but i am going my good friends its best for us all

 vy  

 i have seen how the neighbors look at me and i have seen how they look at you you shant hurt yourselves any longer

dat iss not right we care nodings for de neighbors ve minds our own business

mrs metzingers husband said something under his breath only a word it was but it made his wife gasp and cry  shon for shame on you  

 im going robert went on  either with your consent or without i dont know how im ever going to thank you youve both been so good its nasty in a case like this to think of pay i cant do it decently but im going to do it its the nearest way a brute of a man can come to showing his appreciation

no pay said john

not vun cent said his wife

 ve had some gompany gretchen put in robert smiled on they were so like big children

 i am not going to let you two cheat me out of showing my gratitude by any such excuse

gretchen wept and john caused his wife to exclaim again but it was of no use and just at dusk the old carryall took him away to the station still in his hosts suit the empty sleeve turned up and the stump of arm flapping at his side

it was about an hour after john had gone with robert to the station that mrs metzinger heard footsteps and going to the door saw several men without

we want that man thats stayin here said the leader

hes yoost gone to his home in dorbury

 in dorburyâwhy we thoughtâwhat side was he on  

mrs metzinger drew herself up in dignified anger and said  i dond dink got has any sides deacon callvell then she slammed the door and the deacon and his  committee went away feeling small and glad that it was dark while mrs metzinger rocked out her pious anger until the floor cried again

there was no blare of trumpets no popular acclaim to greet robert van dorens homecoming he entered dorbury alone and unwelcomed weary and sick at heart it was halfpast eight oclock when his train drew into the familiar station and the winter night had settled heavy and black a familiar form came towards him as he walked down the platform and sadly changed as he was he saw the light of recognition in the mans eyes the next instant he was looking at the stern lines of an averted face he shuddered and hurried on as rapidly as his weakness would allow although he had often in his moments of convalescence pictured dimly how he would be received at home yet the actuality was so much stronger and harsher than any anticipation of it could be that he was quite unmanned for the first time it came to him that he was an alien in the land of his adoption and even upon the dark streets he shrank from the people he met because he knew his face would be to them as a lepers and even the empty sleeve the badge of honor to so many of them would read only to these people  unclean unclean

he was bending his steps towards his fathers house absorbed in bitter thoughts when a sort of divination rather than the appearance of things roused him from his revery he looked around upon the place the houses the lawns and then a lighted window caught his eye and he realized that he was passing bradford waters house

 i wonder if she is back at home   he said  i caused her so much grief he passed through the gate and crept up to the window the light shone through a thin shade but he could see nothing within the house after a short while however he heard the sound of womens voices and one was hers without warning all the pentup feeling of the past three years burst forth in the cry  mary  

 whats that   cried some one within but there was no answer save the hurried tread of feet across the floor aware of what he had done he was hurrying away when the front door was thrown open and he saw her before him standing in a flood of light then he could not go he stood transfixed until she walked down the steps to him crying  robert robert i was sure you would come   and all he could do was to bow his head and murmur  thank god

she took him by the hand and led him into the house he unresisting

 here is robert she said to nannie hid i not tell you he would come  

yes and i am glad with you her greeting of robert was tender almost sisterly as soon as she could do so tactfully she left the room and van horens glance followed her questioningly he could not understand her subdued manner her sad fce mary saw the look in his eyes and asked  ho you not know then  

 no he answered  what is it  

 tom

 tomânotâdead  

 head yes

 killed

 yes at mission ridge nearly a month ago and she told of all that had happened while he sat like one dazed

finally he broke in tomdead i living why is this  why this choice of the brave instead of the lukewarm the soldier instead of the raider    robert robert you are not yourself i weep for my brother but you i have you still

for answer he raised his empty sleeve

 ah robert you dont know i love you here are two armsâyours

he kissed her cheek silently and then a sound made them start apart and stare into each others faces with parted lips some one was on the step there was but one person whom it could be

 quick quick said mary opening a door into the next room  in here and robert hurried in just as bradford waters entered finding mary troubled and embarrassed he stood looking at her with a sad face and then he said mary you grieve me very much has all the past been so hard that you cannot forget it  has not the past month proven that i am a changed man and that you need hide nothing from me  

 yes father forgive me and going to the door she called  robert 

van doren came in with a defiant look on his face which vanished at sight of waters outstretched hand

 whyâwhyâmr waters he stammered confusedly

yes yes i know my boy but im glad to see you back robert

robert grasped the old mans hand and wrung it warmly  im so glad youre reconciled to me you didnt like me before

 no more of that no more of that i always liked you but i didnt like your principles ive seen sorrow though and i look at things differently

 mary has told me and it grieved me much

 you know then that the captain has come home  

 yes would to god that i might have come like that

 tut tut have you been home 

no i was on my way there when i heard marys voice and stopped

you must go to him at once now he will be overjoyed

 do you think i dare go to him myself  im afraid he thinks me dead

 i have no doubt let mary go with you and break the news to him go on

mary hastened to put on her hat and cloak and together the two went out leaving the old man standing by the mantel looking at them with strange tenderness robert turned at the door and looked back you will never know what you have done mr waters to make my homecoming less than a tragedy to me he said huskily

it was tom not i said waters gently

the house looked very dismal as mary and robert approached it and the latters heart failed him

 has my father seemed to grieve much   he asked

 he has been absorbed and preoccupied but his faith was like mine we knew you would come back

 i have heard of the faith that is stronger than death but i always thought it a meaningless phrase until now bless you both

stephen van doren was drowsing by his library fire when mary was admitted but with the courtesy of his kind he rose and went nimbly to meet her apologizing meanwhile for his dressinggown and slippers

but my dear child he exclaimed what brings you here at this hour  

 mr van doren mary faltered her face all aglow

 stop he exclaimed  whether the dead can come to life or not no girl can show a face like that unless she has seen her lover what is it  

 i have seen him he is here in the hall

van doren took a step forward and then stood trembling but robert had thrown the door open and rushed to his father

 father 

 my boy  

this was in the days before men grew too old to embrace their fathers and bearded cheeks and lips met the fathers arms were about his son and the empty sleeve fell under his hand he held it up and then pushed his son from him his head drooped sadly for a moment but there was a look of exaltation on his face

fatherâfather dont let that grieve you iâiâlost it honorably

stephen van dorens head went up like a bulls when he scents resistance  grieve me he cried and then turning to mary he said  now my dear i can show your father that and talk to him upon more nearly equal terms why boy youve won your spurs if you havent got them to us of the newer land an empty sleeve when gallantly won is what the victoria cross is to an englishman

eobert flushed and moved away a pace further from his father  but you do not know all all you said it was won honestlyâthat is enough

the young soldier looked appealingly at mary  i shall have to tell you all he said

i will go eobert she said it was wrong for me to stay so long but this meeting has given me such joy as i have never known before she turned towards the door

you must not go he cried detaining her  it is for you also to know it belongs to you

 to me  

 to youâyes

how

you remember that night of nights he asked her softly  do they know of it  

no i have never dared to tell them so wild a story

 i will tell it now then

 you may robert they will believe you every one will

then briefly robert told his father of the strange meeting with mary that had resulted in his wound  i dont know what you will say he ended and i dont know what it means

it means god said his father solemnly  he sent her think of it as an old mans fancy if you will but he lighted one of his own torches at the moment that you might see each others faces

 oh robert cried mary  then it was for me  

yes darling father forgive us but mary is glad

 why mary child you show more sense than that great hulking onearmed hero

heroâfather

 the man who is old enough to have done a noble deed and is not old enough to know it should be sent into a closet like a child

 he does know itâhe must know it robert you must see it

 hero  was the word running through young van dorens brain and he did not understand he felt marys arms about him he felt his fathers hand pressing his own and his thoughts grew hazy hero how could he be a hero when he was lying helpless when the best fighting was going on whenâthough he dared not say itâhe did not even know if his heart were wholly with the cause

his fathers voice broke in upon his revery  bob you are theâwell look here dont you see what kind of a man he must be who dares to ride away from his comrades and into the face of the enemy and alone to save a woman  

 yes dont you see rob   said mary eagerly  why i loved her said robert  loved her and forgive me father more than my cause unless you had had that in you that made your cause strong and noble you could not have done it even for love

 have i pleased you  

 i am proud to be your father

 and mary i didnt want to tell youâare you hurt  

 hurt with the sort of a hurt that a woman â  she started impulsively towards her lover and then paused abashed

never check a good impulse said old van doren  i am now looking at the portrait of my grandfather

the two young people improved the opportunity the old man showed consideration in the length of time he spent admiring the portrait but a hurried knock on the door recalled their attention

a servant with a frightened face entered  theres a lot of men at the door he said

 what do they want   asked van doren sternly

 theyâthey say that there is a rebel in here and they want him

 go back to them and say said the old man his voice ringing like a trumpet  that there is no rebel here but a soldier and the son of a soldier and if they want to see him he is at their service when he knows their business with him the servant retired

 the hounds have begun to bay already said robert his face set and dogged though he patted marys hair as she clung fearfully to him

 the hounds   said his father bringing from his desk a brace of pistols that had seen service you mean the curs the hounds know their true game can you use your left hand  

 as well as my right

the father tried vainly to hide his satisfaction as he handed his son a weapon outside a clamor arose which grew louder and louder and the servant came dying back  they say you must come out

 so they are afraid to chance it where theres a mans chance said robert  come father let us go to them you are right they are curs not hounds after all

mary moved forward with them

 no dear stay here

 i will not robert i have no fear for myself i am going with you if you die i do not want to live i am going

 think of your father

do you think of my brother would he have me do less  

the cries were growing fiercer every moment and the father at the door cried  come on and stepped out as if eager to meet a crowd of enthusiastic admirers they passed along the hall threw open the front door and stepped out into the blaze of light which fell from the chandelier within at their appearance a hoarse cry rose from the lips of the mob for mob it was low ignorant infuriated

 there he isâthe rebel 

 rebels too good for himâcopperheads the name 

 traitor 

 coward  

they stood calmly upon the steps the three robert pale but dauntless his father as fixed as a statue and mary just behind them like a spirit of justice with eyes unbound

when their attitude had somewhat quieted the tumult stephen van doren spoke and his voice was calm and hard  well gentlemen he said  what is it that you want of us  

we want your son we want that damned copperhead thats joined the rebels and been killing our boys thats what we want came the reply in fifty voices

 there is no traitor and no copperhead here tan doren went on  my son it is true is here and he bowed to robert as if he were delivering a complimentary address  but he is none of the things which you name he is a man who has fought for his convictions and has returned here where he has as good a right as any of you he is here i say and if any or all of you want him damn you come and take him  

the old mans voice had risen and at the moment both he and robert as if by a preconcerted signal raised their pistols and levelled them at the foremost ranks of the mob intimidated at this defiance the crowd fell back just then a rock hurtled past van dorens head and crashed through a window the noise was like an electrie shock to the rabbles failing energies and with the cry  come on rock them   they started forward again those behind forcing the front ranks

 try not to kill any of the fools the father whispered briefly to his son

they were both pressing their triggers and the forward men were on the first step when a new cry waters waters checked their advance and a man with flowing white hair who had been thrusting his way through the crowd also mounted the step the mob thought it had found a new champion and again yelling waters waters rushed forward but waters turned and faced them waving his arms

 back back you cowards  he cried they paused in amazement as he backed slowly up the steps when they took in his meaning they attempted another rush but he stood above them and suddenly from beneath his coat he tore a long whip with leaden tipped thongs

 back he cried wielding it with terrific force into the faces and over the heads of the leaders  take this this is for dogs back to your kennels i say 

his face was terrible and the men in front quickly turned and began fighting their way to the rear others followed and a panic seized upon them when waters stood alone and the mob at a safe distance began sullenly to gather some one shouted  if it wasnt for your sons sake waters wed kill you

waters indicated that he wished to speak and they became silent with the silence of watchful beasts

 if it were not for my sons sake   he said  i gave him for the cause of right and decency and i am willing to give myself what right has any of you who joins so cowardly an attack as this to take upon his lips the name of a brave man  let never a man who was in this mob tonight utter my sons name again or by the god who rules over us i will kill him   a breath like a shudder passed over the rabble and waters went on  i have lost and i have the right to demand the full worth of my sacrifice and you who know my loss have no right to deny me this he moved up beside robert and putting his hand on his shoulder said  this man shall stand to me in lieu of the son i have lost and his empty sleeve shall be the sign of an eternal compact between us the badge of honor which it is he is mine not yours mine by the blood of my son mine by the void in my heart touch him if you dare go home and he began moving down the steps his whip grasped tightly in his hand  go home i say or ill whip you there

the mob fell back and just then the orderlytramping of feet was heard and a rush was made in an opposite direction as the police arrived on the scene late and reluctant

the four turned and went silently into the house they sat silent too in the library all too tense for speech until waters said come mary let us go you need have no fear of further trouble bob the captain will be about steve i disagree with you very much in your last article in the diurnal you are all wrong but ill talk to you about that tomorrow goodnight come mary it is strange how fanatical some men will be on a subject

in the after days it was as bradford waters had said and robert van doren experienced no further trouble at the hands of the mob indeed no man was willing to be known as having been a member of the party when it was talked about in public men turned their faces away and did not meet each others eyes in so small a town it was inevitable that many of the participants in such an affair should be known but no name was ever mentioned and the matter was not pressed however there was something suspicious about the manner in which some men avoided bradford waters and kept silent when others spoke his sons name

in the close counsels which took place between the two families formerly so far apart robert had suggested that perhaps it would be better for him to go away from dorbury to some place where he was not known but both waters and his father strenuously objected to that

 no said the latter  there are times when concessions must be made to the prejudices of people there are other times when it is no less than righteous to ride them down

your father is right had i lived in the south with my early training and bent of thought i should have had no better sense than to stand up for my principles just as he did i should have resented any southerners question of my right to do so the trouble with us all is that we will not allow others the right which we demand for ourselves

i think the trouble with us all is that we talk a great deal about free thought and free speech meaning that others shall have both as long as they think and speak as we do no rob you stay right here dorburys got to accept you just as you are

and robert stayed there were those who looked askance at him and those who could not be reconciled to him but no one troubled him as the war drew to a close and the continued victories of the union filled the people with enthusiasm they even began to grow friendly towards him but he was slow to receive their advances he was much with mary and the stream of their love that had been so turbulent now flowed smoothly and sweetly together they tried to cheer nannie  cheer  is hardly the word either for she had never lost a certain lightness of spirit that would not let her be entirely cast down but they tried to bring back the old gayety of her manner that had been her chief charm she was now back and forth between the waters and her own home and was full of the sweetness of good words and good works on every hand she was called  little miss nannie and men had already begun to pay to her that delicate deference which is given to a woman who will never marry she was always and would always be  miss nannie

i wish nannie mary said to her one day that i could give you a part of my happiness nannie laughed

you poor child she said dont you know that i am very happy i am happier than any one could ever imagine i have a lover who will always be young and a love that cannot grow cold dont worry about me i am blest beyond most women

so they let her go her way and their hearts ceased to ache for her as they saw how cheerful she grew with the joy of doing good so nannie began and so she went on through the years until the end like a fair flower dying away in its own perfume there was no selfishness in her subdued sweetness for when the soldiers came back no one was dearer to them than their dead captains sweetheart

the horror of the war has been written of the broken homes and the broken hearts but many a life was made sweeter for the fiery trial through which it passed stephen van doren was stern and implacable until the end robert was with him when the news of the surrender came a shiver passed over his body as if he himself were the confederacy which was dying then he took his sons hand and said with a smile well a principle has been tested and failed we must submit to the inevitable from now onâit is the union and he opened his window to hear the bells and whistles that proclaimed the peoples rejoicings

the war was ended but there were gaping wounds to bind up and deep sores that needed careful nursing the country had been drenched with fraternal blood and the stench of it was an ill savor in the nostrils of both north and south grant was a hero but men were asking  what is mc clellan   the homecoming soldiers worn and weary with the long campaign were being dropped along the wayside from every train some homes were hung with evergreens for gladness and others were draped with cypress for those who would never come back dorbury had its share of joy and grief there were returns and there were messages from those who would not return from lovers husbands fathers and brothers but above the note of sadness was one of joy for joy is more persistent than grief if shorter lived

a little after appomattox robert and mary were married and went to live in a little home of their own where the two fathers were destined to come many an evening thereafter to fight over the war talk politics and wrangle as heartily as ever

down in virginia wounded and broken and sore hey heart bleeding for her lost cause and her lost sons her fields devastated and her resources depleted a solemn tone characterized the thanksgiving for the wars end walter stewart thanked god for the triumph of the union but wept for the grief of his state just about the time that robert and mary were united he and dolly were married in the little vinecovered church by the rector who had looked askance at him a few years before

and they were happy with the happiness of youth nelson etheridge had come back safe dr daniel now with a majors stripes walked much in the garden with emily from whom before going away he had gained a certain promise

stewart had indeed come to his own again and he would have been a delight to his fathers eyes could the old colonel have seen him riding about the plantation among the negroes who remained and directing the repair of the damages which the war had made he would never go hack to dorbury now but his memory oft reverted to the old scenes and old acquaintances his description of nigger ed had so pleased dolly that it resulted in the receipt of the following letter by that gentleman one day in dorbury  my dear ed âyou will remember me as one of the boys who used to run around the streets after you years ago and later as one of the first when you were in command if you will come down here where there are lots of your people ill give you a position on my plantation where you wont be teased let me know if you will come it will be much better than going about ringing an old bell

walter stewart

with this letter the negro marched into the office of one of dorburys young lawyers one day the lawyer had been with the first

 i want you to read dis an answeh it mistah âscuse meâlootenant

the young fellow took it and his face flushed as he read it

 uh huh said ed now you answer it please suh

all right the young fellow scribbled for a moment and then turned saying i think youd better make it a telegram ed

whafu

shorter more expressive

les hyeah it

the young man picked up the slip of paper and read slowly and carefully mr walter stewart stewart house rockford co virginia you be damned

ed started as if he had been shot and then said hastily  oh no lootenant i reckon i wont send dat a telegrams too spressive

 how dare he send for you   the young man broke in you belong to dorbury youre a part of it
