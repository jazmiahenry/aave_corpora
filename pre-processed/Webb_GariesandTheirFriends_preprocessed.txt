garies and their friends webb frank j  fiction
it was at the close of an afternoon in may that a party might have been seen gathered around a table covered with all those delicacies that in the household of a rich southern planter are regarded as almost necessaries of life in the centre stood a dish of ripe strawberries their plump red sides peeping through the covering of white sugar that had been plentifully sprinkled over them geeche limes almost drowned in their own rich syrup temptingly displayed their bronzecoloured forms just above the rim of the glass that contained them opposite and as if to divert the gaze from lingering too long over their luscious beauty was a dish of peaches preserved in brandy a neverfailing article in a southern matrons catalogues of sweets a silver basket filled with a variety of cakes was in close proximity to a plate of cornflappers which were piled upon it like a mountain and from the brown tops of which trickled tiny rivulets of butter all these dainties mingling their various odours with the aroma of the tea and fine old java that came steaming forth from the richly chased silver pots could not fail to produce a very appetising effect

there was nothing about mr garie the gentleman who sat at the head of the table to attract more than ordinary attention he had the ease of manner usual with persons whose education and associations have been of a highly refined character and his countenance on the whole was pleasing and indicative ofhabitual good temper

opposite to him and presiding at the teatray sat a lady of marked beauty the first thing that would have attracted attention on seeing her were her gloriously dark eyes they were not entirely black but of that seemingly changeful hue so often met with in persons of african extraction which deepens and lightens with every varying emotion hers wore a subdued expression that sank into the heart and at once riveted those who saw her her hair of jetty black was arranged in braids and through her lightbrown complexion the faintest tinge of carmine was visible as she turned to take her little girl from the arms of the servant she displayed a fine profile and perfectly moulded form no wonder that ten years before when she was placed upon the auctionblock at savanah she had brought so high a price mr garie had paid two thousand dollars for her and was the envy of all the young bucks in the neighbourhood who had competed with him at the sale captivated by her beauty he had esteemed himself fortunate in becoming her purchaser and as time developed the goodness of her heart and her mind enlarged through the instructions he assiduously gave her he found the connection that might have been productive of many evils had proved a boon to both for whilst the astonishing progress she made in her education proved her worthy of the pains he took to instruct her she returned threefold the tenderness and affection he lavished upon her

the little girl in her arms and the boy at her side showed no trace whatever of african origin the girl had the chestnut hair and blue eyes of her father but the boy had inherited the black hair and dark eyes of his mother the critically learned in such matters knowing his parentage might have imagined they could detect the evidence of his mothers race by the slightly mezzotinto expression of his eyes and the rather african fulness of his lips but the casual observer would have passed him by without dreaming that a drop of negro blood coursed through his veins his face was expressive of much intelligence and he now seemed to listen with an earnest interest to the conversation that was going on between his father and a darkcomplexioned gentleman who sat beside him

 and so you say winston that they never suspected you were coloured  

 i dont think they had the remotest idea of such a thing

at least if they did they must have conquered their prejudices most effectually for they treated me with the most distinguished consideration old mr priestly was like a father to me and as for his daughter clara and her aunt they were politeness embodied the old gentleman was so much immersed in business that he was unable to bestow much attention upon me so he turned me over to miss clara to be shown the lions we went to the opera the theatre to museums concerts and i cant tell where all the sunday before i left i accompanied her to church and after service as we were coming out she introduced me to miss van cote and her mamma mrs van cote was kind enough to invite me to her grand ball

 and did you go interrupted mr garie

 of course i didâand what is more as old mr priestly has given up balls he begged me to escort clara and her aunt

 well winston that is too rich exclaimed mr garie slapping his hand on the table and laughing till he was red in the face   too good by jove  oh  i cant keep that i must write to them and say i forgot to mention in my note of introduction that you were a coloured gentleman

the old man will swear till everything turns blue and as for clara what will become of her a fifthavenue belle escorted to church and to balls by a coloured gentleman 

here mr garie indulged in another burst of laughter so sideshaking and merry that the contagion spread even to the little girl in mrs garies arms who almost choked herself with the tea her mother was giving her and who had to he hustled and shaken for some time before she could be brought round again

it will be a great triumph for me said mr garie

 the old man prides himself on being able to detect evidences of the least drop of african blood in any one and makes long speeches about the natural antipathy of the anglo saxon to anything with a drop of negro blood in its veins

oh i shall write him a glorious letter expressing my pleasure at his great change of sentiment and my admiration of the fearless manner in which ho displays his contempt for public opinion how he will stare i fancy i see him now with his hair almost on end with disgust it will do him good it will convince him i hope that a man can be a gentleman even though he has african blood in his veins

i have had a series of quarrels with him continued mr

garie  i think he had his eye on me for miss clara and that makes him particularly fierce about my present connection he rather presumes on his former great intimacy with my father and undertakes to lecture me occasionally when opportunity is afforded he was greatly scandalized at my bpeaking of emily as my wife  and seemed to think me cracked because i talked of endeavouring to procure a governess for my children or of sending them abroad to be educated he has a holy horror of everything approaching to amalgamation and of all the men i ever met cherishes the most unchristian prejudice against coloured people he says the existence of a gentleman with african blood in his veins is a moral and physical impossibility and that by no exertion can anything be made of that description of people he is connected with a society for the deportation of free coloured people and thinks they ought to be all sent to africa unless they are willing to become the property of some good master

oh yes it is quite a hobby of his here interposed mr winston  he makes lengthy speeches on the subject and has published two of them in pamphlet form have you seen them

 yes he sent them to me i tried to get through one of them but it was too heavy i had to give it up besides i had no patience with them they abounded in misstatements respecting the free coloured people why even here in the slave statesâin the cities of savanah and charleston âthey are much better situated than he describes them to be in new york and since they can and do prosper here where they have such tremendous difficulties to encounter i know they cannot be in the condition he paints in a state where they are relieved from many of the oppressions they labour under here and on questioning him on the subject i found he was entirely unacquainted with coloured people  profoundly ignorant as to the real facts of their case he had never been within a coloured church or school did not even know that they had a literary society amongst them

positively i living down here in georgia knew more about the character and condition of the coloured people of the northern states than he who lived right in the midst of them would you believe that beyond their laundress and a drunken negro that they occasionally employed to do odd jobs for them they were actually unacquainted with any coloured people and how unjust was it for him to form his opinion respecting a class numbering over twenty thousand in his own state from the two individuals i have mentioned and the negro loafers he occasionally saw in the streets

it is truly unfortunate rejoined mr winston for he covers his prejudices with such a pretended regard for the coloured people that a person would be the more readily led to believe his statements respecting them to be correct and he is really bo positive about it and apparently so deaf to all argument that i did not discuss the subject with him to any extent he was so very kind to me that i did not want to run a tilt against his favourite opinions

 you wrote me he gave you letters to philadelphia was there one amongst them to the mortons 

 yes they were very civil and invited me to a grand dinner they gave to the belgian chargã daffaires i also met there one or two scions of the first families of virginia

the belgian minister did not seem to be aware that slavery is a tabooed subject in polite circles and he was continually bringing it forward until slaves slavery and black people in general became the principal topic of conversation relieved by occasional discussion upon some new book or pictures and remarks in praise of the viands before us avery amusing thing occurred during dinner a brightfaced little coloured boy who was assisting at the table seemed to take uncommon interest in the conversation an animated discussion had arisen as to the antiquity of the use of salad one party maintaining that one of the oldest of the english poets had mentioned it in a poem and the other as stoutly denying it at last a reverend gentleman whose remarks respecting the intelligence of the children of ham had been particularly disparaging asserted that nowhere in chaucer spencer nor any of the old english poets could anything relating to it be found at this the little waiter became so excited that he could no longer contain himself and despite the frowns and nods of our hostess exclaimed  yes it can its in chaucer here he continued taking out a book from the bookcase  here is the very volume and turning over the leaves he pointed out the passage to the great chagrin of the reverend gentleman and to the amusement of the guests the belgian minister enjoyed it immensely ah said he  the child of ham know more than the child of shem dis time whereupon mrs morton rejoined that in this case it was not so wonderful owing to the frequent and intimate relations into which ham and salad were brought and with this joke the subject was dismissed i cant say i was particularly sorry when the company broke up

 oh george never mind the white people here interposed mrs garie  never mind them tell us about the coloured folks  they are the ones i take the most interest in

we were so delighted with your letters and so glad that you found mrs ellis tell us all about that

 oh tis a long story em and cant be told in a minute it would take the whole evening to relate it all

 look at the children my dear they are half asleep said mr garie  call nurse and see them safe into bed and when you come back we will have the whole story

 very well  replied she rising and calling the nurse

now remember george you are not to begin until i return for i should be quite vexed to lose a word

 oh go on with the children my dear ill guarantee he shall not say a word on the subject till you come back

with this assurance mrs garie left the room playfully shaking her finger at them as she went out exclaiming not a word remember now not a word

after she left them mr garie remarked  i have not seen em as happy as she is this afternoon for some time i dont know what has come over her lately  she scarcely ever smiles now and yet she used to be the most cheerful creature in the world i wish i knew what is the matter with her sometimes i am quite distressed about her she goes about the house looking so lost and gloomy and does not seem to take the least interest in anything you saw continued he  how silent she has been all tea time and yet she has been more interested in what you have been saying than in anything that has transpired for months well i suppose women will be so sometimes he concluded applying himself to the warm cakes that had just been set upon the table

perhaps she is not well suggested mr winston i think she looks a little pale

well possibly you may be right but i trust it is only a temporary lowness of spirits or something of that kind maybe she will get over it in a day or two and with this remark the conversation dropped and the gentlemen proceeded to the demolition of the sweetmeats before them

and now my reader whilst they are finishing their meal i will relate to you who mr winston is and how he came to he so familiarly seated at mr garies table

mr winston had been a slave yes that finelooking gentleman seated near mr garie and losing nothing by the comparison that their proximity would suggest had been fifteen years before sold on the auctionblock in the neighbouring town of savanahâhad been made to jump show his teeth shout to test his lungs and had been handled and examined by professed negro traders and amateur buyers with less gentleness and commiseration than every humane man would feel for a horse or an ox now do not doubt meâi mean that very gentleman whose polished manners and irreproachable appearance might have led you to suppose him descended from a long line of illustrious ancestors yes âhe was the offspring of a mulatto fieldhand by her master

he who was now clothed in fine linen had once rejoiced in a tow shirt that scarcely covered his nakedness and had sustained life on a peck of corn a week receiving the while kicks and curses from a tyrannical overseer

the death of his master had brought him to the auctionblock from which both he and his mother were sold to separate owners there they took their last embrace of each otherâthe mother tearless but heartbrokenâthe boy with all the wildest manifestations of grief

his purchaser was a cotton broker from new orleans a warmhearted kind old man who took a fancy to the boys looks and pitied him for his unfortunate separation from his mother after paying for his new purchase he drew him aside and said in a kind tone  come my little man stop crying my boys never cry if you behave yourself you shall have fine times with me stop crying now and come with me i am going to buy you a new suit of clothes

 i dont want new clothesâi want my mammy exclaimed the child with a fresh burst of grief

 oh dear me said the fussy old gentleman  why cant you stopâi dont want to hear you cry here continued he fumbling in his pocketâ heres a picayune

 will that buy mother back said the child brightening up

ho no my little man not quiteâi wish it would id purchase the old woman but i cantâim not able to spare the money

 then i dont want it cried the boy throwing the money on the ground  if it wont buy mammy i dont want it

i want my mammy and nothing else

at length by much kind language and by the prospect of many fabulous events to occur hereafter invented at the moment by the old gentleman the boy was coaxed into a more quiescent state and trudged along in the rear of mr

moyeseâthat was the name of his purchaserâto be fitted with the new suit of clothes

the next morning they started by the stage for augusta

george seated on the box with the driver found much to amuse him  and the drivers merry chat and great admiration of georges new and gailybedizened suit went a great way towards reconciling that young gentleman to his new situation

in a few days they arrived in hew orleans there under the kind care of mr moyese he began to exhibit great signs of intelligence the atmosphere into which he was now thrown the kindness of which he was hourly the recipient called into vigour abilities that would have been stifled for ever beneath the blighting influences that surrounded him under his former master the old gentleman had him taught to read and write and his aptness was such as to highly gratify the kind old soul

in course of time the temporary absence of an outdoor clerk caused georges services to be required at the office for a few days as errandboy here he made himself so useful as to induce mr moyese to keep him there permanently after this he went through all the grades from errandboy up to chiefclerk which post he filled to the full satisfaction of his employer his manners and person improved with his circumstances  and at the time he occupied the chiefclerks desk no one would have suspected him to he a slave and few who did not know his history would have dreamed that he had a drop of african blood in his veins he was unremitting in his attention to the duties of his station and gained by his assiduity and amiable deportment the highest regard of his employer

a week before a certain newyearsday mr moyese sat musing over some presents that had just been sent home and which he was on the morrow to distribute amongst his nephews and nieces  why bless me  he suddenly exclaimed turning them over  why ive entirely forgotten george that will never do i must get something for him

what shall it be  he has a fine watch and i gave him a pin and ring last year i really dont know what will be suitable and he sat for some time rubbing his chin apparently in deep deliberation  yes ill do it  he exclaimed starting up  ill do it he has been a faithful fellow and deserves it ill make him a present of himself now how strange it is i never thought of that beforeâits just the thing âhow surprised and delighted he will be   and the old gentleman laughed a low gentle happy laugh that had in it so little of selfish pleasure that had you only heard him you must have loved him for it

having made up his mind to surprise george in this agreeable manner mr moyese immediately wrote a note which he despatched to his lawyers messrs ketchum and lee desiring them to make out a set of free papers for his boy george and to have them ready for delivery on the morrow as it was his custom to give his presents two or three days in advance of the coming year

the note found mr ketchum deep in a disputed will case

âupon the decision of which depended the freedom of some halfdozen slaves who had been emancipated by the will of their late master by which piece of posthumous benevolence his heirs had been greatly irritated and were in consequence endeavouring to prove him insane

look at that lee said he tossing the note to his partner  if that old moyese isnt the most curious specimen of humanity in all new orleans he is going to give away clear fifteen hundred dollars as a newyears gift 

 to whom  asked mr lee

 he has sent me orders replied mr ketchum  to make out a set of free papers for his boy george

well i cant say that i see so much in that said lee  how can he expect to keep him george is almost as white as yon or i and has the manners and appearance of a gentleman he might walk off any day without the least fear of detection

very true rejoined ketchum but i dont think he would do it he is very much attached to the old gentleman and no doubt would remain with him as long as the old man lives but i rather think the heirs would have to whistle for him after moyese was put under ground however concluded mr ketchum they wont have much opportunity to dispute the matter as he will be a free man no doubt before he is fortyeight hours older

a day or two after this mr moyese entertained all his nephews and nieces at dinner and each was gratified with borne appropriate gift the old man sat happily regarding the group that crowded round him their faces beaming with delight the claim for the seat of honour on uncle moyeses knee was clamorously disputed and the old gentleman was endeavouring to settle it to the satisfaction of all parties when a servant entered and delivered a portentouslooking document tied with red tape  oh the papersânow my dears let uncle go gustave let go your hold of my leg or i cant get up amy ring the bell dear this operation mr moyese was obliged to lift her into the chair to effect where she remained tugging at the bellrope until she was lifted out again by the servant who came running in great haste to answer a summons of such unusual vigour

 tell george i want him said mr moyese

hes gone down to the office i hearn him say suffin bout de nordern mail as he went outâbut i duno what it was and as he finished he vanished from the apartment and might soon after have been seen with his mouth in close contact with the drumstick of a turkey

mr moyese being now released from the children took his way to the office with the portentous redtape document that was to so greatly change the condition of george winston in his coat pocket the old man sat down at his desk smiling as he balanced the papers in his hand at the thought of the happiness he was about to confer on his favourite he was thus engaged when the door opened and george entered bearing some newlyarrived orders from european correspondents in reference to which he sought mr moyeses instructions

 i think sir said he modestly  that we had better reply at once to ditson and send him the advance he requires as he will not otherwise be able to fill these  and as he concluded he laid the papers on the table and stood waiting orders respecting them

mr moyese laid down the packet and after looking over the papers george had brought in replied  i think we had

write to him to draw upon us for the amount he requiresâ and george he continued looking at him benevolently what would you like for a newyears present 

 anything you please sir was the respectful reply

well george resumed mr moyese  i have made up my mind to make you a present of here he paused and looked steadily at him for a few seconds and then gravely handing him the papers concluded  of yourself george

now mind and dont throw my present away my boy

george stood for some moments looking in a bewildered manner first at his master then at the papers at last the reality of his good fortune broke fully upon him and he sank into a chair and unable to say more than  god bless you mr moyese  burst into tears

now you are a pretty fellow said the old man sobbing himself  its nothing to cry aboutâget home as fast as you can you stupid crybaby and mind you are here early in the morning sir for i intend to pay you five hundred dollars ayear and i mean you to earn it and thus speaking he bustled out of the room followed by georges repeated god bless you  that  god bless you  played about his ears at night and soothed him to sleep in dreams he saw it written in diamond letters on a golden crown held towards him by a hand outstretched from the azure above he fancied the birds sang it to him in his morning walk and that he heard it in the ripple of the little stream that flowed at the foot of his garden so he could afford to smile when his relatives talked about his mistaken generosity and could take refuge in that fervent god bless you 

six years after this event mr moyese died leaving george a sufficient legacy to enable him to commence business on his own account as soon as he had arranged his affairs he started for his old home to endeavour to gain by personal exertions what he had been unable to learn through the agency of othersâa knowledge of the fate of his mother

he ascertained that she had been sold and resold and had finally died in new orleans not more than three miles from where he had been living he had not even the melancholy satisfaction of finding her grave during his search for his mother he had become acquainted with emily the wife of mr garie and discovered that she was his cousin and to this was owing the familiar footing on which we find him in the household where we first introduced him to our readers

mr winston had just returned from a tour through the northern states where he had been in search of a place in which to establish himself in business

the introductions with which mr garie had kindly favoured him had enabled him to see enough of northern society to convince him that amongst the whites he could not form either social or business connections should his identity with the african race be discovered and whilst on the other hand he would have found sufficiently refined associations amongst the people of colour to satisfy his social wants he felt that he could not bear the isolation and contumely to which they were subjected he therefore decided on leaving the united states and on going to some country where if he must struggle for success in life he might do it without the additional embarrassments that would be thrown in his way in his native land solely because he belonged to an oppressed race

 i wish charlie would come with that tea exclaimed mrs

ellis who sat finishing off some work which had to go home that evening  i wonder what can keep him so long away

he has been gone over an hour it surely cannot take him that time to go to watsons

 it is a great distance mother said esther ellis who was busily plying her needle  and i dont think he has been quite so long as you suppose

 yes he has been gone a good hour repeated mrs

ellis  it is now six oclock and it wanted three minutes to five when he left i do hope he wont forget that i told him half black and half greenâhe is so forgetful  and mrs ellis rubbed her spectacles and looked peevishly out of the window as she concludedâ where can he be   she resumed looking in the direction in which he might be expected  oh here he comes and caddy with him

they have just turned the cornerâopen the door and let them in

esther arose and on opening the door was almost knocked down by charlies abrupt entrance into the apartment he being rather forcibly shoved in by his sister caroline who appeared to be in a high state of indignation

 where do you think he was mother  where do you think i found him  

 well i cant sayâi really dont know in some mischief ill be bound

 he was on the lot playing marblesâand ive had such a time to get him home just look at his knees they are worn through and only think mother the tea was lying on the ground and might have been carried off if i had not happened to come that way and then he has been fighting and struggling with me all the way home see

continued she baring her arm just look how he has scratched me and as she spoke she held out the injured member for her mothers inspection

 mother said charlie in his justification  she began to beat me before all the boys before i had said a word to her and i wasnt going to stand that she is always storming at me she dont give me any peace of my life

 oh yes mother here interposed esther  cad is too cross to him i must say that he would not be as bad as he is if she would only let him alone

 esther please hush now you have nothing to do with their quarrels ill settle all their differences you always take his part whether he be right or wrong i shall send him to bed without his tea and tomorrow i will take his marbles from him  and if i see his knees showing through his pants again ill put a red patch on themâthats what ill do

now sir go to bed and dont let me hear of you until morning

mr and mrs ellis were at the head of a highly respectable and indastrious coloured family they had three children

esther the eldest was a girl of considerable beauty and amiable temper caroline the second child was plain in person and of rather shrewish disposition  she was a most indefatigable housewife and was never so happy as when in possession of a dust or scrubbing brush she would have regarded a place where she could have lived in a perpetual state of house cleaning as an earthly paradise between her and master charlie continued warfare existed interrupted only by brief truces brought about by her necessity for his services as watercarrier when a service of this character had been duly rewarded by a slice of bread and preserves or some other dainty hostilities would most probably be recommenced by charlies making an inroad upon the newly cleaned floor and leaving the prints of his muddy boots thereon

the fact must here be candidly stated that charlie was not a tidy boy he despised mats and seldom or never wiped his feet on entering the house he was happiest when he could don his most dilapidated unmentionables as he could then sit down where he pleased without the fear of his mother before his eyes and enter upon a game of marbles with his mind perfectly free from all harassing cares growing out of any possible accident to the aforesaid garments so that he might give that attention to the game that its importance demanded

he was a brightfaced pretty boy clever at his lessons and a favourite both with tutors and scholars he had withal a thorough boys fondness for play and was also characterised by all the thoughtlessness consequent thereon he possessed a lively affectionate disposition and was generally at peace with all the world his sister caddy excepted

caroline had recovered her breath and her mind being soothed by the judgment that had been pronounced on master charlie she began to bustle about to prepare tea

the shining copper teakettle was brought from the stove where it had been seething and singing for the last halthour then the teapot of china received its customary quantity of tea which was set upon the btove to brew and carefully placed behind the stove pipe that no accidental touch of the elbow might bring it to destruction plates knives and teacups came rattling forth from the closet the butter was brought from the place where it had been placed to keep it cool and a corncake was soon smoking on the table and sending up its seducing odour into the room overhead to which charlie had been recently banished causing to that unfortunate young gentleman great physical discomfort

how mother said the bustling caddy its all ready

come now and sit down whilst the cake is hotâdo put up the sewing esther and come  

neither esther nor her mother needed much pressing and they were accordingly soon seated round the table on which their repast was spread

 put away a slice of this cake for father said mrs ellis  for he wont be home until late he is obliged to attend a vestry meeting tonight

mrs ellis sat for some time sipping the fragrant and refreshing tea when the contents of two or three cups one after another had disappeared and sundry slices of cornbread had been deposited where much cornbread had been deposited before she began to think about charlie and to imagine that perhaps she had been rather hasty in sending him to bed without his supper

 what had charlie today in his dinnerbasket to take to school with him   she inquired of caddy

 why mother i put in enough for a wolf three or four slices of bread with as many more of cornbeef some cheese one of those little pies and all that breadpudding which was left at dinner yesterdayâhe must have had enough

but mother you know he always gives away the best part of his dinner interposed esther  he supplies two or three boys with food there is that dirty kinch that he is so fond of who never takes any dinner with him and depends entirely upon charlie he must be hungry do let him come down and get his tea mother  

notwithstanding the observations of caroline that esther was just persuading her mother to spoil the boy that he would be worse than ever and many other similar predictions esther and the tea combined won a signal triumph and charlie was called down from the room above where he had been exchanging telegraphic communications with the beforementioned kinch in hopes of receiving a commutation of sentence

charlie was soon seated at the table with an ample allowance of cornbread and tea and he looked so demure and conducted himself in such an exemplary manner that one would have scarcely thought him given to marbles and dirty company having eaten to hie satisfaction he quite ingratiated himself with caddy by picking up all the crumbs he had spilled during tea and throwing them upon the dustheap this last act was quite a stroke of policy as even caddy began to regard him as capable of reformation

the teathings washed up and cleared away the females busied themselves with their sewing and charlie immersed himself in his lessons for the morrow with a hearty goodwill and perseverance as if he had abjured marbles for ever

the hearty supper and persevering attention to study soon began to produce their customary effect upon charlie he could not get on with his lessons many of the state capitals positively refused to be found and he was beginning to entertain the sage notion that probably some of the legislatures had come to the conclusion to dispense with them altogether or had had them placed in such obscure places that they could not be found the variously coloured states began to form a vast kaleidoscope in which the lakes and rivers had been entirely swallowed up ranges of mountains disappeared and gulfs and bays and islands were entirely lost in fact he was sleepy and had already had two or three narrow escapes from butting over the candles finally he fell from his chair crushing caddys newlytrimmed bonnet to the intense grief and indignation of that young lady who inflicted summary vengeance upon him before he was sufficiently awake to be aware of what had happened

the work being finished mrs ellis and caddy prepared to take it home to mrs thomas leaving esther at home to receive her father on his return and give him his tea

mrs ellis and caddy wended their way towards the fashionable part of the city looking in at the various shopwindows as they went numberless were the great bargains they saw there displayed and divers were the discussions they held respecting them

 oh isnt that a pretty calico mother that with the green ground  

 tis pretty but it wont wash child those colours always run

 just look at that silk thoughânow thats cheap you must acknowledgeâonly eightyseven and a half cents if i only had a dress of that i should be fixed

 laws caddy  replied mrs ellis  that stuff is as slazy as a washed cotton handkerchief and coarse enough almost to sift sand through it wouldnt last you any time the silks they make nowadays aint worth anything they dont wear well at all why continued she when i was a girl they made silks that would stand on endâand one of them would last a lifetime

they had now reached chestnutstreet which was filled with gailydressed people enjoying the balmy breath of a soft may evening mrs ellis and caddy walked briskly onward and were soon beyond the line of shops and entered upon the aristocratic quarter into which many of its residents had retired that they might be out of sight of the houses in which their fathers or grandfathers had made their fortunes

 mother said caddy this is mr grants new houseâ isnt it a splendid place  they say its like a palace inside

they are great people them grants i saw in the newspaper yesterday that young mr augustus grant had been appointed an attach to the american legation at paris the newspapers say he is a rising man

well he ought to be rejoined mrs ellis for his old granddaddy made yeast enough to raise the whole family

many a pennyworth has he sold me laws how the poor old folk do get up  i think i can see the old man now with his sleeves rolled up dealing out his yeast he wore one coat for about twenty years and used to be always bragging about it

as they were thus talking a door of one of the splendid mansions they were passing opened and a fashionablydressed young man came slowly down the steps and walked on before them with a very measured step and peculiar gait

 thats young dr whiston mother whispered caddy hes courting young miss morton

 you dont say so  replied the astonished mrs ellis

 why i declare his grandfather laid her grandfather out

old whiston was an undertaker and used to make the handsomest coffins of his time and he is going to marry miss morton what next id like to know he walks exactly like the old man i used to mock him when i was a little girl he had just that hopandgo kind of gait and he was the funniest man that ever lived ive seen him at a funeral go into the parlour and condole with the family and talk about the dear departed until the tears rolled down his cheeks and then hed be down in the kitchen eating and drinking and laughing and telling jokes about the corpses before the tears were dry on his face how he used to make money he buried almost all the respectable people about town and made a large fortune he owned a buryingground in coatesstreet and when the property in that vicinity became valuable he turned the dead folks out and built houses on the ground 

 i shouldnt say it was a very pleasant place to live in if there are such things as ghosts said caddy laughing  i for one wouldnt like to live thereâbut here we are at mr

thomassâhow short the way has seemed 

caroline gave a fierce rap at the door which was opened by old aunt rachel the fat cook who had lived with the thomases for a fabulous length of time she was an old woman when mrs ellis came as a girl into the family and had given her many a cuff in days long past in fact notwithstanding mrs ellis had been married many years and had children almost as old as she herself was when she left mr thomas aunt rachel could never be induced to regard her otherwise than as a girl

 oh its you is it   said she gruffly as she opened the door  dont you think better break do door down at onceâ rapping as if you was guine to tear off de knockerâis dat de way gal you comes to qualitys houses  you lived here long nuff to larn better dan datâand dis is twice ive been to de door in de last halfhourâif any one else comes dere they may stay outside shut de door after you and come into de kitchen and dont keep me standin here all night

added she puffing and blowing as she waddled back into her sanctum

waiting until the irate old cook had recovered her breath mrs ellis modestly inquired if mrs thomas was at home  go up and see was the surly response  youve been up stars often enuff to know de wayâgo long wid you gal and dont be botherin me case i dont feel like bein botheredânow mind i tell yerâhere you cad bet down on dis stool and let that cat alone i dont let any one play with my cat

continued she  and youll jest let him alone if you please or ill make you go bit in de entry till your mothers ready to go

i dont see what she has you brats tugging after her for whenever bhe comes hereâshe might jest as well leave yer at home to dam your stockingsâi spect dey want it

poor caddy was boiling over with wrath but deeming prudence the better part of valour she did not venture upon any wordy contest with aunt rachel but sat down upon the stool by the fireplace in which a bright fire was blazing

up the chimney an old smokejack was clicking whirling and making the most dismal noise imaginable this old smokejack was aunt rachels especial protãgã and she obstinately and successfully defended it against all comers

she turned up her nose at all modem inventions designed for the same use as entirely beneath her notice she had been accustomed to hearing its rattle for the last forty years and would as soon have thought of committing suicide as consenting to its removal

she and her cat were admirably matched he was as snappish and cross as she and resented with distended claws and elevated back all attempts on the part of strangers to cultivate amicable relations with him in fact toms pugnacious disposition was clearly evidenced by his appearance one side of his face having a very battered aspect and the fur being torn off his back in several places

caddy sat for some time surveying the old woman and her cat in evident awe of both she regarded also with great admiration the scrupulously clean and shining kitchen tins that garnished the walls and reflected the red light of the blazing fire the wooden dresser was a miracle of whiteness and ranged thereon was a set of oldfashioned blue china on which was displayed the usual number of those unearthly figures which none but the chinese can create tick tick went the old dutch clock in the comer and the smokejack kept up its whirring noise old tom and aunt rachel were both napping and so caddy having no other resource went to sleep also

mrs ellis found her way without any difficulty to mrs

thomass room her gentle tap upon the door quite flurried that good lady who we speak it boftly was dressing her wig a task she entrusted to no other mortal hands she peeped out and seeing who it was immediately opened the door without hesitation

oh its you is it come in ellen said she i dont mind you

 ive brought the nightdresses home said mrs ellis laying her bundle upon the tableâi hope theyll suit

 oh no doubt they will did you bring the bill   asked mrs thomas

the bill was produced and mrs ellis sat down whilst mrs

thomas counted out the money this having been dulyeffected and the bill carefully placed on the file mrs thomas also sat down and commenced her usual lamentation over the state of her nerves and the extravagance of the younger members of the family on the latter subject she spoke very feelingly  such goings on ellen are enough to set me crazy âso many nursesâand then we have to keep four horsesâ and its company company from monday morning until saturday night the house is kept upsidedown continuallyâ money money for everythingâall going out and nothing coming in âand the unfortunate mrs thomas whined and groaned as if she had not at that moment an income of clear fifteen thousand dollars a year and a sister who might die any day and leave her half as much more

mrs thomas was the daughter of the respectable old gentleman whom dr whistons grandfather had prepared for his final restingplace her daughter had married into a once wealthy but now decayed carolina family in consideration of the wealth bequeathed by her grandfather who was a maker of leather breeches and speculator in general miss thomas had received the offer of the povertystricken hand of mr morton and had accepted it with evident pleasure as he was undoubtedly a member of one of the first families of the south and could prove a distant connection with one of the noble families of england

they had several children and their incessant wants had rendered it necessary that another servant should be kept

how mrs thomas had long had her eye on charlie with a view of incorporating him with the thomas establishment and thought this would be a favourable time to broach the subject to his mother she therefore commenced by inquiringâ  how have you got through the winter ellen  everything has been so dear that even we have felt the effect of the high prices

 oh tolerably well i thank you husbands business it is true has not been as brisk as usual but we ought not to complain now that we have got the house paid for and the girls do so much sewing we get on very nicely

i should think three children must be something of a burthenâmust be hard to provide for

 oh no not at all rejoined mrs ellis who seemed rather surprised at mrs thomass uncommon solicitude respecting them  we have never found the children a burthen thank godâtheyre rather a comfort and a pleasure than otherwise

 im glad to hear you say so ellenâvery glad indeed for i have been quite disturbed in mind respecting you during the winter i really several times thought of sending to take charlie off your hands bytheway what is he doing now  

 he goes to school regularlyâhe hasnt missed a day all winter you should just see his writing continued mrs

ellis warming up with a mothers pride in her only sonâ he wont let the girls make out any of the bills but does it all himselfâhe made out yours

mrs thomas took down the file and looked at the bill again  its very neatly written very neatly written indeed isnt it about time that he left schoolâdont you think he has education enough   she inquired

 his father dont he intends sending him to another school after vacation where they teach latin and greek and a number of other branches

 nonsense nonsense ellen if i were you i wouldnt  hear of it there wont be a particle of good result to the child from any such acquirements it isnt as though he was a white child what use can latin or greek be to a coloured boy none in the worldâhell have to be a common mechanic or perhaps a servant or barber or something of that kind and then what use would all his fine education be to him take my advice ellen and dont have him taught things that will make him feel above the situation he in all probability will have to fill now continued she  i have a proposal to make to you let him come and live with me awhileâill pay you well and take good care of him besides he will be learning something here good manners c not that he in not a wellmannered child but you know ellen there is something every one learns by coming in daily contact with refined and educated people that cannot but be beneficialâcome now make up your mind to leave him with me at least until the winter when the schools again commence and then if his father is still resolved to send him back to school why he can do so let me have him for the summer at least

mrs ellis who had always been accustomed to regard mrs thomas as a miracle of wisdom was of course greatly impressed with what she had said she had lived many years in her family and had left it to marry mr ellis a thrifty mechanic who came from savanah her native city

she had great reverence for any opinion mrs thomas expressed  and after some further conversation on the subject made up her mind to consent to the proposal and left her with the intention of converting her husband to her way of thinking

on descending to the kitchen she awoke caddy from a delicious dream in which she had been presented with the black silk that they had seen in the shop window marked eightyseven and a half cents a yard in the dream she had determined to make it up with tight sleeves and infant waist that being the most approved style at that period

 five breadths are not enough for the skirt and if i take six i must skimp the waist and cape murmured she in her sleep

wake up girl what are you thinking about said her mother giving her another shake

 oh  said caddy with a wild and disappointed lookâ i was dreaming wasnt i i declare i thought i had that silk frock in the window

 the girls heads are always running on fineryâwake up and come along im going home

caddy followed her mother out leaving aunt rachel and tom nodding at each other as they dozed before the fire

that night mr ellis and his wife had a long conversation upon the proposal of mrs thomas and after divers objections raised by him and set aside by her it was decided that charlie should be permitted to go there for the holidays at least after which his father resolved he should be sent to school again

charlie the next morning looted very blank on being informed of his approaching fate caddy undertook with great alacrity to break the dismal tidings to him and enlarged in a glowing manner upon what times he might expect from aunt rachel

 i guess shell keep you straightâyoull see sights up there  she is cross as sinâshell make you wipe your feet when you go in and out if no one else can

let him alone caddy gently interposed esther it is bad enough to be compelled to live in a house with that frightful old woman without being annoyed about it beforehand if i could help it charlie you should not go

 i know youd keep me home if you couldâbut old cad here she always rejoices if anything happens to me ill be hanged if i stay there said he  i wont live at serviceâ id rather be a sweep or sell apples on the dock im not going to be stuck up behind their carriage dressed up like a monkey in a tail coatâill cut off my own head first and with this sanguinary threat he left the house with his schoolbooks under his arm intending to lay the case before his friend and adviser the redoubtable and sympathising lunch

charlie started for school with a heavy heart had it not been for his impending doom of service in mr thomass family he would hare been the happiest boy that ever carried a schoolbag

it did not require a great deal to render this young gentleman happy all that was necessary to make up a day of perfect joyfulness with him was a dozen marbles permission to wear his worst inexpressibles and to be thoroughly up in his lessons today he was possessed of all these requisites but there was also in the perspective a long array of skirmishes with aunt rachel who he knew looked on him with an evil eye and who had frequently expressed herself regarding him in his presence in terms by no means complimentary or affectionate and the manner in which she had intimated her desire on one or two occasions to have an opportunity of reforming his personal habits were by no means calculated to produce a happy frame of mind now that the opportunity was about to be afforded her

charlie sauntered on until he came to a lumberyard where he stopped and examined a corner of the fence very attentively  not gone by yet i must wait for him said he and forthwith he commenced climbing the highest pile of boards the top of which he reached at the imminent risk of his neck here he sat awaiting the advent of his friend kinch the absence of deaths head and cross bones from the corner of the fence being a clear indication that he had not yet passed on his way to school

soon however he was espied in the distance and as he was quite a character in his way we must describe him

his most prominent feature was a capacious hungrylooking mouth within which glistened a row of perfect teeth he had the merriest twinkling black eyes and a nose so small and flat that it would have been a prize to any editor living as it would have been a physical impossibility to have pulled it no matter what outrage he had committed his complexion was of a ruddy brown and his hair entirely innocent of a comb was decorated with divers feathery tokens of his last nights rest a cap with the front torn off jauntily set on one side of his head gave him a rakish and wideawake air his clothes were patched and tom in several places and his shoes were already in an advanced stage of decay

as he approached the fence he took a piece of chalk from his pocket and commenced to sketch the accustomed startling illustration which was to convey to charlie the intelligence that he had already passed there on his way to school when a quantity of sawdust came down in a shower on his head

as soon as the blinding storm had ceased kinch looked up and intimated to charlie that it was quite late and that there was a probability of their being after time at school

this information caused charlie to make rather a hasty descent in doing which his dinnerbasket was upset and its contents displayed at the feet of the voracious kinch

 now ill be even with you for that sawdust cried he as he pocketed two boiled eggs and bit an immense piece out of an appletart which he would have demolished completely but for the prompt interposition of its owner

 oh l my golly  charlie your mother makes good pies 

he exclaimed with rapture as soon as he could get his mouth sufficiently clear to speak  give us another biteâonly a nibble

but charlie knew by experience what kinchs  nibbles 

were and he very wisely declined saying sadly as he did so  you wont get many more dinners from me kinch im going to leave school

 no you aint though are you   ashed the astonished kinch  you are not going are you really  

yes really replied charlie with a doleful look mother is going to put me out at service

 and do you intend to go  asked kinch looking at him incredulously

 why of course was the reply  how can i help going if father and mother say i must  

 i tell you what i should do said kinch  if it was me

i should act so bad that the people would be glad to get rid of me they hired me out to live once and i led the people they put me with such a dance that they was glad enough to send me home again

this observation brought them to the schoolhouse which was but a trifling distance from the residence of mrs ellis

they entered the school at the last moment of grace and mr dicker looked at them severely as they took their seats

 just saved ourselves whispered kinch  a minute later and we would have been done for and with this closing remark he applied himself to his grammar a very judicious move on his part for he had not looked at his lesson and there were but ten minutes to elapse before the class would be called

the lessons were droned through as lessons usually are at school there was the average amount of flogging performed  cakes nuts and candy confiscated little boys on the back seats punched one another as little boys on the back seats always will do and were flogged in consequence

then the boy who never knew his lessons was graced with the fools cap and was pointed and stared at until the arrival of the playhour relieved him from his disagreeable situation

 what kind of folks are these thomases   asked kinch as he bat beside charlie in the playground munching the last of the appletart  what kind of folks are they  tell me that and i can give you some good advice maybe

 old mrs thomas is a little driedup old woman who wears spectacles and a wig she isnt of much accountâi dont mind her shes not the trouble its of old aunt rachel im thinking why she has threatened to whip me when ive been there with mother and she even talks to her sometimes as if she was a little girl lord only knows what shell do to me when she has me there by myself you should just see her and her cat i really dont know continued charlie which is the worst looking i hate them both like poison and as he concluded he bit into a piece of bread as fiercely as if he were already engaged in a desperate battle with aunt rachel and was biting her in selfdefence

 well said kinch with the air of a person of vast experience in difficult cases i should drown the catâid do that at onceâas soon as i got there then let me ask you has aunt rachel got corns  

 corns  i wish you could see her shoes replied charlie

 why you could sail down the river in em they are so large yes she has got corns bunions and rheumatism and everything else

 ah then said kinch  your way is clear enough if she has got corns i should confine myself to operating on them

i should give my whole attention to her feet when she attempts to take hold of you do you jist come down on her corns fling your shins about kinder wild you know and let her have it on both feet you see ive tried that plan and know by experience that it works well dont you see you can pass that off as an accident and it dont look well to be scratching and biting as for the lady of the house old mrs whatshername do you just manage to knock her wig off before some company and theyll send you home at onceâ âtheyll hardly give you time to get your hat

charlie laid these directions aside in his mind for future application and asked  what did you do kinch to get away from the people you were with  

 dont ask me said kinch laughing  dont boy dont ask meâmy conscience troubles me awful about it sometimes

i fell up stairs with dishes and i fell down stairs with dishes

i spilled oil on the carpet and broke a lookingglass  but it was all accidentalâentirely accidentalâthey found i was too spensive and so they sent me home

oh i wouldnt do anything like thatâi wouldnt destroy anythingâbut ive made up my mind that i wont stay there at any rate i dont mind workâi want to do something to assist father and mother but i dont want to be any ones servant i wish i was big enough to work at the shop

how did your mother come to think of putting you there   asked kinch

 the lord alone knows was the reply  i suppose old mrs thomas told her it was the best thing that could be done for me and mother thinks what she says is law and gospel i believe old mrs thomas thinks a coloured person cant get to heaven without first living at service a little while

the school bell ringing put an end to this important conversation and the boys recommenced their lessons

when charlie returned from school the first person he saw on entering the house was robberts mrs thomass chief functionary and the presiding genius of the wine cellarâ when he was trusted with the key charlie learned to his horror and dismay that he had been sent by mrs thomas to inquire into the possibility of obtaining his services immediately as they were going to have a series of dinner parties and it was thought that he could be rendered quite useful

and must i go mother  he asked

 yes my son  ive told robberts that you shall come up in the morning replied mrs ellis then turning to robberts she inquired how is aunt rachel 

at this question the liveried gentleman from mrs

thomass shook his head dismally and answered  dont ask me woman dont ask me if you please that old sinner gets worse and worse every day she lives these dinners were spectin to have has just set her wildâshe is mad as fury bout emâand she snaps me up just as if i was to blame that is an awful old woman now mind i tell you

as mr robberts concluded he took his hat and departed giving charlie the cheering intelligence that he should expect him early next morning

charlie quite lost his appetite for supper in consequence of his approaching trials and laying aside his books with a sigh of regret sat listlessly regarding his sisters enlivened now and then by some cheerful remark from caddy such as â  youll have to keep your feet cleaner up there than you do at home or youll have aunt each in your wool half a dozen times a day and you mustnt throw your cap and coat down where you please on the chairs or tablesâshell bring you out of all that in a short time i expect youll have two or three bastings before you have been there a week for she dont put up with any nonsense ah boy

she concluded chuckling youll have a time of itâi dont envy you 

with these and similar enlivening anticipations caddy whiled away the time until it was the hour for charlie to retire for the night which he did with a heavy heart

early the following morning he was awakened by the indefatigable caddy and he found a small bundle of necessaries prepared until his trunk of apparel could be sent to his new home  oh cad he exclaimed rubbing his eyes how i do hate to go up there id rather take a good whipping than go

 well it is too late now to talk about it hurry and get your clothes onâit is quite lateâyou ought to have been off an hour ago

when he came down stairs prepared to go his mother  hoped that he was going to behave like a man which exhortation had the effect of setting him crying at once and then he had to be caressed by the tearful esther and finally started away with very red eyes followed to the door by his mother and the girls who stood looking after him for some moments

so hurried and unexpected had been his departure that he had been unable to communicate with his friend kinch

this weighed very heavily on his spirits and he occupied the time on his way to mrs thomass in devising various plans to effect that object

on arriving he gave a faint rap that was responded to by aunt rachel who saluted him withâ  oh yers come has yerâwipe your feet child and come in quick shut the door after yer

what shall i do with this  timidly asked he holding up his package of clothes

 oh dems yer rags is deyâfling em anywhere but dont bring em in my kitchen said she  dere is enuff things in dere nowâput em down here on this entry table or dere long side de knifeboardâany wberes but in de kitchen

charlie mechanically obeyed and then followed her into her sanctuary

 have you had your breakfast   she asked in a surly tone  cause if you havent you must eat quick or you wont get any i cant keep the breakfast things standing here all day

charlie to whom the long walk had given a good appetite immediately sat down and ate a prodigious quantity of bread and butter together with several slices of cold ham washed down by two cups of tea after which he rested his knife and fork and informed aunt rachel that he had done

 well i think its high time responded she  why boy youll breed a famine in de house if you stay here long enough youll have to do a heap of work to earn what youll eat if yer breakfast is a sample of yer dinner

come get up child  and shell dese ere peaseâtime you get em done old mrs thomas will be down stairs

charlie was thus engaged when mrs thomas entered the kitchen well charlesâgood morning said she in a bland voice  im glad to see you here so soon has he had his breakfast aunt rachel  

 yes  and he eat like a wild animalâi never seed a child eat more in my life was aunt rachels abrupt answer

 im glad he has a good appetite said mrs thomas  it shows he has good health boys will eat you cant expect them to work if they dont but it is time i was at those custards charlie put down those peas and go into the other room and bring me a basket of eggs you will find on the table

 and be sure to overset the milk thats long side of itâ yer hear  added aunt rachel

charlie thought to himself that he would like to accommodate her but he denied himself that pleasure on the ground that it might not be safe to do it

mrs thomas was a housekeeper of the old school and had a scientific knowledge of the manner in which all sorts of pies and puddings were compounded she was so learned in custards and preserves that even aunt rachel sometimes deferred to her superior judgment in these matters carefully breaking the eggs she skilfully separated the whites from the yolks and gave the latter to charlie to beat at first he thought it great fun and he hummed some of the popular melodies of the day and kept time with his foot and the spatula but pretty soon he exhausted his stock of tunes and then the performances did not go off so well his arm commenced aching and he came to the sage conclusion before he was relieved from his task that those who eat the custards are much better off than those who prepare them

this task finished he was pressed into service by aunt rachel to pick and stone some raisins which she gave him with the injunction either to sing or whistle all the time he was  at em  and that if he stopped for a moment she should know he was eating them and in that case she would visit him with condign punishment on the spot for she didnt care a fig whose child he was

thus in the performance of first one little job and then another the day wore away and as the hour approached at which the guests were invited charlie after being taken into the diningroom by robberts where he was greatly amazed at the display of silver cut glass and elegant china was posted at the door to relieve the guests of their coats and hats which duty he performed to the entire satisfaction of all parties concerned

at dinner however he was not so fortunate he upset a plate of soup into a gentlemans lap and damaged beyond repair one of the elegant china vegetable dishes he took rather too deep an interest in the conversation for a person in his station and in fact the bright boy alluded to by mr

winston as having corrected the reverend gentleman respecting the quotation from chaucer was no other than our friend charlie ellis

in the evening when the guests were departing charlie handed mr winston his coat admiring the texture and cut of it very much as he did so mr winston amused at the boys manner askedâ  what is your name my little man  

 charles ellis was the prompt reply  im named after my father

and where did your father come from charlie he asked looking very much interested

 from savanah sir now tell me where you came from

replied charles

 i came from new orleans said mr winston with a smile now tell me he continued where do you live when you are with your parents  i should like to see your father charlie quickly put his interrogator in possession of the desired information after which mr winston departed soon followed by the other guests

charlie lay for some time that night on his little cot before he could get to sleep and amongst the many matters that so agitated his mind was his wonder what one of mrs

thomass guests could want with his father being unable  however to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion respecting it he turned over and went to sleep

in the early part of mr winstons career when he worked as a boy on the plantation of his father he had frequently received great kindness at the hands of one charles ellis who was often employed as carpenter about the premises

on one occasion as a great favour he had been permitted to accompany ellis to his home in savanah which was but a few miles distant where he remained during the christmas holidays this kindness he had never forgotten and on his return to georgia from new orleans he sought for his old friend and found he had removed to the north but to which particular city he could not ascertain

as he walked homewards the strong likeness of little charlie to his old friend forced itself upon him and the more he reflected upon it the more likely it appeared that the boy might be his child and the identity of name and occupation between the father of charlie and his old friend led to the belief that he was about to make some discovery respecting him

on his way to his hotel he passed the old state house the bell of which was just striking ten  its too late to go tonight said he  it shall be the first thing i attend to in the morning  and after walking on a short distance farther he found himself at the door of his domicile

as he passed through the little knot of waiters who were gathered about the doors one of them turning to another asked  aint that man a southerner and aint he in your rooms ben    i think hes a southerner was the reply of ben  but why do you ask allen   he enquired

 because its time he had subscribed something replied mr allen  the funds of the vigilance committee are very low indeed in fact the four that we helped through last week have completely drained us we must make a raise from some quarter and we might as well try it on him

mr winston was waiting for a light that he might retire to his room and was quickly served by the individual who had been so confidentially talking with mr allen

after giving mr winston the light ben followed him into his room and busied himself in doing little nothings about the stove and washstand  let me unbutton your straps sir said he stooping down and commencing on the buttons which he was rather long in unclosing  i know sir dat you southern gentlemen aint used to doing dese yer things for youself i alius makes it a pint to show southerners more tention dan i does to dese yer northern folk cause yer see i knows deyr used to it and cant get on widout it

 i am not one of that kind said winston as ben slowly unbuttoned the last strap  i have been long accustomed to wait upon myself ill only trouble you to bring me up a glass of fresh water and then i shall have done with you for the night

 better let me make you up a little fire the nights is werry cool continued ben  i know you must feel em i does myself im from the south too

are you replied mr winston with some interest  from what part 

 from tuckahoe county virginia nice place dat

never having been there i cant say rejoined mr

winston smiling and how do you like the north  i suppose you are a runaway continued he

 oh no sir no sir replied ben  i was sot freeâand i often wish he added in a whining tone  dat i was back agin on the old placeâhadnt got no kind marster to look after me her and i has to work drefful hard sometimes

ah he concluded drawing a long sigh  ifi was only back on de old place 

 i heartily wish you were  said mr winston indignantly  and wish moreover that you were to be tied up and whipped once a day for the rest of your life any man that prefers slavery to freedom deserves to be a slaveâyou ought to be ashamed of yourself go out of the room sir as quick as possible   phew  said the astonished and chagrined ben as he descended the stairs  that was certainly a great miss continued he talking as correct english and with as pure northern an accent as any one could boast

 we have made a great mistake this time a very queer kind of southerner that is im afraid we took the wrong pig by the ear  and as iie concluded he betook himself to the group of whiteaproned gentlemen before mentioned to whom he related the incident that had just occurred

quite a severe fall that i should say remarked mr allen

 perhaps we have made a mistake and he is not a southerner after all well he is registered from new orleans and i thought he was a good one to try it on

 its a clear case weve missed it this time exclaimed one of the party  and i hope ben when you found he was on the other side of the fence you did not say too much

laws no   rejoined ben  do you think im a fool as soon as i heard him say what he did i was glad to get offâ i felt cheap enough now mind i tell you any one could have bought me for a shilling

now it must be here related that most of the waiters employed in this hotel were also connected with the vigilance committee of the underground railroad companyâa society formed for the assistance of fugitive slaves by their efforts and by the timely information it was often in their power to give many a poor slave was enabled to escape from the clutches of his pursuers

the house in which they were employed was the great resort of southerners who occasionally brought with them their slippery property and it frequently happened that these disappeared from the premises to parts unknown aided in their flight by the very waiters who would afterwards exhibit the most profound ignorance as to their whereabouts

such of the southerners as brought no servants with them were made to contribute unconsciously and most amusingly to the escape of those of their friends

when a gentleman presented himself at the bar wearing boots entirely too small for him with his hat so far down upon his forehead as almost to obscure his eyes and whose mouth was filled with oaths and tobacco he was generally looked upon as a favourable specimen to operate upon and if he cursed the waiters addressed any old man amongst them as  boy and was continually drinking cocktails and mintjuleps they were sure of their man and then would tell him the most astonishing and distressing tales of their destitution expressing almost with tears in their eyes their deep desire to return to their former masters whilst perhaps the person from whose mouth this tale of woe proceeded had been born in a neighbouring street and had never been south of mason and dixons line this flattering testimony in favour of  the peculiar institution  generally had the effect of extracting a dollar or two from the purse of the sympathetic southerner which money went immediately into the coffers of the vigilance committee

it was this course of conduct they were about to pursue with mr winston not because he exhibited in person or manners any of the beforementioned peculiarities but from his being registered from new orleans

the following morning as soon as he had breakfasted he started in bearch of mr ellis the address was  little greenstreet and by diligently inquiring he at length discovered the required place

after climbing up a long flight of stairs on the outside of an old wooden building he found himself before a door on which was written  charles ellis carpenter and joiner

on opening it he ushered himself into the presence of an elderly coloured man who was busily engaged in planing off a prank as soon as mr winston saw his face fully he recognized him as his old friend the hair had grown grey and the form was also a trifle bent but he would hare known him amongst a thousand springing forward he grasped his hand exclaiming  my dear old friend dont you know me 

mr ellis shaded his eyes with his hand and looked at him intently for a few moments but seemed no wiser from his scrutiny the tears started to mr winstons eyes as he said  many a kind word im indebted to you forâi am george winstonâdont you remember little george that used to live on the carter estate  

 why bless me i it cant be that you are the little fellow that used to go home with me sometimes to savanah and that was sold to go to new orleans

 yes the same boy ive been through a variety of changes since then

 i should think you had smilingly replied mr ellis  and judging from appearances very favourable ones  why i took you for a white manâand you are a white man as far as complexion is concerned laws child  he continued laying his hand familiarly on winstons shoulders  how you have changedâi should never have known you the last time i saw you you were quite a shaver running about in a long tow shirt and regarding a hat and shoes as articles of luxury far beyond your reach and now said mr ellis gazing at him with admiring eyes just to look at you

why you are as fine a looking man as one would wish to see in a days travel ive often thought of you it was only the other day i was talking to my wife and wondering what had become of you she although a great deal older than your cousin emily used to be a sort of playmate of hers poor emily we heard she was sold at public sale in savanahâdid you ever learn what became of her    oh yes i saw her about two months since when on my way from new orleans you remember old colonel garie 

well his son bought her and is living with her they have two childrenâshe is very happy i really love him he is the most kind and affectionate fellow in the world there is nothing he would not do to make her happy emily will be so delighted to know that i have seen your wifeâbut who is mrs ellis âany one that i know  

 i do not know that you are acquainted with her but you should remember her mother old nanny tobert as she was called  bhe kept alittle confectioneryâalmost every one in savanah knew her

 i cant say i do replied winston reflectively

 she came here continued mr ellis  some years ago and died soon after her arrival her daughter went to live with the thomases an old philadelphia family and it was from their house i married her

 thomases   repeated mr winston  that is where i saw your boyâhe is the image of you

 and how came you there   asked ellis with a look of surprise

 in the most natural manner possible i was invited there to dinner yesterdayâthe bright face of your boy attracted my attentionâso i inquired his name and that led to the discovery of yourself

 and do the thomases know you are a coloured man  

asked mr ellis almost speechless with astonishment

 i rather think not laughingly rejoined mr winston

 it is a great risk you run to be passing for white in that way said mr ellis with a grave look  but how did you manage to get introduced to that set  they are our very first people

 it is a long story was winstons reply and he then as briefly as he could related all that had occurred to himself since they last met and now continued he as he finished his recital  i want to know all about you and your family and i also want to see something of the coloured people since ive been in the north ive met none but whites im not going to return to new orleans to remain

im here in search of a home i wish to find some place to settle down in for life where i shall not labour under as many disadvantages as i must struggle against in the south

 one thing i must tell you rejoined mr ellis  if you should settle down here youll have to be either one thing or otherâwhite or coloured either you must live exclusively amongst coloured people or go to the whites and remain with them but to do the latter you must bear in mind that it must never be known that you have a drop of african blood in your veins or you would be shunned as if you were a pestilence  no matter how fair in complexion or how white you may be

 i have not as yet decided on trying the experiment and i hardly think it probable i shall rejoined winston as he said this he took out his watch and was astonished to find how very long his visit had been he therefore gave his hand to mr ellis and promised to return at six oclock and accompany him home to visit his family

as he was leaving the shop mr ellis remarked  george you have not said a word respecting your mother his face flushed and the tears started in his eyes as he replied in a broken voice  shes dead only think ellis she died within a stones throw of me and i searching for her all the while i never speak of it unless compelled it is too harrowing it was a great trial to me it almost broke my heart to think that she perished miserably bo near me whilst i was in the enjoyment of every luxury oh if she could only have lived to see me as i am now  continued he  but he ordered it otherwise and we must bow twas gods will it should be so good bye till evening i shall see you again at six

great was the surprise of mrs ellis and her daughters on learning from mr ellis when he came home to dinner of the events of the morning and great was the agitation caused by the announcement of the fact that his friend was to be their guest in the evening

mrs ellis proposed inviting some of their acquaintances to meet him  but to this project her husband objected saying he wanted to have a quiet evening with him and to talk over old times and that persons who were entire strangers to him would only be a restraint upon them

caddy seemed quite put out by the announcement of the intended visit she declared that nothing was fit to be seen that the house was in a state of disorder shocking to behold and that there was scarce a place in it fit to sit down in and she forthwith began to prepare for an afternoons vigorous scrubbing and cleaning

just let things remain as they are will you caddy dear said her father  please be quiet until i get out of the house he continued as she began to make unmistakeable demonstrations towards raising a dust  in a few moments you shall have the house to yourself only give me time to finish my dinner in peace

esther her mother and their sewing were summarily banished to an upstairs room whilst caddy took undivided possession of the little parlour which she soon brought into an astonishing state of cleanliness the ornaments were arranged at exact distances from the corners of the mantelpiece the lookingglass was polished until it appeared to be without spot or blemish and its gilt frame was newly adorned with cut paper to protect it from the flies the best china was brought out carefully dusted and set upon the waiter and all things within doors placed in a state of forwardness to receive their expected guest the doorsteps were however not as white and clean as they might be and that circumstance pressed upon caddys mind she therefore determined to give them a hasty wipe before retiring to dress for the evening

having done this and dressed herself to her satisfaction she came down stairs to prepare the refreshments for tea

in doing this she continually found herself exposing her new silk dress to great risks she therefore donned an old petticoat over her skirt and tied an old silk handkerchief over her head to protect her hair from flying particles of dust and thus arrayed she passed the time in a state of great excitement frequently looking out of the window to see if her father and their guest were approaching

in one of these excursions she to her intense indignation found a beggar boy endeavouring to draw with a piece of charcoal an illustration of a horserace upon her so recently cleaned doorsteps

you young villain she almost screamed go away from there how dare you make those marks upon the steps  go off at once or ill give you to a constable to these behests the daring young gentleman only returned a contemptuous laugh and put his thumb to his nose in the most provoking manner  aint you going   continued the irate caddy almost choked with wrath at the sight of the steps over which she had so recently toiled scored in every direction with black marks

just wait till i come down ill give it to you you audacious villain you she cried as she closed the window  ill see if i cant move you  caddy hastily seized a broom and descended the stairs with the intention of inflicting summary vengeance upon the dirty delinquent who had so rashly made himself liable to her wrath stealing softly down the alley beside the house she sprang suddenly forward and brought the broom with all her energy down upon the head of mr winston who was standing on the place just left by the beggar she struck with such force as to completely crush his hat down over his eyes and was about to repeat the blow when her father caught her arm and she became aware of the awful mistake she had made

 why my child   exclaimed her father  what on earth is the matter with you have you lost your senses   and as he spoke he held her at arms length from him to get a better look at her  what are you dressed up in this style for  

he continued as he surveyed her from head to foot and then bursting into a loud laugh at her comical appearance he released her and she made the quickest possible retreat into the house by the way she came out

rushing breathless upstairs she exclaimed  oh mother mother ive done it now theyve come and ive beat him over the head with a broom  

 beat whom over the head with a broom   asked mrs

ellis

 oh mother im so ashamed i dont know what to do with myself i struck mr winston with a broom mr

winston the gentleman father has brought home

 i really believe the child is crazy said mrs ellis surveying the chagrined girl  beat mr winston over the head with a broom  how came you to do it  

 oh mother i made a great mistake i thought he was a beggar

 he must be a very different looking person from what we have been led to expect here interrupted esther  i understood father to say that he was very gentlemanlike in appearance

 so he is replied caddy

 but you just said you took him for a beggar   replied her mother

 oh dont bother me dont bother me  my head is all turned upside down do esther go down and let them in âhear how furiously father is knocking oh goâdo go 

esther quickly descended and opened the door for winston and her father and whilst the former was having the dust removed and his hat straightened mrs ellis came down and was introduced by her husband she laughingly apologized for the ludicrous mistake caddy had made which afforded great amusement to all parties and divers were the jokes perpetrated at her expense during the remainder of the evening

her equanimity having been restored by winstons assurances that he rather enjoyed the joke than otherwiseâand an opportunity having been afforded her to obliterate the obnoxious marks from the doorstepsâshe exhibited great activity in forwarding all the arrangements for tea

they sat a long while round the tableâmuch time that under ordinary circumstances would have been given to the demolition of the food before them being occupied by the elders of the party in inquiries after mutual friends and in relating the many incidents that had occurred since they last met

tea being at length finished and the things cleared away mrs ellis gave the girls permission to go out where are you going   asked their father

 to the library companys roomâtonight is their last lecture

i thought said winston that coloured persons were excluded from such places i certainly have been told so several times

 it is quite true replied mr ellis   at the lectures of the white library societies a coloured person would no more be permitted to enter than a donkey or a rattlesnake this association they speak of is entirely composed of people of colour they have a fine library a debating club chemical apparatus collections of minerals c they have been having a course of lectures delivered before them this winter and tonight is the last of the course

wouldnt you like to go mr winston  asked mrs

ellis who had a mothers desire to secure so fine an escort for her daughters

 no noâdont george quickly interposed mr ellis i am selfish enough to want you entirely to myself tonight

the girls will find beaux enough ill warrant you at this request the girls did not seem greatly pleased r and miss caddy who already in imagination had excited the envy of all her female friends by the grand entrie she was to make at the lyceum leaning on the arm of winston gave her father a by no means affectionate look and tying her bonnetstrings with a hasty jerk started out in company with her sister

 you appear to be very comfortable here ellis said mr

winston looking round the apartment  if i am not too inquisitiveâwhat rent do you pay for this house  

 its mine   replied ellis with an air of satisfaction  house ground and all bought and paid for since i settled here

 why yon are getting on well i suppose remarked winston  that you are much better off than the majority of your coloured friends from all lean learn the free coloured people in the northern cities are very badly off ive been frequently told that they suffer dreadfully from want and privations of various kinds

 oh i see you have been swallowing the usual dose that is poured down southern throats by those northern negrohaters who seem to think it a duty they owe the south to tell all manner of infamous lies upon us free coloured people i really get so indignant and provoked sometimes that i scarcely know what to do with myself badly off and in want indeed why my dear sir we not only support our own poor but assist the whites to support theirs and enemies are continually filling the public ear with the most distressing tales of our destitution only the other day the colonization society had the assurance to present a petition to the legislature of this state asking for an appropriation to assist them in sending us all to africa that we might no longer remain a burthen upon the state â and they came very near getting it too  had it not been for the timely assistance of young denbigh the son of judge denbigh they would have succeeded such was the gross ignorance that prevailed respecting our real condition amongst the members of the legislature he moved a postponement of the vote until he could have time to bring forward facts to support the ground that he had assumed in opposition to the appropriation being made it was granted  and in a speech that does him honour he brought forward facts that proved us to be in a much superior condition to that in which our imaginative enemies had described us ay he did moreâhe proved us to be in advance of the whites in wealth and general intelligence  for whilst it was one in fifteen amongst the whites unable to read and write it was but one in eighteen amongst the coloured i wont pretend to be correct about the figures but that was about the relative proportions and also that we paid in the shape of taxes upon our real estate more than our proportion for the support of paupers insane convicts c

well said the astonished winston that is turning the tables completely you must take me to visit amongst the coloured people i want to see as much of them as possible during my stay

 ill do what i can for you george i am unable to spare you much time just at present but ill put you in the hands of one who has abundance of it at his disposalâi will call with you and introduce you to walters

 who is walters   asked mr winston

 a friend of mineâa dealer in real estate

 oh then he is a white man  

not by any means laughingly replied mr ellis  he is as black as a man can conveniently be he is very wealthy some say that he is worth half a million of dollars he owns to my certain knowledge one hundred brick houses i met him the other day in a towering rage it appears that he owns ten thousand dollars worth of btock in a railroad extending from this to a neighbouring city having occasion to travel in it for some little distance he got into the firstclass cars  the conductor seeing him there ordered him outâhe refused to go and stated that he was a shareholder the conductor replied that he did not care how much stock he owned he was a nigger and that no nigger should ride in those cars so he called help and after a great deal of trouble they succeeded in ejecting him

 and he a stockholder it was outrageous exclaimed winston  and was there no redress  

 no none practically he would have been obliged to institute a suit against the company and as public opinion now is it would be impossible for him to obtain a verdict in his favour

the next day winston was introduced to mr walters who expressed great pleasure in making his acquaintance and spent a week in showing him everything of any interest connected with coloured people

winston was greatly delighted with the acquaintances he made and the kindness and hospitality with which he was received made a most agreeable impression upon him

it was during this period that he wrote the glowing letters to mr and mrs garie the effects of which will be discerned in the next chapter

we must now return to the garies whom we left listening to mr winstons description of what he saw in philadelphia and we need not add anything respecting it to what the reader has already gathered from the last chapter our object being now to describe the effect his narrative produced

on the evening succeeding the departure of winston for new orleans mr and mrs garie were seated in a little arbour at a short distance from the house and which commanded a magnificent prospect up and down the river it was overshadowed by tall trees from the topmost branches of which depended large bunches of georgian moss swayed to and fro by the soft spring breeze that came gently sweeping down the long avenue of magnolias laden with the sweet breath of the flowers with which the trees were covered

a climbing rose and cape jessamine had almost covered the arbour and their intermingled blossoms contrasting with the rich brown colour of the branches of which it was constructed gave it an exceedingly beautiful and picturesque appearance

this arbour was their favourite resort in the afternoons of summer as they could see from it the sun go down behind the low hills opposite casting his gleams of golden light upon the tops of the trees that crowned their summits northward where the chain of hills was broken the waters of the river would be brilliant with waves of gold king after the other parts of it were shrouded in the gloom of twilight

mr and mrs garie sat looking at the children who were scampering about the garden in pursuit of a pet rabbit which had escaped and seemed determined not to be caught upon any pretence whatever

 are they not beautiful   said mr garie with pride as they bounded past him  there are not two prettier children in all georgia you dont seem half proud enough of them

he continued looking down upon his wife affectionately

mrs garie who was half reclining on the seat and leaning her head upon his shoulder replied oh yes i am garie im sure i love them dearlyâoh so dearly  continued she ferventlyâand i only wishâhere she paused as if she felt she had been going to say something that had better remain unspoken

 you only wish what dear  you were going to say something rejoined her husband  come out with it and let me hear what it was

 oh garie it was nothing of any consequence

 consequence or no consequence let me hear what it was dear

 well as you insist on hearing it i was about to say that i wish they were not little slaves

 oh em em  exclaimed he reproachfully  how can you speak in that manner  i thought dear that you regarded me in any other light than that of a master what have i done to revive the recollection that any such relation existed between us  am i not always kind and affectionate p did you ever have a wish ungratified for a single day if it was in my power to compass it  or have i ever been harsh or neglectful  

 oh no dear noâforgive me garieâdo pray forgive me âyou are kindness itselfâbelieve me i did not think to hurt your feelings by saying what i did i know you do not treat me or them as though we were slaves but i cannot help feeling that we are suchâand it makes me very bad and unhappy sometimes if anything should happen that you should be taken away suddenly think what would be our fate heirs would spring up from somewhere and we might be sold and separated for ever respecting myself i might be indifferent but regarding the children i cannot feel so

 tut tut em dont talk so gloomily do you know of any one now who has been hired to put me to death   said he smiling

 dont talk so dear remember  in the midst of life we are in death it was only this morning i learned that celeste âyou remember celeste dont you pâi cannot recall her last name

no dear i really cant say that i do remember whom you refer to

i can bring her to your recollection i think continued she  one afternoon last fall we were riding together on the augustaroad when you stopped to admire a very neat cottage before the door of which two pretty children were playing

 oh yes i remember something about itâi admired the children so excessively that you became quite jealous

 i dont remember that part of it she continued but let me tell you my story last week the father of the children started for washington the cars ran off the track and were precipitated down a high embankment and he and some others were killed since his death it has been discovered that all his property was heavily mortgaged to old mac turk the worst man in the whole of savannah and he has taken possession of the place and thrown her and the children into the slavepen from which they will be sold to the highest bidder at a sheriffs sale who can say that a similar fate may never be mine p these things press upon my spirit and make me so gloomy and melancholy at times that i wish it were possible to shun even myself lately more than ever have i felt disposed to beg you to break up here and move off to some foreign country where there is no such thing as slavery i have often thought how delightful it would be for us all to be living in that beautiful italy you have so often described to meâor in france either you said you liked both those placesâwhy not live in one of them

no no emily i love america too much to ever think of living anywhere else i am much too thorough a democrat ever to swear allegiance to a king no noâthat would never doâgive me a free country

 that is just what i say rejoined mrs garie  that is exactly what i want that is why i should like to get away from here because this is not a free countryâgod knows it is not 

 oh you little traitor how severely you talk abusing your native land in such shocking style its really painful to hear you said mr garie in a jocular tone

 oh love rejoined she  dont joke its not a subject for jesting it is heavier upon my heart than you dream of

wouldnt you like to live in the free states  there is nothing particular to keep you here and only think how much better it would be for the children  and garie she continued in a lower tone nestling close to him as she spoke and drawing his head towards her  i think i am going toâ and she whispered some words in his ear and as she finished she shook her head and her long curls fell down in clusters over her face

mr garie put the curls aside and kissing her fondly asked  how long have you known it dear 

not long not very long she replied and i have such a yearning that it should be born a free child i do want that the first air it breathes should be that of freedom

it will kill me to have another child born here its infant smiles would only be a reproach to me oh continued she in a tone of deep feeling it is a fearful thing to give birth to an inheritor of chains  and she shuddered as she laid her head on her husbands bosom

mr garies brow grew thoughtful and a pause in the conversation ensued the sun had long since gone down and here and there the stars were beginning to show their twinkling light the moon which had meanwhile been creeping higher and higher in the blue expanse above now began to shed her pale misty beams on the river below the tiny waves of which broke in little circlets of silver on the shore almost at their feet

mr garie was revolving in his mind the conversation he had so recently held with mr winston respecting the free states it had been suggested by him that the children should be sent to the north to be educated but he had dismissed the notion well knowing that the mother would be heartbroken at the idea of parting with her darlings until now the thought of going to reside in the north had never been presented for his consideration he was a southerner in almost all his feelings and had never had a scruple respecting the ownership of slaves but now the fact that he was the master as well as the father of his children and that whilst he resided where he did it was out of his power to manumit them that in the event of his death they might be seized and sold by his heirs whoever they might be sent a thrill of horror through him he had known all this before but it had never stood out in such bold relief until now

 what are you thinking of garie   asked his wife looking up into his face  i hope i have not vexed you by what ive said

 oh no dear not at all i was only thinking whether you would be any happier if i acceded to your wishes and removed to the north here you live in good styleâyou have a luxurious home troops of servants to wait upon you a carriage at your disposal in fact everything for which you express a desire

 i know all that garie and what i am about to say may seem ungrateful but believe me dear i do not mean it to be so i had much rather live on crusts and wear the coarsest clothes and work night and day to earn them than live here in luxury wearing gilded chains carriages and fine clothes cannot create happiness i have every physical comfort and yet my heart is often heavyâoh so very heavy  i know i am envied by many for my fine establishment yet how joyfully would i give it all up and accept the meanest living for the childrens freedomâand your love

 but emily granted we should remove to the north you would find annoyances there as well as here there is a great deal of prejudice existing there against people of colour which often exposes them to great inconveniences

yes dear i know all that i should expect that but then on the other hand remember what george said respecting the coloured people themselves what a pleasant social circle they form and how intelligent many of them are oh garie how i have longed for friendsâwe have visitors now and then but none that i can call friends the gentlemen who come to see you occasionally are polite to me but under existing circumstances i feel that they cannot entertain for me the respect i think i deserve i know they look down upon and despise me because im a coloured woman

then there would bei another advantage i should have some female societyâhere i have none the white ladies of the neighbourhood will not associate with me although i am better educated thanks to your care than many of them so it is only on rare occasions when i can coax some of our more cultivated coloured acquaintances from savannah to pay us a short visit that i have any female society and no woman can be happy without it i have no parents nor yet have you

we have nothing we greatly love to leave behindâno strong ties to break and in consequence would be subjected to no great grief at leaving if i only could persuade you to go  

said she imploringly  well emily replied he in an undecided manner  ill think about it i love you so well that i believe i should be willing to make any sacrifice for your happiness but it is getting damp and chilly and you know said he smiling you must be more than usually careful of yourself now

the next evening and many more besides were spent in discussing the proposed change many objections to it were btated weighed carefully and finally set aside winston was written to and consulted and though he expressed some surprise at the proposal gave it his decided approval he advised at the same time that the estate should not be bold but be placed in the hands of some trustworthy person to be managed in mr garies absence under the care of a firstrate overseer it would not only yield a handsome income but should they be dissatisfied with their northern home they would have the old place still in reserve and with the knowledge that they had this to fall back upon they could try their experiment of living in the north with their minds less harassed than they otherwise would be respecting the result

as mr garie reflected more and more on the probable beneficial results of the project his original disinclination to it diminished until he finally determined on running the risk and he felt fully rewarded for this concession to his wifes wishes when he saw her recover all her wonted serenity and sprightliness

they were soon in all the bustle and confusion consequent on preparing for a long journey when mr garies determination to remove became known great consternation prevailed on the plantation and dismal forebodings were entertained by the slaves as to the result upon themselves divers were the lamentations heard on all sides when they were positively convinced that  massa was gwine away for true   but they were somewhat pacified when they learned that no one was to be sold and that the place would not change hands for mr garie was a very kind master and his slaves were as happy as slaves can be under any circumstances not much less was the surprise which the contemplated change excited in the neighbourhood and it was commented on pretty freely by his acquaintances one of themâ to whom be bad in conversation partially opened his mind and explained that his intended removal grew out of anxiety respecting the children and his own desire that they might be where they could enjoy the advantages of schools câ sneered almost to his face at what be termed his crackbrained notions and subsequently in relating to another person the conversation he bad bad with mr garie spoke of him as a softheaded fool led by the nose by a yaller wench why cant he act be said like other men who happen to have halfwhite childrenâbreed them up for the market and sell them   and he might have added  as i do

for be was well known to have so acted by two or three of bis own tawny offspring

mr garie at the suggestion of winston wrote to mr walters to procure them a small but neat and comfortable house in philadelphia which when procured he was to commit to the care of mr and mrs ellis who were to have it furnished and made ready to receive him and his family on their arrival as mr garie desired to save his wife as much as possible from the care and anxiety attendant upon the arrangement of a new residence

one most important matter and on which depended the comfort and happiness of his people was the selection of a proper overseer on its becoming known that he required such a functionary numbers of individuals who aspired to that dignified and honourable office applied forthwith and as it was also known that the master was to be absent and that in consequence the party having it under his entire control could cut and slash without being interfered with the value of the situation was greatly enhanced it had also another irresistible attraction the absence of the master would enable the overseer to engage in the customary picking and stealing operations with less chance of detection

in consequence of all these advantages there was no want of applicants great bony new england men traitors to the air they first breathed came anxiously forward to secure the prize mean weasenfaced poor white georgians who were able to show testimonials of their having produced large crops with a small number of hands and who could tell to a fraction how long a slave could be worked on a given quantity of com also put in their claims for consideration

short thickset men with fierce faces who gloried in the fact that they had at various times killed refractory negroes also presented themselves to undergo the necessary examination

mr garie sickened as he contemplated the motley mass of humanity that presented itself with such eagerness for the attainment of so degrading an office and as he listened to their vulgar boastings and brutal language he blushed to think that such men were his countrymen

never until now had he had occasion for an overseer he was not ambitious of being known to produce the largest crop to the acre and his hands had never been driven to that shocking extent so common with his neighbours he had been his own manager assisted by an old negro called ephraimâmost generally known as eph and to him had been entrusted the task of immediately superintending the hands engaged in the cultivation of the estate this old man was a great favourite with the children and clarence who used to accompany him on his pony over the estate regarded him as the most wonderful and accomplished coloured gentleman in existence

eph was in a state of great perturbation at the anticipated change and he earnestly sought to be permitted to accompany them to the north mr garie was however obliged to refuse his request as he said that it was impossible that the place could get on without him

an overseer being at last procured whose appearance and manners betokened a better heart than that of any who had yet applied for the situation and who was also highlyrecommended for skill and honesty nothing now remained to prevent mr garies early departure

one evening mr ellis was reading the newspaper and mrs ellis and the girls were busily engaged in sewing when who should come in but mr walters who had entered without ceremony at the front door which had been left open owing to the unusual heat of the weather  here you all are hard at work exclaimed he in his usual hearty manner accepting at the same time the chair offered to him by esther

 come now continued he  lay aside your work and newspapers for i have great news to communicate

indeed what is it pâwhat can it be   cried the three females almost in a breath  do let us hear it 

 oh said mr walters in a provokingly slow tone  i dont think ill tell you tonight  it may injure your rest it will keep till tomorrow

how that is always the way with mr walters said caddy pettishly   he always rouses ones curiosity and then refuses to gratify itâhe is so tantalizing sometimes  

 ill tell you this much said he looking slily at caddy it is connected with a gentleman who had the misfortune to be taken for a beggar and who was beaten over the head in consequence by a young lady of my acquaintance

now father has been telling you that exclaimed caddy looking confused  and i dont thank him for it either i hear of that everywhere i goâeven the burtons know of it

mr walters now looked round the room as though he missed some one and finally exclaimed  where is charlie 

i thought i missed somebodyâwhere is my boy    we have put him out to live at mrs thomass answered mrs ellis hesitatingly for she knew mr walters feelings respecting the common practice of sending little coloured boys to service  it is a very good place for him continued sheâ a most excellent place

 that is too bad rejoined mr waltersâ too bad it is a shame to make a servant of a bright clever boy like that

why ellis man how came you to consent to his going 

the boy should be at school it really does seem to me that you people who have good and smart boys take the very course to ruin them the worst thing you can do with a boy of his age is to put him at service once get a boy into the habit of working for a stipend and depend upon it when he arrives at manhood he will think that if he can secure so much a month for the rest of his life he will be perfectly happy how would you like him to be a subservient old numskull like that old robberts of theirs  

here esther interrupted mr walters by saying  i am very glad to hear you express yourself in that manner mr

waltersâvery glad charlie is such a bright active little fellow i hate to have him living there as a servant and he dislikes it too as much as any one can i do wish mother would take him away

 hush esther said her mother sharply your mother lived at service and no one ever thought the worse of her for it

esther looked abashed and did not attempt to say anything farther

 now look here ellen said mr walters he called her ellen for he had been long intimate with the family  if you cant get on without the boys earning something why dont you do as white women and men do  do you ever find them sending their boys out as servants  no  they rather give them a stock of matches blacking newspapers or apples and start them out to sell them what is the result 

the boy that learns to sell matches soon learns to sell other things  he learns to make bargains he becomes a small trader then a merchant then a millionaire did you ever hear of any one who had made a fortune at service  where would i or ellis have been had we been hired out all our lives at so much a month  it begets a feeling of dependence to place a boy in such a situation  and rely upon it if he stays there long it will spoil him for anything better all his days

mrs ellis was here compelled to add by way of justifying herself that it was not their intention to let him remain there permanently his father only having given his consent for him to serve during the vacation

 well dont let him stay there longer i pray you continued walters  a great many white people think that we are only fit for servants and i must confess we do much to strengthen the opinion by permitting our children to occupy such situations when we are not in circumstances to compel us to do so mrs thomas may tell you that they respect their old servant robberts as much as they do your husband but they dont neverthelessâi dont believe a word of it it is impossible to have the same respect for the man who cleans your boots that you have for the man who plans and builds your house

 oh well walters here interposed mr ellis  i dont intend the boy to remain there so dont get yourself into an unnecessary state of excitement about it let us hear what this great news is that you have brought

oh i had almost forgotten it laughingly replied walters at the same time fumbling in his pocket for a letter which he at length produced  here he continued opening it  is a letter i have received from a mr garie enclosing another from our friend winston this mr garie writes me that he is coming to the north to settle and desires me to procure them a house and he says also that he has so far presumed upon an early acquaintance of his wife with mrs ellis as to request that she will attend to the furnishing of it you are to purchase all that is necessary to make them comfortable and i am to foot the bills

 what you dont mean emily winstons husband   said the astonished mrs ellis

 i cant say whose husband it is but from winstons letter replied mr walters i suppose he is the person alluded to

 that is news continued mrs ellis  only think she was a little mite of a thing when i first knew her and now she is a woman and the mother of two children how time does fly i must be getting quite old concluded she with a sigh

 nonsense ellen remarked mr ellis  you look surprisingly young you are quite a girl yet why it was only the other day i was asked if you were one of my daughters

mrs ellis and the girls laughed at this sally of their fathers who asked mr walters if he had as yet any house in view

 there is one of my houses in winterstreet that i think week since i can call for you tomorrow he continued turning to mr ellin  will you accompany me there to take a look at the premises  

 it is a dreadful long walk replied mrs ellis  how provoking it is to think that because persons are coloured they are not permitted to ride in the omnibuses or other public conveyances  i do hope i shall live to see the time when we shall be treated as civilized creatures should be

 i suppose we shall be so treated when the millennium comes rejoined walters not before i am afraid  and as we have no reason to anticipate that it will arrive before tomorrow we shall have to walk to winterstreet or take a private conveyance at any rate i shall call for you tomorrow at ten good nightâremember at ten

well this is a strange piece of intelligence exclaimed mrs ellis as the door closed upon mr walters  i wonder t what on earth can induce them to move on here their place i am told is a perfect paradise in old colonel garies time it was said to be the finest in georgia i wonder if he really intends to live here permanently  

 i cant say my dear replied mrs ellis i am as r much in the dark as you are

 perhaps they are getting poor ellis and are coming here because they can live cheaper

 oh no wife i dont think that can be the occasion of  their removal i rather imagine he purposes emancipating his children he cannot do it legally in georgia and you know by bringing them here and letting them remain six  months they are freeâso says the law of some of the southern  states and i think of georgia

the next morning mrs ellis caddy and mr walters e itarted for winterstreet it was a very long walk and when they arrived there they were all pretty well exhausted

 oh dear exclaimed mrs ellis after walking upstairs lam so tired and there is not a chair in the house i must wit here said she seating herself upon the stairs and looking out upon the garden  what a large yard  if ours were only flâ largo os this what a delightful place i could make of it i but there is no room to plant anything at our house the garden is so very small

after they were all somewhat rested they walked through the house and surveyed the rooms making some favourable commentary upon each

 the house dont look as if it would want much cleaning said caddy with a tone of regret

 so much the better i should say suggested mr walters

not as caddy views the matter rejoined mrs ellis

 she is so fond of housecleaning that i positively think she regards the cleanly state of the premises as rather a disadvantage than otherwise

they were all however very well pleased with the place  and on their way home they settled which should be the best bedroom and where the children should sleep they also calculated how much carpet and oilcloth would be necessary and what style of furniture should be put in the parlour

i think the letter said plain neat furniture and not too expensive did it not   asked mrs ellis

 i think those were the very words replied caddy  and oh mother isnt it nice to have the buying of so many pretty things  i do so love to shop  

 particularly with some one elses money rejoined her mother with a smile

yes or ones own either when one has it continued caddy   i like to spend money under any circumstances

thus in conversation relative to the house and its fixtures they beguiled the time until they reached their home on arriving there mrs ellis found robberts awaiting her return with a very anxious countenance he informed her that mrs

thomas wished to see her immediately that charlie had been giving that estimable lady a world of trouble  and that her presence was necessary to set things to rights

what has he been doing   asked mrs ellis

 oh lots of things  he and aunt rachel dont get on together at all and last night he came nigh having the house burned down over our heads

 why robberts you dont tell me so what a trial boys are bighed mrs ellis

 he got on first rate for a week or two  but since that he has been raising satan he and aunt rachel had a rigular brush yesterday and he has actually lamed the old woman to that extent she wont be able to work for a week to come

 dear dear what am i to do   said the perplexed mrs

ellis  i cant go up there immediately i am too tired

say to mrs thomas i will come up this evening i wonder

concluded she  what has come over the boy

 mother you know how cross aunt rachel is i expect she has been illtreating him he is so goodnatured that he never would behave improperly to an old person unless goaded to it by some very harsh usage

 thats the wayâgo on esther find some excuse for your angel said caddy ironically  of course that lamb could not do anything wrong and according to your judgment he never does but i tell you he is as bad as any other boyboys are boys i expect he has been tracking over the floor after aunt rachel has scrubbed it or has been doing something equally provoking he has been in mischief depend upon it

things had gone on very well with master charlie for the first two weeks after his introduction into the house of the fashionable descendant of the worthy maker of leathern breeches his intelligence combined with the quickness and goodhumour with which he performed the duties assigned him quite won the regard of the venerable lady who presided over that establishment it is true she had detected him in several attempts upon the peace and wellbeing of aunt rachels tom but with tom she had little sympathy he having recently made several felonious descents upon her stores of cream and custards in fact it was not highly probable if any of his schemes had resulted seriously to the spiteful protãgã of aunt rachel that mrs thomas would have been overwhelmed with grief or disposed to inflict any severe punishment on the author of the catastrophe

unfortunately for mrs thomas charlie whilst going on an errand had fallen in with his ancient friend and adviserâin short he had met no less a person than the formerly allsufficient kinch great was the delight of both parties at this unexpected meeting and warm indeed was the exchange of mutual congratulations on this auspicious event

kinch in the excess of his delight threw his hat several feet in the air nor did his feelings of pleasure undergo the least abatement when that dilapidated portion of his costume fell into a bed of newlymixed lime from which he rescued it with great difficulty and at no little personal risk

 hallo  kinch old fellow how are you cried charlie  ive been dying to see youâwhy havent you been up  

 why i did come up often but that old witch in the kitchen wouldnt let me see youâshe abused me scandalous

i wanted to pull her turban off and throw it in the gutter

why she called me a dirty beggar and threatened to throw cold water on me if i didnt go away phew aint she an old buster 

 why i never knew you were there

 yes continued kinch  and i saw you another time hung up behind the carriage i declare charlie you looked so like a little monkey dressed up in that skyblue coat and silver buttons that i liked to have died alaughing at you 

and kinch was so overcome by the recollection of the event in question that he was obliged to sit down upon a doorstep to recover himself

oh i do hate to wear this confounded livery  said charlie dolefullyâ the boys scream johnny coattail after me in the streets and call me  blue jay and  blue nigger and lots of other names i feel that all thats wanting to make a complete monkey of me is for some one to carry me about on an organ

 what do you wear it for then  asked kinch

 because i cant help myself thats the reason the boys plague me to that extent sometimes that i feel like tearing the things into bitsâbut mother says i must wear it kinch

concluded he significantly  something will have to be done i cant stand it

 you remember what i told you about the wig dont you asked kinch  and on receiving an affirmative reply he continued  just try that on and see how it goesâyoull find itll work like a charm  its a regular footmanexpatriatorâjust try it now youll see if it isnt the thing to do the business for you

im determined to be as bad as i can rejoined charlie  im tired enough of staying there  that old aunt each is a devilâi dont believe a saint from heaven could get on with her  im expecting well have a pitched battle every day

beguiling the time with this and similar conversation they reached the house to which charlie had been despatched with a note after which he turned his steps homeward still accompanied by the redoubtable kinch

as ill luck would have it they passed some boys who were engaged in a game of marbles charlies favourite pastime and on kinchs offering him the necessary stock to commence play he launched into the game regardless of the fact that the carriage was ordered for a drive within an hour and that he was expected to fill his accustomed place in the rear of that splendid vehicle

once immersed in the game time flew rapidly on mrs

thomas awaited his return until her patience was exhausted when she started on her drive without him as they were going through a quiet street to her horror and surprise prominent amidst a crowd of dirty boys she discovered her little footman with his elegant blue livery covered with dirt and sketches in white chalk for in the excitement of the game charlie had not observed that kinch was engaged in drawing on the back of his coat his favourite illustration to wit a skull and crossbones

 isnt that our charlie   said she to her daughter surveying the crowd of noisy boys through her eyeglass  i really believe it isâthat is certainly our livery pull the checkstring and stop the carriage

now robberts had been pressed into service inconsequence of charlies absence and was in no very good humour at being compelled to air his rheumatic old shins behind the familycarriage it can therefore be readily imagined with what delight he recognized the delinquent footman amidst the crowd and with what alacrity he descended and pounced upon him just at the most critical moment of the game

clutching fast hold of him by the collar of his coat he dragged him to the carriagewindow and held him before the astonished eyes of his indignant mistress who lifted up her hands in horror at the picture he presented  oh  you wretched boy said she  just look at your clothes all covered with chalkmarks and bespattered with lime your livery is totally ruinedâand your knees tooâonly look at themâthe dirt is completely ground into them

 but you havent seed his back marm said bobberts  hes got the pirates flag drawn on it that boy ll go straight to the devilâi know he will

all this time charlie to his great discomfiture was being shaken and turned about by bobberts in the most unceremonious manner brack with his usual audacity was meanwhile industriously engaged in tracing on bobberts coat a similar picture to that he had so skilfully drawn on charlies to the great delight of a crowd of boys who stood admiring spectators of his artistic performances the coachman however observing this operation brought it to a rather hasty conclusion by a well directed cut of the whip across the fingers of the daring young artist this so enraged kinck that in default of any other missile he threw his limecovered cap at the head of the coachman  but unfortunately for himself the only result of his exertions was the lodgment of his cap in the topmost bough of a neighbouring tree from whence it was rescued with great difficulty

 what shall we do with him   asked mrs thomas in a despairing tone as she looked at charlie

 put him with the coachman suggested mrs morton

 he cant sit there the horses are so restive and the seat is only constructed for one and he would be in the coachmans way i suppose he must find room on behind with bobberts

 i wont ride on the old carriage cried charlie nerved by despair  i wont stay here nohow im going home to my mother  and as he spoke he endeavoured to wrest himself from bobberts grasp

 put him in here said mrs thomas  it would never do to let him go for he will run home with some distressing tale of illtreatment no we must keep him until i can send for his motherâput him in here

much to mrs mortons disgust charlie was bundled by robberts into the bottom of the carriage where he sat listening to the scolding of mrs thomas and her daughter until they arrived at home he remained in disgrace for several days after this adventure but as mrs thomas well knew that she could not readily fill his place with another she made a virtue of necessity and kindly looked over this first offence

the situation was however growing more and more intolerable aunt rachel and he had daily skirmishes in which he was very frequently worsted he had held several hurried consultations with kinch through the grating of the cellar window and was greatly cheered and stimulated in the plans he intended to pursue by the advice and sympathy of his devoted friend master kinchs efforts to console charlie were not without great risk to himself as he had on two or three occasions narrowly escaped falling into the clutches of robberts who well remembered kinchs unprecedented attempt upon the sacredness of his livery and what the result might have been had the latter fallen into his hands we cannot contemplate without a shudder

these conferences between kinch and charlie produced their natural effect and latterly it had been several times affirmed by aunt rachel that dat air boy was gittin tirely too highâgittin bove hissef pletelyâdat he was gittin more and more aggriwatin every dayâdat she itched to git at himâdat shespected nothin else but what shed be bliged to take hold o him and she comported herself generally as if she was crazy for the conflict which she saw must sooner or later occur

charlie unable on these occasions to reply to her remarks without precipitating a conflict for which he did not feel prepared sought to revenge himself upon the veteran tom and such was the state of his feelings that he bribed kinch with a large lump of sugar and the leg of a turkey to bring up his mothers jerry a fierce young cat and they had the satisfaction of shutting him up in the woodhouse with the belligerent tom who suffered a signal defeat at jerrys claws and was obliged to beat a hasty retreat through the window with a seriously damaged eye and with the fur tom off his back in numberless places after this charlie had the pleasure of hearing aunt rachel frequently bewail the condition of her favourite whose deplorable state she was inclined to ascribe to his influence though she was unable to bring it home to him in such a manner as to insure his conviction

mrs thomas was affected as silly women sometimes are with an intense desire to be at the head of the ton for this object she gave grand dinners and large evening parties to which were invited all who being two or three removes from the class whose members occupythe cobblers bench or the hucksters stall felt themselves at liberty to look down upon the rest of the world from the pinnacle on which they imagined themselves placed at these social gatherings the conversation never turned upon pedigree and if any of the guests chanced by accident to allude to their ancestors they spoke of them as members of the family who at an early period of their lives were engaged in mercantile pursuits

at such dinners mrs thomas would sit for hours mumbling dishes that disagreed with her smiling at conversations carried on in villanous french of which language she did not understand a word and admiring the manners of addleheaded young men who got tipsy at her evening parties because they had been to europe and were therefore considered quite men of the world these parties and dinners she could not be induced to forego although the late hours and fatigue consequent thereon would place her on the sicklist for several days afterwards as soon however as she recovered sufficiently to resume her place at the table she would console herself with a dinner of boiled mutton and roasted turnips as a slight compensation for the unwholesome french dishes she had compelled herself to swallow on the occasions before mentioned

amongst the other modern fashions she had adopted was that of setting apart one morning of the week for the reception of visitors and she had mortally offended several of her oldest friends by obstinately refusing to admit them at any other time two or three difficulties had occurred with robberts in consequence of this new arrangement as he could not be brought to see the propriety of saying to visitors that mrs thomas was  not at home when he knew she was at that very moment upstairs peeping over the banisters his obstinacy on this point had induced her to try whether she could not train charlie so as to fit him for the important office of uttering the fashionable and truthless  not at home 

with unhesitating gravity and decorum and after a series of mishaps she at last believed her object was effected until an unlucky occurrence convinced her to the contrary

mrs thomas during the days on which she did not receive company would have presented to any one who might have had the honour to see that venerable lady an entirely different appearance to that which she assumed on gala days

a white handkerchief supplied the place of the curling wig and the tasty french cap was replaced by a muslin one decorated with an immense border of ruffling that flapped up and down over her silver spectacles in the most comical manner possible a short flannel gown and a dimity petticoat of very antique pattern and scanty dimensions completed her costume thus attired and provided with a duster she would make unexpected sallies into the various domestic departments to see that everything was being properly conducted and that no malpractices were perpetrated at times when it was supposed she was elsewhere she showed an intuitive knowledge of all traps set to give intimation of her approach and would come upon aunt rachel so stealthily as to induce her to declare  dat old mrs thomas put her more in mind of a ghost dan of any other libin animal

one morning whilst attired in the manner described mrs thomas had been particularly active in her excursions through the house and had driven the servants to their wits ends by her frequent descents upon them at the most unexpected times thereby effectually depriving them of the short breathing intervals they were anxious to enjoy charlie in particular had been greatly harassed by her and was sent flying from place to place until his legs were nearly run off as he expressed it and so when lord cutanrun who was travelling in america to give his estates in england an opportunity to recuperate presented his card charlie in revenge showed him into the drawingroom where he knew that mrs thomas was busily engaged trimming an oillamp

relying on the explicit order she had given to say that she was not at home she did not even look up when his lordship entered and as he advanced towards her she extended to him a basin of dirty water saying here take this

receiving no response she looked up and to her astonishment and horror beheld not charlie but lord cutanrun

in the agitation consequent upon his unexpected appearance she dropped the basin the contents of which splashing in all directions sadly discoloured his lordships light pants and greatly damaged the elegant carpet

oh my lord she exclaimed i didntâcouldntâ wouldntâ and unable to ejaculate further she fairly ran out of the apartment into the entry where she nearly fell over charlie who was enjoying the confusion his conduct had created  oh you limbâyou little wretch  said she  you knew i was not at home 

 why where are you now   he asked with the most provoking air of innocence  if you aint in the house now you never was

 if ever mind sir said she  never mind ill settle with you for this dont stand there grinning at me go upstairs and tell mrs morton to come down immediately and then get something to wipe up that water o dear my beautiful carpet  and for a lord to see me in such a plight 

oh its abominable ill give it to you you scamp you did it on purpose continued the indignant mrs thomas

 dont deny itâi know you did what are you standing there for why dont you call mrs morton  she concluded as charlie chuckling over the result of his trick walked leisurely upstairs  that boy will be the death of me she afterwards said on relating the occurrence to her daughter just to think after all the trouble ive had teaching him when to admit people and when not that he should serve me such a trick im confident he did it purposely alas for poor mrs thomas this was only the first of a series of annoyances that charlie had in store with which to test her patience and effect his own deliverance

a few days after one of their grand dinners was to take place and charlie had been revolving in his mind the possibility of his finding some opportunity on that occasion to remove the old ladys wig feeling confident that could he accomplish that feat he would be permitted to turn his back for ever on the mansion of mrs thomas

never had mrs thomas appeared more radiant than at this dinner all the guests whose attendance she had most desired were present a new set of china had lately arrived from paris and she was in full anticipation of a grand triumph now to charlie had been assigned the important duty of removing the cover from the souptureen which was placed before his mistress and the little rogue had settled upon that moment as the most favourable for the execution of his purpose he therefore secretly affixed a nicely crooked pin to the elbow of his sleeve and as he lifted the cover adroitly hooked it into her cap to which he knew the wig was fastened and in a twinkling had it off her head and before she could recover from her astonishment and lay down the soupladle he had left the room the guests stared and tittered at the grotesque figure she presentedâher head being covered with short white hair and her face as red as a peony at the mortifying situation in which she was placed

as she rose from her chair charlie presented himself and handed her the wig with an apology for the accident in her haste to put it on she turned it wrong side foremost the laughter of the guests could now no longer be restrained and in the midst of it mrs thomas left the room encountering charlie as she went she almost demolished him in her wrath not ceasing to belabour him till his outcries became so loud as to render her fearful that he would alarm the guests and she then retired to her room where she remained until the party broke up

it was her custom after these grand entertainments to make nocturnal surreys of the kitchen to assure herself that none of the delicacies had been secreted by the servants for their personal use and refreshment charlie aware of this took his measures for an ample revenge for the beating he had received at her hands at night when all the rest of the family had retired he hastily descended to the kitchen and by some process known only to himself imprisoned the cat in a stone jar that always stood upon the dresser and into which he was confident mrs thomas would peep he then stationed himself upon the stairs to watch the result

he had not long to wait for as soon as she thought the servants were asleep she came softly into the kitchen and after peering about in various places she at last lifted up the lid of the jar tom tired of his long confinement sprang out and in so doing knocked the lamp out of her hand the fluid from which ignited and ran over the floor

 murderâfireâwatch  screamed the thoroughly frightened old woman  oh help help fire  at this terrible noise nearly every one in the household was aroused and hurried to the spot whence it proceeded they found mrs thomas standing in the dark with the lid of the jar in her hand herself the personification of terror the carpet was badly burned in several places and the fragments of the lamp were scattered about the floor

 what has happened   exclaimed mr morton who was the first to enter the kitchen  what is all this frightful noise occasioned by  

 oh there is a man in the house   answered mrs thomas her teeth chattering with fright  there was a man in here âhe has just sprung out she continued pointing to the breadjar

 pooh poohâthats nonsense madam replied the soninlaw  why an infant could not get in there much less a man 

 i tell you it was a man then angrily responded mrs

thomas   and he is in the house somewhere now

 such absurdity   muttered mr morton  adding in a louder tone   why my dear mamma youve seen a mouse or something of the kind

mouse indeed interrupted the old lady do you think im in my dotage and i dont know a man from a mouse  

just then the cat whose back had got severely singed in the mãªlãe set up a most lamentable caterwauling  and on being brought to light from the depths of a closet into which he had flown his appearance immediately discovered the share he had had in the transaction

 it must have been the cat said robberts  only look at his backâwhy here the fur is singed off him  ill bet anything continued he that air boy has had something to do with thisâfor its a clear case that the cat couldnt git into the jar and then put the lid on hissef

toms inability to accomplish this feat being most readily admitted on all sides inquiry was immediately made as to the whereabouts of charlie his absence from the scene being rather considered as evidence of participation for it was argued if he had been unaware of what was to transpire the noise would have drawn him to the spot at once as he was always the first at hand in the event of any excitement robberts was despatched to see if he was in his bed and returned with the intelligence that the bed had not even been opened

search was immediately instituted and he was discovered in the closet at the foot of the stairs he was dragged forth shaken pummelled and sent to bed with the assurance that his mother should be sent for in the morning to take him home and keep him there this being exactly the point to which he was desirous of bringing matters he went to bed and passed a most agreeable night

aunt rachel being one of those sleepers that nothing short of an earthquake can rouse until their customary time for awaking had slept soundly through the stirring events of the past night she came down in the morning in quite a placid state of mind expecting to enjoy a day of rest as she had the night before sat up much beyond her usual time to set matters to rights after the confusion consequent on the dinner party

what was her astonishment therefore on finding the kitchen she had left in a state of perfect order and cleanliness in a condition that resembled the preparation for an annual housecleaning

 lord bless us   she exclaimed looking round  what on yarth has happened  i raly blieve deres bin a fire in dis ere house and i never knowed a word of it why i might have bin burnt up in my own bed deres de lamp brokeâcarpet burntâpots and skillets hauled out of the closetâebery ting turned upside down why deres bin a reglar sturbance down here she continued as she surveyed the apartment

at this juncture she espied tom who sat licking his paws before the fire and presenting so altered an appearance from the events of the night as to have rendered him unrecognizable even by his best friend

 strange cat in de house i making himself quite at home at dat said aunt rachel indignantly her wrath already much excited rose to the boiling point at what she deemed a most daring invasion of her domain she therefore without ceremony raised a broom with which she belaboured the astonished tom who ran frantically from under one chair to another till he ensconced himself in a small closet from which he pertinaciously refused to be dislodged

 wont come out of dere wont you   said she ill see if i cant make you den   and poor tom dodged behind pots and kettles to avoid the blows which were aimed at him at last thoroughly enraged by a hard knock on the back he sprang fiercely into the face of his tormentor who completely upset by the suddenness of his attack fell sprawling on the floor screaming loudly for help she was raised up by robberts who came running to her assistance and on being questioned as to the cause of her outcries repliedâ  deres a strange cat in de houseâwild cat too i raly blieve  and spying tom at that moment beneath the table she made another dash at him for a renewal of hostilities

 why thats tom exclaimed robberts  dont you know your own cat  

 oh she replied  dat ar isnt tom now is it  why whats the matter wid him  

robberts then gave her a detailed account of the transactions of the previous night in which account the share charlie had taken was greatly enlarged and embellished and the wrathful old woman was listening to the conclusion when charlie entered hardly had he got into the room when without any preliminary discussion aunt rachelâto use her own wordsâpitched into him to give him particular fits now charlie not being disposed to receive  particular fits made some efforts to return the hard compliments that were being showered upon him and the advice of kinch providentially occurring to himârespecting an attack upon the understanding of his venerable antagonistâhe brought his hard shoes down with great force upon her pet corn and by this coup de pied completely demolished her with a loud scream she let him go and sitting down upon the floor declared herself lamed for life beyond the possibility of recovery at this stage of the proceedings robberts came to the rescue of his aged coadjutor and seized hold of charlie who forthwith commenced so brisk an attack upon his rheumatic shins as to cause him to beat a hurried retreat leaving charlie sole master of the field the noise that these scuffles occasioned brought mrs thomas into the kitchen and charlie was marched off by her into an upstairs room where he was kept in  durance vile  until the arrival of his mother

mrs thomas had a strong liking for charlieânot as a boy but as a footman he was active and intelligent and until quite recently extremely tractable and obedient more than all he was a very goodlooking boy and when dressed in the thomas livery presented a highlyrespectable appearance she therefore determined to be magnanimous â to look over past events and to show a christian and forgiving spirit towards his delinquencies she sent for mrs ellis with the intention of desiring her to use her maternal influence to induce him to apologize to aunt rachel for his assault upon her corns which apology mrs thomas was willing to guarantee should be accepted as for the indignities that had been inflicted on herself she thought it most politic to regard them in the light of accidents and to say as little about that part of the affair as possible

when mrs ellis made her appearance on the day subsequent to the events just narrated mrs thomas enlarged to her upon the serious damage that aunt rachel had received and the urgent necessity that something should be done to mollify that important individual when charlie was brought into the presence of his mother and mrs thomas the latter informed him that wicked as had been his conduct towards herself she was willing for his mothers sake to look over it hut that he must humble himself in dust and ashes before the reigning sovereign of the culinary kingdom who making the most of the injury inflicted on her toe had declared herself unfit for service and was at that moment ensconced in a large easychair listening to the music of her favourite smokejack whilst a temporary cook was getting up the dinner under her immediate supervision and direction

 charlie im quite ashamed of you said his mother after listening to mrs thomass lengthy statement  what has come over you child  âcharlie stood biting his nails and looking very sullen but vouchsafed them no answerâmrs

thomas is so kind as to forgive you and says she will look over the whole affair if you will beg aunt rachels pardon

come now continued mrs ellis coaxingly  do thats a good boy

yes do added mrs thomas and i will buy you a handsome new suit of livery

this was too much for charlie the promise of another suit of the detested livery quite overcame him and he burst into tears

 why what ails the boy  hes the most incomprehensible child i ever saw  the idea of crying at the promise of a new suit of clothesâany other child would have been delighted

concluded mrs thomas

 i dont want your old buttoncovered uniform said charlie  and i wont wear it neither and as for aunt rachel i dont care how much she is hurtâim only sorry i didnt smash her other toe  and ill see her skinned and be skinned myself before ill ask her pardon  

both mrs thomas and charlies mother stood aghast at this unexpected declaration  and the result of a long conference held by the two was that charlie should be taken home mrs ellis being unable to withstand his tears and entreaties

as he passed through the kitchen on his way out he made a face at aunt rachel who in return threw at him one of the turnips she was peeling it missed the object for which it was intended and came plump into the eye of robberts giving to that respectable individual for some time thereafter the appearance of a prizefighter in livery

charlie started for home in the highest spirits which however became considerably lower on his discovering his mothers view of his late exploits was very different from his own mrs elliss fondness and admiration of her son although almost amounting to weakness were yet insufficient to prevent her from feeling that his conduct even after making due allowance for the provocation he had received could not be wholly excused as mere boyish impetuosity and love of mischievous fun she knew that his father would feel it his duty not only to reprimand him but to inflict some chastisement and this thought was the more painful to her from the consciousness that but for her own weak compliance with mrs thomass request her boy would not have been placed in circumstances which his judgment and selfcommand had proved insufficient to carry him through the day therefore passed less agreeably than charlie had anticipated for now that he was removed from the scene of his trials he could not disguise from himself that his behaviour under them had been very different from what it ought to have been and this had the salutary effect of bringing him into a somewhat humbler frame of mind when his father returned in the evening therefore charlie appeared so crestfallen that even caddy could scarely help commiserating him especially as his subdued state during the day had kept him from committing any of those offences against tidiness which so frequently exasperated her mr ellis though very strict on what he thought points of duty had much command of temper and was an affectionate father he listened therefore with attention to the details of charlies grievances as well as of his misdemeanours and some credit is due to him for the unshaken gravity he preserved throughout although he secretly acquitted his son of any really bad intention he thought it incumbent on him to make charlie feel in some degree the evil consequences of his unruly behaviour after giving him a serious lecture and pointing out the impropriety of taking such measures to deliver himself from the bondage in which his parents themselves had thought fit to place him without even appealing to them he insisted on his making the apologies due both to mrs thomas and aunt rachel although he was fully aware that both had only got their deserts and farther intimated that he would not be reinstated in his parents good graces until he had proved by his good conduct and docility that he was really sorry for his misbehaviour it was a severe trial to charlie to make these apologies but he well knew that what his father had decided upon must be doneâso he made a virtue of necessity and accompanied by his mother on the following day performed his penance with as good a grace as he was able and in consideration of this submission his father when he came home in the evening greeted him with all his usual kindness and the recollection of this unlucky affair was at once banished from the family circle

since the receipt of mr garies letter mrs ellis and caddy had been busily engaged in putting the house in a state of preparation for their reception caddy whilst superintending its decoration felt herself in elysium for the first time in her life she had the supreme satisfaction of having two unfortunate housecleaners entirely at her disposal consequently she drove them about and worried them to an extent unparalleled in any of their former experience she sought for and discovered on the windows which they had fondly regarded as miracles of cleanliness sundry streaks and smears and detected infinite small spots of paint and whitewash on the newlyscrubbed floors she followed them upstairs and downstairs and tormented them to that extent that charlie gave it as his private opinion that he should not be in the least surprised on going up there to find that the two old women had made away with caddy and hidden her remains in the coalbin whilst she was thus engaged to charlie was assigned the duty of transporting to winterstreet her diurnal portion of food without a hearty share of which she found it impossible to maintain herself in a state of efficiency her labours in chasing the women about the house being of a rather exhausting nature

when he made the visits in question charlie was generally reconnoitred by his sister from a window over the door and was compelled to put his shoes through a system of purification devised by her for his especial benefit it consisted of three courses of scraper and two of mat this being considered by her as strictly necessary to bring his shoes to such a state of cleanliness as would entitle him to admission into the premises of which she was the temporary mistress

charlie on two or three occasions finding a window open made stealthy descents upon the premises without first having duly observed these quarantine regulations  whereupon he was attacked by caddy who with the assistance of the minions under her command so shook and pummelled him as to cause his precipitate retreat through the same opening by which he had entered and that too in so short a space of time as to make the whole manoeuvre appear to him in the light of a wellexecuted but involuntary feat of ground and lofty tumbling one afternoon he started with his sisters dinner consisting of a dish of which she was particularly fond and its arrival was therefore looked for with unusual anxiety

charlie having gorged himself to an almost alarming extent did not make the haste that the case evidently demanded and as he several times stopped to act as umpire in disputed games of marbles in the rules of which he was regarded as an authority he necessarily consumed a great deal of time on the way

caddys patience was severely tried by the long delay and her temper at no time the most amiable gathered bitterness from the unprecedented length of her fast therefore when he at length appeared walking leisurely up winterstreet swinging the kettle about in the most reckless manner and setting it down on the pavement to play leapfrog over the fireplugs her wrath reached a point that boded no good to the young trifler

now whilst charlie had been giving his attention to the difficulties growing out of the games of marbles he did not observe that one of the disputants was possessed of a tin kettle in appearance very similar to his own by the side of which in the excitement of the moment he deposited his own whilst giving a practical illustration of his view of the point under consideration having accomplished this to his entire satisfaction he resumed what he supposed was his kettle and went his way rejoicing

now if caddy ellis had a fondness for one dish more than any other it was for haricot with plenty of carrots and knowing she was to have this for her dinner she to use her own pointed expression  had laid herself out to have a good meal she had even abstained from her customary lunch that she might have an appetite worthy of the occasion and accordingly long ere the dinner hour approached she was hungry as a wolf notwithstanding this fact when charlie made his appearance at the door she insisted on his going through all the accustomed forms with the mat and scraper before entering the house  an act of selfsacrifice on her part entirely uncalled for as the day was remarkably fine and charlies boots unusually clean

he received two or three by no means gentle shoves and pokes as he entered which he bore with unusual indifference making not the slightest effort at retaliation as was his usual practice the fact is charlie was as lions are supposed to be quite disinclined for a fight after a hearty meal so he followed caddy upstairs to the second story here she had got up an extempore diningtable by placing a pasting board across two chairs seating herself upon a stool she jerked off the lid of the kettle and to her horror and dismay found not the favourite haricot but a piece of cheeserind a crust of dry bread and a cold potatoe charlie who was amusing himself by examining the flowers in the new carpet did not observe the look of surprise and disgust that came over the countenance of his sister as she took out piece by piece the remains of some schoolboys repast

 look here she at last burst forth  do you call this my dinner  

yes said charlie in a deliberate tone  and a very good one too i should say  if you cant eat that dinner you ought to starve its one of mothers best haricots

 you dont call this cold potatoe and cheeserind haricot do you   asked caddy angrily

at this charlie looked up and saw before her the refuse scraps which she had indignantly emptied upon the table

he could scarcely believe his eyes  he got up and looked in the kettle but found no haricot  well said he with surprise  if that dont beat me i saw mother fill it with haricot myself im clean beat about it

 tell me what youve done with it then almost screamed the angry girl

 i really dont know what has become of it he answered with a bewildered air  i sawâi sawâiâi

 you sawâyou saw replied the indignant caddy imitating his tone and taking up the kettle she began to examine it more closely  why this isnt even our kettle look at this lid im sure its not ours youve been stopping somewhere to play and exchanged it with some other boy thats just what youve done

just then it occurred to charlie that at the place where he had adjusted the dispute about the marbles he had observed in the hands of one of the boys a kettle similar to his own and it flashed across his mind that he had then and there made the unfortunate exchange he broke his suspicion to caddy in the gentlest manner at the same time edging his way to the door to escape the storm that he saw was brewing

the loss of her dinnerâand of such a dinnerâso enraged the hungry girl as to cause her to seize a brush lying near and begin to belabour him without mercy in his endeavour to escape from her his foot was caught in the carpet and he was violently precipitated down the long flight of stairs his screams brought the whole party to his assistance even lunch who was sitting on the step outside threw off his usual dread of caddy and rushed into the house  oh take me up piteously cried charlie  oh take me up im almost killed in raising him one of the old women took hold of his arm which caused him to scream again  dont touch my arm please dont touch my arm  im sure its broke

 no no its not broke only sprained or a little twisted 

said she and seizing it as she spoke she gave it a pull and a wrench for the purpose of making it all right again at this charlies face turned deathly pale and he fainted outright

hun for a doctor cried the now thoroughlyalarmed caddy  run for the doctor my brothers dead  and bursting into tears she exclaimed  oh ive killed my brother ive killed my brother 

dont make so much fuss child soothingly replied one of the old women   hes worth half a dozen dead folk yet

lor bless you child hes only fainted

water was procured and thrown in his face and before kinch returned with the doctor he was quite restored to consciousness

 dont cry my little man said the physician as he took out his knife and ripped up the sleeve of charlies coat  dont cry let me examine your arm stripping up the shirtsleeve he felt it carefully over and shaking his head physicians always shake their heads pronounced the arm broken and that too in an extremely bad place at this information charlie began again to cry and caddy broke forth into such yells of despair as almost to drive them distracted

the physician kindly procured a carriage and saw charlie comfortably placed therein and held in the arms of elinch with the lamenting and disheartened caddy on the opposite beat he was slowly driven home the house was quite thrown into confusion by their arrival under such circumstances mrs ellis for a wonder did not faint but proceeded at once to do what was necessary mr ellis was sent for and he immediately despatched kinch for dr burdett their family physician who came without a moments delay he examined charlies arm and at first thought it would be necessary to amputate it at the mere mention of the word amputate caddy set up such a series of lamentable howls as to cause her immediate ejectment from the apartment dr

burdett called in dr diggs for a consultation and between them it was decided that an attempt should be made to save the injured member now charlie said dr burdett  im afraid we must hurt you my boyâbut if you have any desire to keep this arm you must try to bear it

 ill bear anything to save my arm doctor i cant spare that said he manfully  ill want it byandby to help take care of mother and the girls

 youre a brave little fellow said dr diggs patting him on the head  so then well go at it at once

 stop cried charlie let mother put her arm round my neck so and es you hold the good band now then im all rightâfire away   and clenching his lips hard he waited for the doctor to commence the operation of setting his arm

charlies mother tried to look as stoical as possible but the corners of her mouth would twitch and there was a nervous trembling of her underlip  but she commanded herself and only when charlie gave a slight groan of pain stooped and kissed his forehead and when she raised her head again there was a tear resting on the face of her son that was not his own

esther was the picture of despair and she wept bitterly for the misfortune which had befallen her pet brother and when the operation was over refused to answer poor caddys questions respecting charlies injuries and scolded her with a warmth and volubility that was quite surprising to them all

 you must not be too hard on caddy remarked mr

ellis  she feels bad enough ill warrant you it is a lesson that will not i trust be thrown away upon her it will teach her to command her temper in future

caddy was in truth quite crushed by the misfortune she had occasioned and fell into such a state of depression and apathy as to be scarcely heard about the house indeed so subdued was she that kinch went in and out without wiping his feet and tracked the mud all over the staircarpet and yet she uttered no word of remonstrance

poor little charlie suffered much and was in a high fever

the knocker was tied up the windows darkened and all walked about the house with sad and anxious countenances

day after day the fever increased until he grew delirious and raved in the most distressing manner the unfortunate haricot was still on his mind and he was persecuted by men with strangeshaped heads and carrot eyes sometimes he imagined himself pursued by caddy and would cry in the most piteous manner to have her prevented from beating him then his mind strayed off to the marbleground where he would play imaginary games and laugh over his success in such a wild and frightful manner as to draw tears from the eye of all around him he was greatly changed the bright colour had fled from his cheek his head had been shaved and he was thin and wan and at times they were obliged to watch him and restrain him from tossing about to the great peril of his broken arm

at last his situation became so critical that dr burdett began to entertain but slight hopes of his recovery  and one morning in the presence of caddy hinted as much to mr ellis

 oh doctor doctor exclaimed the distracted girl  dont say that oh try and save him how could i live with the thought that i had killed my brother oh i cant live a day if he dies  will god ever forgive me  oh what a wretch i have been  oh do think of something that will help him

he mustnt die you must save him   and crying passionately she threw herself on the floor in an agony of grief they did their best to pacify her but all their efforts were in vain until mr ellis suggested that since she could not control her feelings she must be sent to stay with her aunt as her lamentations and outcries agitated her suffering brother and made his condition worse the idea of being excluded from the family circle at such a moment had more effect on caddy than all previous remonstrances she implored to have the sentence suspended for a time at least that she might try to exert more selfcommand  and mr ellis who really pitied her well knowing that her heart was not in fault however reprehensible she was in point of temper consented and caddys behaviour from that moment proved the sincerity of her promises  and though she could not quite restrain occasional outbursts of senseless lamentation still when she felt such fits of despair coming on she wisely retired to some remote corner of the house and did not reappear till she had regained her composure

the crisis was at length over and charlie was pronounced out of danger no one was more elated by this announcement than our friend kinch who had in fact grown quite ashy in his complexion from confinement and grief and was now thrown by this intelligence into the highest possible spirits charlie although faint and weak was able to recognize his friends and derived great satisfaction from the various devices of kinch to entertain him that young gentleman quite distinguished himself by the variety and extent of his resources he devised butting matches between himself and a large gourd which he suspended from the ceiling and almost blinded himself by his attempts to butt it sufficiently hard to cause it to rebound to the utmost length of the string and might have made an idiot of himself for ever by his exertions but for the timely interference of mr ellis who put a final stop to this diversion then he dressed himself in a short gown and nightcap and made the pillow into a baby and played the nurse with it to such perfection that charlie felt obliged to applaud by knocking with the knuckles of his best hand upon the headboard of his bedstead on the whole he was so overjoyed as to be led to commit all manner of eccentricities and conducted himself generally in such a ridiculous manner that charlie laughed himself into a state of prostration and kinch was in consequence banished from the sickroom to be readmitted only on giving his promise to abstain from being as funny as he could any more after the lapse of a short time charlie was permitted to sit up and held regular levies of his schoolmates and little friends he declared it was quite a luxury to have a broken arm as it was a source of so much amusement the old ladies brought him jellies and blancmange and he was petted and caressed to such an unparalleled extent as to cause his delighted mother to aver that she lived in great fear of his being spoiled beyond remedy at length he was permitted to come downstairs and sit by the window for a few hours each day whilst thus amusing himself one morning a handsome carriage stopped before their house and from it descended a fat and benevolentlooking old lady who knocked at the door and rattled the latch as if she had been in the daily habit of visiting there and felt quite sure of a hearty welcome she was let in by esther and on sitting down asked if mrs ellis was at home whilst esther was gone to summon her mother the lady looked round the room and espying charlie said  oh there you areâim glad to see you  i hope you are improving

 yes maam politely replied charlie wondering all the time who their visitor could be

 you dont seem to remember meâyou ought to do so children seldom forget any one who makes them a pleasant promise

as she spoke a glimmer of recollection shot across charlies mind and he exclaimed  you are the lady who came to visit the school

yes and i promised you a book for your aptness and

continued she taking from her reticule a splendidlybound copy of robinson crusoe here it is

mrs ellis as soon as she was informed that a stranger lady was below left caddy to superintend alone the whitewashing of charlies sickroom and having hastily donned another gown and a more tasty cap descended to see who the visitor could be

 you must excuse my not rising said mrs bird for that was the ladys name   it is rather a difficulty for me to get up and down oftenâso continued she with a smile  you must excuse my seeming rudeness

mrs ellis answered that any apology was entirely unnecessary and begged she would keep her seat

 ive come said mrs bird  to pay your little man a visit i was so much pleased with the manner in which he recited his exercises on the day of examination that i promised him a book and on going to the school to present it i heard of his unfortunate accident he looks very much changedâhe has had a very severe time i presume  

 yes a very severe one we had almost given him over but it pleased god to restore him replied mrs ellis in a thankful tone  he is very weak yet bhe continued  and it will be a long time before he is entirely recovered

 who is your physician   asked mrs bird

 doctor burdett was the reply  he has been our physician for years and is a very kind friend of our family

 and of mine too rejoined mrs bird  he visits my house every summer what does he think of the arm  she asked

 he thinks in time it will be as strong as ever and re  commends sending charlie into the country for the summer but said mrs ellis  we are quite at a loss where to send him

oh let me take him said mrs birdâi should be delighted to have him ive got a beautiful placeâhe can have a horse to ride and there are wide fields to scamper over only let me have him and ill guarantee to restore him to health in a short time

youre very kind replied mrs ellisâim afraid he would only be a burthen to youâbe a great deal of trouble and be able to do but little work

 work why dear woman replied mrs bird with some astonishment  i dont want him to workâive plenty of servants i only want him to enjoy himself and gather as much strength as possible come make up your mind to let him go with me and ill send him home as stout as i am

at the bare idea of charlies being brought to such a state of obesity kinch who during the interview had been in the back part of the room making all manner of faces was obliged to leave the apartment to prevent a serious explosion of laughter and after their visitor had departed he was found rolling about the floor in a tempest of mirth

after considerable conversation relative to the project mrs

bird took her leave promising to call soon again and advising mrs ellis to accept her offer mrs ellis consulted dr

burdett who pronounced it a most fortunate circumstance and said the boy could not be in better hands and as charlie appeared nothing loth it was decided he should go to warmouth to the great grief of kinch who thought it a most unheardof proceeding and he regarded mrs bird thenceforth as his personal enemy and a wilful disturber of his peace

the time for the departure of the gariea haring been fixed all in the house were soon engaged in the bustle of preparation boxes were packed with books pictures and linen  plate and china were wrapped and swaddled to prerant breakage and bruises carpets were taken up and packed away  curtains taken down and lookingglasses corered only a small part of the house was left in a furnished state for the use of the overseer who was a young bachelor and did not require much space

in superintending all these arrangements mrs garie displayed great activity her former cheerfulness of manner had entirely returned and mr garie often listened with delight to the quick pattering of her feet as she tripped lightly through the hall and up and down the long stairs the birds that sang about the windows were not more cheerful than herself and when mr garie heard her merry voice singing her lively songs as in days gone by he experienced a feeling of satisfaction at the pleasant result of his acquiescence in her wishes he had consented to it as an act of justice due to her and the children there was no pleasure to himself growing out of the intended change beyond that of gratifying emily and securing freedom to her and the children he knew enough of the north to feel convinced that he could not expect to live there openly with emily without being exposed to illnatured comments and closing upon himself the doors of many friends who had formerly received him with open arms the virtuous dignity of the northerner would be shocked not so much at his having children by a woman of colour but by his living with her in the midst of them and acknowledging her as his wife in the community where he now resided such things were more common the only point in which he differed from many other southern gentlemen in this matter was in his constancy to emily and the children and the more than ordinary kindness and affection with which he treated them mr garie had for many years led a very retired life receiving an occasional gentleman visitor but this retirement had been entirely voluntary therefore by no means disagreeable but in the new home he had accepted he felt that he might be shunned and the reflection was anything but agreeable

moreover he was about to leave a place endeared to him by a thousand associations here he had passed the whole of his life except about four years spent in travelling through europe and america

mr garie was seated in a room where there were many things to recall days long since departed the desk at which he was writing was once his fathers and he well remembered the methodical manner in which every drawer was carefully kept over it hung a fulllength portrait of his mother and it seemed as he gazed at it that it was only yesterday that she had taken his little hand in her own and talked with him down the long avenue of magnolias that were waving their flowerspangled branches in the morning breeze and loading it with fragrance near him was the table on which her workbasket used to stand he remembered how important he felt when permitted to hold the skeins of silk for her to wind and how he would watch her stitch stitch hour after hour at the screen that now stood beside the fireplace the colours were faded but the recollection of the pleasant smiles she would cast upon him from time to time as she looked up from her work was as fresh in his memory as if it were but yesterday mr garie was assorting and arranging the papers that the desk contained when he heard the rattle of wheels along the avenue and looking out of the window he saw a carriage approaching

the coachman was guiding his horses with one hand and with the other he was endeavouring to keep a large oldfashioned trunk from falling from the top this was by no means an easy matter as the horses appeared quite restive and fully required his undivided attention the rather unsteady motion of the carriage caused its inmate to put his head out of the window and mr garie recognized his uncle john who lived in the northwestern part of the state on the borders of alabama he immediately left his desk and hastened to the door to receive him

 this is an unexpected visit but none the less pleasant on that account said mr garie his face lighting up with surprise and pleasure as uncle john alighted  i had not the least expectation of being honoured by a visit from you

what has brought you into this part of the country

business of course  i cant conceive it possible that you should have ventured so far from home at this early season for the mere purpose of paying me a visit

you may take all the honour to yourself this time

smilingly replied uncle john  for i have come over for your especial benefit and if i accomplish the object of my journey i shall consider the time anything but thrown away

 let me take your coat and eph see you to that trunk

said mr garie  you see everything is topsyturvy with us uncle john we look like moving dont we  

 like that or an annual housecleaning he replied as he picked his way through rolls of carpet and matting and between halfpacked boxes in doing which he had several narrow escapes from the nails that protruded from them on all sides  its getting very warm let me have something to drink said he wiping his face as he took his seat  a julepâplenty of brandy and ice and but little mint

eph on receiving this order departed in great haste in search of mrs garie as he knew that whilst concocting one julep she might be prevailed upon to mix another and eph had himself a warm liking for that peculiar southern mixture which liking he never lost any opportunity to gratify

emily hurried downstairs on hearing of the arrival of uncle john for he was regarded by her as a friend she had always received from him marked kindness and respect and upon the arrival of mr garies visitors there was none she received with as much pleasure quickly mixing the drink she carried it into the room where he and her husband were sitting she was warmly greeted by the kindhearted old man who in reply to her question if he had come to make them a farewell visit said he hoped not he trusted to make them many more in the same place

 im afraid you wont have an opportunity she replied

in less than a week we expect to be on our way to new yorkâi must go continued she  and have a room prepared for you and hunt up the children youll scarcely know them they have grown so much since you were here

ill soon send them and she hurried off to make uncle johns room comfortable

 i was never more surprised in my life said the old gentleman depositing the glass upon the table after draining  it of its contentsâ never more surprised than when i received your letter in which you stated your intention of going to the north to live a more ridiculous whim it is impossible to conceiveâthe idea is perfectly absurd to leave a fine old place like this where you have everything around you so nice and comfortable to go north and settle amongst a parcel of strange yankees my dear boy you must give it up im no longer your guardianâthe law dont provide one for people of thirty years and upwardsâso it is out of my power to say you shall not do it but i am here to use all my powers of persuasion to induce you to relinquish the project

uncle john you dont seem to understand the matter

it is not a whim by any meansâit is a determination arising from a strict sense of duty i feel that it is an act of justice to emily and the children i dont pretend to be better than moat men but my conscience will not permit me to be the owner of my own flesh and blood im going north because i wish to emancipate and educate my childrenâyou know i cant do it here at first i was as disinclined to favour the project as you are but i am now convinced it is my duty and i must add that my inclination runs in the same direction

look here clarence my boy here interrupted uncle john you cant expect to live there as you do here the prejudice against persons of colour i much stronger in some of the northern cities than it is amongst us southerners

you cant live with emily there as you do here  you will be in everybodys mouth you wont be able to sustain your old connections with your northern friendsâyoull find that they will cut you dead

ive looked at it well uncle john ive counted the cost and have made up my mind to meet with many disagreeable things if my old friends choose to turn their backs on me because my wife happens to belong to an oppressed race that is not my fault i dont feel that i have committed any sin by making the choice i have and so their conduct or opinions wont influence my happiness much

listen to me clary for a moment rejoined the old gentleman  as long as you live here in georgia you can sustain your present connection with impunity and if you should ever want to break it off you could do so by sending her and the children away it would be no more than other men have done and are doing every day but go to the north and it becomes a different thing your connection with emily will inevitably become a matter of notoriety and then you would find it difficult to shake her off there as you could here in case you wanted to marry another woman

 oh uncle uncle how can you speak so indifferently about my doing such an ungenerous act to characterize it in the very mildest terms i feel that emily is as much my wife in the eyes of god as if a thousand clergymen had united us it is not my fault that we are not legally married it is the fault of the laws my father did not feel that my mother was any more his wife than i do that emily is mine

 hush hush that is all nonsense boy  and besides it is paying a very poor compliment to your mother to rank her with your mulatto mistress i like emily very much she has been kind affectionate and faithful to you yet i really cant see the propriety of your making a shipwreck of your whole life on her account how continued uncle john with great earnestness  i hoped for better things from you you have talents and wealth  you belong to one of the oldest and best families in the state when i am gone you will be the last of our name i had hoped that you would have done something to keep it from sinking into obscurity there is no honour in the state to which you might not have aspired with a fair chance of success  but if you carry out your absurd determination you will ruin yourself effectually

 well i shall be ruined then for i am determined to go

i feel it my duty to carry out my design said mr garie

 well well clary rejoined his uncle  ive done my duty to my brothers son i own that although i cannot agree with you in your project i can and do honour the unselfish motive that prompts it you will always find me your friend under all circumstances and now concluded he  its off my mind

the children were brought in and duly admired a box of miniature carpenters tools was produced also a wonderful man with a string through his waistâwhich string when pulled caused him to throw his arms and legs about in a most astonishing manner the little folks were highly delighted with these presents which uncle john had purchased at augusta they scampered off and soon had every small specimen of sable humanity on the place at their heels in ecstatic admiration of the wonderful articles of which they had so recently acquired possession

as uncle john had absolutely refused all other refreshment than the julep before mentioned dinner was ordered at a much earlier hour than usual he ate very heartily as was his custom  and moreover persisted in stuffing the children as old gentlemen will do sometimes until their mother was compelled to interfere to prevent their having a bilious attack in consequence whilst the gentlemen were sitting over their desert mr garie asked his uncle if he had not a sister with whom there wassome mystery connected

no mystery replied uncle john your aunt made a very low marriage and father cut her off from the family entirely it happened when i was very young she was the eldest of us all there were four of us as you knowâyour father bernard i and this sister of whom we are speaking

she has been dead for some years  she married a carpenter whom father employed on the placeâa poor white man from new york i have heard it said that he was handsome but drunken and vicious they left one childâa boy i believe he is alive in the north somewhere or was a few years bince

 and did she never make any overtures for a reconciliation  

 she did some years before fathers death but he was inexorable he returned her letter and died without seeing or forgiving her replied uncle john

 poor thing i suppose they were very poor  

 i suppose they were i have no sympathy for her she deserved her fate for marrying a greasy mechanic in opposition to her fathers commands when she might have connected herself with any of the highest families in the state

the gentlemen remained a long while that night sipping their wine smoking cigars and discussing the probable result of the contemplated change uncle john seemed to have the worst forebodings as to the ultimate consequences and gave it as his decided opinion that they would all return to the old place in less than a year

youll soon get tired of it said he  everything is so different there here you can get on well in your present relations but mark me youll find nothing but disappointment and trouble where you are going

the next morning he departed for his home he kissed the children affectionately and shook hands warmly with their mother after getting into the carriage he held out his hand again to his nephew saying â l am afraid you are going to be disappointed  but i hope you may not good bye good byeâgod bless you  and his blue eyes looked very watery as he was driven from the door

that day a letter arrived from savannah informing them that the ship in which they had engaged passage would be ready to sail in a few days and they therefore determined that the first instalment of boxes and trunks should be sent to the city forthwith and to eph was assigned the melancholy duty of superintending their removal

let me go with him pa begged little clarence who heard his father giving eph his instructions

 oh no replied mr garie  the cart will be full of goods there will be no room for you

 but pa i can ride my pony and besides you might let me go for i shant have many more chances to ride himâdo let me go

 oh yes massa let him go why dat ar chile can take care of his pony all by hissef you should just seed dem two de oder day you see de pony felt kinder big dat day an tuck a heap o airs on hissef an tried to trow himâ twarnt no goâmassa clary conquered him pletely mighty smart boy dat continued eph looking at little clarence admiringly  mighty smart i let him shoot off my pistol toder day and he put de ball smack through de bulls eyeâ dat boy is gwine to be a perfect ramrod

oh pa laughingly interrupted little clarence ive been telling him of what you read to me about nimrod being a great hunter

 thats quite a mistake eph said mr garie joining in the laugh

 well i knowed it was suffin said eph scratching his head  suffin with a rod to it i was all right on that pint âbut your gwine to let him go aint yer massa 

 i suppose i must replied mr garie   but mind now that no accident occurs to young ramrod

 ill take care o dat said epb who hastened off to prepare the horses followed by the delighted clarence

that evening after his return from savannah clarence kept his little sisters eyes expanded to an unprecedented extent by his narration of the wonderful occurrences attendant on his trip to town and also of what he had seen in the vessel

he produced an immense orange also avast store of almonds and raisins which had been given him by the goodnatured steward  but em said he  we are going to sleep in such funny little places even pa and mamma have got to sleep on little shelves stuck up against the wall and theyve got a thing that swings from the ceiling that they keep the tumblers and wineglasses inâevery glass has got a little hole for itself oh its so nice 

 and have they got any nice shady trees on the ship  

asked the wondering little em

 oh noâwhat nonsense  answered clarence swelling with the importance conferred by his superior knowledge

 why no em who ever heard of such a thing as trees on a ship  they couldnt have trees on a ship if they wantedâ theres no earth for them to grow in but ill tell you what theyve gotâtheyve got masts a great deal higher than any tree and im going to climb clear up to the top when we go to live on the ship

 i wouldnt said em  you might fall down like ben did from the tree and then youd have to have your head sewed up as he had

the probability that an occurrence of this nature might be the result of his attempt to climb the mast seemed to have considerable weight with master clarence so he relieved his sisters mind at once by relinquishing the project

the morning for departure at length arrived eph brought the carriage to the door at an early hour and sat upon the box the picture of despair he did not descend from his eminence to assist in any of the little arrangements for the journey being very fearful that the seat he occupied might be resumed by its rightful owner he having had a lengthy contest with the sable official who acted as coachman and who had striven manfully on this occasion to take possession of his usual elevated station on the family equipage this eph would by no means permit as he declared  he was gwine to let nobody drive massa dat day but hissef

it was a mournful parting the slaves crowded around the carriage kissing and embracing the children and forcing upon them little tokens of remembrance blind jacob the patriarch of the place came and passed his hands over the face of little em for the last time as he had done almost every week since her birth that to use his own language  he might see how de piccaninny growed his bleared  and sightless eyes were turned to heaven to ask a blessing on the little ones and their parents

 why daddy jake you should not take it so hard said mr garie with an attempt at cheerfulness  youll see us all again some day

ho no massa ise feared i wont ise gettin mighty old massa and ise gwine home soon i hopes ill meet you all up yonder said he pointing heavenward i dont spect to see any of you here agin

many of the slaves were in tears and all deeply lamented the departure of their master and his family for mr garie had always been the kindest of owners and mrs garie was if possible more beloved than himself she was first at every sickbed and had been comfortergeneral to all the afflicted and distressed in the place

at last the carriage rolled away and in a few hours they reached savannah and immediately went on board the vessel

mbs ellis had been for some time engaged in arranging and replenishing charlies wardrobe preparatory to his journey to warmouth with mrs bird an entire new suit of grey cloth had been ordered of the tailor to whom mrs

ellis gave strict injunctions not to make them too small

notwithstanding the unfavourable results of several experiments mrs ellis adhered with wonderful tenacity to the idea that a boys clothes could never be made too large and therefore when charlie had a new suit it always appeared as if it had been made for some portly gentleman and sent home to charlie by mistake

this last suit formed no exception to the others and charlie surveyed with dismay its ample dimensions as it hung from the back of the chair  oh gemini  said he  but that jacket is a rouser i tell you what mother youll have to get out a searchwarrant to find me in that jacket now mind i tell you 

 nonsense  replied mrs ellis  it dont look a bit too large  put it on

charlie took up the coat and in a twinkling had it on over his other his hands were almost completely lost in the excessively long sleeves which hung down so far that the tips of his fingers were barely visible oh mother  he exclaimed just look at these sleevesâif such a thing were to happen that any one were to offer me a half dqllar they would change their mind before i could get my hand out to take it and it will almost go twice round me it is so large in the waist

 oh you can turn the sleeves up and as for the waistâ youll soon grow to it it will be tight enough for you before long ill warrant said mrs ellis

 but mother rejoined charlie that is just what you said about the other blue suit and it was entirely worn out before you had let down the tucks in the trowsers

never mind the blue suit persisted mrs ellis entirely unbiassed by this statement of facts  youll grow faster this timeâyoure going into the country you must remember âboys always grow fast in the country go into the other room and try on the trowsers

i charlie retired into another room with the trowsers in question here he was joined by kinch who went into fits of laughter over charlies peajacket as he offensively called the new coat

why charlie said he it fits you like a shirt on a beanpole or rather its like a sentrys boxâit dont touch you any where but get into these pants said he almost  choking with the laughter that charlies vexed look caused him to suppressâget into the pants  at the same time tying a string round charlies neck

what are you doing that for   exclaimed charlie in an irritated tone  i shouldnt have thought you would make fun of me 

 oh said kinch assuming a solemn look  dont they always tie a rope round a mans body when they are going to lower him into a pit  and how on earth do you ever expect we shall find you in the legs of them trowsers unless something is fastened to you  here charlie was obliged to join in the laugh that kinch could no longer restrain

stop that playing boys cried mrs ellis as their noisy mirth reached her in the adjoining room you forget i am waiting for you

charlie hastily drew on the trousers and found that their dimensions fully justified the precaution kinch was desirous of taking to secure him from sinking into oblivion

oh i cant wear these things said charlie tears of taxation starting from his eyes  why they are so large i cant even keep them up  and just look at the legs will youâ theyll have to be turned up a quarter of a yard at least

 here said kinch seizing a large pillow  ill stuff this in oh golly how you look if you aint a sight to see  and he shouted with laughter as he surveyed charlie to whom the pillow had imparted the appearance of a london alderman  if you dont look like squire baker now ill give it up you are as big as old daddy downhill you are a regular daniel lambert 

the idea of looking like squire baker and daddy downhill who were the  fat men  of their acquaintance amused charlie as much as it did his companion and making the house ring with their mirth they entered the room where mr ellis and the girls had joined mrs ellis

 what on earth is the matter with the child  exclaimed mr ellis as he gazed upon the grotesque figure charlie presented what has the boy been doing to himself

hereupon kinch explained how matters stood to the infinite amusement of all parties

 oh ellen said mr ellis you must have them altered  theyre a mile too big for him i really believe they would fit me

 they do look rather large said mrs ellis reluctantly  but it seems such a waste to take them in as he grows bo fast

 he would not grow enough in two years to fill that suit

rejoined mr ellis  and he will have worn them out in less than six months and so to the infinite satisfaction of charlie it was concluded that they should be sent back to the tailors for the evidently necessary alterations

the day for charlies departure at last arrived

einch who had been up since two oclock in the morning was found by caddy at the early hour of five waiting upon 

the doorstep to accompany his friend to the wharf beside him lay a bag in which there appeared to be some living object

 what have you got in here   asked caddy as she gave the bag a punch with the broom she was using

its a present for charlie replied kinch opening the bag and displaying to the astonished gaze of caddy a very young pig

why said she laughing you dont expect he can take that with him do you  

 why not   asked kinch taking up the bag and carrying it into the house its just the thing to take into the country charlie can fatten him and sell him for a lot of money

it was as much as mrs ellis could do to convince charlie and kinch of the impracticability of their scheme of carrying off to warmouth the pig in question she suggested as it was the exclusive property of kinch and he was so exceedingly anxious to make charlie a parting gift that she should purchase it which she did on the spot and kinch invested all the money in a large crossbow wherewith charlie was to shoot game sufficient to supply both kinch and his own parents had charlie been on his way to the scaffold he could not have been followed by a more solemn face than that presented by kinch as he trudged on with him in the rear the porter who carried the trunk

 i wish you were not going said he as he put his arm affectionately over charlies shoulder  i shall be so lonesome when you are gone  and what is more i know i shall get licked every day in school for who will help me with my sums

 oh any of the boys will they all like you kinch and if you only study a little harder you can do them yourself

was charlies encouraging reply

on arriving at the boat they found mrs bird waiting for than so charlie hastily kissed his mother and sisters and made endless promises not to be mischievous and above all to be as tidy as possible then tearing himself away from them and turning to kinch he exclaimed ill be back to see you all again soon so dont cry old fellow and at the game time thrusting his hand into his pocket he drew out a number of marbles which he gave him his own lips quivering all the while at last his attempts to suppress his tears and look like a man grew entirely futile and he cried heartily as mrs bird took his hand and drew him on board the steamer

as it slowly moved from the pier and glided up the river charlie stood looking with tearful eyes at his mother and sisters who with kinch waved their handkerchiefs as long as they could distinguish him and then he saw them move away with the crowd

mrs bird who had been conversing with a lady who accompanied her a short distance on her journey came and took her little protegã by the hand and led him to a seat near her in the after part of the boat informing him as she did so that they would shortly exchange the steamer for the cars and she thought he had better remain near her

after some time they approached the little town where the passengers took the train for new york mrs bird who had taken leave of her friend held charlie fast by the hand and they entered the cars together he looked a little pale and weak from the excitement of parting and the novelty of his situation mrs bird observing his pallid look placed him on a seat and propped him up with shawls and cushions making him as comfortable as possible

the train had not long started when the conductor came through to inspect the tickets and quite started with surprise at seeing charlie stretched at full length upon the velvet cushion  what are you doing here   exclaimed he at the same time shaking him roughly to arouse him from the slight slumber into which he had fallen  come get up you must go out of this

 what do you mean by such conduct   asked mrs bird very much surprised  dont wake him ive got his ticket the child is sick

 i dont care whether hes sick or wellâhe cant ride in here we dont allow niggers to ride in this car no how you can fix itâso come youngster said he gruffly to the now aroused boy  you must travel out of this

 he shall do no such thing replied mrs bird in a decided tone  ive paid full price for his ticket and he shall ride here you have no legal right to eject him

 ive got no time to jaw about rights legal or illegalâall i care to know is that ive my orders not to let niggers ride in these cars and i expect to obey so you see there is no use to make any fuss about it

 charlie said mrs bird  sit here  and she moved aside so as to seat him between herself and the window

 now said she  move him if you think best

 ill tell you what it is old woman doggedly remarked the conductor you cant play that game with me ive made up my mind that no more niggers shall ride in this car and ill have him out of here cost what it may

the passengers now began to cluster around the contending parties and to take sides in the controversy in the end the conductor stopped the train and called in one or two of the irish brakemen to assist him if necessary in enforcing his orders

 you had better let the boy go into the negro car madam

said one of the gentlemen respectfully   it is perfectly useless to contend with these ruffians i saw a coloured man ejected from here last week and severely injured and in the present state of public feeling if anything happened to you or the child you would be entirely without redress

the directors of this railroad control the state and there is no such thing as justice to be obtained in any of the state courts in a matter in which they are concerned if you will accept of my a m i will accompany you to the other carâif you will not permit the child to go there alone you had better go quietly with him

oh what is the use of so much talk about it why dont you hustle the old thing out remarked a bystander the respectability of whose appearance contrasted broadly with his manners  she is some crackbrained abolitionist

making so much fuss about a little nigger let her go into the nigger carâshell be more at home there

mrs bird seeing the uselessness of contention accepted the proffered escort of the gentleman before mentioned and was followed out of the cars by the conductor and his blackguard assistants all of them highly elated by the victory they had won over a defenceless old woman and a feeble little boy

mrs bird shrunk back as they opened the door of the car that had been set apart for coloured persons and such objectionable whites as were not admitted to the firstclass cars

 oh what a wretched place  she exclaimed as she surveyed the rough pine timbers and dirty floor  i would not force a dog to ride in such a filthy place

 oh dont stay here maam  never mind meâi shall get on by myself well enough i dare say said charlie  it is too nasty a place for you to stay in

no my child she replied ill remain with you i could not think of permitting you to be alone in your present state of health i declare she continued  its enough to make any one an abolitionist or anything else of the kind to see how inoffensive coloured people are treated 

that evening they went on board the steamer that was to convey them to warmouth where they arrived very early the following morning

charlie was charmed with the appearance of the pretty little town as they rode through it in mrs birds carriage which awaited them at the landing at the door of her residence they were met by two cherryfaced maids who seemed highly delighted at the arrival of their mistress

 now charlie said mrs bird as she sat down in her large armchair and looked round her snug little parlour with an air of great satisfactionânow we are at home and you must try and make yourself as happy as possible

betsey said she turning to one of the women here is a nice little fellow whom i have brought with me to remain during the summer of whom i want you to take the best care for continued she looking at him compassionately  the poor child has had the misfortune to break his arm recently and he has not been strong since the physician thought the country would be the best place for him and so ive brought him here to stay with us tell eeuben to carry his trunk into the little maple chamber and byandby after i have rested i will take a walk over the place with him

 here are two letters for you said betsey taking them from the mantelpiece and handing them to her mistress

mrs bird opened one of which she read a part and then laid it down as being apparently of no importance the other however seemed to have a great effect upon her as she exclaimed hurriedly  tell reuben not to unharness the horsesâi must go to francisville immediatelyâdear mrs

hinton is very ill and not expected to recover you must take good care of charlie until i return if i do not come back tonight you will know that she is worse and that i am compelled to remain there  and on the carriage being brought to the door she departed in haste to visit her sick friend

when mrs garie embarked she entertained the idea so prevalent among freshwater sailors that she was to be an exception to the rule of father neptune in accordance with which all who intrude for the first time upon his domain are compelled to pay tribute to his greatness and humbly bow in acknowledgment of his power

mrs garie had determined not to be seasick upon any account whatever being fully persuaded she could brave the ocean with impunity and was accordingly very brisk and blithelooking as she walked up and down upon the deck of the vessel in the course of a few hours they sailed out of the harbour and were soon in the open sea she began to find out how mistaken she had been as unmistakable symptoms convinced her of the vanity of all human calculations  why you are not going to be ill em after all your valiant declarations exclaimed mr garie supporting her unsteady steps as they paced to and fro

 oh no no   said bhe in a firm tone  i dont intend to give up to any such nonsense i believe that people can keep up if they try i do feel a little fatigued and nervous its causedno doubt by the long drive of this morningâ although i think it singular that a drive should affect me in this manner thus speaking she sat down by the bulwarks of the vessel and a despairing look gradually crept over her face at last she suddenly rose to look at the water as we may imagine the effect of her scrutiny however was that she asked feebly to be assisted to her stateroom where she remained until their arrival in the harbour of new york

the children suffered only for a short time and as their father escaped entirely he was able to watch that they got into no mischief they were both great favourites with the captain and steward and between the two were so stuffed and crammed with sweets as to place their health in considerable jeopardy

it was a delightful morning when they sailed into the harbour of new york the waters were dancing and rippling in the morning sun and the gailypainted feriyboats srere skimming swiftly across its surface in their trips to and from the city which was just awaking to its daily life of bustling toil

what an immense city it is said mrs garieâhow full of life and bustle  why there are more ships at one pier here than there are in the whole port of savanah 

 yes dear rejoined her husband   and what is more there always will be our folks in georgia are not waked up yet and when they do arouse themselves from their slumber it will be too late but we dont see half the shipping from hereâthis is only one side of the cityâthere is much more âa the other look over there continued he pointing to jersey cityâ that is where we take the cars for philadelphia and if we get up to dock in three or four hours we shall be in time for the midday train

in less time than they anticipated they were alongside the wharf the trunks were brought up and all things for present use were safely packed together and despatched under the stewards care to the office of the railroad

mr and mrs garie after bidding goodbye to the captain followed with the children who were thrown into a great state of excitement by the noise and bustle of the crowded thoroughfare

how this whirl and confusion distracts me said mrs

garie looking out of the carriagewindow  i hope philadelphia is not as noisy a place as this

oh no replied mr garie  it is one of the most quiet clean cities in the world whilst this is the noisiest and dirtiest i always hurry out of new york it is to me such a disagreeable place with its extortionate hackmen and filthy streets

on arriving at the little steamer in which they crossed the ferry they found it about to start and therefore had to hurry on board with all possible speed

under the circumstances the hackman felt that it would be flying in the face of providence if he did not extort a large fare and he therefore charged an extravagant price mr garie paid him as he had no time to parley and barely succeeded in slipping a douceur into the stewards hand when the boat pushed off from the pier

in a few moments they had crossed the river and were boon comfortably seated in the cars whirling over the track to philadelphia

as the conductor came through to examine the tickets he paused for a moment before mrs garie and the children as he passed on his assistant inquired isnt that a nigger

 yes a halfwhite one was the reply

 why dont you order her out then âshe has no business to ride in here continued the first speaker

 i guess we had better let her alone suggested the conductor  particularly as no one has complained  and there

might be a row if she turned out to be the nurse to those children the whole party are southerners thats clear  and these southerners are mighty touchy about their niggers sometimes and kick and cut like the devil about them i guess we had better let her alone unless some one complains about her being there

as they drove through the streets of philadelphia oh the way to their new home mrs garie gave vent to many expressions of delight at the appearance of the city  oh what a sweet place everything is so bright and freshlooking  why the pavement and doorsteps look as if they were cleaned twice a day just look at that house how spotless it is i hope ours resembles that ours is a new house is it not   she inquired

not entirely it has been occupied before but only for a short time i believe was her husbands reply

it had grown quite dark by the time they arrived at winterstreet where caddy had been anxiously holding watch md ward in company with the servants who had been procured for them a bright light was burning in the entry as the coachman stopped at the door

this is no  said he opening the door of the carriage shall i ring  

yes do replied mr garie but whilst he was endeavouring to open the gate of the little garden in front caddy flho had heard the carriage stop bounded out to welcome them  this is mr garie i suppose said she as he alighted

yes i am and you i suppose are the daughter of mr

ellis

 yes sir im sorry mother is not here to welcome you she was here until very late last night expecting your arrival and was here again this morning said caddy taking at the same time one of the little carpet bags  give me the little girl i can take care of her too she continued and with little era on one arm and the carpet bag on the other she led the way into the house

we did not make up any fire said she the weather is very warm to us i dont know how it may feel to you though

it is a little chilly replied mrs garie as she sat down upon the sofa and looked round the room with a smile of pleasure and added  all this place wants to make it the r est bewitching of rooms is a little fire

daddy hurried the new servants from place to place remorselessly and set them to prepare the table and get the things ready for tea she waylaid a party of labourers who chanced to be coming that way and hired them to carry all luggage upstairsâhad the desired fire madeâmixed up cornbread and had tea on the table in a twinkling

they all ate very heartily and caddy was greatly praised for her activity

you are quite a housekeeper said mrs garie to caddy

 do you like it  

oh yes she replied i see to the house at home almost entirely mother and esther are so much engaged in sewing that they are glad enough to leave it in my hands and id much rather do that than sew

 i hope said mrs garie  that your mother will permit you to remain with us until we get entirely settled

 i know she will confidently replied caddy  she will be up here in the morning she will know you have arrived by my not having gone home this evening

the children had now fallen asleep with their heads in close proximity to their plates and mrs garie declared that she felt very much fatigued and slightly indisposed and thought the sooner she retired the better it would be for her she accordingly went up to the room which she had already seen and greatly admired and was soon in the land of dreams

as is always the case on such occasions the childrens nightdresses could not be found clarence was put to bed in one of his fathers shirts in which he was almost lost and little em was temporarily accommodated with a calico short gown of caddys and in default of a nightcap had her head tied up in a madras handkerchief which gave her when her back was turned very much the air of an old creole who had been by some mysterious means deprived of her due growth

the next morning mrs garie was so much indisposed as to be unable to rise and took her breakfast in bed her husband had finished his meal and was sitting in the parlour when he observed a middleaged coloured lady coming into the garden

look caddy cried he isnt this your mother

 oh yes that is she replied caddy and ran and opened the door exclaiming oh mother theyre come and as she spoke mr garie came into the entry and shook hands heartily with her

 im so much indebted to you said he  for arranging everything bo nicely for usâthere is not a thing we would wish to alter

 i am very glad you are pleased  we did our best to make it comfortable was her reply

 and you succeeded beyond our expectation but do come up continued he  emily will be delighted to see you she is quite unwell this morning  has not even got up yet  and leading the way upstairs he ushered mrs ellis into the bedroom

 why can this be you   said she surveying emily with surprise and pleasure  if i had met you anywhere i should never have known you how you have altered you were not so tall as my caddy when i saw you last and here you are with two childrenâand pretty little things they are too 

said she kissing little em who was seated on the bed with her brother and sharing with him the remains of her mothers chocolate

and you look much younger that i expected to see you

replied mrs garie  draw a chair up to the bed and let us have a talk about old times you must excuse my lying down i dont intend to get up today i feel quite indisposed

mrs ellis took off her bonnet and prepared for a long chat  whilst mr garie looking at his watch declared it was getting late and started for down town where he had to transact some business

 you can scarcely think ellen how much i feel indebted to you for all you have done for us  and we are so distressed to hear about charlies accident you must have had a great deal of trouble

 oh no none to speak ofâand had it been ever so much i should have been just as pleased to have done it i was so glad you were coming what did put it in your heads to come here to live   continued mrs ellis

 oh cousin george winston praised the place so highly and you know how disagreeable georgia is to live in my mind was never at rest there respecting these said she pointing to the children   so that i fairly teased garie into it did you recognize george  

no i didnt remember much about him i should never have taken him for a coloured man  had i met him in the street i should have supposed him to be a wealthy white southerner what a gentleman he is in his appearance and manners said mrs ellis

yes he is all thatâmy husband thinks there is no one like him but we wont talk about him now i want you to tell me all about yourself and family and then ill tell you everything respecting my own fortunes hereupon ensued long narratives from both parties which occupied the greater part of the morning

mr garie on leaving the house slowly wended his way to the residence of mr walters as he passed into the lower part of the city his attention was arrested by the number of coloured children he saw skipping merrily along with their bags of books on their arms

 this said he to himself  dont much resemble georgia

after walking some distance he took out a card and read  eastonstreet and on inquiry found himself in the very street he proceeded to inspect the numbers and was quite perplexed by their confusion and irregularity

a coloured boy happening to pass at the time he asked him   which way do the numbers run my little man  

the boy looked up waggishly and replied they dont run at all they are permanently affixed to each door

but said mr garie halfprovoked yet compelled to smile at the boys pompous wit you know what i mean  i cannot find the number i wish the street is not correctly numbered

 the street is not numbered at all rejoined the boy  but the houses are and he skipped lightly away

mr garie was finally set right about the numbers and found himself at length before the door of mr walterss house  quite a handsome residence said he as he surveyed the stately house with its spotless marble steps and shining silver doorplate

on ringing his summons was quietly answered by a welldressed servant who informed him that mr walters was at home and ushered him into the parlour the elegance of the room took mr garie completely by surprise as its furniture indicated not only great wealth but cultivated taste aud refined habits the richlypapered walls were adorned by paintings from the hands of wellknown foreign and native artists rich vases and wellexecuted bronzes were placed in the most favourable situations in the apartment the elegantlycarved walnut table was covered with those charming little bijoux which the french only are capable of conceiving and which are only at the command of such purchasers as are possessed of more money than they otherwise can conveniently spend

mr garie threw himself into a luxuriouslycushioned chair and was soon so absorbed in contemplating the likeness of a negro officer which hung opposite that he did not hear the soft tread of mr walters as he entered the room the latter stepping slowly forward caught the eye of mr garie who started up astonished at the commanding figure before him

 mr garie i presume   said mr walters

yes he replied and added as he extended his hand i have the pleasure of addressing mr walters i suppose 

mr walters bowed low as he accepted the proffered hand and courteously requested his visitor to be seated

as mr garie resumed his seat he could not repress a look of surprise which mr walters apparently perceived for a smile slightly curled his lip as he also took a seat opposite his visitor

mr walters was above six feet in height and exceedingly wellproportioned of jetblack complexion and smooth glossy shin his head was covered with a quantity of woolly hair which was combed back from a broad but not very high forehead his eyes were small black and piercing and set deep in his head his aquiline nose thin lips and broad chin were the very reverse of african in their shape and gave his face a very singular appearance in repose his countenance was severe in its expression but when engaged in agreeable conversation the thin sarcasticlooking lips would part displaying a set of dazzlingly white teeth and the small black eyes would sparkle with animation the neatness and care with which he was dressed added to the attractiveness of his appearance his linen was the perfection of whiteness and his snowy vest lost nothing by its contact therewith a long black frock coat black pants and highlypolished boots completed his attire

 i hope said he  your house suits you  it is one of my own and has never been rented except for a short time to a careful tenant who was waiting for his own house to be finished i think you will find it comfortable

 oh perfectly so i am quite sure i must thank you for the prompt manner in which you have arranged everything for us it seems more like coming to an old home than to a new residence replied mr garie

 i am delighted to hear you say so said mr walters

 i shall be most happy to call and pay my respects to mrs

garie when agreeable to her depend upon it we will do all in our power to make our quiet city pleasant to you both

mr garie thanked him and after some further conversation rose to depart

as he was leaving the room he stopped before the picture which had so engaged his attention when mr walters entered

 so you too are attracted by that picture said mr

walters with a smile  all white men look at it with interest

a black man in the uniform of a general officer is something so unusual that they cannot pass it with a glance

it is indeed rather a novelty replied mr garie  particularly to a person from my part of the country who is it  

that is toussaint louverture replied mr walters  and i have every reason to believe it to be a correct likeness it was presented to an american merchant by toussaint himselfâa present in return for some kindness shown him this merchants son not having the regard for the picture that his father entertained for it sold it to me

that continued mr walters  looks like a man of intelligence it is entirely different from any likeness i ever saw of him the portraits generally represent him as a monkeyfaced person with a handkerchief about his head

 this said mr garie  gives me an idea of the man that accords with his actions

thus speaking he continued looking at the picture for a short time and then took his departure after requesting mr walters to call upon him at an early opportunity

we must now introduce our readers into the bach parlour of the house belonging to mr garies nextdoor neighbour mr thomas stevens

we find this gentleman standing at a window that overlooked his garden enjoying a fragrant havannah his appearance was not by any means prepossessing  he was rather above than below the middle height with round shoulders and long thin arms finished off by disagreeablelooking hands his head was bald on the top and the thin greyishred hair that grew more thickly about his ears was coaxed up to that quarter where an attempt had been made to effect such a union between the cords of the hair from each side as should cover the place in question

the object however remained unaccomplished as the hair was either very obstinate and would not be induced to lie as desired or from extreme modesty objected to such an elevated position and in consequence stopped halfway as if undecided whether to lie flat or remain erect producing the effect that would have been presented had he been decorated with a pair of horns his baldness might have given an air of benevolence to his face but for the shaggy eyebrows that overshadowed his cunninglooking grey eyes his cheekbones were high and the cadaverous skin was so tightly drawn across them as to give it a very parchmentlike appearance around his thin compressed lips there was a continual nervous twitching that added greatly to the sinister aspect of his face

on the whole he was a person from whom you would instinctively shrink and had he been president or director of a bank in which you had money deposited his general aspect would not have given you additional confidence in the stable character or just administration of its affairs

mr george stevens was a pettifogging attorney who derived a tolerable income from a rather disreputable legal practice picked up among the courts that held their sessions in the various halls of the statehouse he was known in the profession as slippery george from the easy manner in which he glided out of scrapes that would have been fatal to the reputation of any other lawyer did a man break into a house and escape without being actually caught on the spot with the goods in his possession stevens was always able to prove an alibi by a long array of witnesses in fact he was considered by the swell gentry of the city as their especial friend and protector and by the members of the bar generally as anything but an ornament to the profession

he had had rather a fatiguing days labour and on the evening of which we write was indulging in his usual cigar and amusing himself at the same time by observing the gambols of clarence and little em who were enjoying a romp in their fathers garden

 come here jule said he  and look at our new neighbours childrenârather pretty aint they  

t he was joined by a diminutive redfaced woman with hair and eyes very much like his own and a face that wore a peevish pinched expression

bather goodlooking she replied after observing them for a few minutes and then added  have you seen their parents  

no not yet was the reply i met walters in the street this morning who informed me they are from the south and very rich we must try and cultivate themâask the children in to play with ours and strike up an intimacy in that way the rest will follow naturally you know

by the way jule continued he how i hate that nigger walters with his grand airs i wanted some money of him the other day on rather ticklish securities for a client of mine and the black wretch kept me standing in his hall for at least five minutes and then refused me with some not very complimentary remarks upon my assurance in offering him such securities it made me so mad i could have choked himâit is bad enough to be treated with hauteur by a white man but contempt from a nigger is almost unendurable

 why didnt you resent it in some way  i never would have submitted to anything of the kind from him interrupted mrs stevens

 oh i dont dare to just now  i have to be as mild as milk with him you forget about the mortgage dont you know he has me in a tight place there and i dont see how to get out of it either if i am called slippery george i tell you what jule theres not a better man of business in the whole of philadelphia than that same walters nigger as he is  and no one offends him without paying dear for it in some way or other ill tell you something he did last week he went up to trenton on business and at the hotel they refused to give him dinner because of his colour and told him they did not permit niggers to eat at their tables what does he do but buy the house over the landlords head the lease had just expired and the landlord was anxious to negotiate another he was also making some arrangements with his creditors which could not be effected unless he was enabled to renew the lease of the premises he occupied on learning that the house had been sold he came down to the city to negotiate with the new owner and to his astonishment found him to be the very man he had refused a meal to the week before blunt happened to be in walterss office at the time the fellow called walters he says drew himself up to his full height and looked like an ebony statue

 sir said he  i came to your house and asked for a meal for which i was able to pay  you not only refused it to me but heaped upon me words such as fall only from the lips of blackguards you refuse to have me in your houseâi object to have you in mine  you will therefore quit the premises immediately the fellow sneaked out quite crestfallen and his creditors have broken him up completely

 i tell you what jule if i was a black continued he  living in a country like this id sacrifice conscience and everything else to the acquisition of wealth

as he concluded he turned from the window and sat down by a small table upon which a lighted lamp had been placed and where a few law papers were awaiting a perusal

a little boyand girl were sitting opposite to him the hoy was playing with a small flytrap wherein he had already imprisoned a vast number of buzzing sufferers in appearance he bore a close resemblance to his father he had the same red hair and sallow complexion but his grey eyes had a dull leaden hue

 do let them go george do  said the little girl in a pleading tone  youll kill them shut up there

 i dont care if i do replied he doggedly  i can catch moreâlook here and as he spoke he permitted a few of the imprisoned insects to creep partly out and then brought the lid down upon them with a force that completely demolished them

the little girl shuddered at this wanton exhibition of cruelty and offered him a paper of candy if he would liberate his prisoners which he did rather reluctantly but promising himself to replenish the box at the first opportunity

 ah  said he in a tone of exultation  father took me with him to the jail today and i saw all the people locked up i mean to be a jailer some of these days wouldnt you like to keep a jail liz   continued he his leaden eyes receiving a slight accession of brightness at the idea

 oh no  replied she   i would let all the people go if i kept the jail

a more complete contrast than this little girl presented to her parents and brother cannot be imagined she had very dark chestnut hair and mild blue eyes and a round full face which in expression was sweetness itself she was about six years old and her brothers junior by an equal number of years

her mother loved her but thought her tame and spiritless in her disposition and her father cherished as much affection for her as he was capable of feeling for any one but himself

mrs stevens however doted on their eldest hope who was as disagreeable as a thoroughly spoiled and naturally evildisposed boy could be

as the evenings had now become quite warm mr garie frequently took a chair and enjoyed his evening cigar upon the doorstep of his house  and as mr stevens thought his steps equally suited to this purpose it was very natural he should resort there with the same object

mr stevens found no difficulty in frequently bringing about short neighbourly conversations with mr garie the little folk taking their cue from their parents soon became intimate and ran in and out of each others houses in the most familiar manner possible lizzy stevens and little em joined hearts immediately and their intimacy had already been cemented by frequent consultations on the various ailments wherewith they supposed their dolls afflicted

clarence got on only tolerably with george stevens he entertained for him that deference that one boy always has for another who is his superior in any boyish pastime  but there was little affection lost between themâthey cared very little for each others society

mrs garie since her arrival had been much confined to her room in consequence of her protracted indisposition

mrs stevens had several times intimated to mr garie her intention of paying his wife a visit but never having received any very decided encouragement she had not pressed the matter though her curiosity was aroused and she was desirous of seeing what kind of person mrs garie could be

her son george in his visits had never been permitted farther than the front parlour and all the information that could be drawn from little lizzy who was frequently in mrs garies bedroom was that  she was a pretty lady with great large eyes

one evening when mr garie was occupying his accustomed seat he was accosted from the other side by mrs

stevens who as usual was very particular in her inquiries after the state of his wifes health  and on learning that she was so much improved as to be downstairs suggested that perhaps she would be willing to receive her

no doubt she will rejoined mr garie and he immediately entered the house to announce the intended visit

the lamps were not lighted when mrs stevens was introduced and faces could not therefore be clearly distinguished

 my dear said mr garie  this is our neighbour mrs

stevens

 will you excuse me for not rising   said mrs garie extending her hand to her visitor  i have been quite ill or i should have been most happy to have received you before my little folks are in your house a great dealâi hope you do not find them troublesome

 oh by no means  i quite dote on your little emily she is such a sweet childâso very affectionate it is a great comfort to have such a child near for my own to associate withâthey have got quite intimate as i hope we soon shall be

mrs garie thanked her for the kindness implied in the wish and said she trusted they should be so

 and how do you like your house   asked mrs stevens  it is on the same plan as ours and we find ours very convenient they both formerly belonged to walters my husband purchased of him do you intend to buy  

 it is very probable we shall if we continue to like philadelphia answered mr garie

 im delighted to hear that rejoined sheâ very glad indeed it quite relieves my mind about one thing ever since mr stevens purchased our house we have been tormented with the suspicion that walters would put a family of niggers in this and if there is one thing in this world i detest more than another it is coloured people i think

mr garie here interrupted her by making some remark quite foreign to the subject with the intention no doubt of drawing her off this topic the attempt was however an utter failure for she continuedâ i think all those that are not slaves ought to be sent out of the country back to africa where they belong they are without exception the most ignorant idle miserable set i ever saw

 i think said mr garie  i can show you at least one exception and that too without much trouble sarah he cried  bring me a light

 oh said mrs stevens  i suppose you refer to waltersâit is true he is an exception but he is the only coloured person i ever saw that could make the least pretension to anything like refinement or respectability

 let me show you another said mr garie as he took the lamp from the servant and placed it upon the table near his wife

as the light fell on her face their visitor saw that she belonged to the very class that she had been abusing in such unmeasured terms and so petrified was she with confusion at the faux pas she had committed that she was entirely unable to improvise the slightest apology

mrs garie who had been reclining on the lounge partially raised herself and gave mrs stevens a withering look  i presume madam said she in a hurried and agitated tone  that you are very ignorant of the people upon whom you have just been heaping such unmerited abuse and therefore i shall not think so hardly of you as i should did i deem your language dictated by pure hatred but be its origin what it may it is quite evident that our farther acquaintance could be productive of no pleasure to either of usâyou will therefore permit me continued she rising with great dignity  to wish you good evening  and thus speaking she left the room

mrs stevens was completely demolished by this unexpected denouement of her longmeditated visit and could only feebly remark to mr garie that it was getting late and she would go and rising she suffered herself to be politely bowed out of the house in her intense anxiety to relate to her husband the scene which had just occurred she could not take time to go round and through the gate but leaped lightly over the low fence that divided the gardens and rushed precipitately into the presence of her husband

 good heavens george what do you think   she exclaimed   ive had such a surprise  

 i should think that you had judging from appearances

replied he  why your eyes are almost starting out of your head  what on earth has happened   he asked as he took the shade off the lamp to get a better view of his amiable partner

you would not guess in a year she rejoined  i never would have dreamed itâi never was so struck in my life  

 struck with what  do talk sensibly jule and say what all this is about interrupted her husband in an impatient manner  come out with itâwhat has happened  

 why would you have thought it said she   mrs

garie is a nigger womanâa real niggerâshe would be known as such anywhere  

it was now mr stevenss turn to be surprised  why jule he exclaimed  you astonish me come now youre jokingâyou dont mean a real black nigger 

 oh no not jet blackâbut shes dark enough she is as dark as that sarah we employed as cook some time ago

you dont say so wonders will never ceaseâand he such a gentleman too   resumed her husband

yes and its completely sickening continued mrs

stevens  to see them together he calls her my dear and is as tender and affectionate to her as if she was a circassian âand she nothing but a niggerâfaugh its disgusting

little clarence had been standing near unnoticed by either of them during this conversation and they were therefore greatly surprised when he exclaimed with a burst of tears  my mother is not a nigger any more than you are how dare you call her such a bad name  ill tell my father 

mr stevens gave a low whistle and looking at his wife pointed to the door mrs stevens laid her hand on the shoulder of clarence and led him to the door saying as she did so dont come in here any moreâi dont wish you to come into my house  and then closing it returned to her husband

 you know george said she that i went in to pay her a short visit i hadnt the remotest idea that she was a coloured woman and i commenced giving my opinion respecting niggers very freely when suddenly her husband called for a light and i then saw to whom i had been talking you may imagine my astonishmentâi was completely dumbâand it would have done you good to have seen the air with which she left the room after as good as telling me to leave the house

well said mr stevens this is what may be safely termed an unexpected event but jule he continued  you had better pack these young folks off to bed and then you can tell me the rest of it

clarence stood for some time on the steps of the house from which he had been so unkindly ejected with his little heart swelling with indignation he had often heard the term nigger used in its reproachful sense but never before had it been applied to him or his at least in his presence it was the first blow the child received from the prejudice whose relentless hand was destined to crush him in afteryears

it was his custom when any little grief pressed upon his childish heart to go and pour out his troubles on the breast of his mother but he instinctively shrunk from confiding this to her for child as he was he knew it would make her very unhappy he therefore gently stole into the house crept quietly up to his room lay down and sobbed himself to sleep

to emily winston we have always accorded the title of mrs garie whilst in reality she had no legal claim to it whatever

previous to their emigration from georgia mr garie had on one or two occasions attempted but without success to make her legally his wife

he ascertained that even if he could have found a clergyman willing to expose himself to persecution by marrying them the ceremony itself would have no legal weight as a marriage between a white and a mulatto was not recognized as valid by the laws of the state and he had therefore been compelled to dismiss the matter from his mind until an opportunity should offer for the accomplishment of their wishes

now however that they had removed to the north where they would have no legal difficulties to encounter he determined to put his former intention into execution although emily had always maintained a studied silence on the subject he knew that it was the darling wish of her heart to be legally united to him  so he unhesitatingly proceeded to arrange matters for the consummation of what he felt assured would promote the happiness of both he therefore wrote to dr

blackly a distinguished clergyman of the city requesting him to perform the ceremony and received from him an assurance that he would be present at the appointed time

matters having progressed thus far he thought it time to inform emily of what he had done on the evening succeeding the receipt of an answer from the rev dr blacklyâ after the children had been sent to bedâhe called her to him and taking her hand sat down beside her on the sofa

emily said he as he drew her closer to him my dear faithful emily  i am about to do you an act of justiceâone too that i feel will increase the happiness of us both i am going to marry you my darling i am about to give you a lawful claim to what you have already won by your faithfulness and devotion you know i tried more than once whilst in the south to accomplish this but owing to the cruel and unjust laws existing there i was unsuccessful but now love no such difficulty exists and here

continued he  is an answer to the note i have written to dr blackly asking him to come next wednesday night and perform the ceremonyâyou are willing are you not emily   he asked

 willing i  she exclaimed in a voice tremulous with emotionâ willing oh god if you only knew how i have longed for it it has been my earnest desire for years   and bursting into tears she leaned sobbing on his shoulder

after a few moments she raised her head and looking searchingly in his face she asked but do you do this after full reflection on the consequences to ensue  are you willing to sustain all the odium to endure all the contumely to which your acknowledged union with one of my unfortunate race will subject you clarence  it will be a severe trialâa greater one than any you have yet endured for meâ and one for which i fear my love will prove but a poor recompense  i have thought more of these things lately i am older now in years and experience there was a time when i was vain enough to think that my affection was all that was necessary for your happiness but men i know require more to fill their cup of content than the undivided affection of a woman no matter how fervently beloved you have talents and i have sometimes thought ambition oh clarence

how it would grieve me in afteryears to know that you regretted that for me you had sacrificed all those views and hopes that are cherished by the generality of your sex i have you weighed it well  

yes emilyâwell replied mr garie and you know the conclusion my past should be a guarantee for the future i had the world before me and chose youâand with you i am contented to share my lot and feel that i receive in your affection a full reward for any of the socalled sacrifices i may make so dry your tears my dear concluded he  and let us hope for nothing but an increase of happiness as the result

after a few moments of silence he resumed it will be necessary emily to have a couple of witnesses now whom would you prefer i would suggest mrsellis and her husband

they are old friends and persons on whose prudence we can rely it would not do to have the matter talked about as it would expose us to disagreeable comments

mrs garie agreed perfectly with him as to the selection of mr and mrs ellis and immediately despatched a note to mrs ellis asking her to call at their house on the morrow

when she came emily informed her with some confusion of manner of the intended marriage and asked her attendance as witness at the same time informing her of the high opinion her husband entertained of their prudence in any future discussion of the matter

 i am really glad he is going to marry you emily replied mrs ellis  and depend upon it we will do all in our power to aid it only yesterday that inquisitive mrs tiddy was at our house and in conversation respecting you asked if i knew you to be married to mr garie i turned the conversation somehow without giving her a direct answer mr garie i must say does act nobly towards you he must love you emily for not one white man in a thousand would make such a sacrifice for a coloured woman you cant tell how we all like himâhe is so amiable so kind in his manner and makes everyone so much at ease in his company its real good in him i declare and i shall begin to have some faith in white folks after allâwednesday night continued she very wellâ we shall he here if the lord spare us   and kissing emily she hurried off to impart the joyful intelligence to her husband

the anxiously looked for wednesday evening at last arrived and emily arrayed herself in a plain white dress for the occasion her long black hair had been arranged in ringlets by mrs ellis who stood by gazing admiringly at her

 how sweet you look emilyâyou only want a wreath of orange blossoms to complete your appearance dont you feel a little nervous   asked her friend

 a little excited she answered and her hand shook as she put back one of the curls that had fallen across her face

just then a loud ringing at the door announced the arrival of dr blackly who was shown into the front parlour

emily and mrs ellis came down into the room where mr

garie was waiting for them whilst mr ellis brought in dr

blackly the reverend gentleman gazed with some surprise at the party assembled mr garie was so thoroughly saxon in appearance that no one could doubt to what race he belonged and it was equally evident that emily mrs ellis and her husband were coloured persons

dr blackly looked from one to the other with evident embarrassment and then said to mr garie in a low hesitating tone â i think there has been some mistake hereâwill you do me the favour to step into another room  

mr garie mechanically complied and stood waiting to learn the cause of dr blacklys strange conduct

 you are a white man i believe   at last stammered forth the doctor

 yes sir i presume my appearance is a sufficient guarantee of that answered mr garie

oh yes i do not doubt it and for that reason you must not be surprised if i decline to proceed with the ceremony

 i do not see how my being a white man can act as a barrier to its performance remarked mr garie in reply

 it would not sir if all the parties were of one complexion  but i do not believe in the propriety of amalgamation and on no consideration could i be induced to assist in the union of a white man or woman with a person who has the slightest infusion of african blood in their veins

i believe the negro race he continued  to be marked out by the hand of god for servitude and you must pardon me if i express my surprise that a gentleman of your evident intelligence should seek such a connectionâyou must be labouring under some horrible infatuation

enough sir replied mr garie proudly i only regret that i did not know it was necessary to relate every circumstance of appearance complexion c i wished to obtain a marriage certificate not a passport i mistook you for a christian minister which mistake you will please to consider as my apology for having troubled you  and thus speaking he bowed dr blackly out of the house mr garie stepped back to the door of the parlour and called out mr

ellis

 we are placed in a very difficult dilemma said he as he was joined by the latter  would you believe it  that prejudiced old sinner has actually refused to marry us

it is no more than you might have expected of himâhes a thorough niggerhaterâkeeps a pew behind the organ of his church for coloured people and will not permit them to receive the sacrament until all the white members of his congregation are served why i dont see what on earth induced you to send for him

i knew nothing of his sentiments respecting coloured people i did not for a moment have an idea that he would hesitate to marry us there is no law here that forbids it

what can we do   said mr garie despairingly

 i know a minister who will marry you with pleasure if i can only catch him at home he is so much engaged in visiting the sick and other pastoral duties

 do goâhunt him up ellis it will be a great favour to me if you can induce him to come poor emilyâwhat a disappointment this will be to her said he as he entered the room where she was sitting

 what is the matter dear   she asked as she observed garies anxious face  i hope there is no new difficulty

mr garie briefly explained what had just occurred and informed her in addition of mr ellis having gone to see if he could get father banks as the venerable old minister was called

 it seems dear said she despondingly  as if providence looked unfavourably on our design for every time you have attempted it we have been in some way thwarted

and the tears chased one another down her face which had grown pale in the excitement of the moment

 oh dont grieve about it dear it is only a temporary disappointment i cant think all the clergymen in the city are like dr blackly some one amongst them will certainly oblige us we wont despair at least not until ellis comes back

they had not very long to wait for soon after this conversation footsteps were heard in the garden and mr ellis entered followed by the clergyman

in a very short space of time they were united by father banks who seemed much affected as he pronounced his blessing upon them

 my children he said tremulously you are entering upon a path which to the most favoured is full of disappointment care and anxieties  but to you who have come together under such peculiar circumstances in the face of so many difficulties and in direct opposition to the prejudices of society it will be fraught with more danger and open to more annoyances than if you were both of one race but if men revile you revile not again bear it patiently for the sake of him who has borne so much for you god bless you my children said he and after shaking hands with them all he departed

mr and mrs ellis took their leave soon after and then mrs garie stole upstairs alone into the room where the children were sleeping it seemed to her that night that they were more beautiful than ever as they lay in their little beds quietly slumbering she knelt beside them and earnestly prayed their heavenly father that the union which had just been consummated in the face of so many difficulties might prove a boon to them all

where have you been you runaway exclaimed her husband as she reentered the parlour  you stayed away so long i began to have all sorts of frightful ideasâi thought of the mistletoe hung in the castle hall and of old oak chests and all kind of terrible things ive been sitting here alone ever since the ellises went where have you been

 oh ive been upstairs looking at the children bless their young hearts they looked so sweet and happyâand how they grow clarence is getting to be quite a little man dont you think it time dear that he was sent to school  i have so much more to occupy my mind here than i had in georgia so many household duties to attend to that i am unable to give that attention to his lessons which i feel is requisite besides being so much at home he has associated with that wretched boy of the stevenss and is growing rude and noisy dont you think he had better be sent to school  

 oh yes emily if you wish it was mr garies reply

 i will search out a school tomorrow or next day  and taking out his watch he continued  it is near twelve oclock âhow the night has flown awayâwe must be off to bed

after the excitement of the evening and your exertions of today i fear that you will be indisposed tomorrow

clarence although over nine years old was so backward in learning that they were obliged to bend him to a small primary school which had recently been opened in the neighbourhood  and as it was one for children of both sexes it was deemed advisable to send little em with him

 i do so dislike to have her go said her mother as her husband proposed that she should accompany clarence  she seems so small to be sent to school im afraid she wont be happy

 oh dont give yourself the least uneasiness about her not being happy there for a more cheerful set of little folks i never beheld you would be astonished to see how exceedingly young some of them are

what kind of a person is the teacher asked mrs

garie

oh shes a charming little creature the very embodiment of cheerfulness and good humour she has sparkling black eyes a round rosy face and cant be more than sixteen if she is that old had i had such a teacher when a boy i should have got on charmingly but mine was a cross old widow who wore spectacles and took an amazing quantity of snuff and used to flog upon the slightest pretence i went into her presence with fear and trembling i could never learn anything from her and that must be my excuse for my present literary shortcomings but you need have no fear respecting em getting on with miss jordan  i dont believe she could be unkind to any one least of all to our little darling

 then you will take them down in the morning suggested mrs garie  but on no account leave emily unless she wishes to stay

after the departure of mrs bird to visit her sick friend betsey turned to charlie and bid him follow her into the kitchen i suppose you havent been to breakfast said she in a patronizing manner  if you havent you are just in time as we will be done ours in a little while and then you can have yours

charlie silently followed her down into the kitchen where a manservant and the younger maid were already at breakfast the latter arose and was placing another plate upon the table when betsey frowned and nodded disapprovingly to her  let him wait whispered she  im not going to eat with niggers

 oh hes such a nice little fellow replied eliza in an undertone  let him eat with us

betsey here suggested to charlie that he had better go up to the maple chamber wash his face and take his things out of his trunk and that when his breakfast was ready she would call him

 what on earth can induce you to want to eat with a nigger   asked betsey as soon as charlie was out of hearing

 i couldnt do it my victuals would turn on my stomach

i never ate at the same table with a nigger in my life

 nor i neither rejoined eliza  but i see no reason why i should not the child appears to have good manners he is neat and goodlooking and because god has curled his hair more than he has ours and made his skin a little darker than yours or mine that is no reason we should treat him as if he was not a human being

alfred the gardener had set down his saucer and appeared very much astonished at this declaration of sentiment on the part of eliza and sneeringly remarked youre an abolitionist i suppose

 no i am not replied she reddening  but ive been taught that god made all alike one no better than the other you know the bible says god is no respecter of persons

well if it does rejoined alfred with a stolid look it dont say that man isnt to be either does it when i see anything in my bible that tells me im to eat and drink with niggers ill do it and not before i suppose you think that all the slaves ought to be free and all the rest of the darned stuff these abolitionists are preaching now if you want to eat with the nigger you can  nobody wants to hinder you

perhaps he may marry you when he grows upâdont you think you had better set your cap at him  

eliza made no reply to this low taunt but ate her breakfast in silence

 i dont see what mrs bird brought him here for she says he is sickâhad a broken arm or something i cant imagine what use she intends to make of him remarked betsey

 i dont think she intends him to be a servant here at any rate said eliza  or why should she have him put in the maple chamber when there are empty rooms enough in the garret  

 well i guess i know what she brought him for interposed alfred  i asked her before she went away to get a little boy to help me do odd jobs now that reuben is about to leave we shall want a boy to clean the boots run on errands drive up the cows and do other little chores im glad hes a black boy i can order him round more you know than if he was white and he wont get his back up half as often either you may depend upon it thats what mrs bird has brought him here for the gardener having convinced himself that his view of the matter was the correct one went into the garden for his days labour and two or three things that he had intended doing he left unfinished with the benevolent intention of setting charlie at them the next morning

charlie after bathing his face and arranging his hair looked from the window at the wide expanse of country spread out before him all bright and glowing in the warm summer sunlight broad wellcultivated fields stretched away from the foot of the garden to the river beyond and the noise of the waterfall which was but a short distance off was distinctly heard and the sparkling spray was clearly visible through the openings of the trees  what a beautiful placeâwhat grand fields to run in an orchard too full of blossoming fruittrees well this is nice exclaimed charlie as his eye ran over the prospect but in the midst of his rapture came rushing back upon him the remembrance of the cavalier treatment he had met with belowstairs and he said with a sigh as the tears sprang to his eyes  but it is not home after all just at this moment he heard his name called by betsey and he hastily descended into the kitchen

at one end of the partiallycleared table a clean plate and knife and fork had been placed and he was speedily helped to the remains of what the servants had been eating

 you mustnt be long said betseyfor today is ironing day and we want the table as soon as possible

the food was plentiful and good but charlie could not eat his heart was full and heavyâthe child felt his degradation  even the servants refuse to eat with me because i am coloured thought he  oh i wish i was at home 

 why dont you eat   asked betsey

 i dont think i want any breakfast im not hungry

was the reply

 i hope you are not sulky she rejoined  we dont like sulky boys here why dont you eat   she repeated

the sharp cold tones of her voice struck a chill into the childs heart and his lip quivered as he stammered something farther about not being hungry and he hurried away into the garden where he calmed his feelings and allayed his homesickness by a hearty burst of tears after this was over he wandered through the garden and fields until dinner then by reading his book and by another walk he managed to get through the day

the following morning as he was coming down stairs he was met by allred who accosted him with  oh youre up are you i was just going to call you and looking at charlie from head to foot he inquired  is that your best suit  

 no its my worst replied charlie  i have two suits better than this   and thinking that mrs bird had arrived he continued  ill put on my best if mrs bird wants me

 no she aint home was the reply  its me that wants you come down here ive got a little job for you take this said he handing him a dirty tow apron  and tie it around your neck it will keep the blacking off your clothes you know now continued he i want you to clean these boots these two pairs are mr tyndallsâthem you need not be particular with but this pair is mine and i want em polished up highânow mind i tell you im going to wear a new pair of pants to meetin tomorrow and i expect to cut a dash so youll do em up slick now wont you  

 ill do my best said charlie who although he did not dislike work could not relish the idea of cleaning the servants boots  im afraid i shall find this a queer place

thought he  i shall not like living here i knowâwait for my meals until the servants have finished and clean their boots into the bargain this is worse than being with mrs

thomas

charlie however went at it with a will and was busily engaged in putting the finishing touches on alfreds boots when he heard his name called and on looking up saw mrs

bird upon the piazza above

why bless me child what are you aboutâwhose boots are those and why are you cleaning them

 oh  he replied his face brightening up at the sight of mrs bird  im so glad youve come those are mr tyndalls boots and these he continued holding up the boots on which he was engaged  are the gardeners

and who pray instructed you to clean them

 the gardener replied charlie

he did did he said mrs bird indignantly very well now do you take off that apron and come to me immediately  before you do however tell alfred i want him

charlie quickly divested himself of the tow apron and after having informed the gardener that mrs bird desired his presence in the parlour he ran up there himself alfred came lumbering up stairs after giving his boots an unusual scraping and cleansing preparatory to entering upon that part of the premises which to him was generally forbidden ground

 by whose direction did you set the child at that dirty work  asked mrs bird after he had entered the room

 i hadnt anybodys direction to set him to work but i thought you brought him here to do odd jobs you know maam i asked you some time ago to get a boy and i thought this was the one

 and if he had been you would have taken a great liberty in assigning him any duties without first consulting me

but he is not a servant here nor do i intend him to be such and let me inform you that instead of his cleaning your boots it will be your duty henceforth to clean his now continued she  you know his position here let me see that you remember yours you can go this was said in so peremptory a manner as to leave no room for discussion or rejoinder and alfred with a chagrined look went muttering down stairs

 things have come to a pretty pass grumbled he  im to wait on niggers black their boots and drive them out too i suppose id leave at once if it wasnt such a good situation drat the old pictureâwhat has come over her i wonder âshell be asking old aunt charity the black washerwoman to dine with her next she has either gone crazy or turned abolitionist i dont know which  something has happened to her thats certain

now charlie said mrs bird as the door closed upon the crestfallen gardener go to your room and dress yourself nicely after ive eaten my breakfast i am going to visit a friend and i want you to accompany me dont be long

 cant i eat mine first mrs bird he asked in reply

 i thought you had had yours long ago rejoined she

 the others hadnt finished theirs when you called me and i dont get mine until they have done said charlie

 until they have done  how happens that   asked mrs

bird

 i think they dont like to eat with me because im coloured was charlies hesitating reply

 that is too much exclaimed mrs bird  if it were not so very ridiculous i should be angry it remains for me then continued she to set them an example ive not eaten my breakfast yetâcome sit down with me and well have it together

charlie followed mrs bird into the breakfastroom and took the seat pointed out by her eliza when she entered with the teaurn opened her eyes wide with astonishment at the singular spectacle she beheld her mistress sitting down to breakfast visã vis to a little coloured boy depositing the urn upon the table she hastened back to the kitchen to report upon the startling events that were occurring in the breakfastroom

well i never said she that beats anything i ever did see why mrs bird must have turned abolitionist

charlie is actually sitting at the same table with her eating his breakfast as natural and unconcerned as if he was as white as snow wonders never will cease you see im right though i said that child wasnt brought here for a servant âweve done it for ourselves nowâonly think how mad shell be when she finds he was made to wait for his meals until we have done im glad i wasnt the one who refused to eat with him

 i guess she has been giving alfred a blowing up said betsy for setting him at boot cleaning  for he looked like a thundercloud when he came down stairs and was muttering something about a consarned petniggerâhe looked anything but pleased

whilst the lower powers were discussing what they were pleased to regard as an evidence of some mental derangement on the part of mrs bird that lady was questioning charlie respecting his studies and inquired if he would like to go to school in warmouth

after a while i think i should he replied but for a week id like to be free to run about the fields and go fishing and do lots of things this is such a pretty place and now that you have come i shall have nice timesâi know i shall

you seem to have great confidence in my ability to make you happy how do you know that i am as kind as you seem to suppose   asked mrs bird with a smile

i know you are answered charlie confidently you speak so pleasantly to me and do you know mrs bird

continued he  that i liked you from the first day when you praised me so kindly when i recited my lessons before you

did you ever have any little boys of your own  

a change immediately came over the countenance of mrs

bird as she replied  oh yes charlie a sweet good boy about your own age  and the tears stood in her eyes as she continued  he accompanied his father to england years agoâthe ship in which they sailed was never heard ofâhis name was charlie too

 i didnt know that or i should not have asked said charlie with some embarrassment of manner caused by the pain he saw he had inflicted  i am very sorry he continued

mrs bird motioned him to finish his breakfast and left the table without drinking the tea she had poured out for herself

there were but one or two families of coloured people living in the small town of warmouth and they of a very humble description  their faces were familiar to all the inhabitants and their appearance was in accordance with their humble condition therefore when charlie made his dãbut in company with mrs bird his dress and manners differed so with persons of his complexion that he created quite a sensation in the streets of the usually quiet and obscure little town

he was attired with great neatness and not haring an opportunity of playing marbles in his new suit it still maintained its spotless appearance the fine grey broadcloth coat and pants fitted him to a nicety the jaunty cap was set slightly on one side of his head giving him a somewhat saucy look and the fresh colour now returning to his cheeks imparted to his face a much healthier appearance than it had worn for months

he and his kind friend walked on together for some time chatting about the various things that attracted their attention on the way until they reached a cottage in the garden of which a gentleman was busily engaged in training a rosebush upon a new trellis

so completely was he occupied with his pursuit that he did not observe the entrance of visitors and quite started when he was gently tapped upon the shoulder by mrs bird

 how busy we are said she gaily at the same time extending her handâ so deeply engaged that we can scarcely notice old friends that we have not seen for months

 indeed this is a pleasant surprise he remarked when he saw by whom he had been interrupted  when did you arrive  

 only this morning and as usual i have already found something with which to bore youâyou know mr whately i always have something to trouble you about

dont say trouble my dear mrs bird if you will say give me something to occupy my time usefully and agreeably you will come much nearer the mark but who is this you have with you  

oh a little protãgã of mine poor little fellowâhe met with a sad accident recentlyâhe broke his arm and i have brought him down here to recruit charlie walk around and look at the gardenâi have a little matter of business to discuss with mr whately and when we shall have finished i will call you

mr whately led the way into his library and placing a seat for mrs bird awaited her communication

 you have great influence with the teacher of the academy i believe said she

a little replied mr whately smiling

not a little rejoined mrs bird  but a great deal and my dear mr whately i want you to exercise it in my behalf

i wish to enter as a scholar that little boy i brought with me this morning

 impossible  said mr whately  my good friend the boy is coloured  

 i am well aware of that continued mrs bird  if he were not there would not be the least trouble about his admission nor am i sure there will be as it is if you espouse his cause one who has been such a benefactor to the academy as yourself could i suppose accomplish anything

 yes  but that is stretching my influence unduly i would be willing to oblige you in almost anything else but i hesitate to attempt this why not send him to the public school â they have a separate bench for black children he can be taught there all that is necessary for him to know

 he is far in advance of any of the scholars there i attended the examination of the school to which he was attached said mrs bird  and i was very much surprised at the acquirements of the pupils this lad was distinguished above all the restâhe answered questions that would have puzzled older heads with the greatest facility i am exceedingly anxious to get him admitted to the academy as i am confident he will do honour to the interest i take in him

 and a very warm interest it must be my dear mrs bird to induce you to attempt placing him in such an expensive and exclusive school i am very much afraid you will have to give it up many of the scholars parents i am sure will object strenuously to the admission of a coloured boy as a scholar

 only tell me that you will propose him and i will risk the refusal replied mrs birdâit can be tried at all events and if you will make the effort i shall be under deep obligations to you

 well mrs bird let us grant him admittedâwhat benefit can accrue to the lad from an education beyond his station 

he cannot enter into any of the learned professions both whilst he is there and after his education is finished he will be like a fish out of water you must pardon me if i say i think in this case your benevolence misdirected the boys parents are poor i presume  

they certainly are not rich rejoined mrs bird and it is for that reason i wish to do all that i can for him if i can keep him with me and give him a good education it may be greatly for his advantage  there may be a great change in public sentiment before he is a manâwe cannot say what opening there may be for him in the future

not unless it changes very much i never knew prejudice more rampant than it is at this hour to get the boy admitted as a right is totally out of the question  if he is received at all it will be as a special favour and a favour whichâ i am sure it will require all my influence to obtain i will set about it immediately and rely upon it i will do my best for your protãgã satisfied with the promise which was as much as mrs

bird had dared to hope for she called charlie then shook hands with mr whately and departed

the garies had now become thoroughly settled in philadelphia and amongst the people of colour had obtained a very extensive and agreeable acquaintance

at the south mr garie had never borne the reputation of an active person having an ample fortune and a thoroughly southern distaste for labour he found it by no means inconvenient or unpleasant to have so much time at his disposal

his newspaper in the morning a good book a stroll upon the fashionable promenade and a ride at dusk enabled him to dispose of his time without being oppressed with ennui

it was far happier for him that such was his disposition as his domestic relations would have been the means of subjecting him to many unpleasant circumstances from which his comparative retirement in a great measure screened him

once or twice since his settlement in the north his feelings had been ruffled by the sneering remarks of some of his former friends upon the singularity of his domestic position but his irritation had all fled before the smiles of content and happiness that beamed from the faces of his wife and children

mrs garie had nothing left to wish for she was surrounded by every physical comfort and in the enjoyment of frequent intercourse with intelligent and refined people and had been greatly attracted toward esther ellis with whom she had become very intimate

one morning in november these two were in the elegant little bedroom of mrs garie where a fire had been kindled as the weather was growing very chilly and disagreeable

 it begins to look quite like autumn said mrs garie rising and looking out of the window  the chrysanthemums are drooping and withered and the dry leaves are whirling and skimming through the air i wonder she continued  if the children were well wrapped up this morning  

 oh yes i met them at the corner on their way to school looking as warm and rosy as possible what beautiful children they are  little em has completely won my heart it really seems a pity for her to be put on the shelf as she must be soon

 howâwhat do you mean   asked mrs garie

oh this will explain archly rejoined esther as she held up to view one of the tiny lace trimmed frocks that she was making in anticipation of the event that has been previously hinted

mrs garie laughed and turned to look out of the window again

 do you know i found little lizzy stevens your neighbours daughter shivering upon the steps in a neighbouring street fairly blue with cold she was waiting there for clarence and em i endeavoured to persuade her to go on without them but she would not prom what i could understand she waits for them there every day

 her mother cannot be aware of it then for she has forbidden her children to associate with mine rejoined mrs garie i wonder she permits her little girl to go to the same school i dont think she knows it or it is very likely she would take her away

 has she ever spoken to you since the night of her visit 

asked esther

 never i have seen her a great many times since  she never speaks nor do i there she goes now that continued mrs garie with a smile  is another illustration of the truthfulness of the old adage talk ofâwell i wont say whoâ and he is sure to appear  and thus speaking she turned from the window and was soon deeply occupied in the important work of preparing for the expected little stranger

mrs garie was mistaken in her supposition that mrs

stevens was unaware that clarence and little em attended the same school to which her own little girl had been sent for the evening before the conversation we have just narrated she had been discussing the matter with her husband

here said she to him is miss jordans bill for the last quarter i shall never pay her another i am going to remove lizzy from that school

 remove her what for  i thought i heard you say jule that the child got on excellently well thereâthat she improved very fast 

 so she does as far as learning is concerned  but she is sitting right next to one of those garie children and that is an arrangement i dont at all fancy i dont relish the idea of my child attending the same school that niggers do so ive come to the determination to take her away

 i should do no such thing coolly remarked mr stevens

 i should compel the teacher to dismiss the garies or i should break up her school those children have no right to be there whatever i dont care a straw how light their complexions are they are niggers nevertheless and ought to go to a nigger school they are no better than any other coloured children ill tell you what you can do jule continued he  call on mrs kinney the roths and one or two others and induce them to say that if miss jordan wont dismiss the garies that they will withdraw their children and you know if they do it will break up the school entirely if it was any other persons children but his i would wink at it but i want to give him a fall for his confounded haughtiness

just try that plan jule and you will be sure to succeed

 i am not so certain about it stevens miss jordan i learn is very fond of their little em i must say i cannot wonder at it she is the most loveable little creature i ever saw i will say that if her mother is a nigger

yes jule all that may be but i know the world well enough to judge that when she becomes fully assured that it will conflict with her interests to keep them she will give them up she is too poor to be philanthropic and i believe has sufficient good sense to know it

 well ill try your plan said mrs stevens i will put matters in train tomorrow morning

early the next morning mrs stevens might have been seen directing her steps to the house of mrs kinney with whom she was very intimate she reached it just as that lady was departing to preside at a meeting of a female missionary society for evangelizing the patagonians

 i suppose you have come to accompany me to the meeting said she to mrs stevens as soon as they had exchanged the usual courtesies

oh dear no  i wish i was she replied ive got a troublesome little matter on my hands and last night my husband suggested my coming to ask your advice respecting it george has such a high opinion of your judgment that he would insist on my troubling you

mrs kinney smiled and looked gratified at this tribute to her importance

 and moreover continued mrs stevens  its a matter in which your interest as well as our own is concerned

mrs kinney now began to look quite interested and untying the strings of her bonnet exclaimed  dear me what can it be    knowing said mrs stevens that you entertain just the same sentiments that we do relative to associating with coloured people i thought i would call and ask if you were aware that miss jordan receives coloured as well as white children in her school

 why no  my dear mrs stevens you astound me i hadnt the remotest idea of such a thing it is very strange my children never mentioned it

 oh children are so taken up with their play they forget such things rejoined mrs stevens  now continued she  husband said he was quite confident you would not permit your children to continue their attendance after this knowledge came to your ears we both thought it would be a pity to break up the poor girls school by withdrawing our children without first ascertaining if she would expel the little darkies i knew if i could persuade you to let me use your name as well as ours and say that you will not permit your children to continue at her school unless she consents to our wishes she knowing the influence you possess would i am sure accede to our demands immediately

 oh you are perfectly at liberty to use my name mrs

stevens and say all that you think necessary to effect your object but do excuse me for hurrying off she continued looking at her watch   i was to have been at the meeting at ten oclock and it is now halfpast i hope you wont fail to call and let me know how you succeed  and with her heart overflowing with tender care for the poor patagonian mrs

kinney hastily departed

 thats settled soliloquized mrs stevens with an air of intense satisfaction as she descended the stepsâ her four children would make a serious gap in the little school and now then continued she for the boths

mrs stevens found not the slightest difficulty in persuading mrs both to allow her name to be used in connection with mrs kinneys in the threat to withdraw their children if the little garies were not immediately expelled mrs both swore by mrs kinney and the mere mention of that ladys name was sufficient to enlist her aid

thus armed mrs stevens lost no time in paying a visit to miss jordans school as she entered the busy hum of childish voices was somewhat stilled  and lizzy stevens touched little em who sat next her and whispered  there is my mother

mrs stevens was welcomed very cordially by miss jordan who offered her the seat of honour beside her

your school seems quite flourishing she remarked after looking around the room and i really regret being obliged to make a gap in your interesting circle

 i hope you dont intend to deprive me of your little girl

inquired miss jordan  i should regret to part with herâ not only because i am very fond of her but in consideration of her own interestâshe is coming on so rapidly

 oh i havent the slightest fault to find with her progress

that said she  is not the reason i have another of much more weight of course every one is at liberty to do as they choose and we have no right to dictate to you what description of scholars you should receive but if they are not such as we think proper companions for our children you cant complain if we withdraw them

 i really do not understand you mrs stevens said the teacher with an astonished look   i have none here but the children of the most respectable personsâthey are all as well behaved as school children generally are

 i did not allude to behaviour that for all that i know to the contrary is irreproachable it is not character that is in question but colour i dont like my daughter to associate with coloured children

 coloured children  repeated the now thoroughly bewildered teacherâ coloured children my dear madam

continued she smiling  some one has been hoaxing youâi hare no coloured pupilsâi could not be induced to receive one on any account

 i am very glad to hear you say so rejoined mrs stevens  for that convinces me that my fears were groundless i was under the impression you had imbibed some of those pestilent abolition sentiments coming into vogue i see you are not aware of it but you certainly have two coloured scholars  and there said she pointing to clarence  is one of them

clarence who with his head bent over his book was sitting so near as to overhear a part of this conversation now looked up and found the cold malignant grey eyes of mrs stevens fastened on him he looked at her for a momentâthen apparently resumed his studies

the poor boy had when she entered the room an instinctive knowledge that her visit boded no good to them he was beginning to learn the anomalous situation he was to fill in society he had detested mrs stevens ever since the night she bad ejected him so rudely from her house and since then had learned to some extent what was meant by the term nigger woman

you must certainly be misinformed responded miss jordan  i know their fatherâhe has frequently been here

he is a southerner a thorough gentleman in his manners and if ever a man was white i am sure he is

 have you seen their mother   asked mrs stevens significantly

 no i never have replied miss jordan  she is in poor health  but she must unquestionably be a white womanâa glance at the children ought to convince you of that

 it might if i had not seen her and did not know her to be a coloured woman you see my dear miss jordan

continued she in her blandest tone i am their nextdoor neighbour and have seen their mother twenty times and more she is a coloured woman beyond all doubt

 i never could have dreamed of such a thing  exclaimed miss jordan as an anxious look overspread her face then after a pause she continued   i do not see what i am to do âit is really too unfortunateâi dont know how to act it seems unjust and unchristian to eject two such children from my school because their mother has the misfortune to have a few drops of african blood in her veins i cannot make up my mind to do it why you yourself must admit that they are as white as any children in the room

i am willing to acknowledge they are but they have nigger blood in them notwithstanding and they are therefore as much niggers as the blackest and have no more right to associate with white children than if they were black as ink i have no more liking for white niggers than for black ones

the teacher was perplexed and turning to mrs stevens said imploringly  this matter seems only known to you  let me appeal to your generosityâsay nothing more about it

i will try to keep your daughter away from them if you wish âbut pray do not urge me to the performance of an act that i am conscious would be unjust

mrs stevenss face assumed a severe and disagreeable expression  i hoped you would look at this matter in a reasonable light and not compel those who would be your friends to appear in the light of enemies if this matter was known to me alone i should remove my daughter and say nothing more about it but unfortunately for you i find that by some means or other both mrs kinney and mrs

both have become informed of the circumstance and are determined to take their children away i thought i would act a friends part by you and try to prevail on you to dismiss these two coloured children at once i so far relied upon your right judgment as to assure them that you would not hesitate for a moment to comply with their wishes and i candidly tell you that it was only by my so doing that they were prevented from keeping their children at home today

miss jordan looked aghast at this startling intelligence if mrs both and mrs kinney withdrew their patronage and influence her little school the sole support of her mother and herself would be wellnigh broken up

she buried her face in her hands and sat in silence for a few seconds then looking at mrs stevens with tearful eyes exclaimed  god forgive me if it must be so nothing but the utter ruin that stares me in the face if i refuse induces me to accede to your request

 i am sorry that you distress yourself so much about it

you know you are your own mistress and can do as you choose said mrs stevens  but if you will be advised by me you will send them away at once

 after school i will hesitatingly replied miss jordan

 i hate to appear so pressing resumed mrs stevens  but i feel it my duty to suggest that you had better do it at once and before the rest of the scholars i did not wish to inform you to what extent this thing had gone but it really has been talked of in many quarters and it is generally supposed that you are cognisant of the fact that the garies are coloured  therefore you see the necessity of doing something at once to vindicate yourself from the reproach of abolitionism at the pronunciation of this then terrible word in such connection with herself miss jordan turned quite pale and for a moment struggled to acquire sufficient control of her feelings to enable her to do as mrs stevens suggested at last bursting into tears she said  oh i cannotâwill notâ do it ill dismiss them but not in that unfeeling manner that i cannot do

the children were now entirely neglecting their lessons and seemed much affected by miss jordans tears of which they could not understand the cause she observing this rang the bell the usual signal for intermission

mrs stevens satisfied with the triumph she had effected took leave of miss jordan after commending her for the sensible conclusion at which she had arrived and promising to procure her two more pupils in the room of those she was about to dismiss

miss jordan was a long time writing the note that she intended sending to mr garie and one of the elder girls returned to the schoolroom wondering at the unusually long time that had been given for recreation

 tell clarence and his sister to come here said she to the girl who had just entered  and whilst they were on their way upstairs she folded the note and was directing it when clarence entered

 clarence said she in a soft voice  put on your hat i have a note of some importance for you to take to your father âyour father rememberâdont give it to any one else

taking out her watch she continued  it is now so late that you would scarcely get back before the time for dismissal so you had better take little emily home with you

i hope maam i havent done anything wrong asked clarence

 oh no quickly replied she youre a dear good boy and have never given me a moments pain since you came to the school and she hurried out into the hall to avoid farther questioning

she could not restrain the tears as she dressed little em whose eyes were large with astonishment at being sent home from school at so early an hour

 teacher is school out   asked she

 no dear not quite  i wanted to send a note to your pa and so i have let clarry go home sooner than usual replied miss jordan kissing her repeatedly whilst the tears were trickling down her cheek

 dont cry teacher i love you said the little blueeyed angel whose lip began to quiver in sympathy  dont cry ill come back again tomorrow

this was too much for the poor teacher who clasped the child in her arms and gave way to a burst of uncontrollable sorrow at last conquering herself with an effort she led the children down stairs kissed them both again and then opening the door she turned them forth into the streetâ turned away from her school these two little children such as god received into his arms and blessed because they were the children of a  nigger woman

 well jule old aunt tabitha is gone at last and i am not at all sorry for it i assure you shes been a complete tax upon me for the last eight years i suppose you wont lament much nor yet go into mourning for her continued mr

stevens looking at her jocularly

im not sorry that i admit rejoined mrs stevens  the poor old soul is better off no doubt but then theres no necessity to speak of the matter in such an offhand manner

how jule i beg you wont attempt to put on the sanctified  thats too much from you who have been wishing her dead almost every day for the last eight years why dont you remember you wished her gone when she had a little money to leave and when she lost that you wished her off our hands because she had none dont pretend to be in the least depressed that wont do with me

 well never mind that said mrs stevens a little confused   what has become of her thingsâher clothing and furniture  

ive ordered the furniture to be sold and all there is of it will not realize sufficient to pay her funeral expenses

brixton wrote me that she has left a bundle of letters directed to me and i desired him to send them on

 i wonder what they can be said mrs stevens

 some trash i suppose an early love correspondence of but little value to any one but herself i do not expect that they will prove of any consequence whatever

dont you think one or the other of us should go to the funeral  asked mrs stevens

 nonsense no i have no money to expend in that way âit is as much as i can do to provide comfortably for the living without spending money to follow the dead replied he  and besides i have a case coming on in the criminal court next week that will absorb all my attention

 what kind of a case is it  she inquired

 a murder case some irishmen were engaged in a row when one of the party received a knock on his head that proved too much for him and died in consequence my client was one of the contending parties  and has been suspected from some imprudent expressions of his to have been the man who struck the fatal blow his preliminary examination comes off tomorrow or next day and i must be present as a matter of course

at an early hour of the morning succeeding this conversation mr stevens might have been seen in his dingy office beated at a rickety desk which was covered with various little bundles carefully tied with red tape the room was gloomy and cheerless and had a mouldy disagreeable atmosphere a fire burned in the coal stove which however seemed only to warm but did not dry the apartment and the windows were covered with a thin coating of vapour

mr stevens was busily engaged in writing when hearing footsteps behind him he turned and saw mr egan a friend of his client entering the room

 good morning mr egan baid he extending his hand   how is our friend mc closkey this morning  

 oh its far down in the mouth he is be jabersâthe life amost scared out of him  

tell him to keep up a good heart and not to be frightened at trifles laughingly remarked mr stevens

 cant your honour come and see him   asked egan

 i cant do that but ill give you a note to constable berry and he will bring mc closkey in here as he takes him to court and mr stevens immediately wrote the note which egan received and departed

after the lapse of a few hours mc closkey was brought by the accommodating constable to the office of mr stevens

hell be safe with you i suppose stevens said the constable but then there is no harm in seeing for ones self that alls secure and thus speaking he raised the window and looked into the yard below the height was too great for his prisoner to escape in that direction  then satisfying himself that the other door only opened into a closet he retired locking mr stevens and his client in the room

mr stevens arose as soon as the door closed behind the constable and stuffed a piece of damp sponge into the keyhole  he then returned and took a seat by his client

 now mc closkey said he in a low tone as he drew his chair closely in front of the prisoner and fixed his keen grey eyes on him â ive seen whitticar and i tell you what it is â youre in a very tight place

hes prepared to swear that he saw you with a slung shot in your handâthat he saw you drop it after the man fell he picked it up and whilst the man was lying dead at his tavern awaiting the coroners inquest he examined the wound and saw in the skull two little dents or holes which were undoubtedly made by the little prongs that are on the leaden ball of the weapon as they correspond in depth and distance apart and moreover the ball is attached to a twisted brace which proves to be the fellow to the one found upon a pair of your trousers what can you say to all this  

mc closkey here gave a smothered groan and his usually red face grew deadly pale in contemplation of his danger

now said mr stevens after waiting long enough for his revelation to have its due effect upon him  there is but one thing to be done we must buy whitticar off have you got any money  i dont mean fifty or a hundred dollars âthat would be of no more use than as many pennies we must have something of a lumpâthree or four hundred at the very least

the prisoner drew his breath very hard at this and remained silent

come speak out continued mr stevens circumstances wont admit of our delayingâthis mans friends will raise heaven and earth to secure your conviction so you see my good fellow its your money or your life you can decide between the twoâyou know which is of the most importance to you

god save us squire how am i to raise that much money

i havent more nor a hunther dollars in the world

 youve got a house and a good horse and dray replied mr stevens who was well posted in the mans pecuniary resources  if you expect me to get you out of this scrape you must sell or mortgage your house and dispose of your horse and dray somehow or other four hundred dollars must be raised or you will be dangling at a ropes end in les than six mouths

 i suppose it will have to go then said mc closkey reluctantly

then give me authority continued mr stevens to arrange for the disposal of the property and i will have your affairs all set straight in less than no time

the constable here cut short any further colloquy by rapping impatiently on the door then opening it and exclaiming come now it is ten oclock â time that you were in court  and the two started out followed by mr

stevens

after having by some of those mysterious plans with which lawyers are familiar been enabled to put off the examination for a few days mr stephens returned to his office and found lying upon his table the packet of letters he was expecting from new york

upon breaking the seal and tearing off the outer covering he discovered a number of letters timeworn and yellow with age they were tied tightly together with a piece of cord cutting this they fell scattered over the desk

taking one of them up he examined it attentively turning it from side to side to endeavour to decipher the halfeffaced postmark  what a ninny i am to waste time in looking at the cover of this when the contents will no doubt explain the whole matter   thus soliloquising he opened the letter and was soon deeply absorbed in its contents he perused and reperused it then opened one after another the remainder that lay scattered before him their contents seemed to agitate him exceedingly as he walked up and down the room with hasty strides muttering angrily to himself and occasionally returning to the desk to reperuse the letters which had so strangely excited him

whilst thus engaged the door was opened by no less a personage than mr morton who walked in and seated himself in a familiar manner

 oh how are you morton you entered with such a ghostly tread that i scarcely heard you said mr stevens with a start  what has procured me the honour of a visit from you this morning  

 i was strolling by and thought i would just step in and inquire how that matter respecting the tenthstreet property has succeeded

hot at allâthe old fellow is as obstinate as a mule he wont sell except on his own terms which are entirely out of all reason i am afraid you will be compelled to abandon your building speculation in that quarter until his demiseâ he is old and feeble and cant last many years in the event of his death you may be able to effect some more favourable arrangement with his heirs

 and perhaps have ten or fifteen years to waitâno that wont do id better sell out myself what would you advise me to do stevens  

mr stevens was silent for a few moments then having opened the door and looked into the entry he closed it carefully placed the piece of sponge in the keyhole and returned to his seat at the desk sayingâ  weve transacted enough business together to know one another pretty well so ive no hesitation in confiding to you a little scheme ive conceived for getting into our hands a large proportion of property in one of the lower districts at a very low figure and tis probable that the same plan if it answers will assist you materially in carrying out your designs it will require the aid of two or three moneyed men like yourself and if successful will without doubt be highly remunerative

 if successful rejoined mr morton  yes there is the rub how are you to guarantee success  

hear my plan and then you can decide in the first place you know as well as i that a very strong feeling exists in the community against the abolitionists and very properly too this feeling requires to be guided into some proper current and i think we can give it that necessary guidance and at the same time render it subservient to our own purposes you are probably aware that a large amount of property in the lower part of the city is owned by niggers and if we can create a mob and direct it against them they will be glad to leave that quarter and remove further up into the city for security and protection once get the mob thoroughly aroused and have the leaders under our control and we may direct its energies against any parties we desire and we can render the district so unsafe that property will be greatly lessened in valueâthe houses will rent poorly and many proprietors will be happy to sell at very reduced prices if you can furnish me the means to start with i have men enough at my command to effect the rest we will bo control the elections in the district through these men as to place in office only such persons as will wink at the disturbances when through their agency we have brought property down sufficiently low we will purchase all that we can reestablish order and quiet and sell again at an immense advantage

your scheme is a good one i must confess and i am ready to join you at any time i will communicate with carson who i think will be interested as he desired to invest with me in those tenthstreet improvements i will call in tomorrow and endeavour to persuade him to accompany me and then we can discuss the matter more fully

 well do but one word before you go you appear to know everybodyâwho is anybodyâsouth of mason and dixons line  can you give me any information respecting a family by the name of garie who live or formerly did live in the vicinity of savannah  

 oh yesâi know them root and branch although there is but little of the latter left they are one of the oldest families in georgiaâthose of whom i have heard the most are of the last two generations there now remain of the family but two personsâold john or jack garie as he is called a bachelorâand who i have recently learned is at the point of death and a crackbrained nephew of his living in this cityâsaid to be married to a nigger womanâactually married to her dr blackly informed me last week that he sent for him to perform the ceremony which he very properly refused to do i have no doubt however that he has been successful in procuring the services of some one else i am sorry to say there are some clergymen in our city who would willingly assist in such a disgraceful proceeding

what ever could have induced a man with his prospects to throw himself away in that manner i am at loss to determineâhe has an independent fortune of about one hundred thousand dollars besides expectations from his uncle who is worth a considerable sum of money i suppose these little darkies of his will inherit it concluded mr morton

 are there no other heirs   asked mr stevens in a tone of deep interest

 there may be he had an aunt who married an exceedingly low fellow from the north who treated her shamefully

the mercenary scoundrel no doubt expected to have acquired a fortune with her as it was generally understood that she was sole heiress of her mothers propertyâbut it turned out to be an entire mistake the circumstance made considerable stir at the time i remember having heard my elders discuss it some years after its occurrence but why do you take such an interest in it you charged me with coming upon you like a ghost i could return the compliment

why man you look like a sheet what ails you  

 meâiâoh nothingânothing im perfectly wellâ that is to say i was up rather late last night and am rather fatigued to dayânothing more

you looked so strange that i could not help being frightenedâand you seemed so interested you must have some personal motive for inquiring

no more than a lawyer often has in the business of his clients i have been commissioned to obtain some information respecting these peopleâa mere matter of business nothing more believe me call in again soon and endeavour to bring carson but pray be discreetâbe very careful to whom you mention the matter

never fear said mr morton as he closed the door behind him and sauntered lazily out of the house

mr morton speculated in stocks and townlots in the same spirit that he had formerly betted at the racecourse and cockpit in his dear palmetto state it was a pleasant sort of excitement to him and without excitement of some kind he would have found it impossible to exist to have frequented gaming hells and race courses in the north would have greatly impaired his social position and as he set a high value upon that he was compelled to forego his favourite pursuits and associate himself with a set of men who conducted a system of gambling operations upon change of a less questionable but equally exciting character

mr stevens sat musing at his desk for some time after the departure of his visitor then taking up one of the letters that had so strongly excited him he read and reread it then crushing it in his hand arose stamped his feet and exclaimed  ill have it if i here he stopped short and looking round caught a view of his face in the glass he sank back into the chair behind him horrified at the lividness of his countenance

good god he soliloquized i look like a murderer already and he covered his face with his hands and turned away from the glass  but i am wrong to be excited thus  men who accomplish great things approach them coolly so must i i must plot watch and waitand thus speaking he put on his hat and left the office

as mr stevens approached his house a handsome carriage drove up to the door of his neighbour and mr garie and his wife who had been enjoying a drive along the bank of the river alighted and entered their residence the rustle of her rich silk dress grated harshly on his ear and the soft perfume that wafted toward him as she glided by was the very reverse of pleasant to him

mr garie bowed stiffly to him as they stood on the steps of their respective residences which were only divided by the low iron fence  but beyond the slight inclination of the head took no further notice of him

 the cursed haughty brute muttered mr stevens as he jerked the bell with violence   how i hate him i hated him before i knewâbut now i  as he spoke the door was opened by a little servant that mrs stevens had recently obtained from a charity institution

 youve kept me standing a pretty time exclaimed he savagely as he seized her ear and gave it a spiteful twist cant you manage to open the door quicker 

 i was up in the garret and didnt hear the bell she replied timidly

then ill improve your hearing he continued malignantly as he pulled her by the ear take that now and see if youll keep me standing at the door an hour again

striding forward into the back parlour he found his wife holding a small rattan elevated over little lizzy in a threatening attitude

 will you never mind me  ive told you again and again not to go and still you persist in disobeying me ill cut you to pieces if you dont mind will you ever go again   she almost screamed in the ears of the terrified child

 oh no mother never please dont whip me ill mind you and as she spoke she shrank as far as possible into the corner of the room

 whats all thisâwhats the matter jule  what on earth are you going to whip liz for 

 because she deserves it was the sharp reply  she dont mind a word i say ive forbid her again and again to go next door to visit those little niggers and she will do it in spite of me she slipped off this afternoon and has been in their house over an hour and it was only this morning i detected her kissing their clarence through the fence

 faugh said mr stevens with a look of disgust you kissed a nigger im ashamed of you you nasty little thing your mother ought to have taken a scrubbingbrush and cleaned your mouth never do such a thing again come here to me

as he spoke he extended his hand and grasped the delicately rounded arm of his little girl

 what induces you to go amongst those people hasnt your mother again and again forbidden you to do so why do you go i say   he continued shaking her roughly by the arm and frowning savagely why dont you answerâ speak 

the child with the tears streaming down her lovely face was only able to answer in her defence  oh pa i do love them so

you do do you replied her exasperated father stamping his foot and pushing her from him  go to bed and if ever i hear of you going there again you shall be well whipped

the tearful face lingered about the door in hope of a reprieve that did not come and then disappeared for the night

 the children must not be suffered to go in there jule something ive learned today will here mr stevens checked himself and in answer to his wifes impatient  what have you learned   replied  oh nothing of consequenceânothing that will interest you and sat with his slipper in his hand engaged in deep thought

now for mr stevens to commence a communication to his wife and then break off in the middle of it was as novel as disagreeable as he was generally very communicative and would detail to her in the evening with pleasing minuteness all the rogueries he had accomplished during the day and his unwillingness to confide something that evidently occupied his mind caused his spouse to be greatly irritated

mr stevens drank his tea in silence and during the evening continued absorbed in reflection and notwithstanding the various illnatured remarks of his wife upon his strange conduct retired without giving her the slightest clue to its cause

mr stevens awoke at a very early hour the ensuing morning and quite unceremoniously shook his wife to arouse her also this he accomplished after considerable labour for mrs stevens was much more sleepy than usual in consequence of her husbands restlessness the previous night

 i declare said she rubbing her eyes  i dont get any peace of my life you lie awake kicking about half the night muttering and whispering about no one knows what and then want me to rise before day what are you in such a hurry for this morningâno more mysteries i hope  

 oh come jule get up   said her husband impatiently

 i must be off to my business very early i am overburthened with different things this morning

mrs stevens made a very hasty toilette and descended to the kitchen where the little charitygirl was bustling about with her eyes only half open with her assistance the breakfast was boon prepared and mr stevens called downstairs he ate rapidly and silently and at the conclusion of his meal put on his hat and wished his amiable spouse an abrupt good morning

after leaving his house he did not take the usual course to his office but turned his steps toward the lower part of the city hastening onward he soon left the improved parts of it in his rear and entered upon a shabby district

the morning was very chilly and as it was yet quite early but few people were stirring they were labourers hurrying to their work milkmen and trundlers of breadcarts

at length he stopped at the door of a tavern over which was a large sign bearing the name of whitticar on entering he found two or three forlornlooking wretches clustering round the stove endeavouring to receive some warmth upon their halfclothed bodiesâtheir red and pimpled noses being the only parts about them that did not look cold they btared wonderingly at mr stevens as he entered  for a person so respectable as himself in appearance was but seldom seen in that house

the boy who attended the bar inquired from behind the counter what he would take

 mr whitticar if you please blandly replied mr

stevens

hearing this the boy bolted from the shop and quite alarmed the family by stating that there was a man in the shop who said he wanted to take mr whitticar and he suspected that he was a policeman

whitticar who was seldom entirely free from some scrape went through another door to take a survey of the new comer and on ascertaining who it was entered the room

youve quite upset the family we all took you fora constable said he approaching mr stevens who shook hands with him heartily and then laying his arm familiarly on his shoulder rejoinedâ  i say whitticar i want about five minutes conversation with you havent you some room where we can be quite private for a little while  

 yes come this way replied he and leading his visitor through the bar they entered a small back room the door of which they locked behind them

how whitticar said mr stevens i want you to act the part of a friend by the fellow who got in that awkward scrape at this house as you did not give the evidence you informed me you were possessed of at the coroners inquest it is unnecessary for you to do so before the magistrate at examination there is no use in hanging the fellowâ it cannot result in any benefit to yourself it will only attract disagreeable notice to your establishment and possibly may occasion a loss of your licence we will be willing to make it worth your while to absent yourself for a short time at least until the trial is over it will put money in your purse and save this poor devils life besides what do you say to receiving a hundred and fifty and going off for a month or two  

 couldnt think of it mr stevens no how see how my business would suffer everything would be at loose ends

i should be obliged to hire a man to take my place and in that case i must calculate upon his stealing at least twentyfive per cent of the receipts and then there is his wages no no that wont do besides im trying to obtain the nomination for the office of aldermanâto secure it i must be on the spot nothing like looking out for oneself

i am afraid i cant accommodate you squire unless you can offer something better than one hundred and fifty

youve got no conscience rejoined mr stevens not a bit

 well the less of that the better for me  its a thing of very little use in the rumselling business it interferes with tradeâso i cant afford to keep a conscience if you really want me to go make me a better offer say two fifty and ill begin to think of it the trial will be over in a month or six weeks i suppose and a spree of that length would be very pleasant

no i wont do that whitticarâthats flat but ill tell you what i will do ill make it two hundred and what is more ill see to your nomination im all right down here you know i own the boys in this district and if youll say youll put some little matters through for me after you are elected ill call it a bargain

 then im your man said whitticar extending his hand

well then added stevens come to my office this morning and you shall have the money after that i shall expect you to get out of town as quick as possible goodbye

 so far all right muttered mr stevens with an air of intense satisfaction as he left the house  hell be of great use to me when it becomes necessary to blind the public by a sham investigation he will be the man to conduct it when i want a man released from prison or a little job of that kind done he will do itâthis act will put him in my power and i am much mistaken if he wont prove of the utmost service in our riot scheme now then we will have an examination of mc closkey as soon as they like

a few weeks subsequent to the events we have just written we find mr stevens seated in his dingy office in company with the mc closkey who had recently been discharged from custody in default of sufficient evidence being found to warrant his committal for trial he was sitting with his feet upon the stove and was smoking a cigar in the most freeandeasy manner imaginable

 so far so good said mr stevens as he laid down the letter he was perusing  that simplifies the matter greatly  and whatever is to be done towards his removal must be done quicklyânow that the old man is dead there is but one to deal with

during the interval that had elapsed between the interview of mr stevens with whitticar and the period to which we now refer mr stevens had been actively engaged in promoting his riot scheme and already several disturbances had occurred in which a number of inoffensive coloured people had been injured in their persons and property

but this was only a faint indication of what was to follow and as he had through the agency of mr morton and others been able to prevent any but the most garbled statements of these affairs from getting abroad there was but little danger of their operations being interfered with leading articles daily appeared in the public journals particularly those that circulated amongst the lowest classes in which the negroes were denounced in the strongest terms it was averred that their insolence since the commencement of the abolition agitation had become unbearable and from many quarters was suggested the absolute necessity for inflicting some general chastisement to convince them that they were still negroes and to teach them to remain in their proper place in the body politic

many of these articles were written by mr stevens and their insertion as editorials procured through the instrumentality of mr morton and his friends

mr stevens turned to his visitor and inquired  what was done last nightâmuch of anything  

a great deal yer honour replied mc closkey a nagur or two half killed and one house set on fire and nearly burned up

is that all said mr stevens with a wellassumed look of disappointment is that all why you are a miserable set you should have beaten every darky out of the district by this time

theyre not so aisily bate out â they fight like sevin divils one o em night before last split mikey dolans head clane open and its a small chance of his life hes got to comfort himself wid

 chances of warâchances of war  rejoined mr stevens â mere trifles when you get used to em  you mustnt let that stop youâyou have a great deal yet to do what you have already accomplished is a very small matter compared with what is expected and what i intend you to do your work has only just begun man

 jist begun  replied the astonished mc closkey havent we bin raising the very divil every night for the last weekâ running a near chance of being kilt all the timeâand all for nothing  its gettin tiresome one dont like to be fighting the nagurs all the time for the mere fun of the thingâit dont pay for divil a cent have i got for all my trouble and ye said ye would pay well ye remimber

 so i shall said mr stevens  when you do something worth paying forâthe quarter is not accomplished yet i want the place made so hot down there that the niggers cant stay go ahead dont give them any restâill protect you from the consequences whatever they be  ive great things in store for you continued he moving nearer and speaking in a confidential tone  how should you like to return to ireland a moneyed man  

 i should like it well enough to be sure but wheres the money to come from squire  

 oh theres money enough to be had if you have the courage to earn it

 im willin enough to earn an honest penny but i dont like risking me neck for it squire its clear yell not be aftker givin me a dale of money widout being sure of havin the worth of it out o me and its dirty work enough ive done widout the doin of any more me conscience is a sore throuble to me about the other job be the powers im out o that and divil a like scrape will i get in agin wid my own consint

your conscience has become troublesome very suddenly

rejoined mr stevens with a look of angry scorn its strange it dont appear to have troubled you in the least during the last few weeks whilst you have been knocking niggers on the head so freely

well im tired o that work interrupted mc closkey  and whats more ill soon be lavin of it off

well see about that said mr stevens youre a pretty fellow now aint youâgrateful tooâvery here ive been successful in getting you out of a hanging scrape and require a trifling service in return and you retire youll find this trifling wont do with me continued mr stevens with great sternness of manner  you shall do as i wish you are in my power i need your services and i will have themâmake up your mind to that

mc closkey was somewhat staggered at this bold declaration from mr stevens but he soon assumed his former assured manner and replied id like to know how im in your power  as far as this riot business is concerned youre as deep in the mud as im in the mire as for the other be st patrick im clane out o thatâthey dont try a man twice for the same thing

 dont halloo so loud my fine fellow sneeringly rejoined mr stevens you are not entirely out of the wood yet you are by no means as safe as you imagineâyou havent been tried yet you have only been examined before a magistrate

they lacked sufficient evidence to commit you for trialâthat evidence i can produce at any time so remember if you please you have not been tried yet when you have been and acquitted be kind enough to let me know will you  

mr stevens stood for a few moments silently regarding the change his language had brought over the now crestfallen mc closkey he then continuedâ dont think you can escape meâill have a thousand eyes upon you no one ever escapes me that i wish to retain do as i require and ill promote your interest in every possible way and protect you but waver or hold back and ill hang you as unhesitatingly as if you were a dog

this threat was given in a tone that left no doubt on the mind of the hearer but that mr stevens would carry out his expressed intention and the reflections thereby engendered by no means added to the comfort or sense of security that mc closkey had flattered himself he was in future to enjoy  he therefore began to discover the bad policy of offending one who might prove so formidable an enemyâof incensing one who had it in his power to retaliate by such terrible measures

he therefore turned to mr stevens with a somewhat humbled manner and said you neednt get so mad squire âsure its but natural that a man shouldnt want to get any deeper in the mire than he can help  and ive enough on my hands now to make them too red to look at wid comfortsure its not a shade deeper youd have em   he asked looking inquiringly at mr stevens who was compelled to turn away his face for a moment to hide his agitation

at last he mastered his countenance and in as cool a tone as he could assume replied  oh a little more on them will be scarcely a perceptible addition you know the old adage  in for a penny in for a pound you need have no fear said he lowering his voice almost to a whisper it can be done in a crowdâand at nightâno one will notice it

 i dont know about that squireâin a crowd some one will be sure to notice it its too dangerousâi cant do it

 tut tut man  dont talk like a fool i tell you there is no danger you in company with a mob of others are to attack this mans house when he makes his appearance as he will be sure to do shoot him down

good god squire said mccioskey his face growing pale at the prospect of what was required of him  you talk of murder as if it was mere play  

and still i never murdered any one rejoined mr

stevens significantly   come comeâput your scruples in your pocket and make up your mind to go through with it like a man when the thing is done you shall have five thousand dollars in hard cash and you can go with it where you please now what do you think of that 

 ah squire the moneys a great timptation but its an awful job

 no worse than you did for nothing replied mr stevens

 but that was in a fair fight and in hot blood it isnt like planning to kill a man squire

do you call it a fair fight when you steal up behind a man and break his skull with a slung shot   asked mr

stevens

mccioskey was unable to answer this and sat moodily re gliding his tempter

 m gome make up your mind to itâyou might as well resumed mr stevens in a coaxing tone

ye seem bent on not giving it up and i suppose ill have to do it replied mccioskey reluctantly   but what has the done to yes squire that youre so down upon him 

oh he is one of those infernal abolitionists and one of the very worst kind he lives with a nigger womanâand what is more he is married to her 

married to a nigger exclaimed mccioskeyâits a quare taste the animal hasâbut youre not afther killing him for that theres something more behind its not for having a black wife instead of a white one youd be afther murthering himâyell get no stuff like that down me

no it is not for that alone i acknowledge rejoined mr stevens with considerable embarrassment  he insulted me some time ago and i want to be revenged upon him

its a dear job to insult you at that rate squire but where does he live  

 in my neighbourhoodâin fact next door to me replied mr stevens with an averted face

 howly mother not away up thereâsure its crazy ye are

what away up there in the city limitsâwhy they would have the police and the sogers at our heels in less than no time sure youre out o your sinses to have me go up there with a mob no noâtheres too much riskâi cant try that

 i tell you there shall be no risk impatiently replied mr

stevens  its not to be done tonight nor tomorrow night and when i say do it you shall do it and as safely there as anywhere only come to the conclusion that a thing must be done and it is half finished already you have only to make up your mind that you will accomplish a design in spite of obstacles and what you once thought to be insurmountable difficulties will prove mere straws in your path but we are wasting time ive determined you shall do it and i hope you now know me well enough to be convinced that it is your best policy to be as obliging as possible you had better go now and be prepared to meet me tonight at whitticars

after the door closed upon the retreating form of mc closkey the careless expression that mr stevenss countenance had worn during the conversation gave place to one full of anxiety and apprehension and he shuddered as he contemplated the fearful length to which he was proceeding

if i fail said heâpshaw ill not failâi must not foilâfor failure is worse than ruin but coolâcool he continued sitting down to his deskâ those who work nervously do nothing right he sat writing uninterruptedly until quite late in the afternoon when the fading sunlight compelled him to relinquish his pen and prepare for home

thrusting the papers into his pocket he hurried toward the newspaper office from which were to emanate as editorials the carefully concocted appeals to the passions of the rabble which he had been all the afternoon so busily engaged in preparing

the amiable partner of mr stevens sat in high dudgeon at being so long restrained from her favourite beverage by the unusually deferred absence of her husband at length she was rejoiced by hearing his wellknown step as he came through the garden and the rattle of his latchkey as he opened the door was quite musical in her ears

 i thought you was never coming said she querulously as he entered the room  i have been waiting tea until i am almost starved

you neednt have waited a moment for you will be obliged to eat alone after all im going out pour me out a cup of teaâill drink it whilst im dressing and continued mr stevens i want you to get me that old brown overcoat and those striped trowsers i used to wear occasionally

 why you told me rejoined mrs stevens  that you did not require them again and so i exchanged them for this pair of vases today

 the devil you did  said mr stevens angrily  you let them lie about the house for nearly a yearâand now just as they were likely to be of some service to me youve sold them its just like youâalways doing something at the wrong time

 how on earth stevens was i to know you wanted them  

 well there jule theyre gone dont lets have any more talk about it get me another cup of tea  i must go out immediately

after hastily swallowing the second cup mr stevens left his home and walked to an omnibusstation from whence he was quickly transported to a street in the lower part of the city in which were a number of secondhand clothing stores

these places were supported principally by the country people who attended the market in the same street and who fancied that the clothing they purchased at these shops must be cheap because it was at secondhand

mr stevens stopped at the door of one of these establishments and paused to take a slight survey of the premises before entering the doorway was hung with coats of every fashion of the last twenty years and all in various stages of decay some of them looked quite respectable from much cleaning and patching  and others presented a reckless and forlorn aspect as their worn and ragged sleeves swung about in the evening air old hats some of which were in all probability worn at a period anterior to the revolution kept company with the wellblacked shoes that were ranged on shelves beside the doorway where they served in the capacity of signs and fairly indicated the style of goods to be purchased within

seeing that there were no buyers in the store mr stevens opened the door and entered the sounds of his footsteps drew from behind the counter no less a personage than our redoubtable friend kinch who in the absence of his father was presiding over the establishment

well snowball said mr stevens do you keep this curiosityshop  

 my name is not snowball and this aint a curiosityshop

replied kinch  do you want to buy anything  

 i believe i do answered mr stevens let me look at some coatsâone that i can get onâi wont say fit me im indifferent about thatâlet me see some of the worst youve got

kinch looked surprised at this request from a gentleman of mr stevenss appearance and handed out quite mechanically a coat that was but slightly worn

oh that wont doâi want something like this said mr stevens taking down from a peg a very dilapidated coat of drab colour and peculiar cut what do you ask for this  

 thats not fit for a gentleman like you sir said kinch

 im the best judge of that matter rejoined mr stevens

 what is the price of it  

 oh that coat you can have for a dollar replied kinch

 then ill take it now hand out some trowsers

the trowsers were brought and from a large number mr

stevens selected a pair that suited him then adding an old hat to his list of purchases he declared his fitout complete

 cant you accommodate me with some place where i can put these on   he asked of kinch  im going to have a little sport with some friends of mine and i want to wear them

kinch led the way into a back room where he assisted mr

stevens to array himself in his newlypurchased garments

by the change in his attire he seemed completely robbed of all appearance of respectability the most disagreeable points of his physique seemed to be brought more prominently forward by the habiliments he had assumed they being quite in harmony with his villanous countenance

kinch who looked at him with wonder was forced to remark  why you dont look a bit like a gentleman now sir

mr stevens stepped forward and surveyed himself in the lookingglass the transformation was completeâsurprising even to himself i never knew before said he mentally  how far a suit of clothes goes towards giving one the appearance of a gentleman

he now emptied the pockets of the suit he had onâin so doing he dropped upon the floor without observing it one of the papers

 fold these up said he handing to kinch the suit he had just taken off  and tomorrow bring them to this address as he spoke he laid his card upon the counter and after paying for his new purchases walked out of the shop and bent his steps in the direction of whitticars tavern

on arriving there he found the barroom crowded with halfdrunken men the majority of whom were irishmen armed with bludgeons of all sizes and shapes his appearance amongst them excited but little attention and he remained there some time before he was recognized by the master of the establishment

 by the howly st patherick i didnt know you squire what have you been doing to yourself  

 hist  cried mr stevens putting his fingers to his lips  i thought it was best to see how matters were progressing so ive run down for a little while how are you getting on  

pine fine squire replied whitticar the boys are ripe for anything they talk of burning down a nigger church

hot tonightâthey must not do such a thing tonightâ we are not ready for that yet ive made out a little listâ some of the places on it they might have a dash at tdnight just to keep their hands in as mr stevens spoke he fumbled in his pocket for the list in question and was quite surprised to be unable to discover it

 cant you find it squire   asked whitticar

 i must have lost it on the way replied mr stevens

 i am sure i put k in this pocket and he made another search  ho useâill have to give it up said he at length  but where is mc closkey  i havent seen him since i came in

 he came here this afternoon very far gone  he had been crooking his elbow pretty frequently and was so very drunk that i advised him to go home and go to bed so he took another dram and went away and i havent seen him since

 thats bad very badâeverything goes wrong this eveningâi wanted him tonight particularly

 wouldnt the boys go out with you   suggested whitticar

no no that wouldnt do at all i mustnt appear in these things if im hauled up for participation who is to be your lawyerâeh  

 true for you rejoined whitticar  and ill just disperse the crowd as soon as i can and there will be one peaceable night in the district at any rate

not liking to give directions to the mob personally and his useful coadjutor mc closkey not being at hand mr

stevens came to the conclusion he would return to his home and on the next evening a descent should be made upon the places marked on the list

taking out his watch he found it would be too late to return to the store where he had purchased his present adornments so he determined to start for home

the coat that temporarily adorned the person of mr

stevens was of peculiar cut and colourâit was in fact rather in the rowdy style and had in its pristine state bedecked the person of a member of a notorious fire company these gentry had for a long time been the terror of the district in which they roamed and had rendered themselves highly obnoxious to some of the rival factions on the borders of their own territory they had the unpleasant habit of pitching into and maltreating without the slightest provocation any one whom their practised eyes discovered to be a rival and by such outrages they had excited in the bosoms of their victims a desire for revenge that only awaited the occasion to manifest itself

mr stevens in happy unconsciousness that owing to his habiliments he represented one of the wellknown and hated faction walked on quite leisurely but unfortunately for him his way home lay directly through the camp of their bitterest and most active enemies

standing in front of a tavernwindow through which a bright light shone were a group of young men who bestowed upon mr stevens more than passing attention

im blest exclaimed one of them if there aint a ranger 

now that is a saucy piece of business aint it that fellow has come up here to be able to go back and play braggame

lets wallop him then suggested another and teach him better than to come parading himself in  our parts i owe em something for the way they served me when i was down in their district

well come on said the first speaker or he will get away whilst we are jawing about what we shall do

advancing to mr stevens he tapped that gentleman on the shoulder and said with mock civility and in as bland a tone as he could assume  its really very obliging of you mister to come up here to be floggedâsaves us the trouble of coming down to you we would like to settle with you for that drubbing you gave one of our boys last week

 you must be mistaken replied mr stevens   i dont know anything of the affair to which you allude

 you dont eh well take that then to freshen your memory exclaimed one of the party at the same time dealing him a heavy blow on the cheek which made the lamplights around appear to dance about in the most fantastic style

the first impulse of mr stevens was to cry out for the watchman  but a moments reflection suggested the impolicy of that project as he would inevitably be arrested with the rest and to be brought before a magistrate in his present guise would have entailed upon him very embarrassing explanations he therefore thought it best to beg offâto throw himself as it were upon their sympathies

 stop gentlemenâstopâfor gods sake stop he cried as soon as he could regain the breath that had been almost knocked out of him by the tremendous blow he had just receivedâ dont kill an innocent man upon my honour i never saw you before nor ever assaulted any of you in my life my dear friends he continued in a dolorous tone  please let me goâyou are quite mistaken  i assure you i am not the man

 no we aint mistaken either youre one of the rangers  i know you by your coat replied one of the assaulters

it now flashed upon mr stevens that he had brought himself into these difficulties by the assumption of the dress he then wore he therefore quickly rejoinedâ oh it is not my coatâi only put it on for a joke 

 thats a likely tale responded one of the party who looked very incredulous  i dont believe a word of it

thats some darned stuff youve trumped up thinking to gammon usâit wont go down  well just give you a walloping if its only to teach you to wear your own clothesâ and suiting the action to the word he commenced pommelling him unmercifully

 help help  screamed mr stevens  dont kill me gentlemenâdont kill me  

 oh we wont kill youâwell only come as near it as we can without quite finishing you cried one of his relentless tormentors

on hearing this their victim made a frantic effort to break away and not succeeding in it he commenced yelling at the top of his voice as is usual in such cases the watchman was nowhere to be seen and his cries only exasperated his persecutors the more

 hit him in the breadcrusher and stop his noise suggested one of the party farthest off from mr stevens this piece of advice was carried into immediate effect and the unfortunate wearer of the obnoxious coat received a heavy blow in the mouth which cut his lips and knocked out one of his front teeth

his cries now became so loud as to render it necessary to gag him which was done by one of the party in the most thorough and expeditious manner they then dragged him into a wheelwrights shop near by where they obtained some tar with which they coated his face completely

 oh dont he look like a nigger  said one of the party when they had finished embellishing their victim

 rub some on his hands and then let him go suggested another  when he gets home i guess hell surprise his mammy  i dont believe his own dog will know him   a shout of laughter followed this remark in the midst of which they ungagged mr stevens and turned him from the door

 now run for itâcut the quickest kind of time exclaimed one of them as he gave him a kick to add impetus to his forward movement

this aid was however entirely unnecessary for mr

stevens shot away from the premises like an arrow from a bow and that too without any observation upon the direction in which he was going

as soon as he felt himself out of the reach of his tormentors he sat down upon the steps of a mansion to consider what was best to be done all the shops and even the taverns were closedânot a place was open where he could procure the least assistance he had not even an acquaintance in the neighbourhood to whom he might apply

he was indeed a pitiable object to look upon the hat he had so recently purchased bad as it was when it came into his possession was now infinitely less presentable in the severe trials it had undergone in company with its unfortunate owner it had lost its tip and half the brim the countenance beneath it would however have absorbed the gazers whole attention his lips were swelled to a size that would have been regarded as large even on the face of a congo negro and one eye was puffed out to an alarming extent whilst the coating of tar he had received rendered him such an object as the reader can but faintly picture to himself

the door of the mansion was suddenly opened and there issued forth a party of young men evidently in an advanced state of intoxication hallo  heres a darkey  exclaimed one of them as the light from the hall fell upon the upturned face of mr stevens ha ha heres a darkeyânow for some fun 

mr stevens was immediately surrounded by half a dozen welldressed young men who had evidently been enjoying an entertainment not conducted upon temperance principles

 spirit ofâhicâhicânight whence cococomest thou  

stammered one  spppeakâart thou a creature of the magmagnationgoblindamned or only a niggerâspeak

mr stevens who at once recognized one or two of the parties as slight acquaintances would not open his mouth for fear that his voice might discover him as to them above all persons he would have shrunk from making himself known he therefore began to make signs as though he were dumb

let him alone said one of the more sober of the party   hes a poor dumb fellowâlet him go his voice was disregarded however as the rest seemed bent on having some sport

a halfhogshead nearly filled with water which stood upon the edge of the pavement for the convenience of the builders who were at work next door caught the attention of one of them

 lets make him jump into this he exclaimed at the same time motioning to mr stevens to that effect by dint of great effort they made him understand what was required and they then continued to make him jump in and out of the hogshead for several minutes then joining hands they danced around him whilst he stood kneedeep in the water shivering and making the most imploring motions to be set at liberty

whilst they were thus engaged the door again opened and the fashionable mr morton who had been one of the guests descended the steps and came to see what had been productive of so much mirth

what have you got here  he asked pressing forward until he saw the battered form of mr stevens  oh let the poor darkey go he continued compassionately for he had just drunk enough to make him feel humane let the poor fellow go its a shame to treat him in this manner

as he spoke he endeavoured to take from the hands of one of the party a piece of chip with which he was industriously engaged in streaking the face of mr stevens with lime  let me alone mortonâlet me alone im making a white man of him im going to make him a glorious fellowcitizen and have him run for congress let me alone i say

mr morton was able however after some persuasion to induce the young men to depart and as hi home lay in a direction opposite to theirs he said to mr stevens  come on old fellow ill protect you

aa soon as they were out of hearing of the others mr

stevens exclaimed  dont you know me morton  

mr morton started back with surprise and looked at his companion in a bewildered manner then exclaimed  no ill be hanged if i do who the devil are you 

 im stevens you know me

 indeed i dont whos stevens  

 you dont know me why im george stevens the lawyer

mr morton thought that he now recognized the voice and as they were passing under the lamp at the time mr stevens said to him  put your finger on my face and you will soon see it is only tar mr morton did as he was desired and found his finger smeared with the sticky article

 what on earth have you been doing with yourself  he asked with great surprise  what is all this masquerading for

mr stevens hereupon related his visit at whitticars and detailed the events that had subsequently occurred

mr morton gave vent to shouts of laughter as he listened to the recital of his friend  by george   he exclaimed  ill have to tell that it is too goodto keep

oh no dont said mr stevens that wont doâyou forget what i came out for  

 true rejoined mr morton   i suppose it will be best to keep mum about it ill go home with you you might fall into the hands of the philistines again

 thank youâthank you replied mr stevens who felt greatly relieved to have some company for his further protection   and continued he  if i could only get some of this infernal stuff off my face i should be so glad let us try

accordingly they stopped at the nearest pump and endeavoured to remove some of the obnoxious tar from his face but unfortunately the only result obtained by their efforts was to rub it more thoroughly in so they were compelled to give up in despair and hasten onward

mr stevens rang so loudly at the door as to quite startle his wife and the charitygirl both of whom had fallen into a sound sleep as they sat together awaiting his return mr

morton who as we have said before was not entirely sober was singing a popular melody and keeping time upon the door with the head of his cane now in all her life mrs

stevens had never heard her husband utter a note and being greatly frightened at the unusual noise upon the doorstep held a hurried consultation with the charitygirl upon the best mode of proceeding

 call through the keyhole maam suggested she which advice mrs stevens immediately followed and inquired  whos there  

 open the door jule dont keep me out here with your darned nonsense  let me in quick

yes let him in added mr morton  hes brought a gentleman from africa with him

mrs stevens did not exactly catch the purport of the words uttered by mr morton  and therefore when she opened the door and her husband with his wellblacked face stalked into the entry she could not repress a scream of fright at the hideous figure he presented

hush hush he exclaimed dont arouse the neighboursâits me  dont you know my voice

mrs stevens stared at him in a bewildered manner and after bidding mr morton good night she closed and locked the door and followed her husband into the back room

in a short time he recapitulated the events of the night to his astonished and indignant spouse who greatly commiserated his misfortunes a bottle of sweet oil was brought into requisition and she made a lengthened effort to remove the tar from her husbands face in which she only partially succeeded  and it was almost day when he crawled off to bed with the skin half scraped off from his swollen face

immediately after the departure of mr stevens master kinch began to consider the propriety of closing the establishment for the night sliding down from the counter where he had been seated reflecting upon the strange conduct of his recent customer he said  i feels rather queer round about here laying his hand upon his stomach and im inclined to think that some of them ere jersey sausages and buckwheat cakes that the old man has been stuffing himself with wouldnt go down slow bather shabby in him not to come back and let me go home and have a slap at the wittles

i expect nothing else but that he has eat so much that hes fell asleep at the suppertable and wont wake up till bedtime hes always serving me that same trick

the old man thus alluded to was no other than master kinchs father who had departed from the shop two or three hours previously promising to return immediately after tea

this promise appeared to have entirely faded from his recollection as he was at that moment as kinch had supposed fast asleep and totally oblivious of the fact that such a person as his hungry descendant was in existence

having fully come to the conclusion to suspend operations for the evening kinch made two or three excursions into the street returning each time laden with old hats coats and shoes these he deposited on the counter without order or arrangement muttering as he did so that the old man could sort em out in the morning to suit himself the things being all brought from the street he had only to close the shutters which operation was soon effected and our hungry friend on his way home

the next morning mr de younge for the father of kinch rejoiced in that aristocratic cognomen was early at his receptacle for old clothes and it being marketday he anticipated doing a good business the old man leisurely took down the shutters assorted and hung out the old clothes and was busily engaged in sweeping out the store when his eye fell upon the paper dropped by mr stevens the evening previous

 whats dis ere said he stooping to pick it up   bill or suthin like it i spose what a trial tis not to be able to read writin dont know whether tis worth keeping or not best save it though till dat ar boy of mine comes he can read itâhes a scholar ah de children nowadays has greater vantages than deir poor fathers had

whilst he was thus soliloquizing his attention was arrested by the noise of footsteps in the other part of the shop and looking up he discerned the tall form of mr walters

 why bless me said the old man  dis is an early visit where you come from honey dis time o day  

 oh i take a walk every morning to breathe a little of the fresh air it gives one an appetite for breakfast you know youll let me take the liberty of sitting on your counter wont you   he continued  i want to read a little article in a newspaper i have just purchased

assent being readily given mr walters was soon perusing the journal with great attention  at last he tossed it from him in an impatient manner and exclaimed  of all lying rascals i think the reporters for this paper are the greatest now for instance three or four nights since a gang of villains assaulted one of my tenantsâa coloured manâupon his own doorstep and nearly killed him and that too without the slightest provocation they then set fire to the house which was half consumed before it could be extinguished  and it is here stated that the coloured people were the aggressors and whilst they were engaged in the melee the house caught fire accidentally

yes rejoined mr de younge things are gitting mighty critical even in dese ere parts  and i wouldnt live furder down town if you was to give me a house rentfree

why its raly dangerous to go home nights down dere

and there is no knowing how long we may be any better off up here continued mr walters  the authorities dont seem to take the least notice of them and the rioters appear to be having it all their own way

they continued conversing upon the topic for some time mr de younge being meanwhile engaged in sponging and cleaning some coats he had purchased the day before in so doing he was obliged to remove the paper he had picked up from the floor and it occurred to him to ask mr

walters to read it he therefore handed it to him sayingâ  jist read dat honey wont you  i want to know if its worth savin ive burnt up two or three receipts in my life and had de bills to pay over and ise got rale careful you know taint pleasant to pay money twice over for de same thing

mr walters took the paper extended to him and after glancing over it remarked  this handwriting is very familiar to me very  but whose it is i cant say  it appears to be a list of addresses or something of that kind and he read over various names of streets and numbers of houses

 why he exclaimed with a start of surprise  here is my own house upon the list  eastonstreet then here is  christianstreet here also are numbers in bakerstreet bedfordstreet sixth seventh and eighth streets in some of which houses i know coloured people live for one or two of them are my own this is a strange affair

as he spoke he turned over the paper and read on the other sideâ places to be attacked  why this looks serious he continued with some excitement of manner

  places to be attackedâdont that seem to you as if it might be a list of places for these rioters to bet upon  i really must look into this who could have left it here  

 i raly dont know replied the old man  kinch told me suthin last night about some gemman comin here and changing his clothes praps twas him id like to know who twas myself well wait awhile my boy will come in directly maybe he can explain it

he had scarcely finished speaking when master kinch made his appearance with his hat as usual placed upon nine hairs and his mouth smeared with the eggs and bacon with which he had been  staying and comforting  himself he took off his hat on perceiving mr walters and with great humility  hoped that gentleman was well

yes very well kinch replied mr walters we were waiting for you can you tell where this came from  

he asked handing him the mysterious paper

 never seen it before that i know of replied kinch after a short inspection

 well who was here last night   asked his father  you said you sold suthin  

 so i did replied kinch   sold a whole suit and the gentleman who put it on said he was going out for a lark

he was changing some papers from his pocket perhaps he dropped it im to take this suit back to him today here is his card

by heavens exclaimed mr walters after looking at the card  i know the fellowâgeorge stevens  slippery georgeâevery one knows him and can speak no good of him either now i recognize the handwriting of the list i begin to suspect something wrong by seeing his name in connection with this

hereupon kinch was subjected to a severe crossexamination which had the effect of deepening mr walterss impression that some plot was being concocted that would result to the detriment of the coloured people for he was confident that no good could be indicated by the mysterious conduct of mr stevens

after some deliberation kinch received instructions to take home the clothes as directed and to have his eyes about him and if he saw or heard anything he was to report it

in accordance with his instructions master kinch made several journeys to mr stevenss office but did not succeed in finding that gentleman within the last trip he made there fatigued him to such a degree that he determined to wait his arrival as he judged from the lateness of the hour that if it was his intention to come at all that day he would soon be there

 ill sit down here said kinch who espied an old box in the back part of the entry  and give myself a little time to blow

he had not sat long before he heard footsteps on the stairs and presently the sound of voices became quite audible

thats him ejaculated kinch as mr stevens was heard saying in an angry toneâ yes  and a devil of a scrape i got into by your want of sobriety had you followed my directions and met me at whitticars instead of getting drunk as a beast and being obliged to go home to bed it wouldnt have happened

 well squire replied mc closkey for he was the person addressed by mr stevens  a man cant be expected always to keep sober

 he ought to when he has business before him rejoined mr stevens sharply   how the devil am i to trust you to do anything of importance when i cant depend on your keeping sober a day at a time  come up to this top landing continued he  and listen to me if you think you are sober enough to comprehend what i say to you

they now approached and stood within a few feet of the place where kinch was sitting and mr stevens said with a great deal of emphasis how i want you to pay the strictest attention to what i say i had a list of places made out for you last night but somehow or other i lost it

but that is neither here nor there this is what i want you to attend to particularly dont attempt anything tonight you cant get a sufficient number of the boys together but when you do go you are to take first christianstreet between eleventh and twelfthâthere are several nigger families living in that block smash in their windows break their furniture and if possible set one of the houses on fire and that will draw attention to that locality whilst you are operating elsewhere by that time the boys will be ripe for anything then you had better go to a house in eastonstreet corner of shotwell there is a rich nigger living there whose plunder is worth something i owe him an old grudge and i want you to pay it off for me

you keep me pretty busy paying your debts whats the name of this rich nigger 

 walters replied mr stevens   everybody knows him

how about that other affair here he whispered so low that einch could only learn they were planning an attack on the house of some one but failed in discovering the name

mc closkey departed as soon as he had received full directions from mr stevens and his retreating steps might be still heard upon the stairs when mr stevens unlocked his officedoor and entered

after giving him sufficient time to get quietly seated einch followed and delivered the clothes left with him the evening previous he was very much struck with mr

stevenss altered appearance and in fact would not have recognized him but for his voice

you dont seem to be well remarked einch inquiringly

no im not he replied gruffly  ive caught cold

as einch was leaving the office he called after him  did you find a paper in your shop this morning  

no sir replied einch i didnt but mentally he observed  my daddy did though  and fearful of some other troublesome question he took leave immediately

fatigued and out of breath einch arrived at the house of mr walters where he considered it best to go and communicate what he had learned

mr walters was at dinner when he received from the maid a summons to the parlour to see a lad who said his business was a matter of life or death he was obliged to smile at the air of importance with which kinch commenced the relation of what he had overheardâbut the smile gave place to a look of anxiety and indignation long ere he had finished and at the conclusion of the communication he was highly excited and alarmed

  the infernal scoundrel  exclaimed mr walters are you sure it was my house  

yes bure was kinchs reply you are the only coloured person living in the squareâand he said plain enough for anybody to understand eastonstreet corner of shotwell i heard every word but what they said towards the last in a whisper

you couldnt catch anything of it p asked mr walters

 no i missed that they talked too low for me to hear

after reflecting a few moments mr walters said not a word of this is to be lisped anywhere except with my permission and by my direction have you had your dinner  

 no sir was the prompt reply

 i want to despatch a note to mr ellis by you if it wont trouble you too much can you oblige me  

 oh yes sir by all means replied kinch  ill go there with pleasure

 then whilst im writing continued mr walters  you can be eating your dinner that will economize time you know

kinch followed the servant who answered the bell into the diningroom which mr walters had just left on being supplied with a knife and fork he helped himself bountifully to the roast duck then pouring out a glass of wine he drank with great enthusiasm to  our honoured self which proceeding caused infinite amusement to the two servants who were peeping at him through the diningroom door  derlicious exclaimed kinch depositing his glass upon the table   guess ill try another  and suiting the action to the word he refilled his glass and dispatched its contents in the wake of the other having laboured upon the duck until his appetite was somewhat appeased he leant bnolt ill his chair and suf tered his plate to bo chuugod for another which being done he made an attack upon a peach pie and nearly demolished it outright

this last performance brought his meal to a conclusion and with a look of weariness he remarked  i dont see how it isâbut as soon as i have eat for a little while my appetite is sure to leave meânow i cant eat a bit more but the worst thing is walking down to mr elliss i dont feel a bit like it but i suppose i must  and reluctantly rising from the table he returned to the parlour where he found mr

walters folding the note he had promised to deliver

as soon as he had despatched kinch on his errand mr

walters put on his hat and walked to the office of the mayor

 is his honour in  he asked of one of the police who was lounging in the anteroom

 tes he isâwhat do you want with him p  asked the official in a rude tone

 that sir is none of your business replied mr walters  if the mayor is in hand him this card and say i wish to see him

somewhat awed by mr walterss dignified and decided manner the man went quickly to deliver his message and returned with an answer that his honour would be obliged to mr walters if he would step into his office

on following the officer he was ushered into a small room âthe private office of the chief magistrate of the city

 take a seat sir said the mayor politely  it is some time since we have met i think i had the pleasure of transacting business with you quite frequently some years back if i am not mistaken

 you are quite correct replied mr walters  and being so favourably impressed by your courtesy on the occasions to which you refer i have ventured to intrude upon you with a matter of great importance not only to myself but i think i may say to the public generally since this jnorning circumstances have come under my notice that leave no doubt on my mind that a thoroughlyconcerted plan is afoot for the distraction of the property of a large number of our coloured citizensâmine amongst the rest you must be aware he continued  that many very serious disturbances have occurred lately in the lower part of the city

yes ive heard something respecting it replied the mayor  but i believe they were nothing more than trifling combats between the negroes and the whites in that vicinity

 oh no sir i assure you rejoined mr walters  they were and are anything but trifling i regard them however as only faint indications of what we may expect if the thing is not promptly suppressed there is an organized gang of villains who are combined for the sole purpose of mobbing us coloured citizens and as we are inoffensive we certainly deserve protection  and here continued mr walters  is a copy of the list of places upon which it is rumoured an attack is to be made

 i really dont see how im to prevent it mr walters  with the exception of your own residence all that are hero enumerated are out of my jurisdiction i can send two or three police for your protection if you think it necessary

but i really cant see my way clear to do anything further

two or three police  said mr walters with rising indignation at the apathy and indifference the mayor exhibited  they would scarcely be of any more use than as many women if that is the extent of the aid you can afford me i must do what i can to protect myself

 i trust your fears lead you to exaggerate the danger

said the mayor as mr walters arose to depart perhaps it is only rumour after all

 i might have flattered myself with the same idea did i not feel convinced by what has so recently occurred but a bhort distance from my own house at any rate if i am attacked they will find i am not unprepared good day

and bowing courteously to the mayor mr walters departed

mb walters lost no time in sending messengers to the various parties threatened by the mob warning them either to leave their houses or to make every exertion for a vigorous defence few however adopted the latter extremity the majority fled from their homes leaving what effects they could not carry away at the mercy of the mob and sought an asylum in the houses of such kindlydisposed whites as would give them shelter

although the authorities of the district had received the most positive information of the nefarious schemes of the rioters they had not made the slightest efforts to protect the poor creatures threatened in their persons and property but let the tide of lawlessness flow on unchecked

throughout the day parties of coloured people might have been seen hurrying to the upper part of the city women with terror written on their faces some with babes in their arms and children at their side hastening to some temporary place of refuge in company with men who were bending beneath the weight of household goods

mr walters had converted his house into a temporary fortress the shutters of the upper windows had been loopholed double bars had been placed across the doors and windows on the ground floor carpets had been taken up superfluous furniture removed and an air of thorough preparation imparted a few of mr walterss male friends had volunteered their aid in defence of his house and their services had been accepted

mr ellis whose house was quite indefensible it being situated in a neighbourhood swarming with the class of which the mob was composed had decided on bringing his family to the house of mr walters and sharing with him the fortunes of the night his wife and daughters having declared they would feel as safe there as elsewhere and accordingly about five in the afternoon mrs ellis came up accompanied by kinch and the girls

caddy and kinch who brought up the rear seemed very solicitous respecting the safety of a package that the latter bore in his arms

 what have you there p  asked mr walters with a smile  it must be powder or some other explosive matter you take such wonderful pains for its preservation come caddy tell us what it is  is it powder 

no mr walters it isnt powder she replied its nothing that will blow the house up or burn it down

 what is it then p you tell us kinch

just do if you think best said caddy giving him a threatening glance whereupon master kinch looked as much as to say  if you were td put me on the rack you couldnt get a word out of me

 i suppose i shall have to give you up said mr walters at last  but dont stand here in the entry  come up into the drawingroom

mrs ellis and esther followed him upstairs and stood at the door of the drawingroom surveying the preparations for defence that the appearance of the room so abundantly indicated guns were stacked in the corner a number of pistols lay upon the mantelpiece and a pile of cartridges was heaped up beside a small keg of powder that stood upon the table opposite the fireplace

 dear me  exclaimed mrs ellis  this looks dreadful it almost frightens me out of my wits to see so many dangerous weapons scattered about

and how does it affect our quiet esther p  asked mr

walters

 it makes me wish i were a man she replied with con biderable vehemence of manner all started at this language from one of her usually gentle demeanour

 why esther how you talk girl whats come over youp

 talk  replied she  i say nothing that i do not feel

as we came through the streets today and i saw so many inoffensive creatures who like ourselves have never done these white wretches the least injuryâto see them and us driven from our homes by a mob of wretches who can accuse us of nothing but being darker than themselvesâit takes all the woman out of my bosom and makes me feel like a

here esther paused and bit her lip to prevent the utterance of a fierce expression that hovered on the tip of her tongue

she then continued  one poor woman in particular i noticed she had a babe in her arms poor thing and was weeping bitterly because she knew of no place to go to seek for shelter or protection a couple of white men stood by jeering and taunting her i felt as though i could have strangled them had i been a man i would have attacked them on the spot if i had been sure they would have killed me the next moment

 hush esther hush my child you must not talk so it sounds unwomanlyâunchristian why i never heard you talk so before esther made no reply but btood resting her forehead upon the mantelpiece her face was flushed with excitement and her dark eyes glistened like polished jet

mr walters stood regarding her for a time with evident admiration and then said  you are a brave one after my own heart esther hung down her head confused by the ardent look he cast upon her as he continued  you have taken me by surprise but its always the way with you quiet people events like these bring you outâseem t

change your very natures as it were we must look out

said he with a smile turning to one of the young men  or miss ellis will excel us all in courage i shall expect great things from her if we are attacked tonight

 dont make a jest of me mr walters said esther and as she spoke her eyes moistened and her lip quivered with vexation

 no no my dear girl dont misunderstand me replied he quickly nothing was farther from my thoughts i truly meant all that i said i believe you to be a brave girl

 if you really think so rejoined esther  prove it by showing me how to load these as she spoke she took from the mantel one of the pistols that were lying there and turned it over to examine it

 oh put that down esther put that down immediately

almost screamed mrs ellis  what with your speeches and your guns youll quite set me crazy do take it from her walters it will certainly go off

 theres not the least danger ellen he replied  theres nothing in it

 well im afraid of guns loaded or unloaded they are dangerous all of them whether they have anything in them or not do you hear me esther do put that down and come out of here

 oh no mother said she  do let me remain there ill lay the pistols down and wont touch them again whilst you are in the room

 you may safely leave her in my hands interposed mr

walters  if she wants to learn let her it wont injure her in the least ill take care of that this assurance somewhat quieted mrs ellis who left the room and took up her quarters in another apartment

now mr walters said esther taking off her bonnet im quite in earnest about learning to load these pistols and i wish you to instruct me you may be hard pressed tonight and unable to load for yourselves and in such an emergency i could perhaps be of great use to you

 but my child replied he  to be of use in the manner you propose you would be compelled to remain in quite an exposed situation

 i am aware of that calmly rejoined esther

 and still you are not afraid p  lie asked in surprise

 why should i be i shall not be any more exposed than you or my father

thats enoughâill teach you look here said mr

walters  observe how i load this esther gave her undivided attention to the work before her and when he had finished she took up another pistol and loaded it with a precision and celerity that would have reflected honour on a more practised hand

âº  well doneâcapital  exclaimed mr walters as she laid down the weapon youll do my girl as i said before you are one after my own heart how whilst you are loading the rest i will go downstairs where i have some little matters to attend to on the stairway he was met by kinch and caddy who were tugging up a large kettle of water  is it possible caddy asked mr walters  that your propensity to dabble in soap and water has overcome you even at this critical time  you certainly cant be going to scrub  

 ho im not going to scrub she replied  nor do anything like it weve got our plans havent we kinch 

lets hear what your plans are id like to be enlightened a little if convenient said mr walters

 well its not convenient mr walters so you need not expect to hear a word about them youd only laugh if we were to tell you so were going to keep it to ourselves aint we kinch p 

the latter thus appealed to put on an air of profound mystery and intimated that if they were permitted to pursue the even tenor of their way great results might be expected but if they were balked in their designs he could not answer for the consequences

 you and esther have your plans resumed caddy  and we have ours we dont believe in powder and shot and dont want anything to do with guns for my part im afraid of them so please let us go byâdo now thats a good soul

you seem to forget that im the commander of this fortress said mr walters and that i have a right to know everything that transpires within it but i see you look obstinate and as i havent time to settle the matter now you may pass on i wonder what they can be about

he remarked as they hurried on  i must steal up byandby and see for myself

one after another the various friends of mr walters came in each bringing some vague report of the designs of the mob they all described the excitement as growing more intense that the houses of various prominent abolitionists had been threatened that an attempt had been made to fire one of the coloured churches and that notwithstanding the rioters made little scruple in declaring their intentions the authorities were not using the slightest effort to restrain them or to protect the parties threatened day was fast waning and the approaching night brought with it clouds and cold

whilst they had been engaged in their preparations for defence none had time to reflect upon the danger of their situation but now that all was prepared and there was nothing to sustain the excitement of the last few hours a chill crept over the circle who were gathered round the fire

there were no candles burning and the uncertain glow from the grate gave a rather weirdlike look to the group the arms stacked in the corner of the room and the occasional glitter of the pistolbarrels as the flames rose and fell gave the whole a peculiarly strange effect

we look belligerent enough i should think remarked mr walters looking around him  i wish we were well out of this its terrible to be driven to these extremitiesâbut we are not the aggressors thank god and the results be they what they may are not of our seeking i have a right to defend my own i have asked protection of the law and it is too weak or too indifferent to give it so i have no alternative but to protect myself but who is here p it has grown so dark in the room that i can scarcely distinguish any one where are all the ladies p 

none are hero except myself answered esther all the rest are below stairs

and where are you i hear but cant see you give me your hand said he extending his own in the direction from which her voice proceeded  how cold your hand is he continued   are you frightened  

frightened she replied i never felt calmer in my lifeâput your fi dger on my pulse

mr walters did as he was desired and exclaimed  steady as a clock i trust nothing may occur before morning to cause it to beat more hurriedly

 let us put some wood on these coals suggested mr

ellis  it will make a slight blaze and give us a chance to see each other as he spoke he took up a few small fagots and cast them upon the fire

the wood snapped and crackled as the flames mounted the chimney and cast a cheerful glow upon the surrounding objects suddenly a thoroughly ignited piece flew off from the rest and fell on the table in the midst of the cartridges

 run for your lives  shrieked one of the party  the powder the powder simultaneously they nearly all rushed to the door

mr walters stood as one petrified esther alone of the whole party retained her presence of mind springing forward she grasped the blazing fragment and dashed it back again into the grate all this passed in a few seconds and in the end esther was so overcome with excitement and terror that she fainted outright hearing no report those who had fled cautiously returned and by their united efforts she was soon restored to consciousness

 what a narrow escape  said she trembling and covering her face with her hands  it makes me shudder to think of it

we owe our lives to you my brave girl said ml

walters  your presence of mind has quite put us all to the blush

oh move the powder some distance off or the same thin may happen again please do move it mr walters i shall have no peace whilst it is there

whilst they were thus engaged a loud commotion was heard below stairs and with one accord all started in the direction from whence the noise proceeded

 bring a light bring a light  cried mrs ellis  something dreadful has happened a light was soon procured and the cause of this second alarm fully ascertained

master kinch in his anxiety to give himself as warlike an appearance as possible had added to his accoutrements an old sword that he had discovered in an outoftheway corner of the garret not being accustomed to weapons of this nature he had been constantly getting it between his legs and had already been precipitated by it down a flight of steps to the imminent risk of his neck undaunted however by this mishap he had clung to it with wonderful tenacity until it had again caused a disaster the noise of which had brought all parties into the room where it had occurred

the light being brought master kinch crawled out from under a table with his head and back covered with batter a pan of which had been overturned upon him in consequence of his having been tripped up by his sword and falling violently against the table on which it stood

i said you had better take that skewer off exclaimed caddy   its a wonder it hasnt broke your neck before now but you are such a goose you would wear it said she surveying her aidedecamp with derision as he vainly endeavoured to scrape the batter from his face

please give me some water cried kinch looking from one to the other of the laughing group   help a feller to get it off cant youâits all in my eyes and the yeast is blinding me

the only answer to this appeal was an additional shout of laughter without the slightest effort for his relief at last ci aij ar r rtmen hia ftrvm eeniidin prothis is the farce after what was almost a tragedy said mr walters as they ascended the stairs again   i wonder what we shall have next 

they all returned to their chairs by the drawingroom fire after this occurrence and remained in comparative silence for some time until loud cries of  fire fire   startled them from their seats

 the whole of the lower part of the city appears to he in a blaze exclaimed one of the party who had hastened to the window   look at the flamesâthey are ascending from several places they are at their work we may expect them here soon

 well theyll find us prepared when they do come rejoined mr walters

what do you propose asked mr ellis are we to fire on them at once or wait for their attack p 

wait for their attack by all means said he in replyâ  if they throw stones youll find plenty in that room with which to return the compliment if they resort to firearms then we will do the same i want to be strictly on the defensiveâbut at the same time we must defend ourselves fully and energetically

in about an hour after this conversation a dull roar was beard in the distance which grew louder and nearer every moment

 hist  said esther  do you hear that noise  listen

isnt that the mob coming p 

mr walters opened the shutter and then the sound became more distinct on they came nearer and nearer until the noise of their voices became almost deafening

there was something awful in the appearance of the motley crowd that like a torrent foamed and surged through the streets some were bearing large pine torches that filled the air with thick smoke and partially lighted up the surrounding gloom most of them were armed with clubs and  with gnn smd piaf

a they th vvv to   consultation between the ringleaders for soon after every light was extinguished and the deafening yells of  kill the niggers    down with the abolitionists   were almost entirely stilled

i wonder what that means said mr walters who had closed the shutter and was surveying through an aperture that had been cut the turbulent mass below look out for something soon

he had scarcely finished speaking when a voice in the street cried  oneâtwoâthree   and immediately there followed a volley of missiles crushing in the windows of the chamber above and rattling upon the shutters of the room in which the party of defenders were gathered a yell then went up from the mob followed by another shower of stones

 it is now our turn said mr walters coolly  four of you place yourselves at the windows of the adjoining room  the rest remain here when you see a bright light reflected on the crowd below throw open the shutters and hurl down stones as long as the light is shining now take your places and as soon as you are prepared stamp upon the floor

each of the men now armed themselves with two or more of the largest stones they could find from the heap that had been provided for the occasion and in a few seconds a loud stamping upon the floor informed mr walters that all was ready he now opened the aperture in the shutter and placed therein a powerful reflecting light which brought the shouting crowd below clearly into view and in an instant a shower of heavy stones came crashing down upon their upturned faces

yells of rage and agony ascended from the throng who not seeing any previous signs of life in the house had no anticipation of so prompt and severe a response to their attack for a time they swayed to and fro bewildered by the intense light and crushing shower of stones that had so suddenly fallen upon them those in the rear however pressing forward did not permit the most exposed to retire out of reach of missiles from the house on perceiving which mr walters again turned the light upon them and immediately another stony shower came rattling down which caused a precipitate retreat

 the house is full of niggers â the house is full of niggers   cried several voicesâ shoot them  kill them 

and immediately several shots were fired at the window by the mob below

dont fire yet said mr walters to one of the young men who had his hand upon a gun  stop awhile when we do fire let it be to some purposeâlet us make sure that some one is hit

whilst they were talking two or three bullets pierced the shutters and flattened themselves upon the ceiling above

 those are rifle bullets remarked one of the young men â do let us fire

 it is too great a risk to approach the windows at present keep quiet for a little while and when the light is shown again fire but hark   continued he  they are trying to burst open the door we cant reach them there without exposing ourselves and if they should get into the entry it would be hard work to dislodge them

 let us give them a round probably it will disperse those farthest offâand those at the door will follow suggested one of the young men

well try it at any ratereplied walters take your places dont fire until i show the lightâthen pick your man and let him have it there is no use to fire you know unless you hit somebody are you ready p  he asked

 yes was the prompt reply

 then here goes said he turning the light upon the crowd belowâwho having some experience in what would follow did their best to get out of reach but they were too lateâfor the appearance of the light was followed by the instantaneous report of several guns which did fearful execution amidst the throng of ruffians two or three fell on the spot and were carried off by their comrades with fearful execrations

the firing now became frequent on both sides and esthers services came into constant requisitions it was in vain that her father endeavoured to persuade her to leave the room notwithstanding the shutters had been thrown open to facilitate operations from within and the exposure thereby greatly increased she resolutely refused to retire and continued fearlessly to load the guns and hand them to the men

 theyve got axes at work upon the door if they are not dislodged theyll cut their way in exclaimed one of the young menâthe stones are exhausted and i dont know what we shall do

just then the splash of water was heard followed by shrieks of agony

 oh god  im scalded  im scalded  cried one of the men upon the steps  take me away  take me away  

in the midst of his cries another volume of scalding water came pouring down upon the group at the door which was followed by a rush from the premises

 what is thatâwho could have done thatâwhere has that water come from   asked mr walters as he saw the seething shower pass the window and fall upon the heads below  i must go and see

he ran upstairs and found kinch and caddy busy putting on more water they having exhausted one kettlefullâinto which they had put two or three pounds of cayenne pepper ââon the heads of the crowd below

 we gave em a settler didnt we mr walters p  asked caddy as he entered the room  it takes us we fight with hot water this said she holding up a dipper  is my gun

i guess we made em squeal

youve done well caddy replied heâfirstrate my girl i believe youve driven them off entirely he continued peeping out of the window  they are going off at any rate said he drawing in his head whether they will return or not is more than i can say keep plenty of hot watec ready but dout expose yourselves children werent you afraid to go to the window p  he asked

we didnt go near it look at this replied caddy fitting a broom handle into the end of a very large tin dipper  kinch cut this to fit so we have nothing to do but to stand back here dip up the water and let them have it the length of the handle keeps us from being seen from the street that was xinchs plan

 and a capital one it was too your head xinch evidently has no batter within if it has without there is a great deal in that xeep a bright look out continued mr

walters  im going downstairs if they come again let them have plenty of your warm peppersauce

on returning to the drawingroom mr walters found mr dennis one of the company preparing to go out  im about to avail myself of the advantage afforded by my fair complexion and play the spy said he  they cant discern at night what i am and i may be able to learn some of their plans

 a most excellent idea said mr walters  but pray be careful you may meet some one who will recognise you

never fear replied mr dennis ill keep a bright look out for that and drawing his cap far down over his eyes to screen his face as much as possible he sallied out into the street

he had not been absent more than a quarter of an hour when he returned limping into the house have they attacked youâare you hurt   asked the anxious group by which he was surrounded

 im hurt but not by them i got on very well and gleaned a great deal of information when i heard a sudden exclamation and on looking round i found myself recognized by a white man of my acquaintance i ran immediately  and whether i was pursued or not im unable to ay i had almost reached here when my foot caught in a grating and gave my ancle such a wrench that im unable to stand as he spoke his face grew pale from the suffering the limb was occasioning  im sorry very sorry he continued limping to the sofa  i was going out again immediately they intend making an attack on mr garies house  i didnt hear his name mentioned but i heard one of the men who appeared to be a ringleader say  were going up to winterstreet to give a coat of tar and feathers to a white man who is married to a nigger woman they can allude to none but him how annoying that this accident should have happened just now of all times they ought to be warned

 oh poor emily   cried esther bursting into tears   it will kill her i know it will she is so ill some one must go and warn them let me try  the mob even if i met them surely would not assault a woman

 you mustnt think of such a thing esther exclaimed mr walters  the idea isnt tobe entertained for a moment

yon dont know what ruthless wretches they are your colour discovered you would find your sex but a trifling protection id go but it would be certain death to me my black face would quickly obtain for me a passport to another world if i were discovered in the street just now

 ill go calmly spoke mr ellis  i cant rest here and think of what they are exposed to by skulking through byestreets and keeping under the shadows of houses i may escape observationâat any rate i must run the risk and he began to button up his coat  dont let your mother know im gone stick by her my girl baid he kissing esther  trust in godâhell protect me

esther hung sobbing on her fathers neck  oh father father said she  i couldnt bear to see you go for any one but emily and the children

i know it dear he replied its my duty garie would do the same for me i know even at greater risk

goodbye goodbye  and disengaging himself from the weeping girl he started on his errand of mercy

walking swiftly forwards he passed over more than twothirds of the way without the slightest interruption the streets through which he passed being almost entirely deserted he had arrived within a couple of squares of the garies when suddenly on turning a corner he found himself in the midst of a gang of ruffians

 heres a nigger heres a nigger   shouted two or three of them almost simultaneously making at the same time a rush at mr ellis who turned and ran followed by the whole gang fear lent him wings and he fast outstripped his pursuers and would have entirely escaped had he not turned into a street which unfortunately was closed at the other end this he did not discover until it was too late to retrace his steps his pursuers having already entered the street

looking for some retreat he perceived he was standing near an unfinished building tearing off the boards that were nailed across the window he vaulted into the room knocking off his hat which fell upon the pavement behind him scarcely had he groped his way to the staircase of the dwelling when he heard the footsteps of his pursuers

 he cant have got through exclaimed one of them  the street is closed up at the end he must be up here somewhere

lighting one of their torches they began to look around them and soon discovered the hat lying beneath the window

 hes in here boys weve treed the coon laughingly exclaimed one of the ruffians lets after him

tearing off the remainder of the boards one or two entered opened the door from the inside and gave admission to the rest

mr ellis mounted to the second story followed by his pursuers  on he went until he reached the attic from which a ladder led to the roof ascendingthis he drew it up after him and found himself on the roof of a house that was entirely isolated

the whole extent of the danger flashed upon him at once

here he was completely hemmed in without the smallest chance for escape he approached the edge and looked over but could discover nothing near enough to reach by a leap

 i must sell my life dearly he said  god be my helper nowâhe is all i have to rely upon and as be spoke the great drops of sweat fell from his forehead espying a sheet of lead upon the roof he rolled it into a club of tolerable thickness and waited the approach of his pursuers

 hes gone on the roof he heard one of them exclaim  and pulled the ladder up after him just then a head emerged from the trapdoor the owner of which perceiving mr ellis set up a shout of triumph

 weve got him weve got himâhere he is   which cries were answered by the exultant voices of his comrades below

an attempt was now made by one of them to gain the roof but he immediately received a blow from mr ellis that knocked him senseless into the arms of his companions

another attempted the same feat and met a similar fate

this caused a parley as to the best mode of proceeding which resulted in the simultaneous appearance of three of the rioters at the opening nothing daunted mr ellis attacked them with such fierceness and energy that they were forced to descend muttering the direst curses in a few moments another head appeared at which mr ellis aimed a blow of great force  and the club descended upon a bat placed upon a stick not meeting the resistance expected it flew from his hand and he was thrown forward nearly falling down the doorway

with a shout of triumph they seized his arm and held him firmly until one or two of them mounted the roof

throw him over throw him over exclaimed some of the fiercest of the crowd one or two of the more merciful endeavoured to interfere against killing him outright but the frenzy of the majority triumphed and they determined to cast him into the street below

mr ellis clung to the chimney shriekingâ save me 

save me âhelp help will no one save me   his cries were unheeded by the ruffians and the people at the surrounding windows were unable to afford him any assistance even if they were disposed to do so

despite his cries and resistance they forced him to the edge of the roof he clinging to them the while and shrieking in agonized terror forcing off his hold they thrust him forward and got him partially over the edge where he clung calling frantically for aid one of the villains to make him loose his hold struck on his fingers with the handle of a hatchet found on the roof not succeeding in breaking his hold by these means with an oath he struck with the blade severing two of the fingers from one hand and deeply mangling the other

with a yell of agony mr ellis let go his hold and fell upon a pile of rubbish below whilst a cry of triumphant malignity went up from the crowd on the roof

a gentleman and some of his friends kindly carried the insensible man into his house poor fellow said he he is killed i believe what a gang of wretches these things are dreadful that such a thing can be permitted in a christian city is perfectly appalling the halfdressed family gathered around the mangled form of mr ellis and gave vent to loud expressions of sympathy a doctor was quickly sent for who stanched the blood that was flowing from his hands and head

i dont think he can live said he the fall was too great as far as i can judge his legs and two of his ribs are broken the best thing we can do is to get him conveyed to the hospital look in his pockets perhaps we can find out who he is

there was nothing found however that afforded the least clue to his name and residence and he was therefore as soon as persons could be procured to assist borne to the hospital where his wounds were dressed and the broken limbs set

unawabe of the impending danger mr garie sat watching by the bedside of his wife she had been quite ill but on the evening of which we write although nervous and wakeful was much better the bleak winds of the fast approaching winter dealt unkindly with her delicate frame accustomed as she was to the soft breezes of her southern home

mr garie had been sitting up looking at the fires in the lower part of the city not having been out all that day or the one previous he knew nothing of the fearful state into which matters had fallen

 those lights are dying away my dear said he to his wife there must have been quite an extensive conflagration taking out his watch he continued  almost two oclock  why how late ive been sitting up i really id ont know whether its worth while to go to bed or not i should be obliged to get up again at five oclock i go to new york tomorrow or rather today there are some matters connected with uncle johns will that require my personal attention dear old man how suddenly he died

 i wish dear you could put off your journey until i am better said mrs garie faintly   i do hate you to go just now

 i would if i could emily  but it is impossible i shall be back tomorrow or the next day at farthest whilst im there ill

 hush   interrupted mrs garie  stop a moment

dont you hear a noise like the shouting of a great many people

 oh its only the firemen replied he j  as i was about to observe

 hush   cried she again  listen now that dont sound like the firemen in the least mr garie paused as the sound of a number of voices became more distinct

wrapping his dressinggown more closely about him he walked into the front room which overlooked the street

opening the window he saw a number of menâsome bearing torchesâcoming rapidly in the direction of his dwelling  i wonder what all this is for what can it mean he exclaimed

they had now approached sufficiently near for him to understand their cries  down with the abolitionistâdown with the amalgamationist give them tar and feathers 

 its a mobâand that word amalgamationistâcan it be pointed at me  it hardly seems possible  and yet i have a fear that there is something wrong

what is it gariep what is the matterp asked his wife who with a shawl hastily thrown across her shoulders was standing pale and trembling by the window

 go in emily my dear for heavens sake youll get your death of cold in this bleak night airâgo in  as soon as i discover the occasion of the disturbance ill come and tell you pray go in mrs garie retired a few feet from the window and stood listening to the shouts in the street

the rioters led on evidently by some onewho knew what he was about pressed forward to mr garies house  and soon the garden in front was filled with the shouting crowd

 what do you all wantâwhy are you on my premises creating this disturbance p  cried mr garie

 come down and youll soon find out you white livered abolitionist come out damn you we are going to give you a coat of tar and feathers and your black wench nineandthirty yes come downâcome down  shouted several  or we will come up after you

 i warn you replied mr garie  against any attempt at violence upon my person family or property i forbid you to advance another foot upon the premises if any man of you enters my house ill shoot him down as quick as i would a mad dog

 shut up your gap  none of your cussed speeches said a voice in the crowd  if you dont come down and give yourself up well come in and take youâthats the talk aint it boys p  a general shout of approval answered this speech and several stones were thrown at mr garie one of which struck him on the breast

seeing the utter futility of attempting to parley with the infuriated wretches below he ran into the room exclaiming  put on some clothes emily  shoes firstâquickâquick wife âyour life depends upon it ill bring down the children and wake the servants we must escape from the houseâ we are attacked by a mob of demons hurry emily do for god sake  â  mr garie aroused the sleeping children and threw some clothes upon them over which he wrapped shawls or blankets or whatever came to hand pushing into the next room he snatched a pair of loaded pistols from the drawer of his dressingstand and then hurried his terrified wife and children down the stairs

 this way dearâthis way  he cried leading on toward the back door  out that way through the gate with the children and into some of the neighbours houses ill stand here to keep the way

 ho no garie she replied frantically  i wont go without you

you must  he cried stamping his foot impatiently this is no time to parleyâgo or we shall all be murdered

listen theyve broken in the door quickâquick  go on  

and as he spoke he pressed her and the children out of the door and closed it behind them

mrs garie ran down the garden followed by the children  to her horror she found the gate locked and the key nowhere to be found

 what shall we do she cried  oh we shall all be killed 

and her limbs trembled beneath her with cold and terror

 let us hide in here mother suggested clarence running toward the woodhouse well be safe in there  seeing that nothing better could be done mrs garie availed herself of the suggestion and when she was fairly inside the place fell fainting upon the ground

as she escaped through the back door the mob broke in at the front and were confronting mr garie as he stood with his pistol pointed at them prepared to fire

 come another step forward and i fire   exclaimed he resolutely but those in the rear urged the advance of those in front who approached cautiously nearer and nearer their victim fearful of opening the door behind him lest he should show the way taken by his retreating wife he stood uncertain how to act a severe blow from a stone however made him lose all reflection and he immediately fired a loud shriek followed the report of his pistol and a shower of stones was immediately hurled upon him

he quickly fired again and was endeavouring to open the door to effect his escape when a pistol was discharged close to his head and he fell forward on the entry floor lifeless

all this transpired in a few moments and in the semidarkness of the entry hushing forward over his lifeless form the villains hastened upstairs in search of mrs garie

they ran shouting through the house stealing everything valuable that they could lay their hands upon and wantonly destroying the furniture they would have fired the house but were prevented by mc closky who acted as leader of the gang

for two long hours they ransacked the house breaking all they could not carry off drinking the wine in mr garies cellar and shouting and screaming like so many fiends

mrs garie and the children lay crouching with terror in the woodhouse listening to the ruffians as they went through the yard cursing her and her husband and uttering the direst threats of what they would do should she fall into their hands once she almost fainted on hearing one of them propose opening the woodhouse to see if there wa anything of value in itâbut breathed again when they abandoned it as not worth their attention

the children crouched down beside herâscarcely daring to whisper lest they should attract the attention of their persecutors shivering with cold they drew closer around them the blanket with which they had been providentially provided

 brother my feet are so cold sobbed little em  i cant feel my toes oh im so cold  

 put your feet closer to me sissy answered her brother baring himself to enwrap her more thoroughly  put my stockings on over yours   and as well as they were able in the dark he drew his stockings on over her benumbed feet

 there sis thats better he whispered with an attempt at cheerfulness  now youll be warmer

just then clarence heard a groan from his mother so loud indeed that it would have been heard without but for the noise and excitement around the houseâand feeling for her in the dark he asked  mother are you worse p are you sick p 

a groan was her only answer

mother mother he whispered do speak please do 

and he endeavoured to put his arm around her

dont dearâdont said she faintly just take care of your sisterâyou cant do me any goodâdont speak dear the men will hear you

reluctantly the frightened child turned his attention again to his little sister ever and anon suppressed groans from his mother would reach his earsâat last he heard a groan even fierce in its intensity  and then the sounds grew fainter and fainter until they entirely ceased the night to the poor shivering creatures in their hiding place seemed interminably long and the sound of voices in the house had not long ceased when the faint light of day pierced their cheerless shelter

hearing the voices of some neighbours in the yard clarence hastened out and seizing one of the ladies by the dress cried imploringly  do come to my mother shes siclc

 why where did you come from child   said the lady with a start of astonishment  where have you been p 

in there he answered pointing to the woodhouse  mother and sister are in there

the lady accompanied by one or two others hastened to the woodhouse

 where is she p  asked the foremost for in the gloom of the place she could not perceive anything

 here replied clarence  shes lying here on opening a small window they saw mrs garie lying in a corner stretched upon the boards her head supported by some blocks shes asleep said clarence motherâmother

but there came no answer  motheb said he still louder but yet there was no response

stepping forward one of the females opened the shawl which was held firmly in the clenched hands of mrs garieâand there in her lap partially covered by her scanty nightdress was discovered a newborn babe who with its mother had journeyed in the darkness cold and night to the better land that they might pour out their woes upon the bosom of their creator

the women gazed in mournful silence on the touching scene before them clarence was on his knee regarding with fear and wonder the unnatural stillness of his motherâ the child had never before looked on death and could not recognize its presence laying his hand on her cold cheek he cried with faltering voice  mother cant you speak   but there was no answering light in the fixed stare of those glassy eyes and the lips of the dead could not move  why dont she speak   he asked

 she cant my dear you must come away and leave her

shes better off my darlingâshes dead

then there was a cry of grief sprung up from the heart of that orphan boy that rang in those womens ears for long years after it was the first outbreak of a loving childish heart pierced with lifes bitterest griefâa mothers loss

the two children were kindly taken into the house of some benevolent neighbour as the servants had all fled none knew whither little em was in a profound btuporâthe result of cold and terror and it was found necessary to place her under the care of a physician

after they had all gone an inquest was held by the coroner and a very unsatisfactory and untruthful verdict pronouncedâone that did not at all coincide with the circumstances of the case but such a one as might have been expected where there was a great desire to screen the affair from public scrutiny

estheb ellis devoured with anxiety respecting the safety of her father and the garies paced with impatient step up and down the drawingroom opening the window she looked to see if she could discover any signs of day  its pitchy dark she exclaimed  and yet almost five oclock

father has run a fearful risk i hope nothing has happened to him

 i trust not i think hes safe enough somewhere said mr walters  hes no doubt been very cautious and avoided meeting any oneâdont worry yourself my child tis most likely he remained with them wherever they went probably they are at the house of some of their neighbours

 i cant help feeling dreadfully oppressed and anxious

continued she  i wish he would come

whilst she was speaking her mother entered the room

 any news of your father p  she asked in a tone of anxiety

esther endeavoured to conceal her own apprehensions and rejoined in as cheerful tone as she could assumeânot yet motherâits too dark for us to expect him yetâhell remain most likely until daylight

he shouldnt have gone had i been hereâhes no business to expose himself in this way

 but mother interrupted esther  only think of itâ the safety of emily and the children were depending on itâ we mustnt be selfish

i know we oughtnt to be my child rejoined her mother but its natural to the best of usâsometimes we cant help it

fiveâsixâseven oclock came and passed and still there were no tidings of mr ellis

 i can bear this suspense no longer exclaimed esther

 if father dont come soon i shall go and look for him

ive tried to flatter myself that hes safe but im almost convinced now that something has happened to him or hed have come back long before thisâhe knows how anxious we would all be about him ive tried to quiet mother and caddy by suggesting various reasons for his delay but at the same time i cannot but cherish the most dismal forebodings i must go and look for him

no no estherâstay where you are at presentâleave that to me ill order a carriage and go up to garies immediately

 well do mr walters and hurry back wont you  she rejoined as he left the apartment

in a few moments he returned prepared to start and was speedily driven to winterstreet he found a group of people gathered before the gate gazing into the house  the place has been attacked said he as he walked towards the front doorâpicking his way amidst fragments of furniture straw and broken glass at the entrance of the house he was met by mr balch mr garies lawyer

this is a shocking affair walters said he extending his handâhe was an old friend of mr walters

very shocking indeed he replied looking around

but where is garie f we sent to warn them of this i hope they are all safe

 safe   repeated mr balch with an air of astonishment

 why man havent you heard p 

 heard what  asked mr walters looking alarmed

 that mr and mrs garie are deadâboth were killed last night

the shock of this sudden and totally unexpected disclosure was such that mr walters leaned against the doorway for support  it cant be possible he exclaimed at last  not dead 

yes dead i regret to sayâhe vras shot through the headâand she died in the woodhouse of premature confinement brought on by fright and exposure

and the children p  gasped walters

they are safe with some neighboursâits heartbreaking to hear them weeping for their mother here a tear glistened in the eye of mr balch and ran down his cheek

brushing it off he continued  the coroner has just held an inquest and they gave a most truthless verdict nothing whatever is said of the cause of the murder or of the murderers  they simply rendered a verdictâdeath caused by a wound from a pistolshot and hersâdeath from exposure

there seemed the greatest anxiety on the part of the coroner to get the matter over as quickly as possible and few or no witnesses were examined but im determined to sift the matter to the bottom  if the perpetrators of the murder can be discovered ill leave no means untried to find them

do you know any one who sat on the inquest asked walters

 yes one was the reply  slippery george the lawyer you are acquainted with himâgeorge stevens i find he resides next door

do you know here interrupted mr walters  that ive my suspicions that that villain is at the bottom of these disturbances or at least has a large share in them i have a paper in my possession in his handwritingâit is in fact a list of the places destroyed by the mob last nightâit fell into the hands of a friend of mine by accidentâhe gave it to me âit put me on my guard and when the villains attacked my house last night they got rather a warmer reception than they bargained for

you astonish me is it possible your place was assaulted also p  asked mr balch

 indeed it wasâand a hot battle we had of it for a short space of time but how did you hear of this affair  

i was sent for by i cant tell whom when i came and saw what had happened i immediately set about searching for a will that i made for mr garie a few weeks bince it was witnessed and signed at my office and he brought it away with him i cant discover it anywhere ive ransacked every cranny it must have been carried off by some one you are named in it conjointly with myself as executor all the property is left to her poor thing and his children we must endeavour to find it somewhereâat any rate the children are secure  they are the only heirsâhe had not to my knowledge a single white relative but let us go in and see the bodies

they walked together into the back room where the bodies were lying mrs garie was stretched upon the sofa covered with a piano cloth  and her husband was laid upon a long table with a silk windowcurtain thrown across his face

the two gazed in silence on the face of mr garieâthe brow was still knit the eyes staring vacantly and the marble whiteness of the face unbroken save by a few gouts of blood near a small blue spot over the eye where the bullet had entered

 he was the besthearted creature in the world said walters as he recovered the face

wont you look at her  asked mr balch

 no noâi cant continued walters  ive seen horrors enough for one morning ive another thing on my mind

a friend who assisted in the defence of my house started up here last night to warn them of their danger and when i left home he had not returned its evident he hasnt been here and i greatly fear some misfortune has befallen him

where are the children poor little orphans i must see them before i go

accompanied by mr balch he called at the house where clarence and em had found temporary shelter the children ran to him as soon as he entered the room  oh  mr walters sobbed clarence  my mothers deadâmy mothers dead  

 hush dearsâhush he replied endeavouring to restrain his own tears as he took little em in his arms  dont cry my darling said he as she gave vent to a fresh outburst of tears

 oh mr walters  said she still sobbing  she was all the mother i had

mr baleh here endeavoured to assist in pacifying the two little mourners

 why dont father come   asked clarence  have you seen him mr walters  

mr walters was quite taken aback by this inquiry which clearly showed that the children were still unaware of the extent of their misfortunes ive seen him my child said he evasively   youll see him before long and fearful of further questioning he left the house promising soon to return

unable longer to endure her anxiety respecting her father esther determined not to await the return of mr walters which had already been greatly delayed but to go herself in search of him it had occurred to her that instead of returning from the garies direct to them he had probably gone to his own home to see if it had been disturbed during the night

encouraged by this idea without consulting any one she hastily put on her cloak and bonnet and took the direction of her home numbers of people were wending their way to the lower part of the city to gratify their curiosity by gazing upon the havoc made by the rioters during the past night

esther found her home a heap of smoking ruins some of the neighbours who recognized her gathered round expressing their sympathy and regret but she seemed comparatively careless respecting the loss of their property and in answer to their kind expressions could only ask  have you seen my father pâdo you know where my father is  

none however had seen him  and after gazing for a short time upon the ruins of what was once a happy home she turned mournfully away and walked back to mr walterss

 has father come   she inquired as soon as the door was opened

 not yet  was the discouraging reply  and mr walters lie hasnt come back either miss  

esther stood for some moments hesitating whether to go in or to proceed in her search the voice of her mother calling her from the stairway decided her and she went in

mrs ellis and caddy wept freely on learning from esther the destruction of their home this cause of grief added to tie lnxey rrwiueed by the prolonged absence of mr ellis rendered them truly miserable

whilst they were condoling with one another mr walters returned he was unable to conceal his fears that something had happened to mr ellis and frankly told them so he also gave a detailed account of what had befallen the garies to the great horror and grief of all

as soon as arrangements could be made mr walters and esther set out in search of her father all day long they went from place to place but gained no tidings of him and weary and disheartened they returned at night bringing with them the distressing intelligence of their utter failure to procure any information respecting him

on the day succeeding the events described in our last chapter mr walters called upon mr balch for the purpose of making the necessary preparations for the interment of mr and mrs garie

 i think said mr balch  we had better bury them in the ashgrove cemetery its a lovely spotâall my people are buried there

 the place is fine enough i acknowledge rejoined mr

walters  but i much doubt if you can procure the necessary ground   ob yes you can  said mr balch  there are a number oflots still unappropriated

 that may very likely be so but are you sure we can get one if we apply p 

of course we canâwhat is to prevent asked mr

balch

 you forget replied mr walters  that mrs garie was a coloured woman

 if it wasnt such a solemn subject i really should be obliged to laugh at you walters rejoined mr balch with a smileâyou talk ridiculously whatean her complexion have to do with her being buried there i should like to know p 

 it has everything to do with it can it be possible you are not aware that they wont even permit a coloured person to walk through the ground much less to be buried there  

 you astonish me walters  are you sure of it p 

 i give you my word of honour it is so but why should you be astonished at such treatment of the dead when you see how they conduct themselves towards the living p i have a friend continued zvlr walters  who purchased a pew for himself and family in a whitechurch and the deacons actually removed the floor from under it to prevent his sitting there

they refuse us permission to kneel by the side of the white communicants at the lords supper and give us separate pews in obscure corners of their churches all this you knowâ why then be surprised that they carry their prejudices into their graveyards âthe conduct is all of a piece

well walters i know the way things are conducted in our churches is exceedingly reprehensible but i really did not know they stretched their prejudices to such an extent

 i assure you they do then resumed mr walters  and in this very matter youll find im correct ask stormley the undertaker and hear what hell tell you oh a case in pointâabout six months ago one of our wealthiest citizens lost by death an old family servant a coloured woman a sort of halfhousekeeperâhalffriend she resembled him so much that it was generally believed she was his sister well he tried to have her laid in their family vault and it was refused the directors thought it would be creating a bad precedentâthey said as they would not sell lots to coloured persons they couldnt consistently permit them to be buried in those of the whites

 then ashgrove must be abandoned and in lieu of that what can you propose   asked mr balch

 i should say we cant do better than lay them in the graveyard of the coloured episcopal church

 let it be there then you will see to the arrangements walters i shall have enough on my hands for the present searching for that will i have already offered a large reward for itâi trust it may turn up yet

 perhaps it may rejoined mr walters  we must hope so at least ive brought the children to my house where they are under the care of a young lady who was a great friend of their mothers though it seems like putting too much upon the poor young creature to throw them upon her for consolation when she i almost distracted with her own griefs i think i mentioned to you yesterday that her father is missing  and to add to their anxieties their property has been all destroyed by the rioters they have a home with me for the present and may remain there as long as they please

 oh i remember you told me something of them yesterday  and now i come to think of it i saw in the journal this morning that a coloured man was lying at the hospital very much injured whose name they could not ascertain can it be possible that he is the man you are in search of 

 let me see the article asked mr walters mr balch handed him the paper and pointed out the paragraph in question

 ill go immediately to the hospital said he as he finished reading  and see if it is my poor friend  i have great fears that it is youll excuse my leaving so abruptlyâi must be off immediately

on hastening to the hospital mr walters arrived just in time to be admitted to the wards and on being shown the person whose name they had been unable to discover he immediately recognized his friend

 ellis my poor fellow he exclaimed springing forward

stop stop cried the attendant laying his hand upon mr walterss shoulder   he is hovering between life and death the least agitation might be fatal to him the doctor says if he survives the night he may probably get better but he has small chance of life i hardly think he will last twelve hours more hes been dreadfully beaten there are two or three gashes on his head his leg is broken and his hands have been so much cut that the surgeon thinks theyll never be of any use to him even if he recovers

 what awful intelligence for his family said mr walters  they are already half distracted about him

mr ellis lay perfectly unconscious of what was passing around him and his moans were deeply affecting to hear unable to move but one limbâhe was the picture of helplessness and misery

 its time to close we dont permit visitors to remain after this hour said the attendant come tomorrow yon can see your friend and remain longer with him  and bidding mr walters good morning he ushered him from the ward

 how shall i ever find means to break this to the girls and their mother  said he as he left the gates of the hospital  it will almost kill them really i dont know what i shall say to them

he walked homeward with hesitating steps and on arriving at his house he paused awhile before the door mustering up courage to enter at last he opened it with the air of a man who had a disagreeable duty to perform and had made up his mind to go through with it  tell miss ellis to come to the drawingroom said he to the servant merely say shes wantedâdont say ive returned

he waited but a few moments before esther made her appearance looking sad and anxious  oh its you she said with some surprise  you have news of father 

 yes esther i have news  but i am sorry to say not of a pleasant character

 oh mr walters nothing serious i hope has happened to him p  she asked in an agitated tone

im sorry to say there has esther he has met with an accidentâa sad and severe oneâhes been badly wounded

esther turned deadly pale at this announcement and leaned upon the table for support

i sent for you esther continued mr walters in preference to your mother because i knew you to be courageous in danger and i trusted you would be equally so in misfortune your fathers case is a very critical oneâvery

it appears that after leaving here he fell into the hands of the rioters by whom he was shockingly beaten he was taken to the hospital where he now remains  oh let me go to him at once do mr walters 

 my dear child it is impossible for you to see him today it is long past the visiting hour moreover i dont think him in a state that would permit the least agitation

tomorrow you can go with me

esther did not weep her heart was too full for tears

with a pale face and trembling lips she said to mr walters god give us strength to bear up under these misfortunes we are homelessâalmost beggarsâour friends have been murdered and my father is now trembling on the brink of the grave such troubles as these said she sinking into a chair  are enough to crush any one

 i know it esther  i know it my child i sympathize with you deeply all that i have is at your disposal you may command me in anything give yourself no uneasiness respecting the future of your mother and family let the result to your father be what it may  always bear in mind that next to god i am your best friend i speak thus frankly to you esther because i would not have you cherish any hopes of your fathers recovery from his appearance i should say there is but little if any i leave to you my good girl the task of breaking this sad news to your mother and sister  i would tell them but i must confess esther im not equal to it the events of the last day or two have almost overpowered me

esthers lips quivered again as she repeated the words  little hope  did the doctor say that p  she asked

 i did not see the dootor replied he  perhaps there may be a favourable change during the night id have you prepare for the worst whilst you hope for the best go now and try to break it as gently as possible to your mother

esther left the room with heavy step and walked to the chamber where her mother was sitting caddy also was there rocking backwards and forwards in a chair in an earnest endeavour to soothe to sleep little em who was sitting in her lap

 who was it esther p  asked her mother

 mr walters she hesitatingly answered

 was it p well has he heard anything of your father  she asked anxiously

esther turned away her head and remained silent

why dont you answerp asked her mother with aa alarmed loolc  if you know anything of him for gods sake tell me whatever it may be it cant be worse than i expect is he dead   she asked

 noâno mother hes not dead but hes sick very sick mother mr walters found him in the hospital  in the hospital how came he there p dont deceive me esther theres something behind all this are you telling me the truth  is he still alive  

 mother believe me he is still alive but how long he may remain so god only knows mrs ellis at this communication leant her head upon the table and wept uncontrollably

caddy put down her little charge and stood beside her mother endeavouring to soothe her whilst unable to restrain her own grief

 let us go to him esther said her mother rising  i must see himâlet us go at once

 we cant mother mr walters says its impossible for us to see him today  they dont admit visitors after a certain hour in the morning

they must admit me ill tell them im his wife when they know that they cant refuse me quickly dressing themselves esther caddy and their mother were about to start for the hospital when mr walters entered

where are you all going he asked

 to the hospital answered mrs ellis   i must see my husband

 i have just sent there ellen to make arrangements to hear of him every hour you will only have the grief of being refused admission if you go theyre exceedingly strict ââno one is admitted to visit a patient after a certain hour try and compose yourselves sit down i want to talk to you for a little while

mrs ellis mechanically obeyed and on sitting down little em crept into her lap and nestled in her arms

ellen said mr walters taking a seat by her its useless to disguise the fact that ellis is in a precarious situationâhow long he may be sick it is impossible to say as soon as it is practicable should he get better we will bring him here you remember ellen that years ago when i was young and poor ellis often befriended meânow tis my turn you must all make up your minds to remain with me âfor ever if you likeâfor the present whether you like it or not im going to be dreadfully obstinate and have my own way completely about the matter here ive a large house furnished from top to bottom with every comfort often ive wandered through it and thought myself a selfish old fellow to be surrounded with so much luxury and keep it entirely to myself god has blessed me with abundance and to what better use can it be appropriated than the relief of my friends 

how ellen you shall superintend the whole of the establishment esther shall nurse her father caddy shall stir up the servants and ill look on and find my happiness in seeing you all happy now what objection can you urge against that arrangement p  concluded he triumphantly

 why we shall put you to great inconvenience and place ourselves under an obligation we can never repay answered mrs ellis

dont despair of thatânever mind the obligation try and be as cheerful as you can  tomorrow we shall see ellis and perhaps find him better let us at least hope for the best

esther looked with grateful admiration at mr walters as he left the room  what a good heart he has mother said she as he closed the door behind him just such a great tender heart as one should expect to find in so fine a form

mrs ellis and her daughters were the first who were found next day at the office of the doorkeeper of the hospital waiting an opportunity to see their sick friends

 youre early maam said a little baldheaded official who sat at his desk fronting the door take a chair near the fireâits dreadful cold this morning

very cold replied esther taking a seat beside her mother  how long will it be before we can go in  

 oh youve good an hour to waitâthe doctor hasnt come yet replied the doorkeeper

 how is my husband  tremblingly inquired mrs ellis

 who is your husband âyou dont know his number do you  hever know names hereâgo by numbers

we dont know the number rejoined esther my father s name is ellis he was brought here two or three nights sinceâhe was beaten by the mob

 oh yes i know now who you meanânumber sixtybad case that shocking bad caseâhands choppedâhead smashedâleg broke hell have to cross over i guessâ make a die of it im afraid

mrs ellis shuddered and turned pale as the man coolly discussed her husbands injuries and their probable fatal termination caddy observing her agitation said  please sir dont talk of it mother cant bear it

the man looked at them compassionately for a few moments âthen continued you mustnt think me hardheartedâi see so much of these things that i cant feel them as others do this is a dreadful thing to you no doubt but its an everyday ong to meâpeople are always coming here mangled in all sorts of waysâso you see ive got used to itâin fact id rather miss em now if they didnt come ive sat in this seat every day for almost twenty years and he looked on the girls and their mother as he gave them this piece of information as if he thought they ought to regard him henceforth with great reverence

hot finding them disposed to converse the doorkeeper resumed the newspaper he was reading when they entered and was soon deeply engrossed in a horrible steamboat accident

the sound of wheels in the courtyard attracting his attention he looked up and remarked   heres the doctorâas soon as he has walked the wards youll be admitted

mrs ellis and her daughters turned round as the door opened and to their great joy recognized doctor burdett

how dye do said he extending his hand to mrs ellis â whats the matter p crying   he continued looking at their tearful faces  what has happened  

 oh doctor said esther fathers lying here very much injured and they think hell die said she giving way to a fresh burst of grief

 very much injuredâdieâhow is this fâi knew nothing of itâi havent been here before this week

esther hereupon briefly related the misfortunes that had befallen her father

dear me â dear me repeated the kind old doctor

 there my dear dont fretâhell get better my childâill take him in hand at once my dear mrs ellis weeping wont do the least good and only make you sick yourself

stop do nowâill go and see him immediately and as soon as possible you shall be admitted

they had not long to wait before a message came from doctor burdett informing them that they could now be permitted to see the sufferer

you must control yourselves said the doctor to the sobbing women as he met them at the door  you mustnt do anything to agitate himâhis situation is extremely critical

the girls and their mother followed him to the bedside of mr ellis who ghastly pale lay before them apparently unconscious

mrs ellis gave but one look at her husband and with a faint cry sank fainting upon the floor the noise partially aroused him he turned his head and after an apparent effort recognized his daughters standing beside him he made a feeble attempt to raise his mutilated hands and murmured faintly youve come at last then closing his eyes he dropped his arms as if exhausted by the effort

esther knelt beside him and pressed a kiss on his pale face

fatherâfather said she softly he opened his eyes again and a smile of pleasure broke over his wan face and lighted up his eyes as he feebly said  god bless you darlings  i thought youd never come wheres mother and caddy

 here answered esther  here by me your looks frightened her so that shes fainted

doctor burdett here interposed and said   you must all go now hes too weak to bear more at present

let me stay with him a little longer pleaded esther

no my child its impossible he continued besides your mother will need your attention  and whilst he spoke he led her into an adjoining room where the others had preceded her

charlie had now been many weeks under the hospitable roof of mrs bird improving in health and appearance

indeed it would have been a wonder if he had not as the kind mistress of the mansion seemed to do nought else from day to day but study plans for his comfort and pleasure

there was one sad drawback upon the contentment of the dear old lady and that was her inability to procure charlies admission to the academy

one morning mr whately called upon her and throwing himself into a chair exclaimed   its all to no purpose  their laws are as unalterable as those of the medes and persiansâ arguments and entreaty are equally thrown away upon them ive been closeted at least half a dozen times with each director and as all i can say wont make your protigd a shade whiter im afraid his admission to the academy must be given up

its too bad rejoined mrs bird and who may i ask were the principal opposers p 

 they all opposed it except mr weeks and mr

bentham

 indeed â âwhy they are the very ones that i anticipated would go against it tooth and nail and mr glentworthââ surely he was on our side  

 heâwhy my dear madam he was the most rabid of the lot with his sanctified face and canting tongue  

im almost ashamed to own itâbut its the truth and i shouldnt hesitate to tell itâi found the most pious of the directors the least accessible  as to old glentworth he actually talked to me as if i was recommending the committal of some horrid sin im afraid i shall be set down by him as a rabid abolitionist i got so warm on the subject ive cherished as strong prejudices against coloured people as any one but i tell you seeing how contemptible it makes others appear has gone a great way towards eradicating it in me

i found myself obliged to use the same arguments against it that are used by the abolitionists and in endeavouring to convince others of the absurdity of their prejudices i convinced myself

 id set my heart upon it said mrs bird in a tone of regret  but i suppose ill have to give it up charlie dont know ive made application for his admission and has been asking me to let him go a great many of the boys who attend there have become acquainted with him and it was only yesterday that mr glentworths sons were teasing me to consent to his beginning there the next term the boys

concluded she  have better hearts than their parents

 oh i begin to believe its all sham this prejudice im getting quite disgusted with myself for having had itâor rather thinking i had it as for saying it is innate or that there is any natural antipathy to that class its all perfect folly children are not born with it or why shouldnt they shrink from a black nurse or playmate p its all bosh concluded he indignantly as he brought his cane down with a rap

 charlies been quite a means of grace to you laughingly rejoined mrs bird amused at his vehemence of manner

 well im going to send him to sabbathschool next sunday and if there is a rebellion against his admission there i shall be quite in despair

it is frequently the case that we are urged by circumstances to the advocacy of a measure in which we take but little interest and of the propriety of which we are often very sceptical bul so surely as it is just in itself in our endeavours to convert others we convince ourselves and from lukewarm apologists we become earnest advocates this was just mr whatelys case he had begun to canvass for the admission of charlie with a doubtful sense of its propriety and in attempting to overcome the groundless prejudices of others he was convicted of his own

happily in his case conviction was followed by conversion and as he walked home from mrs birds he made up his mind that if they attempted to exclude charlie from the sabbathschool he would give them a piece of his mind and then resign his superintendency of it

on arriving at home he found waiting for him a young lady who was formerly a member of his class in the sabbathschool  ive come said she  to consult you about forming an adult class in our school for coloured persons we have a girl living with us who would be very glad to attend and she knows two or three others ill willingly take the class myself ive consulted the pastor and several others and no one seems to anticipate any objections from the scholars if we keep them on a separate bench and do not mix them up with the wrhite children

 im delighted to hear you propose it answered mr

whately quite overjoyed at the opening it presented  the plan meets my warmest approval i decidedly agree with you in the propriety of our making some effort for the elevation and instruction of this hitherto neglected classâany aid i can render

you astonish me interrupted miss cass though i must say very agreeably you were the last person from whom i thought of obtaining any countenance i did not come to you until armed with the consent of almost all the parties interested because from you i anticipated considerable opposition and in her delight the young girl grasped mr whatelys hand and shook it very heartily

 oh my opinions relative to coloured people have lately undergone considerable modification in fact said he with some little confusion  quite a thorough revolution i dont think we have quite done our duty by these people well well we must make the future atone for the past

miss cass had entered upon her project with all the enthusiasm of youth and being anxious that her class  in point of numbers should make a presentable appearance had drafted into it no less a person than aunt comfort

aunt comfort was a personage of great importance in the little village of warmouth and one whose services were ealled into requisition on almost every great domestic occasion

at births she frequently officiated and few young mothers thought themselves entirely safe if the black goodhumoured face of aunt comfort was not to be seen at their bedside

she had a hand in the compounding of almost every bridecake and had been known to often leave houses of feasting to prepare weary earthworn travellers for their final place of rest every one knew and all liked her and no one was more welcome at the houses of the good people of warmouth than aunt comfort

but whilst rendering her all due praise for her domestic acquirements justice compels us to remark that aunt comfort was not a literary character she could get up a shirt to perfection and made irreproachable chowder but she was not a woman of letters in fact she had arrived at maturity at a time when negroes and books beldom came in familiar contact and if the truth must be told she cared very little about the latter  but jist to blege miss cass she consented to attend her class averring as she did so  that she didnt spect she was gwine to larn nothin when she got thar

miss cass however was of the contrary opinion and anticipated that after a few sabbaths aunt comfort would prove to be quite a literary phenomenon the first time their class assembled the white children wellnigh dislocated their necks in their endeavours to catch glimpses of the coloured scholars who were seated on a backless bench in an obscure corner of the room

prominent amongst them shone aunt comfort who in honour of this extraordinary occasion had retrimmed her cap which was resplendent with bows of red ribbon as large as peonies she had a sundayschool primer in her hand and was repeating the letters with the utmost regularity as miss cass pronounced them they got on charmingly until after crossing over the letter  as a matter of course they came to p and q

look here said aunt comfort with a look of profound erudition  heres anoder  whats de use of having two of em  

no no aunt comfortâthats qâthe letter q

 tjmph grunted the old woman incredulously  whats de use of saying dats a q when you jest said not a minute ago twas op

this is not the same rejoined the teacher dont you see the little tail at the bottom of it 

aunt comfort took off her silver spectacles and gave the glasses of them a furious rub then after essaying another look exclaimed  what you dont mean dat ere little speck down at the bottom of it does yer p 

 yes aunt comfort that little speck as you call it makes all the differenceâit makes o into q

oh goway child said she indignantly you isnt gwine to fool me dat ar way i knows you of old honeyâ yous up to dese ere thingsâyou know you alius was mighty chevious and i isnt gwine to blieve dat dat ar little speck makes all the differenceâno such thing case it dontâdeys either both os or both qs im clar o datâdeys either one or tother

knowing by long experience the utter futility of attempting to convince aunt comfort that she was in the wrong by anything short of a miracle the teacher wisely skipped over the obnoxious letter then all went smoothly on to the conclusion of the alphabet

the lesson having terminated miss cass looked up and discovered standing near her a coloured boy who she correctly surmised was sent as an addition to her class  come here and sit down said she pointing to a seat next aunt comfort  what is your name  

charlie gave his name and residence which were entered in due form on the teachers book  now charles she continued  do you know your letters p 

 yes maam was the answer

 can you spell   she inquired to this also charlie gave an affirmative highly amused at the same time at being asked such a question

miss cass inquired no further into the extent of his acquirements it never having entered her head that he could do more than spell so handing him one of the primers she pointed out a line on which to begin the spirit of mischief entered our little friend and he stumbled through bla blaâ bli bliâblo bioâblu blu with great gravity and slowness

 you spell quite nicely particularly for a little coloured boy said miss cass encouragingly as he concluded the line   take this next she continued pointing to another  and when you have learned it i will hear you again

it was the custonj of the superintendent to question the scholars upon a portion of bible history given out the sabbath previous for study during the week it chanced that upon the day of which we write the subject for examination was one with which charlie was quite familiar

accordingly when the questions were put to the school he answered boldly and quickly to many of them and with an accuracy that astonished his fellow scholars

 how did you learn the answers to those questionsâyou cant read p  said miss cass

 yes but i can read answered charlie with a merry twinkle in his eye

 why didnt you tell me so before p  she asked

 because you didnt ask me he replied suppressing a grin

this was true enough so miss cass having nothing farther to say sat and listened whilst he answered the numerous and sometimes difficult questions addressed to the scholars

not so aunt comfort she could not restrain her admiration of this display of talent on the part of one of her despised race she was continually breaking out with expressions of wonder and applause  jis hear datâmassy on us âonly jis listen to de chile said she talks jis de same as if he was white why boy where you learn all dat p 

 across the bed sea cried charlie in answer to a question from the desk of the superintendent

 cross de bed sea umph chile you been dere p 

asked aunt comfort with a face full of wonder

what did you say  asked charlie whose attention had been arrested by the last question

 why i asked where you learned all dat bout de children of israel

oh i learned that at philadelphia was his reply i learned it at school with the rest of the boys

 you did   exclaimed she raising her hands with astonishment  is dere many more of em like you p 

charlie did not hear this last question of aunt comforts therefore she was rather startled by his replying in a loud tone immense hosts

did i everâjis hear dat deres mense hostes of em jest like him only think of it is dey all dere yet honey p 

 they were all drowned

 oh lordy lordy rejoined she aghast with horror for charlies reply to a question regarding the fate of pharaohs army had been by her interpreted as an answer to her question respecting his coloured schoolmates at philadelphia

 and how did you scape honey continued she  from drowning long wid the rest of em  

 why i wasnt there it was thousands of years ago

 look here what do you mean p  she whispered  didnt you say jest now dat you went to school wid em p 

this was too much for charlie who shook all over with suppressed laughter nor was miss cass proof against the contagionâshe was obliged to almost suffocate herself with her handkerchief to avoid a serious explosion

 aunt comfort you are mistaking him said she as soon as she could recover her composure   he is answering the questions of the superintendentânot yours and very well he has answered them too continued she  i like to see little boys aspiring  i am glad to see you so intelligentâyou must persevere charlie

 yes you must honey chimed in aunt comfort  ise very much like miss cass  i likes to see childrenâspecially children of colourâhave expiring minds

charlie went quite off at this and it was only by repeated hushâhushes from miss cass and a pinch in the back from aunt comfort that he was restored to a proper sense of his position

the questioning being now finished mr whately came to charlie praised him highly for his aptness and made some inquiries respecting his knowledge of the catechism also whether he would be willing to join the class that was to be catechised in the church during the afternoon to this charlie readily assented and at the close of the school was placed at the foot of the class preparatory to going into the church

the public catechizing of the scholars was always an event in the village  but now a novelty was given it by the addition of a black lamb to the flock and as a matter of course a much greater interest was manifested had a lion entered the doors of st stephens church he might have created greater consternation but he could not have attracted more attention than did our little friend on passing beneath its sacred portals the length of the aisle seemed interminable to him and on his way to the altar he felt oppressed by the scrutiny of eyes through which he was compelled to pass

mr dural the pastor looked kindly at him as he stood in front of the chancel and charlie took heart from his cheering bmile

now to aunt comfort who was the only coloured person who regularly attended the church a seat had been assigned beside the organ which elevated position had been given her that the congregation might indulge in their devotions without having their prejudices shocked by a too close contemplation of her ebony countenance

but aunt comfort on this occasion determined to get near enough to hear all that passed and leaving her accustomed seat she planted herself in one of the aisles of the gallery overlooking the altar where she remained almost speechless with wonder and astonishment at the unprecedented sight of a woolly head at the foot of the altar

charlie got on very successfully until called upon to repeat the lords prayer  and strange to say at this critical juncture his memory forsook him and he was uuable to utter a word of it for the life of him he could not think of anything but  now i lay me down to sleep âand confused and annoyed he stood unable to proceed at this stage of affairs aunt comforts interest in charlies success had reached such a pitch that her customary awe of the place she was in entirely departed and she exclaimed  ill give yer a startâour farrerâthen overwhelmed by the consciousness that she had spoken out in meeting she sank down behind a pewdoor completely extinguished at this there was an audible titter that was immediately suppressed after which charlie recovered his memory and started by the opportune prompting of aunt comfort he recited it correctly a few questions more terminated the examination and the children sat down in front of the altar until the conclusion of the service

mrs bird highly delighted with the debut of her pro uge bestowed no end of praises upon him and even made the coachman walk home that charlie might have a seat in the carriage as she alleged she was sure he must be much fatigued and overcome with the excitement of the day  then taking the reins into her own hands she drove them safely home

we must now return to philadelphia and pay a visit to the office of mr balch we shall find that gentleman in company with mr walters both look anxious and are poring over a letter which is outspread before them

it was like a thunderclap to me said mr balch   the idea of there being another heir never entered my brainâi didnt even know he had a living relative

 when did you get the letter  asked walters

 only this morning and i bent for you immediately

let us read it againâwell make another attempt to decipher this incomprehensible name confound the fellow why couldnt he write so that some one besides himself could read it we must stumble through it said he as he again began the letter as followsâ dear sirâimmediately on receipt of your favour i called upon mr thurston to take the necessary steps for securing the property of your late client to my great surprise i found that another claimant had started up and already taken the preliminary measures to entering upon possession this gentleman mr now what would you call that name walters pâto me it looks like stimmens or stunners or something of the kind 

never mind the name exclaimed waltersâskip that âlet me hear the rest of the letter we shall find out who he is soon enough in all conscience

 well then resumed mr balchâ this gentleman mr is a resident in your city and he will no doubt take an early opportunity of calling on you in reference to the matter it is my opinion that without a will in their favour these children cannot oppose his claim successfully if he can prove his consanguinity to mr garie his lawyer here showed me a copy of the letters and papers which are to be used as evidence and i must say they are entirely without flaw he proves himself undoubtedly to be the first cousin of mr garie you are no doubt aware that these children being the offspring of a slavewoman cannot inherit in this state except under certain circumstances the property of a white father i am therefore very much afraid that they are entirely at his mercy

well then said walters when mr balch finished reading the letter  it is clear there is an heir and his claim must be well sustained if such a man as beckley the first lawyer in the state does not hesitate to endorse it and as all the property with the exception of a few thousands in my hands lies in georgia im afraid the poor children will come off badly unless this new heir prove to be a man of generosityâat all events it seems we are completely at his mercy

 we must hope for the best rejoined mr balch  if he has any heart he certainly will make some provision for them the disappearance of that will is to me most unaccountable  i am confident it was at his house it seemed so singular that none of his papers should be missing except thatâthere were a great many others deeds mortgages c

scattered over the floor but no will 

the gentlemen were thus conversing when they heard a tap at the door  come in  cried mr balch  and in answer to the request in walked mr george stevens

mr walters and mr balch bowed very stiffly and the latter inquired what had procured him the honour of a visit

 i have called upon you in reference to the property of the late mr garie

 oli yon are acting in behalf of this new claimant i suppose   rejoined mr balch

 sir  said mr stevens looking as though he did not thoroughly understand him

i said repeated mr balch that i presumed you called in behalf of this newfound heir to mr garies property

mr stevens looked at him for a moment then drawing himself up exclaimed i am the heib  

you âyou the heir  cried both the gentlemen almost simultaneously

yes i am the heir   coolly repeated mr stevens with an assured look  i am the first cousin of mr garie 

you his first cousin pâit is impossible   said walters

youll discover it is not only possible but trueâi am as i said mr garies first cousin 

 if you are that you are more said walters fiercelyâ youre his murderer   at this charge mr stevens turned deathly pale  yes continued walters  you either murdered him or instigated others to do so  it was you who directed the rioters against both him and meâi have proof of what i say and can produce it now your motive is clear as dayâyou wanted his money and destroyed him to obtain it his blood is on your hands   hissed walters through hia clenched teeth

in the excitement consequent upon buch a charge mr

stevens unnoticed by himself had overturned a bottle of red ink and its contents had slightly stained his hands when walters charged him with having mr garies blood upon them he involuntarily looked down and saw his hands stained with red an expression of intense horror flitted over his face when he observed it but quickly regaining his composure he replied  its only a little ink

yes i know that is ink rejoined walters scornfully look at him balch he continued he doesnt dare to look either of us in the face

 its false exclaimed stevens with an effort to appear courageous  its as false as hell and any man that charges me with it is a liar

the words had scarcely passed his lips when walters sprang upon him with the ferocity of a tiger and seizing him by the throat shook and whirled him about as though he were a plaything

 stop stop  walters cried mr balch endeavouring to loose his hold upon the throat of mr stevens who was already purple in the face let him go this violence can benefit neither party loose your hold at this remonstrance walters dashed stevens from him into the farthest corner of the room exclaiming now go and prosecute me if you dare and ill tell for what i chastised you prosecute me for an assault if you think you can risk the consequences

mr balch assisted him from the floor and placed him iu a chair where he sat holding his side and panting for breath

when he was able to speak he exclaimed with a look of concentrated malignity  eemeraber well be even some day i never received a blow and forgot it afterwards bear that in mind

 this will never do gentlemen said mr balch soothingly   this conduct is unworthy of you you are unreasonable both of you when you have cooled down we will discuss the matter as we should

 youll discuss it alone then said stevens rising and walking to the door   and when you have any further communication to make you must come to me

 stop stop dont go cried mr balch following him out at the door which they closed behind them  dont go away in a passion mr stevens you and walters are both too hasty come in here and sit down said he opening the door of a small adjoining room  wait here one moment ill come back to you

 this will never do walters said he as he reentered his office  the fellow has the upper hand of us and we must humour him we should suppress our own feelings for he childrens sake you are as well aware as i am of the necessity of some compromiseâwe are in his power for the present and must act as circumstances compel us to

 i cant discuss the matter with him interrupted walters  hes an unmitigated scoundrel i couldnt command my temper in his presence for five minutes if you can arrange anything with him at all advantageous to the children i shall be satisfied it will be more than i expect only bear in mind that what i have in my hands belonging to garie we must retain he knows nothing of that

very well rejoined mr balch depend upon it ill do my best and closing the door he went back to mr

stevens

 now mr stevens said he drawing up a chair  we will talk over this matter dispassionately and try and arrive at some amicable arrangement be kind enough to inform me what your claims are

 mr balch you are a gentleman began mr stevens and therefore im willing to discuss the matter thoroughly with you youll find me disposed to do a great deal for these children but i wish it distinctly understood at the beginning that whatever i may give them i bestow as a favour i concede nothing to them as a right legally they have not the slightest claim upon me of that you who are an excellent lawyer must be well aware

 we wont discuss that point at present mr stevens i believe you intimated you would be kind enough to say upon what evidence you purposed sustaining your claims p 

well to come to the point then said stevens the deceased mr garie was as i before said my first cousin

his father and my mother were brother and sister my mother married in opposition to her parents desires  they cut her off from the family and for years there was no communication between them at my fathers death my mother made overtures for a reconciliation which were contemptuously rejected at length she died i was brought up in ignorance of who my grandparents were and only a fewmonths since on the death of my fathers sister did i make the discovery here said he extending the packet of letters which the reader will remember once agitated him so strangely here are the letters that passed between my mother and her father

mr balch took up one and read savannah â  madamâpermit me to return this letter wherein you declare yourself the loving and repentant daughter of bernard garie and at the same time inform you that by your own acts you have deprived yourself of all claim to that relation

in opposition to my wishes and in open defiance of my express commands you chose to unite your fortune with one in every respect your inferior if that union has not resulted as happily as you expected you must sustain yourself by the reflection that you are the author of your own misfortunes and alone to blame for your present miserable conditionârespectfully yours bebnabd gabie

mr balch read one after another letters of a similar purportâin fact a long correspondence between bernard garie and the mother of mr stevens when he had finished the latter remarked  in addition to those i can produce my mothers certificate of baptism her marriage certificate and every necessary proof of my being her son if that does not suffice to make a strong case i am at a loss to imagine what will

mr balch pondered a few moments and then inquired looking steadily at mr stevens  how long have you known of this relationship p 

 oh ive known it these three years

 three years  why my dear sir only a few moments ago you said a few months

 oh did ip said mr stevens very much confused j  i meant or should have said three years

 then of course you were aware that mr garie was your cousin when he took the house beside you p 

 oh yesâthat isâyesâyes i was aware of it

 and did you make any overtures of a social character p 

asked mr balch

well yesâthat is to say my wife did

 where were you the night of the murder 

mr stevens turned pale at this question and replied hesitatingly  why at home of course

 you were at home and saw the house of your cousins assaulted and made no effort to succour them or their children the next morning you are one of the coroners inquest and hurry through the proceedings never once saying a word of your relationship to them nor yet making any inquiry respecting the fate of the children it is very singular

 i dont see what this crossquestioning is to amount to it has nothing to do with my claim as heir

we are coming to that rejoined mr balch  this as i said is very singular  and when i couple it with some other circumstances that have come to my knowledge it is more than singularâit is suspicious here are a number of houses assaulted by a mob two or three days before the assault takes placea list in your handwriting and which is headed  places to be attached is found under circumstances that leave no doubt that it came directly from you well the same mob that attacks these placesâmarked out by youâ traverse a long distance to reach the house of your nextdoor neighbour they break into it and kill him and you who are aware at the time that he is your own cousin do not attempt to interpose to prevent it although it can be proved that you were allpowerful with the marauders ho you allow him to be destroyed without an effort to save him and immediately claim his property how mr stevens people disposed to be suspiciousâseeing how much you were to be the gainer by his removal and knowing you had some connection with this mobâmight not scruple to say that you instigatedthe attack by which he lost his life  and i put it to youânow dont you think that if it was any one else you would say that the thing looked suspicious p 

mr stevens winced at this but made no effort to reply

mr balch continued  what i was going to remark is simply this as we are in possession of these facts and able to prove them by competent witnesses we should not be willing to remain perfectly silent respecting it unless you made what we regarded as a suitable provision for the children

 im willing as i said before to do something  but dont flatter yourself ill do any more than i originally intended from any fear of disclosures from you im not to be frightened said mr stevens

 im not at all disposed to attempt to frighten you  however you know how far a mere statement of these facts would go towards rendering your position in society more agreeable

a person who has been arrested on suspicion of murder is apt to be shunned and distrusted it cant be helped people are so very squeamishâthey will draw back you know under such circumstances

i dont see how such a suspicion can attach itself to me

rejoined stevens sharply

 oh well we wont discuss that any further let me hear what you will do for the children

mr balch saw from the nervous and embarrassed manner of mr stevens that the indirect threat of exposing him had had considerable effect and his downcast looks and agitation rather strengthened in his mind the suspicions that had been excited by the disclosures of mr walters

after a few moments silence mr stevens said ill settle three thousand dollars on each of the children how i think that is treating them liberally

 liberally  exclaimed balch in a tone of contemptâ  liberally you acquire by the death of their father property worth one hundred and fifty thousand dollars and you offer these children who are the rightful heirs three thousand dollars  that sir wont suffice

 i think it should then rejoined stevens by the laws of georgia these children instead of being his heirs are my slaves their mother was a slave before them and they were bom slaves  and if they were in savannah i could sell them both tomorrow on the whole i think ive made you a very fair offer and id advise you to think of it

 no mr stevens  i shall accept no such paltry sum if you wish a quick and peaceful possession of what you are pleased to regard as your rights you must tender something more advantageous or i shall feel compelled to bring this thing into court even at the risk of loss and there you know we should be obliged to make a clear statement of everything connected with this business it might be advantageous to us to bring the thing fully before the court and publicâbut im exceedingly doubtful whether it would advance your interest

stevens winced at this and asked  what would you consider a fair offer p 

 i should consider all a just offer half a fair one and a quarter as little as you could have the conscience to expect us to take

 i dont see any use in this chaffering mr balch said stephens   you cant expect me to give you any such bums as you propose name a sum that you can reasonably expect to get

 well said mr balch rising you must give us fifteen thousand dollars and you should think yourself well off then

we could commence a suit and put you to nearly that expense to defend it to say nothing of the notoriety that the circumstance would occasion you both walters and i are willing to spend both money and time in defence of these childrens rights  i assure you they are not friendless

 ill give twelve thousand and not a cent more if im hung for it said mr stevens almost involuntarily

 who spoke of hanging p  asked mr balch

 oh  rejoined stevens  that is only my emphatic way of speaking

 of course you meant figuratively said mr balch in a tone of irony  mentally adding  as i hope you may be one day literally

mr stevens looked flushed and angry but mr balch continued without appearing to notice him and said  ill speak to walters should he acquiesce in your proposal i am willing to accept it however i cannot definitely decide without consulting him tomorrow i will inform you of the result

to charlie the summer had been an exceedingly short onetime had flown so pleasantly away everything that could be done to mate the place agreeable mrs bird had effected

amongst the number of her acquaintances who had conceived a regard for her young protigi was a promising artist to whom she had been a friend and patroness charlie paid him frequent visits and would sit hour after hour in his studio watching the progress of his work having nothing else at the time to amuse him he one day asked the artists permission to try his hand at a sketch being supplied with the necessary materials he commenced a copy of a small drawing and was working assiduously when the artist came and looked over his shoulder

 did you ever draw before   he asked with a start of surprise

never replied charlie except on my slate at school

i sometimes used to sketch the boys faces

 and you have never received any instructions p 

 neverânot even a hint was the answer

 and this is the first time you have attempted a sketch upon paper p 

 yes the very first

 then you are a little prodigy said the artist slapping him upon the shoulder  i must take you in hand you have nothing else to do come here regularly every day and ill teach you will you come  

 certainly if you wish it but now tell me do you really think that drawing good p 

 well charlie if i had done it it would be pronounced very bad for me  but coming from your hands its something astonishing

 really nowâyoure not joking me  

no charlie im in earnestâi assure you i am it is drawn with great spirit and the boy that you have put in by the pump is exceedingly well done

this praise served as a great incentive to our little friend who day after day thenceforth was found at the studio busily engaged with his crayons and making rapid progress in his new art

he had been thus occupied some weeks and one morning was hurrying to the breakfasttable to get through his meal that he might be early at the studio when he found mrs bird in her accustomed seat looking very sad

why what is the matter  he asked on observing the unusually grave face of his friend

oh charlie my dear ive received very distressing intelligence from philadelphia your father is quite ill

 my father ill  cried he with a look of alarm

yes my dear quite sickâso says my letter here are two for you

charlie hastily broke the seal of one and read as follows  mydeab little bbothebâwe are all in deep distress in consequence of the misfortunes brought upon us by the mob

our home has been destroyed and worse than all our poor father was caught and so severely beaten by the rioters that for some days his life was entirely despaired of fhank god 

he is now improving and we have every reasonable hope of his ultimate recovery mother caddy and i as you may well suppose are almost prostrated by this accumulation of misfortunes and but for the kindness of mr walters with whom we are living i do not know what would have become of us dear mr and mrs garieâhere followed a passage that was so scored and crossed as to be illegible after a short endeavour to decipher it he continued we would like to see you very much and mother grows every day more anxious for your return i forgot to add in connection with the mob that mr walterss house was also attacked but unsuccessfully the rioters having met a signal repulse

mother and caddy send a world of love to you so does kinch who comes every day to see us and is often extremely useful give our united kind regards to mrs bird and thank her in our behalf for her great kindness to youâever yours  esther

 psâdo try and manage to come home soon

the tears trickled down charlies cheek as he perused the letter which when he had finished reading he handed to mrs bird and then commenced the other this proved to be from kinch who had spent all the spare time at his disposal since the occurrence of the mob in preparing it

 to mr charles ellis esq at mbs birds

 philadelphia

deer sib and honnoeed eriendâitake this chance to write to you to tell you that i am well and that we are all well except your father who is sick and i hope you are enjoying the same blessin we had an awful fight and i was there and i was one of the captings i had a sord on and the next mornin we had a grate brekfast but nobody eat anything but me and i was obliged to eat or the wittles would have spoiled the mob had guns as big as cannun  and they shot them off and the holes are in the shutter yet and when you come back i will show them to you your father is very bad and i have gone back to school and i am licked every day because i dont know my lesson a great big boy with white woolly hair and pinkish grey eyes has got your seat i put a pin under him one day and he told on me  and we are to have a fijjljt tamarrâo the boys call him  short and dirty because be aint tall and never washes his face

_ _  ps this is the best skull and crossbones that i can make come home soon yours c  k s de youngs esq

charlie could not but smile through his tears as he read this curious epistle which was not more remarkable for its graceful composition than its wonderful chirography some of the lines were written in blue ink some in red and others in that pale muddy black which is the peculiar colour of ink after passing through the various experiments of schoolboys âwho generally entertain the belief that all foreign substances from molassescandy to breadcrumbs necessarily improve the colour and quality of that important liquid

why every other word almost is commenced with a capital  and i declare hes even made some in german text

cried charlie running his finger mirthfully along the lines until he came to  your father is very bad here the tears came welling up again âthe shower had returned almost before the sun had departed and hiding his face in his hands he leant sobbing on the table

 cheer up charlieâcheer up my little man all may go well yet

 mrs bird he sobbed  youve been very kind to me  yet i want to go home i must see mother and father

you see what esther writesâthey want me to come home do let me go

 of course you shall go if you wish yet i should like you to remain with me if you will

no no mr bird i mustnt stay it wouldnt be right for me to remain here idle and enjoying myself and they so poor and unhappy at home i couldnt stay said he rising from the tableâ i must go

 well my dear you cant go now sit down and finish your breakfast or you will have a headache   im not hungryâi cant eat he replied  my appetite has all gone and stealing away from the room he went up into his chamber threw himself on the bed and wept bitterly

mrs bird was greatly distressed at the idea of losing her little favourite he had been so much with her that she had become strongly attached to him and therefore looked forward to his departure with unfeigned regret but charlie could not be persuaded to stay and reluctantly mrs bird made arrangements for his journey home even the servants looked a little sorry when they heard of his intended departure  and eeuben the coachman actually presented him with a jackknife as a token of his regard

mrs bird accompanied him to the steamer and placed him under the special care of the captain  so that he was most comfortably provided for until his arrival in hew york where he took the cars direct for home

hot having written to inform them on what day he might be expected he anticipated giving them a joyful surprise and with this end in view hastened in the direction of mr

walterss as he passed along his eye was attracted by a figure before him which he thought he recognized and on closer inspection it proved to be his sister caddy

full of boyish fun he crept up behind her and clasped his hands over her eyes exclaiming in an assumed voice  how who am ip

go away you impudent nasty thing cried caddy plunging violently charlie loosed his hold she turned and beheld her brother

 oh charlie charlie is it you p why bless you you naughty fellow how you frightened me  said she throwing her arms round his neck and kissing him again and again

 when did you come p oh how delighted mother and ess wifi be 

 i only arrived about half an hour ago how are mother and father and esther p 

 mother and ess are well and father better but im so glad to see you she cried with a fresh burst of tears and additional embraces

 why cad said he endeavouring to suppress some watery sensations of his own  im afraid youre not a bit pleased at my returnâyoure actually crying about it

ob im so glad to see you that i cant help it she replied as she fell to crying and kissing him more furiously than before

charlie became much confused at these repeated demonstrations of joyful affection in the crowded street and gently disengaging her remarked  see caddy everybody is looking at us  let us walk on

 i had almost forgot i was sent on an errandâhowever its not of much consequenceâill go home again with you

and taking his hand they trudged on together

 how did you say father was p  he asked again

 ob hes better bodily that is he has someappetite sits up every day and is gradually getting stronger but hes all wrong here said she tapping her forehead  sometimes ho dont know any of usâand it makes us all feel so bad here the tears came trickling down again as she continued   oh charlie what those white devils will have to answer for

when i think of how much injury they have done us i hate them i i know its wrong to hate anybodyâbut i cant help it and i believe god hates them as much as i do 

charlie looked gloomy and as he made no rejoinder sho continued we didnt save a thing not even a change of clothes  they broke and burnt up everything and then tho way they beat poor father was horribleâhorrible just thinkâthey chopped his fingers nearly all off so that he has only the btumps left charlie charlie  she cried wringing her hands  its heartrending to see himâhe cant even feed himself and hell never be able to work again 

 dont grieve cad aid charlie with an effort to suppresg his own tears  im almost a man now continued he drawing himself upâ dont he afraid ill take care of you all 

thus conversing they reached mr walterss caddy wanted charlie to stop and look at the damage effected by the mob upon the outside of the house but he was anxious to go in and ran up the steps and gave the bell a very sharp pull the servant who opened the door was about to make some exclamation of surprise and was only restrained by a warning look from charlie hurrying past them caddy led the way to the room where her mother and esther were sitting with a cry of joy mrs ellis caught him in her arms and before he was aware of their presence he found himself half smothered by her and esther

they had never been separated before his trip to warmouth  and their reunion under such circumstances was particularly affecting none of them could speak for a few moments and charlie clung round his mothers neck as though he would never loose his hold  mother mother 

was all he could utter yet in that word was comprised a world of joy and affection

esther soon came in for her share of caresses then charlie inquired  wheres father    in here said mrs ellis leading the way to an adjoining room  i dont think he will know youâperhaps he may

in one corner of the apartment propped up in a large easy chair by a number of pillows sat poor mr ellis gazing vacantly about the room and muttering to himself his hair had grown quite white and his form was emaciated in the extreme there was a broad scar across his forehead and his dull lustreless eye were deeply sunken in his head he took no notice of them as they approached but continued muttering and looking at his hands

charlie was almost petrified at the change wrought in his father a few months before he had left him in the prime of healthful manhood now he was bent and spectrelike and old in appearance as if the frosts of eighty winters had suddenly fallen on him

mrs ellis laid her hand gently upon his shoulder and said  husband heres charlie he made no reply but continued muttering and examining his mutilated hands  its charlie she repeated

 oh ay  nice little boy  he replied vacantly  whose son is he p 

mrs elliss voice quivered as she reiterated  its charlie âour charlieâdont you know him  

 oh yes  nice little boyânice little boy oh  he continued iu a suppressed and hurried tone as a look of alarm crossed his face  run home quick little boy and tell your mother theyre coming thousands of them theyve guns and swords and clubs hush there they comeâthere they come  and he buried his face in the shawl and trembled in an agony of fright

 oh mother this is dreadful  exclaimed charlie  dont he know any of you p

yes sometimes his mind comes backâvery seldom thoughâonly for a very little while come away talking to him sometimes makes him worse and slowly and sorrowfully the two left the apartment

that evening after mr ellis had been safely bestowed in bed the family gathered round the fire in the room of mrs

ellis where charlie entertained them with a description of warmouth and of the manner in which he had passed the time whilst there he was enthusiastic respecting mrs bird and her kindness  mother she is such a dear old lady if id been as white as snow and her own son she couldnt have been kinder to me she didnt want me to come away and cried ever so much let me show you what she gave me 

charlie thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out a small wallet from which he counted out four tendollar bills two fives and a two dollar and a half gold piece  aint i rich

said he as with the air of a millionaire he tossed the money upon a table  how he continued  do you know what im about to do p  hot receiving any answer from his wondering sisters or mother he added  why just thisâhere mother this is yours said he placing the four tendollar bills before her  and here are five apiece for esther and cad  the balance is for your humble servant now then

he concluded  what do you think of that p 

mrs ellis locked fondly at him and stroking his head told him that he was a good son and esther and caddy declared him to be the best brother in town

now girls said he with the air of a patriarch what do you intend to do with your money p 

 mine will go towards buying me a dress and esther will save hers for a particular purpose said caddy ill tell you something about her and mr walters continued she with a mischievous look at her sister

oh caddyâdont i aint you ashamed to plague me so p  asked esther blushing to the roots of her hair

 mother pray stop her cried she pleadingly

 hush caddy  interposed her mother authoritatively  you shall do no such thing

well resumed caddy mother says i mustnt tell but i can say this much

esther here put her hand over her sisters mouth and effectually prevented any communication she was disposed to make

never mind her ess  cried charlie youll tell me all in good time especially if its anything worth knowing

esther made no reply but releasing her sister hurried out of the room and went upstairs to charlies chamber where he found her on retiring for the night

im glad youre here ess said he youll indulge me

here is the keyâopen my trunk and get me out a nightcap im too tired or too lazy to get it for myself esther stooped down opened the trunk and commenced searching for the article of headgear in question  come ess said charles coaxingly  tell me what this is about you and mr

walters

she made no reply at first but fumbled about in the bottom of the trunk professedly in search of the nightcap â which she at that moment held in her hand  cant you tell me p  he again asked

 oh theres nothing to tell charlie  she answered there must be something ess or you wouldnt have blushed up so when cad was about to speak of it do said he approaching her and putting his arm round her neckâ  do tell me all about itâi am sure there is some secret i 

 oh no charlieâthere is no secret its only this

here she stopped and blushing turned her head away

 ess this is nonsense said charlie impatiently if its anything worth knowing why cant you tell a fellow p come

said he kissing her  tell me now like a dear old ess as you are

 well charlie said she jerking the words out with an effort  mrâmr walters has asked me to marry him 

phewâgemini that is news   exclaimed charlie and are you going to accept him ess p 

 i dont know she answered

 dont know   repeated charlie in a tone of surprise

 why ess im astonished at youâsuch a capital fellow as he is  half the girls of our acquaintance would give an eye for the chance

 but he is so rich   responded esther

well now thats a great objection aint it i should say all the better on that account rejoined charlie

 the money is the great stumblingblock continued she  everybody would say i married him for that

 then everybody would lie as everybody very often does 

if i was you ess and loved him i shouldnt let his fortune stand in the way i wish continued he pulling up his shirtcollar  that some amiable young girl with a fortune of a hundred thousand dollars would make me an offerâid like to catch myself refusing her  

the idea of a youth of his tender years marrying any one seemed so ludicrous to esther that she burst into a hearty fit of laughter to the great chagrin of our hero who seemed decidedly of the opinion that his sister had not a proper appreciation of his years and inches

 dont laugh ess  but tell meâdo you really intend to refuse him  

 i cant decide yet charlie answered she seriously  if we were situated as we were beforeâwere not such absolute paupersâi wouldnt hesitate to accept him but to bring a family of comparative beggars upon himâi cant make up my mind to do that

charlie looked grave as esther made this last objection boy as he was he felt its weight and justice  well ess

rejoined he  i dont know what to say about itâof course i cant advise what does mother say  

 she leaves it entirely to me she answered  she says i must act just as i feel is right

 i certainly wouldnt have him at all ess if i didnt love him and if i did i shouldnt let the money stand in the wayâso good night 

charlie slept very late the next morning and was scarcely dressed when esther knocked at his door with the cheerful tidings that her father had a lucid interval and was waiting to see him

dressing himself hastily he followed her into their fathers room when he entered the feeble sufferer stretched out his mutilated arms towards him and clasped him round the neck  they tell me said he  that you came yesterday and that i didnt recognize you x thought vthen i awoke this morning that i had a dim recollection of having seen some dear face but my head aches so that i often forgetâ yes often forget my boy he continued  you are all your mother and sisters have to depend upon now imâim

here his voice faltered as he elevated his stumps of handsâ  im helpless  but you must take care of them im an old man now said he despondingly

i will father ill try so hard  replied charlie

 it was cruel in them wasnt it son he resumed  see theyve made me helpless for ever 

charlie restrained the tears that were forcing themselves up and rejoined never fear father ill do my best i trust i shall soon be able to take care of you

his father did not understand himâhis mind was gone again and he was staring vacantly about him charlie endeavoured to recall his attention but failed for he began muttering about the mob and his hands they were compelled to quit the room and leave him to himself as he always became quiet sooner by being left alone

we must now admit our readers to a consultation that is progressing between mr balch and mr walters respecting the future of the two garie children they no doubt entered upon the conference with the warmest and most earnest desire of promoting the childrens happiness but unfortunately their decision failed to produce the wishedfor result

 i scarcely thought you would hare succeeded so well with him said walters  he is such an inveterate scoundrel  depend upon it nothing but the fear of the exposure resulting from a legal investigation would ever have induced that scamp to let twelve thousand dollars escape from his clutches

i am glad you have secured that much when we add it to the eight thousand already in my possession it will place them in very comfortable circumstances even if they never get any more

 i think we have done very well rejoined mr balch   we were as much in his power a he was in oursânot in the same way however a legal investigation no matter how damaging it might have been to his reputation would not have placed us in possession of the property or invalidated his claim as heir i think on the whole we may as well be satisfied and trust in providence for the future so now then we will resume our discussion of that matter we had under consideration the other day i cannot but think that my plan is best adapted to secure the boys happiness

 im sorry i cannot agree with you mr balch i have tried to view your plan in the most favourable light yet i cannot rid myself of a presentiment that it will result in the ultimate discovery of his peculiar position and that most probably at some time when his happiness is dependent upon its concealment an undetected forger who is in constant fear of being apprehended is happy in comparison with that coloured man who attempts in this country to hold a place in the society of whites by concealing his origin he must live in constant fear of exposure this dread will embitter every enjoyment and make him the most miserable of men

 you must admit rejoined mr balch  that i have their welfare at heart i have thought the matter over and over and cannot for the life of me feel the weight of your objections the children are peculiarly situated everything seems to favour my views their mother the only relative they had whose african origin was distinguishable is dead and both of them are so exceedingly fair that it would never enter the brain of any one that they were connected with coloured people by ties of blood clarence is old enough to know the importance of concealing the fact and emily might be kept with us until her prudence also might be relied upon

you must acknowledge that as white persons they will be better off

 i admit answered mr walters  that in our land of liberty it is of incalculable advantage to be white that is beyond dispute and no one is more painfully aware of it than i often i have heard men of colour say they would not be white if they couldâhad no desire to change their complexions  ive written some down fools others liars why

continued he with a sneering expression of countenance  it is everything to be white one feels that at every turn in our boasted free country where all men are upon an equality

when i look around me and see what i have made myself in spite of circumstances and think what i might have been with the same heart and brain beneath a fairer skin i am almost tempted to curse the destiny that made me what i am time after time when scraping toiling saving i have asked myself to what purpose is it all pâperhaps that in the future white men may point at and call me sneeringly  a nigger millionaire or condescend to borrow money of me

ah often when some negrohating white man has been forced to ask a loan at my hands ive thought of shylock and his pound of flesh and ceased to wonder at him theres no doubt my dear sir but what i fully appreciate the advantage of being white yet with all i have endured and yet endure from day to day i esteem myself happy in comparison with that man who mingling in the society of whites is at the same time aware that he has african blood in his veins and is liable at any moment to be ignominiously hurled from his position by the discovery of his origin he is never safe

i have known instances where parties have gone on for years and years undetected but some untoward circumstance brings them out at last and down they fall for ever

 walters my dear fellow you will persist in looking upon his being discovered as a thing of course i see no reason for the anticipation of any such result i dont see how he is to be detectedâit may never occur and do you feel justified in consigning them to a position which you know by painful experience to be one of the most disagreeable that can be endured ought we not to aid their escape from it if we can 

mr walters stood reflectively for some moments and then exclaimed  ill make no farther objection i would not have the boy say to me hereafter  but for your persisting in identifying me with a degraded people i might have been better and happier than i am however i cannot but feel that concealments of this kind are productive of more misery than comfort

 we will agree to differ about that walters  and now having your consent i shall not hesitate to proceed in the matter with full reliance that the future will amply justify my choice

well well as i said before i will offer no further objection now let me hear the details of your plan

 i have written answered mr balch  to mr eustis a friend of mine living at sudbury where there is a large preparatory school for boys at his house i purpose placing clarence mr eustis is a most discreet man and a person of liberal sentiments i feel that i can confide everything to him without the least fear of his ever divulging a breath of it he is a gentleman in the fullest sense of the term and at his house the boy will have the advantage of good society and will associate with the best people of the place

 has he a family p  asked mr walters

he is a widower answered mr balch a maiden sister of his wifes presides over his establishment she will be kind to clarence i am confident she has a motherly soft heart and is remarkably fond of children i have not the least doubt but that he will be very happy and comfortable there i think it very fortunate walters he continued  that he has so few coloured acquaintancesâno boyish intimacies to break up and it will be as well to send him away before he has an opportunity of forming them besides being here where everything will be so constantly reviving the remembrance of his recent loss he may grow melancholy and stupid i have several times noticed his reserve so unusual in a child his dreadful loss and the horrors that attended it have made a deep impressionâstupified him to a certain extent i think well well we will get him off and once away at school and surrounded by lively boys this dulness will soon wear off

the gentlemen having fully determined upon his being sent it was proposed to bring him in immediately and talk to him relative to it he was accordingly sent for and came into the room placinghimself beside the chair of mr walters

clarence had altered very much since the death of his parents his face had grown thin and pale and he was much taller than when he came to philadelphia a shade of melancholy had overspread his face there was now in his eyes that expression of intense sadness that characterized his mothers  you sent for me p  he remarked inquiringly to mr walters

yes my boy he rejoined we sent for you to have a little talk about school would you like to go to school again p 

 oh yes  answered clarence his face lighting up with pleasure  i should like it of all things it would be much better than staying at home all day doing nothing the days are so long concluded he with a sigh n ah we will soon remedy that rejoined mr balch  when you go to sudbury

 sudbury  repeated clarence with surprise  where is that p i thought you meant to go to school here

 oh no my dear said mr balch i dont know of any good school here such as you would like we wish to send you to a place where you will enjoy yourself finelyâwhere you will have a number of boys for companions in your studies and pleasures

 and is em going with me p  he asked

 oh no that is not possible it is a school for boys exclusively you cant take your sister there rejoined mr

walters

 then i dont want to go said clarence decidedly j  i dont want to go where i cant take em with me

mr balch exchanged glances with mr walters and looked quite perplexed at this new opposition to his scheme

nothing daunted however by this difficulty he by dint of much talking and persuasion brought clarence to look upon the plan with favour and to consent reluctantly to go without his sister

but the most delicate part of the whole business was yet to comeâthey must impress upon the child the necessity of concealing the fact that he was of african origin neither beemed to know how to approach the subject clarence however involuntarily made an opening for them by inquiring if emily was to go to miss jordans school again

 no my dear answered mr balch  miss jordan wont permit her to attend school there

 why p  asked clarence

because she is a coloured child rejoined mr balch

now clarence be continued you are old enough i presume to know the difference that exists between the privileges and advantages enjoyed by the whites and those that are at the command of the coloured people white boys can go to better schools and they can enter college and become professional men lawyers doctors c or they may be merchants â in fact they can be anything they please

coloured people can enjoy none of these advantages they are shut out from them entirely now which of the two would you rather beâcoloured or white  

i bhould much rather be white of course answered clarence  but i am coloured and cant help myself said he innocently

 but my child we are going to send you where it is not known that you are coloured j and you must never never tell it because if it became known you would be expelled from the school as you were from miss jordans

 i didnt know we were expelled rejoined clarence  i know she sent us home but i could not understand what it was for im afraid they will send me from the other school wont they know i am coloured p 

 no my child i dont think they will discover it unless you should be foolish enough to tell it yourself in which case both mr walters and myself would be very much grieved

 but suppose some one bhould ask me suggested clarence

no one will ever ask you such a question said mr balch impatiently  all you have to do is to be silent yourself on the subject should any of your schoolmates ever make inquiries respecting your parents all you have to answer is they were from georgia and you are an orphan

clarences eyes began to moisten as mr balch spoke of his parents and after a few moments he asked with some hesitation am i never to speak of motherp i love to talk of mother

 yes my dear of course you can talk of your mother

answered mr balch with great embarrassment  only you know my child you need not enter into particulars as regards her appearance  that is youâahâneed not say she was a coloured woman you must not say that you understand p

 yes sir answered clarence

very well then bear that in mind you must know clarence continued he  that this concealment is necessary for your welfare or we would not require it and you must let me impress it upon you that it is requisite that you attend strictly to our directions

mr walters remained silent during most of this conversation he felt a repugnance to force upon the child a concealment the beneficial results of which were the reverse of obvious so he merely gave clarence some useful advice respecting his general conduct and then permitted him to leave the room

the morning fixed upon for their departure for sudbury turned out to be cold and cheerless and clarence felt very gloomy as he sat beside his sister at their early breakfast of which he was not able to eat a morsel  do eat something clary said she coaxingly  only look what nice buckwheat cakes these are cook got up ever so early on purpose to bake them for you

 ho sis he replied  i cant eat i feel so miserable everything chokes me

well eat a biscuit then she continued as she buttered it and laid it on his plate  do eat it now

more to please her than from a desire to eat he forced down a few mouthfuls of it and drank a little tea then laying his arm round her neck he said em you must try hard to learn to write soon so that i may hear from you at least once a week

 oh i shall boon know how im in gs and hs now

aunt estherâshe says i may call her aunt estherâteaches me every day aint i getting on nicely p 

 oh yes you learn very fast said esther encouragingly as she completed the pile of sandwiches she was preparing for the young traveller then turning to look at the timepiece on the mantel she exclaimed  quarter to sevenâhow time flies mr balch will soon be here you must be all ready clarence so as not to keep him waiting a moment clarence arose from his scarcely tasted meal began slowly to put on his overcoat and make himself ready for the journey em tied on the warm woollen neckcomforter kissing him on each cheek as she did so and whilst they were thus engaged mr balch drove up to the door

charlie who had come down to see him off tried with his mouth full of buckwheat cake to say something consolatory and gave it as his experience  that a fellow soon got over that sort of thing that separations must occur sometimes câand on the whole endeavoured to talk in a very manly and philosophical strain but his precepts and practice proved to be at utter variance for when the moment of separation really came and he saw the tearful embrace of em and her brother he caught the infection of grief and cried as heartily as the best of them there was but little time however to spare for leavetakings and the young traveller and his guardian were soon whirling over the road towards new york

by a singular chance clarence found himself in the same car in which he had formerly rode when they were on their way to philadelphia he recognized it by some peculiar paintings on the panel of the door and the ornamental border of the ceiling this brought back a tide of memories and he began contrasting that journey with the present

opposite was the seat on which his parents had sat in the bloom of health and elate with joyous anticipations he rememberedâ oh so well â his others pleasant smile his mothers soft and gentle voice both now were gone

death had made rigid that smiling faceâher soft voice was hushed for everâand the cold snow was resting on their bosoms in the little churchyard miles away truly the contrast between now and then was extremely saddening and the child bowed his head upon the seat and sobbed in bitter grief

what is the matterp asked mr balch not crying again i hope i thought you were going to be a man and that we were not to have any more tears come  continued he patting him encouragingly on the back  cheer up you are going to a delightful place where you will find a number of agreeable playmates and have a deal of fun and enjoy yourself amazingly

 but it wont be home replied clarence

 true replied mr balch a little touched  it wont seem so at first but youll soon like it ill guarantee that

clarence was not permitted to indulge his grief to any great extent for mr balch soon succeeded in interesting him in the various objects that they passed on the way

on the evening of the next day they arrived at their destination and clarence alighted from the cars cold fatigued and spiritless there had been a heavy fall of snow a few days previous and the town of sudbury which was built upon the hillside shone white and sparkling in the clear winter moonlight

it was the first time that clarence had ever seen the ground covered with snow and he could not restrain his admiration at the novel spectacle it presented to him  oh lookâ oh do look mr balch he exclaimed how beautifully white it looks  it seems as if the town was built of salt

it was indeed a pretty sight near them stood a clump of fantasticshaped trees their gnarled limbs covered with snow and brilliant with the countless icicles that glistened like precious stones in the bright light that was reflected upon them from the windows of the station a little farther on between them and the ttwn flowed a small stream the waters of which were dimpling and sparkling in the moonlight beside its banks arose stately cottonmills and from their many windows hundreds of lights were shining behind them tier above tier were the houses of the town and crowning the hill was the academy with its great dome gleaming on its top like a silver cap upon a mountain of snow the merry sleighbells and the crisp tramp of the horses upon the frozen ground were all calculated to make a striking impression on one beholding such a scene for the first time

clarence followed mr balch into the sleigh delighted and bewildered with the surrounding objects the driver whipped up his horses they clattered over the bridge dashed swiftly through the town and in a very short period arrived at the dwelling of mr eustis

the horses had scarcely stopped when the door flew open and a stream of light from the hall shone down the pathway to the gate mr eustis came out on the step to welcome them after greeting mr balch warmly he took clarence by the hand and led him into the room where his sister was sitting

 here is our little friend said he to her as she arose and approached them  try and get him warm adaâhis hands are like ice

miss ada bell welcomed clarence in the most affectionate manner assisted him to remove his coat unfastened his woollen necktie and smoothed down his glossy black hair then warming a napkin she wrapped it round his benumbed hands and held them in her own until the circulation was restored and they were supple and comfortable again

miss ada bell appeared to be about thirtyfive she had good regular features hazel eyes and long chestnut curls a mouth with the sweetest expression and a voice so winning and affectionate in its tone that it went straight to the hearts of all that listened to its music

 had you a pleasant journey p  she asked

 it was rather cold answered clarence  and i am not accustomed to frosty weather

 and did you leave all your friends well p  she continued as she chafed his hands

 quite well i thank you he replied

 i hear you have a little sister were you not sorry to leave her behind p 

this question called up the tearful face of little em and her last embrace he could not answer he only raised hia mournful dark eyes to the face of miss ada and as he looked at her they grew moist and a tear sparkled on his long lashes

miss ada felt that she had touched a tender chord so she stooped down and kissed his forehead remarking  you have a good face clarence and no doubt an equally good heart j we shall get on charmingly together i know those kind words won the orphans heart and from that day forth clarence loved her tea was soon brought upon the table and they all earnestly engaged in the discussion of the various refreshments that miss adas wellstocked larder afforded everything was so fresh and nicely flavoured that both the travellers ate very heartily  then being much fatigued with their two days journey they seized an early opportunity to retire

here we leave clarence for many years  the boy will have become a man ere we reintroduce him and till then we bid him adieu

charlie had been at home some weeks comparatively idle  at least he so considered himself as the little he did in the way of collecting rents and looking up small accounts for mr walters he regarded as next to nothing it not occupying half his time a part of each day he spent in attendance on his father who seemed better satisfied with his ministrations than with those of his wife and daughters this proved to be very fortunate for all parties as it enabled the girls to concentrate their attention on their sewingâof which they had a vast deal on hand

one day when esther and charlie were walking out together the latter remarked ess i wish i could find some regular and profitable employment or was apprenticed to some good trade that would enable me to assist mother a little  id even go to service if i could do no betterâanything but being idle whilst you are all so hard at work it makes me feel very uncomfortable

 i would be very glad if you could procure some suitable employment i dont wish you to go to service again that is out of the question of whom have you made inquiry respecting a situation

 oh of lots of people they can tell me of any number of families who are in want of a footman but no one appears to know of a person who is willing to receive a black boy as an apprentice to a respectable calling its too provoking i really think ess that the majority of white folks imagine that we are only fit for servants and incapable of being rendered useful in any other capacity if that terrible misfortune had not befallen father i should have learned his trade

 ah   sighed esther  but for that we should all have been happier but charlie she added how do you know that you cannot obtain any other employment than that of a servant p have you ever applied personally to any one p 

no esther i havent but you know as well as i that white masters wont receive coloured apprentices

 i think a great deal of that is taken for granted

rejoined esther  try some one yourself

 i only wish i knew of any one to try responded charlie  id hazard the experiment at any rate

look over the newspaper in the morning advised esther   there are always a great many wants advertisedâ amongst them you may perhaps find something suitable

 well i will essânow then we wont talk about that any moreâpray tell me if im not too inquisitive what do you purpose buying with your moneyâa weddingdress eh p 

he asked with a merry twinkle in his eye

esther blushed and sighed as she answered no charlie that is all over for the present i told him yesterday i could not think of marrying now whilst we are all so unsettled it grieved me to do it charlie but i felt that it was my duty cad and i are going to add our savings to mothers  that combined with what we shall receive for fathers tools goodwill c will be sufficient to furnish another house and as soon as we can succeed in that we will leave mr walters as it is embarrassing to remain under present circumstances

 and what is to become of little emâshe surely wont remain alone with him j mr walters has proposed that when we procure a house she shall come and board with us he wants us to take one of his houses and offers some fabulous sum for the childs board which it would be unreasonable in us to take dear good man he is always complaining that we are too proud and wont let him assist us when he might if we find a suitable house i shall be delighted to have her i love the child for her mothers sake and her own

 i wonder if they will ever send her away as they did clarence p  asked charlie

i do not know she rejoined mr balch told me that he should not insist upon it if the child was unwilling

the next day charlie purchased all the morning papers he could obtain and sat down to look over the list of wants

there were hungry people in want of professed cooks divers demands for chambermaids black or white special inquiries for waiters and footmen in which the same disregard of colour was observable advertisements for partners in all sorts of businesses and for journeymen in every department of mechanical operations then there were milliners wanted sempstresses and even theatrical assistants but nowhere in the long columns could he discover wanted a boy

charlie searched them over and over but the stubborn fact stared him in the faceâthere evidently were no boys wanted and he at length concluded that he either belonged to a very useless class or that there was an unaccountable prejudice existing in the city against the rising generation

charlie folded up the papers with a despairing sigh and walked to the postoffice to mail a letter to mrs bird that he had written the previous evening having noticed a number of young men examining some written notices that were posted up he joined the group and finding it was a list of wants he eagerly read them over

to his great delight he found there was one individual at least who thought boys could be rendered useful to society and who had written as follows   wanted a youth of about thirteen years of age who writes a good hand and is willing to make himself useful in an officeâaddress box no

 postoffice

 im their man   said charlie to himself as he finished perusing itâim just the person ill go home and write to them immediately  and accordingly he hastened back to the house sat down and wrote a reply to the advertisement

he then privately showed it to esther who praised the writing and composition and pronounced the whole very neatly done

charlie then walked down to the postoffice to deposit his precious reply and after dropping it into the brass mouth of the mailbox he gazed in after it and saw it glide slowly down into the abyss below

how many more had stopped that day to add their contributions to the mass which charlies letter now joined p merchants on the brink of ruin had deposited missives whose answer would make or break them others had dropped upon the swelling heap tidings that would make poor men richârich men richer maidens came with delicately written notes perfumed and giltedged eloquent with loveâand cast them amidst invoices and bills of lading letters of condolence and notes of congratulation jostled each other as they slid down the brass throat widowed mothers tender epistles to wandering sons the letters of fond wives to absent husbands  erring daughters last appeals to outraged parents offers of marriage invitations to funerals hope and despair joy and sorrow misfortune and successâhad glided in one almost unbroken stream down that everdistended and insatiable brass throat

charlie gave one more look at the opening then sauntered homeward building by the way houses of fabulous dimensions with the income he anticipated from the situation if he succeeded in procuring it throughout the next day he was in a state of feverish anxiety and expectation and mrs ellis two or three times inquired the meaning of the mysterious whisperings and glances that were exchanged between him aad esther the day wore away and yet no answerâthe next came and passed still no communication and charlie had given up in despair when he was agreeably surprised by the followingâ  messrs twining western and twining will be much obliged to charles ellis if he will call at their office  waterstreet tomorrow morning at eleven oclock as they would like to communicate further with him respecting a situation in their establishment

charlie flew up stairs to esthers room and rushing in precipitately exclaimed  oh essâive got it ive got itââ  see here he shouted waving the note over his head  hurrah  hurrah just read it ess only just read it 

 how can i charlie   said she with a smile  if you hold it in your hand and dance about in that frantic styleâ give it me there nowâkeep quiet a moment and let me read it after perusing it attentively esther added dont be too sanguine charlie you see by the tenor of the note that the situation is not promised you  they only wish to see you respecting it you may not secure it after allâsome obstacle may arise of which we are not at present aware

 go on old ravenâcroak away   said charlie giving her at the same time a facetious poke

 theres many a slip between the cup and the lip she added

 oh ess  he rejoined  dont throw cold water on a fellow in that styleâdont harbour so many doubts do you think they would take the trouble to write if they did not intend to give me the situation p go away old raven

concluded he kissing her  and dont let us have any more croaking

charlie was bounding from the room when he was stopped by his sister who begged him not to say anything to their mother respecting it but wait until they knew the issue of the interview  and if he secured the situation it would be a very agreeable surprise to her

we will now visit in company with the reader the spacious offices of messrs twining western and twining where we shall find mr western about consigning to the wastepaper basket a large pile of letters this gentleman was very fashionably dressed of dark complexion with the languid air and drawling intonation of a southerner

at an adjoining desk sat an elderly sharpfaced gentleman who was looking over his spectacles at the movements of his partner  what a mass of letters you are about to destroy

he remarked

mr western took from his mouth the cigar he was smoking and after puffing from between his lips a thin wreath of smoke replied   some of the most atwocious scwawls that man ever attempted to pewuseâweplies to the advertisement out of the whole lot there wasnt more than a dozen amongst them that were weally pwesentable here is one wemawkably well witten  i have desiwed the witer to call this morning at eleven i hope he will make as favouwable an impwession a his witing has done it is now almost elevenâi pwesume he will be here soon

scarcely had mr western finished speaking ere the door opened and esther entered followed by charlie both the gentlemen rose and mr twining offered her a chair

esther accepted the proffered seat threw up her veil and baid in a slightly embarrassed tone  my brother here took the liberty of replying to an advertisement of yours and you were kind enough to request him to call at eleven today

we sent a note t o your brother  said mr twining in a tone of surprise

yes sir and here it is said she extending it to him

mr twining glanced over it and remarked  this is your writing western then taking charlies letter from the desk of mr western he asked in a doubting tone is this your own writing and composition  

 my own writing and composing answered charlie

 and it is vewy cweditable to you indeed said mr

western

both the gentlemen looked at the note again then at charlie then at esther and lastly at each other but neither seemed able to say anything and evident embarrassment existed on both sides

 and so you thought you would twy for the situation at last remarked mr western to charlie

yes sir he answered  i was and am very anxious to obtain some employment

 have you a father p  asked mr twining

 yes sir but he was badly injured by the mob last summer and will never be able to work again

  thats a pity said western sympathisingly and what have you been doing p 

 nothing very recently i broke my arm last spring and was obliged to go into the country for my health i have not long returned

 do your pawents keep house p 

 not at present we are staying with a friend our house was burned down by the rioters

this conversation recalled so vividly their past trials that esthers eyes grew watery and she dropped her veil to conceal a tear that was trembling on the lid

 how vewy unfortunate  said mr western sympathisingly  vewy twying indeed   then burying his chin in his hand he sat silently regarding them fora moment or two

have you come to any decision about taking him

esther at last ventured to ask of mr twining

 taking him âoh dear me i bad almost forgot charles let me see you write somethingâhere take this seat

charlie sat down as directed and dashed off a few lines which he banded to mr twining who looked at it over and over  then rising he beckoned to his partner to follow him into an adjoining room

 well what do you say p  asked western after they had closed the door behind them dont you think we had better engage him

 engage him  exclaimed twiningâ why you surprise me westernâthe things absurd  engage a coloured boy as under clerk  i never heard of such a thing

 i have often drawled western there are the gweatest number of them in new orleans

ah but new orleans is a different place such a thing never occurred in philadelphia

 well let us cweate a pwecedent then the boy wites wemarkably well and will no doubt suit us exactly it will be a chawity to take him we need not care what others say âeverybody knows who we are and what we are 

 no western  i know the north better than you do  it wouldnt answer at all here we cannot take the boyâit is impossible it would create a rumpus amongst the clerks who would all feel dreadfully insulted by our placing a nigger child on an equality with them i assure you the thing is out of the question

 well i must say you northern people are perfectly incompwehensible you pay taxes to have niggers educated and made fit for such placesâand then wont let them fill them when they are pwepared to do so i shall leave you then to tell them we cant take him im doosed sowwy for itâi like his looks

whilst mr western and his partner were discussing in one room charlie and esther were awaiting with some anxiety their decision in the other

 i think they are going to take me said charlie  you saw how struck they appeared to be with the writing

 they admired it i know my dear but dont be too sanguine

 i feel sure they are going to take me repeated he with a hopeful countenance

esther made no reply and they remained in silence until mr twining returned to the room

after two or three preparatory ahems he said to esther   i should like to take your brother very much but you see in consequence of there being so much excitement just now relative to abolitionism and kindred subjects that my partner and myselfâthat is i and mr westernâthinkâor rather feelâthat just now it would be rather awkward for us to receive him we should like to take him but his colour missâhis complexion is afatal objection it grieves me to be obliged to tell you this  but i think under the circumstances it would be most prudent for us to decline to receive him we are very sorryâbut our clerks are all young men and have a great deal of prejudice and i am sure he would be neither comfortable nor happy with them if i can serve you in any other wayâ

 there is nothing that you can do that i am aware of

said esther rising  i thank you and am sorry that we have occupied so much of your time

 oh dont mention it said mr twining evidently happy to get rid of them and opening the door he bowed them out of the office

the two departed sadly and they walked on for some distance in silence at last esther pressed his hand and in a choking voice exclaimed  charlie my dear boy id give my life if it would change your complexionâif it would make you white  poor fellow  your battle of life will be a hard one to fight 

i know it ess but i shouldnt care to be white if i knew i would not have a dear old ess like you for a sister

he answered pressing her hand affectionately  i dont intend to be conquered he continued   ill fight it out to the lastâthis wont discourage me ill keep on trying

said he determinedlyâ if one wont perhaps another will

for two or three days charlie could hear of nothing that would be at all suitable for him at last one morning he saw an advertisement for a youth to learn the engravers business â one who had some knowledge of drawing preferred  to apply at thomas blatchfords banknote engraver

thomas blatchfordrepeated mr walters as charlie read it overâ why that is the mr blatchford the abolitionist

i think you have some chance there most decidedlyâi would advise you to take those sketches of yours and apply at once

charlie ran upstairs and selecting the bestexecuted of his drawings put them in a neat portfolio and without saying anything to esther or his mother hastened away to mr blatchfords he was shown into a room where a gentleman was sitting at a table examining some engraved plates

 is this mr blatehfords   asked charlie

 that is my name my little manâdo you want to see me

he kindly inquired

 yes sir you advertised for a boy to learn the engraving business i believe

 well and what then  

 i have come to apply for the situation

 youâyou apply   said he in a tone of surprise

 yes sir faltered charlie  mr walters recommended me to do so

 ah you know mr walters then he rejoined

yes sir he is a great friend of my fathersâwe are living with him at present

 what have you in your portfolio there p enquired mr

blatchford charlie spread before him the sketches he had made during the summer and also some ornamental designs suitable for the titlepages of books  why these are excellently well done exclaimed he after examining them attentively  who taught you  

charlie hereupon briefly related his acquaintance with the artist and his efforts to obtain employment and their results besides many other circumstances connected with himself and family mr blatchford became deeply interested and at the end of a long conversation delighted charlie by informing him that if he and his mother could agree as to terms he should be glad to receive him as an apprentice

charlie could scarcely believe the evidence of his own ears and leaving his portfolio on the table was hastening away

 stop stop   cried mr blatchford with a smile  you have not heard all i wish to say i would be much obliged to your mother if she would call at my house this evening and then we can bettle the matter definitely

charlie seemed to tread on air as he walked home flying up to estherâhis usual confidantâbe related to her the whole affair and gave at great length his conversation with mr blatchford

that looks something like said she lam delighted âwith the prospect that is opening to you let us go and tell motherâand accordingly off they both started to carry the agreeable intelligence to mrs ellis

that evening charlie his mother and mr walters went to the house of mr blatchford they were most kindly received and all the arrangements made for charlies apprenticeship he was to remain one month on trial and if at the end of that period all parties were satisfied he was to be formally indentured

charlie looked forward impatiently to the following monday on which day he was to commence his apprenticeship in the intervening time he held daily conferences with kinch as he felt their intimacy would receive a slight check after he entered upon his new pursuit

look here old fellow said charlie it wont do for you to be lounging on the doorsteps of the office nor be whistling for me under the windows mr blatchford bpoke particularly against my having playmates around in work hours evenings i shall always be at home and then you can come and see me as often as you like

since his visit to warmouth charlie had been much more particular respecting his personal appearance dressed neater and was much more careful of his clothes he had also given up marbles and tried to persuade kinch to do the same

 id cut marbles kinch said he to him one evening when they were walking together if i were you it makes one such a frightâcovers one with chalkmarks and dirt from head to foot and another thing kinch you have an abundance of good clothesâdo wear them and try and look more like a gentleman

 dear me  said kinch rolling up the white of his eyesâ just listen how we are going on  hadnt i better get an eyeglass and pair of light kid gloves p 

 oh kinch  said charlie gravely  im not jokingâi mean what i say you dont know how far rough looks and an untidy person go against one i do wish you would try and keep yourself decent

 well there thenâi will  answered kinch  but charlie im afraid with your travelling and one thing or other you will forget your old playmate byandby and get above him

charlies eyes moistened and with a boys impulsiveness he threw his arm over kinchs shoulder and exclaimed with emphasis  never old fellow neverânot as long as my name is charlie ellis  you mustnt be hurt at what i said kinch âi think more of these things than i used toâi see the importance of them i find that any one who wants to get on must be particular in little things as well great and i must try and be a man nowâfor you know things dont glide on as smoothly with us as they used i often think of our fun in the old houseâah perhaps well have good times in another of our own yet âand with this charlie and his friend separated for the night

the important monday at length arrived and charlie hastened to the office of mr blatchford which he reached before the hour for commencing labour he found some dozen or more journeymen assembled in the workroom and noticed that upon his entrance there was an interchange of significant glances and once or twice he overheard the whisper of  nigger

mr blatchford was engaged in discussing some business matter with a gentleman and did not observe the agitation that charlies entrance had occasioned the conversation having terminated the gentleman took up the morning paper and mr blatchford noticing charlie said ah  you have come and in good time too wheeler he continued turning to one of the workmen  i want you to take this boy under your especial charge  give him a seat at your window and overlook his work

at this there was a general uprising of the workmen who commenced throwing off their caps and aprons  what is all this forp  asked mr blatchford in astonishmentâwhy this commotion p 

we wont work with niggers   cried one  ho nigger apprentices  cried another and  no niggersâno niggers 

was echoed from all parts of the room

 silence   cried mr blatchford stamping violentlyâ  silence every one of you  as soon as partial order was restored he turned to wheeler and demanded  what is the occasion of all this tumultâwhat does it mean  

 why sir it means just this the men and boys diacovered that you intended to take a nigger apprentice and have made up their minds if you do they will quit in a body

 it cannot be possible exclaimed the employer  that any man or boy in my establishment has room in his heart for buch narrow contemptible prejudices can it be that you have entered into a conspiracy to deprive an inoffensive child of an opportunity of earning his bread in a respectable manner  come let me persuade youâthe boy is wellbehaved and educated 

 damn hi behaviour and education  responded a burly fellow  let him be a barber or shoeblackâthat is all niggers are good for if he comes we goâthats so aint it boys p 

there was a general response of approval to this appeal and mr blatchford seeing the utter uselessness of further parleying left the room followed by charlie and the gentleman with whom he had been conversing

mr blatchford was placed in a most disagreeable position by this revolt on the part of his workmen he had just received large orders from some new banks which were commencing operations and a general disruption of his establishment at that moment would have ruined him to accede to his workmens demands he must do violence to his own conscience  but he dared not sacrifice his business and bring ruin on himself and family even though he was right

 what would you do burrell   he asked of the gentleman who had followed them out

there is no question as to what you must do you mustnt ruin yourself for the sake of your principles you will have to abandon the lad  the other alternative is not to be thought of for a moment

well charles you see how it is said mr blatchford reluctantly charlie had been standing intently regarding the conversation that concerned him so deeply his face was pale and his lips quivering with agitation

id like to keep you my boy but you see how im situated i must either give up you or my business the latter x cannot afford to do with a great effort charlie repressed his tears and bidding them good morning in a choking voice hastened from the room

 its an infernal shame  said mr blatchford indignantly  and i shall think meanly of myself for ever for submitting to it but i cant help myself and must make the best of it

charlie walked downstairs with lingering steps and took the direction of home  all because im coloured said he bitterly to himselfâ all because im coloured  what will mother and esther say  how it will distress themâtheyve so built upon it i wish said he sadly  that i was dead  

ho longer able to repress the tears that were welling up he walked towards the window of a printstore where he pretended to be deeply interested in some pictures whilst he stealthily wiped his eyes every time he turned to leave the window there came a fresh flood of tears  and at last he was obliged to give way entirely and sobbed as if his heart would break

he was thus standing when he felt a hand laid familiarly on his shoulder and on turning round he beheld the gentleman he had left in mr blatchfords office  come my little man said he  dont take it so much to heart cheer upâ you may find some other person willing to employ you come walk on with meâwhere do you live   charlie dried his eyes and gave him his address as they walked on up the street together

mr burrell talked encouragingly and quite succeeded in soothing him ere they separated  i shall keep a look out for you said he kindly  and if i hear of anything likely to suit you i shall let you know

charlie thanked him and sauntered slowly home when he arrived and they saw his agitated looks and his eyes swollen from the effect of recent tears there was a general inquiry of what has happened why are you home so early  are you sick p 

charlie hereupon related all that had transpired at the officeâhis great disappointment and the occasion of itâto the intense indignation and grief of his mother and sisters

 i wish there were no white folks said caddy wrathfully   they are all i believe a complete set of villains and everything else that is bad

dont he so sweeping in your remarks pray dont caddy interposed esther you have just heard what charlie said of mr blatchfordâhis heart is kindly disposed at any rate  you see he is trammelled by others

 oh  well i dont like any of themâi hate them all 

bhe continued bitterly driving her needle at the same time into the cloth she was sewing as if it was a white person she had in her lap and she was sticking pins in him dont cry charlie she added  the old white wretches they shouldnt get a tear out of me for fifty trades   but charlie could not be comforted  he buried his head in his mothers lap and wept over his disappointment until he made himself sick

that day after mr burrell had finished his dinner he remarked to his wife  i saw something this morning my dear that made a deep impression on me i havent been able to get it out of my head for any length of time since  it touched me deeply i assure you

 why what could it have been  pray tell me what it was

thereupon he gave his wife a graphic account of the events that had transpired at blatchfords in the morning and in conclusion said now you know my dear that no one would call me an abolitionist and i suppose i have some little prejudice as well as others against coloured people  but i had no idea that sensible men would have carried it to that extent to set themselves up as they did in opposition to a little boy anxious to earn his bread by learning a useful trade

mrs burrell was a young woman of about twentytwo with a round goodnatured face and plump comfortablelooking figure she had a heart overflowing with kindness and was naturally much affected by what he related  i declare its perfectly outrageous exclaimed she indignantly   and i wonder at blatchford for submitting to it i wouldnt allow myself to be dictated to in that mannerâand he such an abolitionist too had i been him i should have stuck to my principles at any risk poor little fellow  i so wonder at blatchford i really dont think he has acted manly

not so fast my little woman if you pleaseâthat is the way with almost all of you you let your hearts run away with your heads you are unjust to blatchford  he could not help himself he was completely in their power it is almost impossible at present to procure workmen in our business and he is under contract to finish a large amount of work within a specified time  and if he should fail to fulfil his agreement it would subject him to immense lossâin fact it would entirely ruin him you are aware my dear that i am thoroughly acquainted with the state of his affairs he is greatly in debt from unfortunate speculations and a false step just now would overset him completely  he could not have done otherwise than he has and do justice to himself and his family i felt that he could not and in fact advised him to act as he did

now george burrell you didnt said she reproachfully

 yes i did my dear because i thought of his family i really believe though had i encouraged him he would have made the sacrifice

 and what became of the boy  

 oh poor lad he seemed very much cut down by itâi was quite touched by his grief when i came out i found him standing by a shop window crying bitterly i tried to pacify him and told him i would endeavour to obtain a situation for him somewhereâand i shall

 has he parents p  asked mrs burrell

 yes and by the way dont you remember whilst the mob was raging last summer we read an account of a man running to the roof of a house to escape from the rioters p you remember they chopped his hands off and threw him over  

 oh yes dear i recollect dontâdont mention it said bhe with a shudder of horror  i remember it perfectly

well this little fellow is his son continued mr burrell

 indeed  and what has become of his fatherâdid he diep 

 no he partially recovered but is helpless and almost an idiot i never saw a child apparently so anxious to get â work he talked more like a man with a family dependent upon him for support than a youth i tell you what i became quite interested in him he was very communicative and told me all their circumstances their house was destroyed by the mob and they are at present residing with a friend

just then the cry of a child was heard in the adjoining room and mrs burrell rushed precipitately away and soon returned with a fat healthylooking boy in her arms which after kissing she placed in her husbands lap he was their firstborn and only child and as a matter of course a great pet and regarded by them as a most wonderful boy in consequence papa sat quite still and permitted him to pull the studs out of his shirt untie his cravat rumple his hair and take all those little liberties to which babies are notoriously addicted

mrs burrell sat down on a stool at her husbands feet and gazed at him and the child in silence for some time

 whats the matter jane what has made you so grave p 

 i was trying to imagine burrell how i should feel if you i and baby were coloured i was trying to place myself in such a situation now we know that our boy if he is honest and uprightâis blest with great talent or geniusâmay aspire to any station in society that he wishes to obtain how different itwould be if he were colouredâthere would be nothing bright in the prospective for him we could hardly promise him a living at any respectable calling i think george we treat coloured people with great injustice dont you p 

mr burrell hemmed and had at this direct query and answered well we dont act exactly right toward them i must confess

mrs burrell rose and took the vacant knee of her husband and toying with the baby said  now george burrell i want to ask a favour of you why cant you take this boy p 

 i take him âwhy my dear i dont want an apprentice

 yes but you must make a want you said he was a bright boy and sketched well why i should think that hes just what you ought to have there is no one at your office that would oppose it cummings and dalton were with your father before you they would never object to anything reasonable that you proposed come dear do now make the trialâwont you p 

mr burrell was a tenderhearted yielding sort of an individual  and what was more his wife was fully aware of it and like a young witch as she was she put on her sweetest looks and begged so imploringly that he was almost conquered but when she took up the baby and made him put his chubby arms round his fathers neck and say pese poppop he was completely vanquished and surrendered at discretion

 ill see what can be done said he at last

and will you do it afterwards   she asked archly

 yes i will dear i assure you he rejoined

 then i know it will be done said she confidently  and none of us will be the worse off for it i am sure

after leaving home mr burrell went immediately to the office of mr blatchford  and after having procured charlies portfolio he started in the direction of his own establishment he did not by any means carry on so extensive a business as mr blatchford and employed only two elderly men as journeymen after he had sat down to work one of them remarked  tucker has been here and wants some rough cuts executed for a new book  told him i did not think you would engage to do them that you had given up that description of work

i think we lose a great deal cummings by being obliged to give up those jobs rejoined mr burrell

 why dont you take an apprentice then he suggested  its just the kind of work for them to learn upon

well ive been thinking of that replied he rising and producing the drawings from charlies portfolio  look here said he  what do you think of these as the work of a lad of twelve or fourteen who has never had more than half a dozen lessons 

 i should say they were remarkably well done responded cummings  shouldnt you say so dalton the party addressed took the sketches and examined them thoroughly and gave an approving opinion of their merits

well said mr burrell the boy that executed those is in want of a situation and i should like to take him but i thought i would consult you both about it first i met with him under very singular circumstances and ill tell you all about it and forthwith he repeated to them the occurrences of the morning dwelling upon the most affecting parts and concluding by putting the question to them direct as to whether they had any objections to his taking him

why no none in the world readily answered cummings  laws me colour is nothing after all and black fingers can handle a graver as well as white ones i expect

 i thought it best to ask you to avoid any after difficulty

you have both been in the establishment so long that i felt that you ought to be consulted

you neednt have taken that trouble said dalton

 you might have known that anything done by your fathers son would be satisfactory to us i never had anything to do with coloured people and havent anything against them  and as long as you are contented i am

 well we all have our little prejudices against various things and as i did not know how you both would feel i thought i wouldnt take any decided steps without consulting you  but now i shall consider it settled and will let the lad know that i will take him

in the evening he hastened home at an earlier hour than usual and delighted his wife by sayingâi have succeeded to a charm my dearâthere wasnt the very slightest objection im going to take the boy if he wishes to come

 ob im delighted cried she clapping her hands  cry hurrah for papa  said she to the baby  cry hurrah for papa 

the scion of the house of burrell gave vent to some scarcely intelligible sounds that resembled  boorogler poppop   which his mother averred was astonishingly plain and deserving of a kiss and snatching him up she gave him two or three hearty ones and then planted him in his fathers lap again

 my dear said her husband  i thought as you proposed my taking this youth you might like to have the pleasure of acquainting him with his good fortune after tea if you are disposed we will go down there  the walk will do you good

oh george burrell said she her face radiant with pleasure you are certainly trying to outdo yourself i have been languishing all day for a walk  what a charming husband you are  i really ought to do something for you ah i know whatâill indulge you j you may smoke all the way there and back ill even go so far as to light the cigars for you myself

 that is a boon rejoined her husband with a smile  really  virtue rewarded i declare

tea over the baby kissed and put to bed mrs burrell tied on the most bewitching of bonnets and donning her new furtrimmed cloak declared herself ready for the walk and off they started mr burrell puffed away luxuriously as they walked along stopping now and then at her command to look into such shopwindows as contained articles adapted to the use of infants from indiarubber rings and ivory rattles to baby coats and shoes

at length they arrived at the door of mr walters and on looking up at the house he exclaimed  this is  but it cant be the place surely coloured people dont live in as fine an establishment as this then running up the steps he examined the plate upon the door  the name corresponds with the address given me said he j  ill ring is there a lad living here by the name of charles ellis   he asked of the servant who opened the door

 yes sir was the reply  will you walk in p 

when they were ushered into the drawingroom mr

burrell saidâ be kind enough to say that a gentleman wishes to see him

the girl departed closing the door behind her leaving them staring about the room  how elegantly it is furnished   said she  i hadnt an idea that there were any coloured people living in such style

 some of them are very rich remarked her husband

but you said this boy was poor

r  so he is i understand they are staying with the owner of this house

whilst they were thus conversing the door opened and esther entered i am sorry said she that my brother has retired he has a very severe headache and was unable to remain up longer his mother is out i am his sister and shall be most happy to receive any communication for him

 i regret to hear of his indisposition replied mr burrell  i hope it is not consequent upon his disappointment this morning p 

 i fear it is poor fellow  he took it very much to heart

it was a disappointment to us all we were congratulating ourselves on having secured him an eligible situation

 i assure you the disappointment is not all on one side he is a very promising boy and the loss of his prospective services annoying nothing but stern necessity caused the result

 oh we entirely acquit you mr blatchford of all blame in the matter we are confident that what happened was not occasioned by any indisposition on your part to fulfil your agreement

 my dear interrupted mrs burrell  she thinks you are mr blatchford

and are you not p  asked esther with some surprise

 oh no im an intimate friend of his and was present this morning when the affair happened

 oh indeed responded esther

yes and he came home and related it all to meâthe whole affair interrupted mrs burrell i was dreadfully provoked i assure you i sympathized with him very much i became deeply interested in the whole affair i was looking at my little boyâfor i have a little boy

said she with matronly dignityâ and i thought suppose it was my little boy being treated so how should i like it  so bringing the matter home to myself in that way made me feel all the more strongly about it and i just told george burrell he must take him as he is an engraver and i and the baby gave him no rest until he consented to do so

he will take himon the same terms offered by mr blatehford and then we came down to tell you andâand said she quite out of breath that is all about it

esther took the little womans plump hand in both her own and for a moment seemed incapable of even thanking her at last she said in a husky voice  you cant think what a relief this is to us my brother has taken his disappointment so much to heartâi cant tell you how much i thank you god will reward you for your sympathy and kindness you must excuse me she continued as her voice faltered we have latterly been so unaccustomed to receive such sympathy and kindness from persons of your complexion that this has quite overcome me

 oh now dont im sure its no more than our duty and im as much pleased as you can possibly beâit has given me heartfelt gratification i assure you

esther repeated her thanks and followed them to the door where she shook hands with mrs burrell who gave her a pressing invitation to come and see her baby

 how easy it is george burrell said the happy little woman  to make the hearts of others as light as our ownmine feels like a feather she added as she skipped along clinging to his arm  what a nice ladylike girl his sister is âis her brother as handsome as she p 

hot quite he answered   still he is very goodldoking

ill bring him home with me tomorrow at dinner and then you can see him

chatting merrily they soon arrived at home mrs

burrell ran straightway upstairs to look at that blessed baby she found him sleeping soundly and looking as comfortable and happy as it is possible for a sleeping baby to lookâso she bestowed upon him a perfect avalanche of kisses and retired to her own peaceful pillow

and now having thus satisfactorily arranged for our young friend charlie we will leave him for a few years engaged in his new pursuits

old father time is a stealthy worker in youth we are scarcely able to appreciate his efforts and oftentimes think him an exceedingly slow and limping old fellow when we ripen into maturity and are fighting our own way through the battle of life we deem him swift enough of foot and sometimes rather hurried but when old age comes on and death and the grave are foretold by trembling limbs and snowy locks we wonder that our course has been so swiftly run and chide old time for a somewhat hasty and precipitate individual

the reader must imagine that many years have passed away since the events narrated in the preceding chapters transpired and permit us to reintroduce the characters formerly presented without any attempt to describe how that long period has been occupied

first of all let us resume our acquaintance with mr

stevens to effect this we must pay that gentleman a visit at his luxurious mansion in fifth avenue the most fashionable street of new yorkâthe place where the upper ten thousand of that vast bustling city most do congregate

as he is an old acquaintance we wont say friend we will disregard ceremony and walk boldly into the library where that gentleman is sitting

he is changedâyes sadly changed time has been hard at work with him and dissatisfied with what his unaided agency could produce has called in conscience to his aid and their united efforts have left their marks upon him he looks oldâaye very old the bald spot on his head has extended its limits until there is only a fringe of thin white hair above the ears there are deep wrinkles upon his forehead and the eyes half obscured by the bushy grey eyebrows are bloodshot and sunken  the jaws hollow and spectral and his lower lip drooping and flaccid he lifts his hand to pour out another glass of liquor from the decanter at his side when his daughter lays her hand upon it and looks appealingly in his face

she has grown to be a tall elegant woman slightly thin and with a careworn and fatigued expression of countenance

there is however the same sweetness in her clear blue eyes and as she moves her head her fair flaxen curls float about her face as dreamily and deliciously as ever they did of yore

she is still in black wearing mourning for her mother who not many months before had been laid in a quiet nook on the estate at savanah

 pray papa dont drink any more said she persuasively âit makes you nervous and will bring on one of those frightful attacks again

 let me alone he remonstrated harshlyâlet me alone and take your hand off the glass the doctor has forbidden laudanum so i will have brandy insteadâtake off your hand and let me drink i say

lizzie still kept her hand upon the decanter and continued gently no no dear paâyou promised me you would only drink two glasses and you have already taken threeâit is exceedingly injurious the doctor insisted upon it that you should decrease the quantityâand you are adding to it instead

 devil take the doctor  exclaimed he roughly endeavouring to disengage her holdâ give me the liquor i say

his daughter did not appear the least alarmed at this violence of manner nor suffer her grasp upon the neck of the decanter to be relaxed  but all the while spoke soothing words to the angry old man and endeavoured to persuade him to relinquish his intention of drinking any more

 you dont respect your old father he cried in a whining toneâ you take advantage of my helplessness all of youâ you illtreat me and deny me the very comforts of life  ill tellâill tell the doctor he continued as his voice subsided into an almost inaudible tone and he sank back into the chair in a state of semistupor

removing the liquor from his reach his daughter rang the bell and then walked towards the door of the room

 who procured that liquor for my father  she asked of the servant who entered

 i did miss answered the man hesitatingly

 let this be the last time you do such a thing she rejoined eyeing him sternly unless you wish to be discharged

i thought you all fully understood that on no consideration was my father to have liquor unless by the physicians or my orderâit aggravates his disease and neutralizes all the doctors effortsâand unless you wish to be immediately discharged never repeat the same offence now procure some assistanceâit is time my father was prepared for bed

the man bowed and left the apartment but soon returned saying there was a person in the hall who had forced his way into the house and who positively refused to stir until he saw mr stevens

 he has been here two or three times added the man and he is very rough and impudent

 this is most singular conduct exclaimed miss stevens

 did he give his name  

 yes miss he calls himself mc closkey

at the utterance of this wellknown name mr stevens raised his head and stared at the speaker with a look of stupid fright and inquired  who hereâwhat name is that

âspeak louderâwhat name 

 mc closkey answered the man in a louder tone

 what heâh  cried mr stevens with a terrified look  whereâwhere is he   he continued endeavouring to riseâ where is he  

 stop pa interposed his daughter alarmed at his appearance and manner  do stopâlet me go

noâno said the old man wildly seizing her by the dress to detain herâyou must not goâthat would never do 

he might tell her he muttered to himselfâ no noâill go   â and thus speaking he made another ineffectual attempt to reach the door

 dear father do let me go  she repeated imploringly

 you are incapable of seeing any oneâlet me inquire what he wants  she added endeavouring to loose his hold upon her dress

noâyou shall not  he replied clutching her dress still tighter and endeavouring to draw her towards him

 oh father   she asked distractedly  what can this mean  here said she addressing the servant who stood gazing in silent wonder on this singular scene  help my father into his chair again and then tell this strange man to wait awhile

the exhausted man having been placed in his chair motioned to his daughter to close the door behind the servant who had just retired

 he wants money said he in a whisperâ he wants money  hell make beggars of us allâand yet ill have to give him some quick give me my chequebookâlet me give him something before he has a chance to talk to any one âquick quick  

the distracted girl wrung her hands with grief at what she imagined was a return of her fathers malady and exclaimed  oh if george only would remain at homeâit is too much for me to have the care of father whilst he is in such a state

then pretending to be in search of the chequebook she turned over the pamphlets and papers upon his desk that she might gain time and think how it was best to proceed

whilst she was thus hesitating the door of the room was suddenly opened and a shabbily dressed man bearing a strong odour of rum about him forced his way into the apartment saying  i will see him dn it i dont care haporth how sick he isâlet me go or by the powers ill murther some of yes

the old mans face was almost blanched with terror when he heard the voice and saw the abrupt entry of the intruder

he sprang from the chair with a great effort and then unable to sustain himself sunk fainting on the floor

 oh you have killed my fatherâyou have killed my father who are you and what do you want that you dare thrust yourself upon him in this manner  said she stooping to assist in raising him  cannot you see he is entirely unfit for any business  

mr stevens was replaced in his chair and water thrown in his face to facilitate his recovery

meanwhile mc closkey had poured himself out a glass of brandy and water which he stood sipping as coolly as if everything in the apartment was in a state of the most perfect composure the singular terror of her father and the boldness and assurance of the intruder were to miss stevens something inexplicableâshe stood looking from one to the other as though seeking an explanation and on observing symptoms of a return to consciousness on the part of her parent she turned to mc closkey and said appealingly  you see how your presence has agitated my father pray let me conjure youâgo be your errand what it may i promise you it shall have the earliest attention or said she  tell me what it is  perhaps i can see to itâi attend a great deal to fathers business pray tell me  

no no exclaimed the old man who had caught the last few words of his daughter no noânot a syllable

here im wellâim well enough ill attend to you

there thereâthat will do he continued addressing the servant leave the room and you he added turning to his daughter do you go too i am much beter now and can talk to him go go   he cried impatiently as he saw evidences of a disposition to linger on her part if i want you ill ring go âthis person wont stay long

not if i get what i came for miss said mc closkey insolently  otherwise there is no knowing how long i may stay with a look of apprehension lizzie quitted the room and the murderer and his accomplice were alone together

mr stevens reached across the table drew the liquor towards him and recklessly pouring out a large quantity drained the glass to the bottomâthis seemed to nerve him up and give him courage for he turned to mc closkey and said with a much bolder air than he had yet shown in addressing him  so youre back again villain are you p i thought and hoped you were dead  and he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes as if to shut out some horrid spectre

 ive been divilish near it squire but providence has preserved me ye seeâjist to be a comfort to ye in yer old age

ive been shipwrecked blown up in steamboats and ive had favers and choleray and the divil alone knows whatâbut ive been marcifully presarved to ye and hope yell see a good dale of me this many years to come

mr stevens glared at him fiercely for a few seconds and then rejoined  you promised me solemnly five years ago that you would never trouble me again and i gave you money enough to have kept you in comfortâay luxuryâ for the remainder of your life where is it all now  

 thats more than i can tell you squire i only know how it comes i dont trouble myself how it goesâthats your look out if ye are anxious on that score youd better hire a bookkeeper for meâhe shall send yer honour a quarterly account and then it wont come on ye so sudden when its all out another time

 insolent  muttered mr stevens

mc closkey gave mr stevens an impudent look but beyond that took no farther notice of his remark but proceeded with the utmost coolness to pour out another glass of brandy âafter which he drew his chair closer to the grate and placed his dirty feet upon the mantelpiece in close proximity to an alabaster clock

you make yourself very much at home said stevens indignantly

 why shouldnt i  answered his tormentor in a tone of the most perfect good humour  why shouldnt iâin the house of an ould acquaintance and particular friendâjust the place to feel at home eh stevens   then folding his arm and tilting back his chair he asked coolly  you havent a cigar have ye  

no replied stevens surlily and if i had you should not have it your insolence is unbearable you appear continued he with some show of dignity to have forgotten who i am and who you are

 yere mistaken there squire divil a bit have i im mc closkey and you are slippery georgeâan animal thats known over the varsal world as a philadelphia lawyerâa man thaifs chated his hundreds and if he lives long enough hell chate as many more savin his friend mr mc closkey and him hell not be afther chating because he wont be able to get a chance although hed like to if he couldâdivil a doubt of that

its falseâi never tried to cheat you rejoined stevens courageously for the liquor was beginning to have a very inspiriting effect  its a lieâi paid you all i agreed upon and more besides  but you are like a leechânever satisfied

you have had from me altogether nearly twenty thousand dollars and youll not get much moreânow mind i tell you

the divil i wont rejoined he angrily  that is yet to be seen how would you like to make yer appearance at court some fine morning on the charge of murther eh

mr stevens gave a perceptible shudder and looked round whereupon mc closkey said with a malevolent grin ye see i dont stick at words squire i call things by their names

so i perceive answered stevens you were not so bold once

ha ha laughed mc closkey i know that as well as youâthen i was under the thumbâthat was before we were sailing in the one boat now ye see squire the boot ia on the other leg

mr stevens remained quiet for a few moments whilst his ragged visitor continued to leisurely sip his brandy and contemplate the soles of his boots as they were reflected in the mirror aboveâthey were a sorry pair of boots and looked as if there would soon be a general outbreak of his toesâso thin and dilapidated did the soles appear

look at thim boots and me suit ginerally and see if your conscience wont accuse ye of ingratitude to the man who made yer fortuneâor rather lets ye keep it now ye have it

isnt it a shame now for me the best friend youve got in the world to be tramping the streets widdout a penny in his pocket and ye livin in clover with gold pieces as plenty as blackberries it dont look right squire and mustnt go on any longer

 what do you wantâwhatever will satisfy you   asked stevens  if i give you ever so much now what guarantee have i that youll not return in a month or so and want as much more 

 ill pledge ye me honour said mc closkey grandly

 your honour  rejoined stevens that is no security

security or no security said mc closkey impatiently   youll have to give me the moneyâits not a bit of use now this disputin bekase ye see im bound to have it and ye are wise enough to know yed better give it to me what if ye have give me thousands upon thousands continued he his former goodhumoured expression entirely vanishing its nothing more than you ought to do for keeping yer secrets for yeâand as long as ye have money ye may expect to share it with me  so make me out a good heavy cheque and say no more about it

 what do you call a heavy cheque   asked stevens in despairing tone

 five or six thousand coolly answered his visitor

 five or six thousand i  echoed mr stevens  it is impossible

 it had better not be said mc closkey looking angry  it bad better not beâim determined not to be leading a beggars life and you to be a rolling in wealth

 i cant give it and wont give itâif it must come to that answered stevens desperately  it is you that have the fortuneâi am only your banker at this rate i cant give it to youâi havent got that much money

 you must find it then and pretty quick at that said mc closkey  im not to be fooled withâi came here for money and i must and will have it

 i am willing to do what is reasonable rejoined mr

stevens in a more subdued tone  you talk of thousands as most men do of hundreds i really havent got it

 oh bother such stuff as that interrupted mc closkey incredulously  i dont believe a word of itâive asked them that know and every one says youve made a mint of money by speculationâthat since ye sold out in the south and came here to live theres no end to the money yeve made so you see it dont do to be making a poor mouth to me ive come here for a check for five thousand dollars and shant go away without it concluded he in a loud and threatening tone

during this conversation lizzie stevens had been standing at the door momentarily expecting a recall to the apartment she heard the low rumble of their voices but could not distinguish words at length hearing mc closkeys raised to a higher key she could no longer restrain her impatience and gently opening the door looked into the room

both their faces were turned in the opposite direction so that neither noticed the gentle intrusion of lizzie who fearing to leave her father longer alone ventured into the apartment

 you need not stand looking at me in that threatening manner you may do as you pleaseâgo tell what you like but remember when i fall so do you  i have not forgotten that affair in philadelphia from which i saved youâdont place me in a situation that will compel me to recur to it to your disadvantage

 all dont trouble yerself about that squire  i dontâthat is entirely off my mind j for now whitticar is dead where is yer witnesses

whitticar dead repeated stevens

 yes  and whats more hes buriedâso hes bafe enough squire and i shouldnt be at all surprised if youd be glad to have me gone too

 i would to god you had been before i put myself in your power

 twas your own hastiness when it came to the pinch i wasnt equal to the job so ye couldnt wait for another time but out with yer pistol and does it yerself the wretched man shuddered and covered his face as mc closkey coolly recounted his murder of mr garie every word of which was too true to be denied

and havent i suffered said he shaking his bald head mournfully   havent i sufferedâlook at my grey hairs and halfpalsied frame decrepit before im oldâsinking into the tomb with a weight of guilt and sin upon me that will crush me down to the lowest depth of hell think you he continued that because i am surrounded with all that money can buy that i am happy or ever shall be with this secret gnawing at my heart every piece of gold i count out i see his hands outstretched over it and hear him whisper  mine   he gives me no peace night or day he is always by me  i have no rest and you must come adding to my torture and striving to tear from me that for which i bartered conscience peace soul everything that would make life desirable if there is mercy in yon leave me with what i give you and come back no more life has so little to offer that rather than bear this continued torment and apprehension i daily suffer i will cut my throat and then your game is over

lizzie stevens stood rooted to the spot whilst her father made the confession that was wrung from him by the agony of the moment

well well said mc closkey somewhat startled and alarmed at stevenss threat of selfdestructionâwell ill come down a thousandâmake it four

 that ill do answered the old man tremblingly   and reaching over he drew towards him the chequebook after writing the order for the sum he was placing it in the hand of mc closkey when hearing a faint moan he looked towards the door and saw his daughter fall fainting to the ground

we left the quiet town of sudbury snowclad and sparkling in all the glory of a frosty moonlight night we now return to it and discover it decked out in its bravest summer garniture a short distance above the hill upon which it is built the water of the river that glides along its base may be seen springing over the low dam that obstructs its passage sparkling glistening dancing in the sunlight as it falls splashing on the stones below and then as though subdued by the fall and crash it comes murmuring on stopping now and then to whirl and eddy round some rock or protruding stump and at last glides gently under the arch of the bridge seemingly to pause beneath its shadow and ponder upon its recent tumble from the heights above seated here and there upon the bridge are groups of boys rod in hand endeavouring with the most deliciouslooking and persuasive of baits to inveigle finny innocents from the cool depths below

the windows of the mills are all thrown open and now and then the voices of some operatives singing at their work steal forth in company with the whir and hum of the spindles and mingle with the splash of the waterfall and the united voices of nature industry and man harmonize their swelling tones or go floating upward on the soft july air the houses upon the hillside seem to be endeavouring to extricate themselves from bowers of fullleafed trees  and with their white fronts relieved by the light green blinds look cool and inviting in the distance high above them all as though looking down in pride upon the rest stands the academy ennobled in the course of years by the addition of extensive wings and a row of stately pillars

on the whole the town looked charmingly peaceful and attractive and appeared just the quiet nook that a weary worker in cities would select as a place of retirement after a busy round of toils or pleasure

there were little knots of idlers gathered about the railroad station as there always is in quiet townsânot that they expect any one but that the arrival and departure of the train is one of the events of the day and those who have nothing else particular to accomplish feel constrained to be on hand to witness it every now and then one of them would look down the line and wonder why the cars were not in sight

amongst those seemingly the most impatient was miss ada bell who looked but little older than when she won the heart of the orphan clarence years before by that kind kiss upon his childish brow it was hers stillâshe bound it to her by long years of affectionate care almost equalling in its sacrificing tenderness that which a mother would have bestowed upon her only child clarence her adopted son had written to her that he was wretched heartsore and ill and longed to come to her his almost mother for sympathy advice and comfort so she with yearning heart was there to meet him

at last the faint scream of the steamwhistle was heard and soon the lumbering locomotive came puffing and snorting on its iron path dashing on as though it could never stop and making the surrounding hills echo with the unearthly scream of its startling whistle and arousing to desperation every dog in the quiet little town at last it stopped and stood giving short and impatient snorts and hisses whilst the passengers were alighting

clarence stepped languidly out and was soon in the embrace of miss ada

 my dear boy how thin and pale you look she exclaimed   come get into the carriage never mind your baggage george will look after that your hands are hotâ very hot you must be feverish

 yes aunt ada for so he had insisted on his calling her  i am illâsick in heart mind and everything cut up the horses said he with slight impatience of manner let us get home quickly wheni get in the old parlour and let you bathe my head as you used to i am sure i shall feel better i am almost exhausted from fatigue and heat

very well then dear dont talk now she replied notin the least noticing his impatience of manner when you are rested and have had your tea will be time enough

they were soon in the old house and clarence looked round with a smile of pleasure on the room where he had spent so many happy hours good aunt ada would not let him talk but compelled him to remain quiet until he had rested himself and eaten his evening meal

he had altered considerably in the lapse of years there was but little left to remind one of the slight melancholylooking boy that once stood a heavyhearted little stranger in the same room in days gone by his face was without a particle of red to relieve its uniform paleness his eyes large dark and languishing were half hidden by unusually long lashes his forehead broad and surmounted with clustering raven hair  a glossy moustache covered his lip and softened down its fulness on the whole he was strikingly handsome and none would pass him without a second look

tea over miss ada insisted that he should lie down upon the sofa again whilst she sat by and bathed his head

 have you seen your sister lately  she asked

 ho aunt ada he answered hesitatingly whilst a look of annoyance darkened his face for a moment  i have not been to visit her since last fallâalmost a year

 oh clarence how can you remain so long away  said she reproachfully

 well i cant go there with any comfort or pleasure he answered apologetically   i cant go there  each year as i visit the place their ways seem more strange and irksome to me whilst enjoying her company i must of course come in familiar contact with those by whom she is surrounded sustaining the position that i doâpassing as i am for a white man âi am obliged to be very circumspect and have often been compelled to give her pain by avoiding many of her dearest friends when i have encountered them in public places because of their complexion i feel mean and cowardly whilst im doing it but it is necessaryâi cant be white and coloured at the same time  the two dont mingle and i must consequently be one or the other my education habits and ideas all unfit me for associating with the latter and i live in constant dread that something may occur to bring me out with the former i dont avoid coloured people because i esteem them my inferiors in refinement education or intelligence  but because they are subjected to degradations that i shall be compelled to share by too freely associating with them

 it is a pity continued he with a sigh  that i was not suffered to grow up with them then i should have learnt to bear their burthens and in the course of time might have walked over my path of life bearing the load almost unconsciously now it would crush me i know it was a great mistake to place me in my present false position concluded he bitterly  it has cursed me only a day ago i had a letter from em reproaching me for my coldness yet god help me what am i to do 

miss ada looked at him sorrowfully and continued smoothing down his hair and inundating his temples with cologne  at last she ventured to inquire  how do matters progress with you and miss bates  clary you have lost your heart there 

 too true he replied hurriedly   and what is moreâ little birdie i call her little birdie has lost hers too aunt ada we are engaged  

 with her parents consent   she asked

yes with her parents consent we are to be married in the coming winter

then they know all of course â they know you are coloured   observed she

 they know all  cried he starting up who said they didâwho told them âtell me that i say  who has dared to tell them i am a coloured man  

 hush clarence hush  replied she attempting to soothe him  i do not know that any one has informed them i only inferred so from your saying you were engaged i thought you had informed them yourself dont you remember you wrote that you should âand i took it for granted that you had

 oh yes yes  so i did  i fully intended to hut found myself too great a coward i dare notâi cannot risk losing her i am fearful that if she knew it she would throw me off for ever

 perhaps not clarenceâif she loves you as she should and even if she did would it not be better that she should know it now than have it discovered afterwards and you both be rendered miserable for life

no no aunt adaâi cannot tell her it must remain a secret until after our marriage  then if they find it out it will be to their interest to smooth the matter over and keep quiet about it

 clary claryâthat is not honourable  

 i know itâbut how can i help it  once or twice i thought of telling her but my heart always failed me at the critical moment it would kill me to lose her oh i love her aunt ada said he passionatelyâ love her with all the energy and strength of my fathers race and all the doating tenderness of my mothers i could have told her long ago before my love had grown to its present towering strength but craft set a seal upon my lips and bid me be silent until her heart was fully mine and then nothing could part us yet now even when sure of her affections the dread that her love would not stand the test compels me to shrink more than ever from the disclosure

 but clarence you are not acting generously i know your conscience does not approve your actions

dont i know that  he answered almost fiercely  yet i dare not tellâi must shut this secret in my bosom where it gnaws gnaws gnaws until it has almost eaten my heart away oh ive thought of that time and again it has kept me awake night after night it haunts me at all hours it is breaking down my health and strengthâwearing my very life out of me no escaped galleyslave ever felt more than i do or lived in more constant fear of detection and yet i must nourish this tormenting secret and keep it growing in my breast until it has crowded out every honourable and manly feeling and then perhaps after all my sufferings and sacrifice of candour and truth out it will come at last when i least expect or think of it

aunt ada could not help weeping and exclaimed commiseratingly  my poor poor boy as he strode up and down the room

 the whole family except her seem to have the deepest contempt for coloured people they are constantly making them a subject of bitter jests  they appear to have no more feeling or regard for them than if they were brutesâand i

continued he  i miserable contemptible falsehearted knave as i am iâiâyes i join them in their heartless jests and wonder all the while my mother does not rise from her grave and curse me as i speak 

 oh clarence clarence my dear child  cried the terrified aunt ada  you talk deliriously  you have brooded over this until it has almost made you crazy come hereâbit down and seizing him by the arm she drew him on the sofa beside her and began to bathe his hot head with the cologne again

 let me walk aunt ada said he after a few moments âlet me walk i feel better whilst i am moving i cant bear to be quiet and forthwith he commenced striding up and down the room again with nervous and hurried steps

after a few moments he burst out againâ  it seems as if fresh annoyances and complications beset me every day em writes me that she is engaged i was in hopes that after i had married i could persuade her to come and live with me and so gradually break off her connection with coloured people  but that hope is extinguished now she is engaged to a coloured man

aunt ada could see no remedy for this new difficulty and could only say  indeed 

 i thought something of the kind would occur when i was last at home and spoke to her on the subject but she evaded giving me any definite answer i think she was afraid to tell meâshe has written asking my consent

 and will you give it   asked aunt ada

 it will matter but little if i dont em has a will of her own and i have no means of coercing her  besides i have no reasonable objection to urge it would be folly in me to oppose it simply because he is a coloured manâforwhat am i myself the only difference is that his identity with coloured people is no secret and he is not ashamed of it whilst i conceal my origin and live in constant dread that some one may find it out when clarence had finished he continued to walk up and down the room looking very careworn and gloomy

miss bell remained on the sofa thoughtfully regarding him at last she rose up and took his hand in hers as she used to when he was a boy and walking beside him said  the more i reflect upon it the more necessary i regard it that you should tell this girl and her parents your real position before you marry her throw away concealment make a clean breast of it you may not be rejected when they find her heart is so deeply interested if you marry her with this secret hanging over you it will embitter your life make you reserved suspicious and consequently illtempered and destroy all your domestic happiness let me persuade you tell them ere it be too late suppose it reached them through some other source what would they then think of you  

 who else would tell them  who else knows it  you you said he suspiciouslyâ you would not betray me i thought you loved me aunt ada

 clarence my dear boy she rejoined apparently hurt by his hasty and accusing tone you will mistake meâi have no such intention if they are never to learn it except through me your secret is perfectly safe yet i must tell you that i feel and think that the true way to promote her happiness and your own is for you to disclose to them your real position and throw yourself upon their generosity for the result

clarence pondered for a long time over miss bells advice which she again and again repeated placing it each time before him in a stronger light until at last she extracted from him a promise that he would do it  i know you are right aunt ada said he i am convinced of thatâit is a question of courage with me i know it would be more honourable for me to tell her now ill try to do itâi will make an effort and summon up the courage necessaryâgod be my helper 

 thats a dear boy   she exclaimed kissing him affectionately   i know you will feel happier when it is all over and even if she should break her engagement you will be infinitely better off than if it was fulfilled and your secret subsequently discovered come now she concluded i am going to exert my old authority and send you to bed  tomorrow perhaps you may see this in a more hopeful light

two days after this clarence was again in new york amid the heat and dust of that crowded bustling city soon after his arrival he dressed himself and started for the mansion of mr bates trembling as he went for the result of the communication he was about to make

once on the way he paused for the thought had occurred to him that he would write to them then reproaching himself for his weakness and timidity he started on again with renewed determination

 ill see her myself he soliloquized  ill tell little birdie all and know my fate from her own lips if i must give her up ill know the worst from her

when clarence was admitted he would not permit himself to be announced but walked tiptoe upstairs and gently opening the drawingroom door entered the room

standing by the piano turning over the leaves of some music and merrily humming an air was a young girl of extremely petite and delicate form her complexion was strikingly fair and the rich curls of dark auburn that fell in clusters on her shoulders made it still more dazzling by the contrast presented her eyes were grey inclining to black her features small and not overremarkable for their symmetry yet by no means disproportionate there was the sweetest of dimples on her small round chin and her throat white and clear as the finest marble the expression of her face was extremely childlike  she seemed more like a schoolgirl than a young woman of eighteen on the eve of marriage

there was something deliciously airy and fairylike in her motions and as she slightly moved her feet in time to the music she was humming her thin blue dress floated about her and undulated in harmony with her graceful motions

after gazing at her for a few moments clarence called gently little birdie she gave a timid joyous little cry of surprise and pleasure and fluttered into his arms

oh clary love how you startled me i did not dream there was any one in the room it was so naughty in you

said she childishly as he pushed back the curls from her face and kissed her  when did you arrive  

 only an hour ago he answered

 and you came here at once  ah that was so loverlike and kind she rejoined smiling

you look like a sylph tonight anne said he as she danced about him  ah he continued after regarding her fora few seconds with a look of intense admiration you want to rivet my chains the tighterâyou look most bewitching why are you so much dressed tonight âjewels sash and satin slippers he continued  are you going out  

no clary she answered i was to have gone to the theatre but just at the last moment i decided not to a singular desire to stay at home came over me suddenly i had an instinctive feeling that i should lose some greater enjoyment if i went so i remained at home and here love are you but what is the matter  you look sad and weary

 i am a little fatigued said he seating himself and holding her hand in his   a little weary  but that will soon wear off and as for the sadness concluded he with a forced smile  that must depart now that i am with you little birdie

 i feel relieved that you have returned safe and well

said she looking up into his face from her seat beside him for clary love i had such a frightful dream such a singular dream about you i have endeavoured to shake it out of my foolish little head but it wont go claryâi cant get rid of it it occurred after you left us at saratoga oh it was nothing though said bhe laughing and shaking her curls ânothing and now you are safely returned i shall not think of it again tell me what you have seen since you went away and how is that dear aunt ada of yours you talk so much about  

 oh she is quite well answered he  but tell anne tell me about that dream what was it birdie âcome tell me

 i dont care to she answered with a slight shudderâ  i dont want to love

yes yesâdo sweet importuned he i want to hear it

 then if i must said she  i will i dreamed that you and i were walking on a road together and twas such a beautiful road with flowers and fruit and lovely cottages on either side i thought you held my hand i felt it just as plain as i clasp yours now presently a rough ugly man overtook us and bid you let me go and that you refused and held me all the tighter then he gave you a diabolical look and touched you on the face and you broke out in loathsome black spots and screamed in such agony and frightened me so that i awoke all in a shiver of terror and did not get over it all the next day

clarence clutched her hand tighter as she finished so tight indeed that she gave a little scream of pain and looked frightened at him what is the matter she inquired your hand is like ice and you are paler than ever you havent let that trifling dream affect you so it is nothing

 i am superstitious in regard to dreams said clarence wiping the perspiration from his forehead  go he asked faintly  play me an air loveâsomething quick and lively to dispel this i wish you had not told me

but you begged me to said she pouting as she took her seat at the instrument

 how ominous muttered heâ became covered with black spots that is a foreshadowing how can i tell her

he thought it seems like wilfully destroying my own happiness and he sat struggling with himself to obtain the necessary courage to fulfil the purpose of his visit and became so deeply engrossed with his own reflections as to scarcely even hear the sound of the instrument

 it is too bad she cried as she ceased playing   here i have performed some of your favourite airs and that too without eliciting a word of commendation you are inexpressibly dull tonight nothing seems to enliven you

what is the matter  

 oh rejoined he abstractedly am i i was not aware of it

 yes you are said little birdie pettishly   nothing seems to engage your attention and skipping off to the table she took up the newspaper and exclaimedâ let me read you something very curious

no no anne dear interrupted he sit here by me

i want to say something serious to youâsomething of moment to us both

 then its something very grave and dull i know she remarked  for that is the way people always begin now i dont want to hear anything serious tonight i want to be merry you look serious enough and if you begin to talk seriously youll be perfectly unbearable so you must hear what i am going to read to you first and the little tyrant put her finger on his lip and looked so bewitching that he could not refuse her and the important secret hung on his lips but was not spoken

 listen said she spreading out the paper before her and running her tiny finger down the column  ah i have it

she exclaimed at last and began â   we learn from unimpeachable authority that the hon who represents a district of our city in the state legislature was yesterday united to the quateroon daughter of the late gustave almont she is said to be possessed of a large fortune inherited from her father and they purpose going to france to resideâa sensible determination as after such a mesalliance the honourable gentleman can no longer expect to retain his former social position in our midstânew orleans watchman 

 isnt it singular she remarked  that a man in his position should make such a choice  

 he loved her no doubt suggested clarence   and she was almost white

how could he love her asked she wonderingly

 love a coloured woman i cannot conceive it possible

said she with a look of disgust  there is something strange and unnatural about it

no no he rejoined hurriedly it was love anneâ pure love  it is not impossible iâi  am coloured

he would have said but he paused and looked full in her lovely face he could not tell herâthe words slunk back into his coward heart unspoken

she stared at him in wonder and perplexity and exclaimed â dear clarence how strangely you act i am afraid you are not well your brow is hot said she laying her hand on his forehead  you have been travelling too much for your strength

 it is not that he replied  i feel a sense of suffocation as if all the blood was rushing to my throat let me get the air and he rose and walked to the window anne hastened and brought him a glass of water of which he drank a little and then declared himself better

after this he stood for a long time with her clasped in his arms then giving her one or two passionate kisses he strained her closer to him and abruptly left the house leaving little birdie startled and alarmed by his strange behaviour

let us visit once more the room from which mr walters and his friends made so brave a defence there is but little in its present appearance to remind one of that eventful nightâno reminiscences of that desperate attack save the bullethole in the ceiling which mr walters declares shall remain unfilled as an evidence of the marked attention he has received at the hands of his fellowcitizens

there are several noticeable additions to the furniture of the apartment amongst them an elegantlycarved workstand upon which some unfinished articles of childrens apparel are lying a capacious rockingchair and grand piano

then opposite to the portrait of toussaint is suspended another picture which no doubt holds a higher position in the regard of the owner of the mansion than the african warrior aforesaid it is a likeness of the lady who is sitting at the windowâmrs esther walters nãe ellis the brown baby in the picture is the little girl at her sideâthe elder sister of the other brown baby who is doing its best to pull from its mothers lap the dolls dress upon which she is sewing yes that is dear old ess as charlie calls her yet though why he will persist in applying the adjective we are at a loss to determine

esther looks anything but oldâa trifle matronly we admit âbut old we emphatically say she is not her hair is parted plainly and the tiniest of all tiny caps sits at the back of her head looking as if it felt it had no business on such raven black hair and ought to be ignominiously dragged off without one word of apology the face and form are much more round and full and the old placid expression has been undisturbed in the lapse of years

the complexion of the two children was a sort of compromise between the complexions of their parentsâchubbyfaced chestnutcoloured curlyheaded rollicking little pests who would never be quiet and whose little black buttons of eyes were always peering into something and whose little plugs of fingers would in spite of every precaution to prevent be diving into mothers workbox and various other highly inconvenient and inappropriate places

 there  said esther putting the last stitch into a doll she had been manufacturing  now take sister and go away and play but little sister it appeared did not wish to be taken and she made the best of her way off holding on by the chairs and tottering over the great gulfs between them until she succeeded in reaching the musicstand where she paused for a while before beginning to destroy the music

just at this critical juncture a young lady entered the room and held up her hands in horror and baby hastened off as fast as her toddling limbs could carry her and buried her face in her mothers lap in great consternation

emily garie made two or three slight feints of an endeavour to catch her and then sat down by the little ones mother and gave a deep sigh

 have you answered your brothers letter   asked esther

yes i have she replied here it isâand she laid the letter in esthers lap baby made a desperate effort to obtain it but suffered a signal defeat and her mother opened it and readâ dear brotherâi read your chilling letter with deep borrow i cannot say that it surprised me it is what i have anticipated during the many months that i have been silent on the subject of my marriage yet when i read it i could not but feel a pang to which heretofore i have been a stranger

clarence you know i love you and should not make the sacrifice you demand a test of my regard true i cannot say and most heartily i regret it that there exists between us the same extravagant fondness we cherished as childrenâbut that is no fault of mine did you not return to me each year colder and colderâmore distant and unbrotherlyâ until you drove back to their source the gushing streams of a sisters love that flowed so strongly towards you  you ask me to resign charles ellis and come to you what can you offer me in exchange for his true manly affection âto what purpose drive from my heart a love that has been my only solace only consolation for your waning regard  we have grown up togetherâhe has been warm and kind when you were cold and indifferentâand now that he claims the reward of long years of tender regard and my own heart is conscious that he deserves it you would step between us and forbid me yield the recompense that it will be my pride and delight to bestow it grieves me to write it yet i must claryâfor between brother and sister there is no need of concealments and particularly at such a time should everything be open clear explicit do not think i wish to reproach you what you are clarence your false position and unfortunate education have made you i write it with painâyour demand seems extremely selfish i fear it is not of me but of yourself you are thinking when you ask me to sever at once and for ever my connection with a people who you say can only degrade me yet how much happier am i sharing their degradation than you appear to be is it regard for me that induces the desire that i should share the life of constant dread that i cannot but feel you endureâor do you fear that my present connections will interfere with your own plans for the future 

even did i grant it was my happiness alone you had in view my objections would be equally strong i could not forego the claims of early friendship and estrange myself from those wrho have endeared themselves to me by long years of careânor pass coldly and unrecognizingly by playmates and acquaintances because their complexions were a few shades darker than my own this i could never doâto me it seems ungrateful yet i would not reproach you because you canâfor the circumstances by which you have been surrounded have conspired to produce that resultâand i presume you regard such conduct as necessary to sustain you in your present position from the tenor of your letter i should judge that you entertained some fear that i might compromise you with your future bride and intimate that my choice may deprive you of yours surely that need not be she need not even know of my existence do not entertain a fear that i or my future husband will ever interfere with your happiness by thrusting ourselves upon you or endanger your social position by proclaiming our relationship our paths lie so widely apart that they need never cross you walk on the side of the oppressorâi thank god am with the oppressed  i am happyâmore happy i am sure than you could make me even by surrounding me with the glittering lights that shine upon your path and which alas  may one day go suddenly out and leave you wearily groping in the darkness

i trust dear brother my words may not prove a prophecy yet should they be trust me clarence you may come back again and a sisters heart will receive you none the less warmly that you selfishly desired her to sacrifice the happiness of a lifetime to you i shall marry charles ellis i ask you to come and see us unitedâi shall not reproach you if you do not yet i shall feel strange without a single relative to kiss or bless me in that most eventful hour of a womans life god bless you clary  i trust your union may be as happy as i anticipate my own will beâand if it is not it will not be because it has lacked the earnest prayers of your neglected but still loving sister

 esther i thought i was too cold in thatâtell me do you think so  

 no dear not at all i think it a most affectionate reply to a cold selfish letter

 oh im glad to hear you say that i can trust better to your tenderness of others feelings than to my own heart i felt strongly esther and was fearful that it might be too harsh or reproachful i was anxious lest my feelings should be too strikingly displayed yet it was better to be explicitâ dont you think so  

 undoubtedly answered esther and handing back the letter she took up baby and seated herself in the rockingchair

now baby had a prejudice against caps inveterate and unconquerable  and grandmamma nurse and esther were compelled to bear the brunt of her antipathies we have before said that esthers cap looked as though it felt itself in an inappropriate positionâthat it had got on the head of the wrong individualâand baby no doubt in deference to the caps feelings tore it off and threw it in the halfopen piano from whence it was extricated with great detriment to the delicate lace

emily took a seat near the window and drawing her worktable towards her raised the lid this presenting another opening for baby she slid down from her mothers lap and hastened towards her she just arrived in time to see it safely closed and toddled back to her mother as happy as if she had succeeded in running riot over its contents and scattering them all over the floor

emily kept looking down the street as though in anxious expectation of somebody  and whilst she stood there there was an opportunity of observing how little she had changed in the length of years she is little em magnified with a trifle less of the child in her face her hair has a slight kink is a little more wavy than is customary in persons of entire white blood  but in no other way is her extraction perceptible only the initiated searching for evidences of african blood would at all notice this slight peculiarity

her expectation was no doubt about to be gratified for a smile broke over her face as she left the window and skipped downstairs  when she reentered she was accompanied by her intended husband

there was great commotion amongst the little folk in consequence of this new arrival baby kicked and screamed out unker char and went almost frantic because her dress became entangled in the buckle of her mammas belt and her sister received a kiss before she could be extricated

charlie is greatly alteredâhe is tall remarkably athletic with a large handsomelyshaped head covered with closecut woolly hair high forehead heavy eyebrows large nose and a mouth of ordinary size filled with beautifully white teeth which he displays at almost every word he speaks chin broad and the whole expression of his face thoughtful and commanding yet replete with good humour no one would call him handsome yet there was something decidedly attractive in his general appearance no one would recognize him as the charlie of old whose escapades had so destroyed the comfort and harmony of mrs thomass establishment and only once when he held up the baby and threatened to let her tear the paper ornaments from the chandelier was there a twinkle of the charlie of old looking out of his eyes

 how are mother and father today   asked esther

 oh both well i left them only a few minutes ago at the dinner table i had to hurry off to go to the office

 so i perceive observed esther archly  and of course coming here which is four squares out of your way will get you there much sooner

emily blushed and said smilingly esther was a very impertinent person and in this opinion charlie fully concurred they then walked to the window where they stood saying no doubt to each other those little tender things which are so profoundly interesting to lovers and so exceedingly stupid to every one else baby in high glee was seated on charlies shoulder where she could clutch both hands in his hair and pull until the tears almost started from his eyes

 emily and you have been talking a long while and i presume you have fully decided on what day you are both to be rescued from your misery and when i am to have the exquisite satisfaction of having my house completely turned upside down for jour mutual benefit said esther  i trust it will be as soon as possible as we cannot rationally expect that either of you will be bearable until it is all over and you find yourselves ordinary mortals again come now out with it when is it to be

 i say next week cried charlie

 next week indeed hastily rejoined emily  i could not think of such a thingâso abrupt

 so abrupt repeated charlie with a laugh  why havent i been courting you ever since i wore roundabouts and hasnt everybody been expecting us to be married every week within the last two years fie em its anything but abrupt

emily blushed still deeper and looked out of the window down the street and up the street but did not find anything in the prospect at either side that at all assisted her to come to a decision so she only became more confused and stared the harder  at last she ventured to suggest that day two months

this day two months â outrageous said charlie

 come here dear old ess and help me to convince this deluded girl of the preposterous manner in which she is conducting herself

 i must join her side if you will bring me into the discussion i think she is right charlieâthere is so much to be done  the house to procure and furnish and numberless other things that you hasty and absurd men know nothing about

by dint of strong persuasion from charlie emily finally consented to abate two weeks of the time and they decided that a family council should be held that evening at mrs

elliss when the whole arrangements should be definitely settled

a note was accordingly despatched by esther to her motherâthat she accompanied by emily and the children would come to them early in the afternoon and that the gentlemen would join them in the evening at teatime caddy was of course completely upset by the intelligence for notwithstanding that she and the maidofallwork lived in art almost perpetual state of housecleaning nothing appeared to her to be in order and worse than all there was nothing to eat

nothing to eat exclaimed mrs ellis  why my dear child there are all manner of preserves plenty of fresh peaches to cut and sugar down and a large poundcake in the house and any quantity of bread can be purchased at the bakers

bread â plain bread rejoined caddy indignantly quite astonished at her mothers modest idea of a teaâand a companytea at that do you think mother id set mr

walters down to plain bread when we always have hot rolls and shortcake at their house it is not to be thought of for a moment they must have some kind of hot cake be the consequences what they may

caddy bustled herself about and hurried up the maidofallwork in an astonishing manner and before the company arrived had everything prepared and looked as trim and neat herself as if she had never touched a rollingpin and did not know what an oven was used for

behold them all assembled mrs ellis at the head of the table with a grandchild on each side of her and her capstrings pinned upon the side next to baby esther bits opposite her husband who is grown a little grey but otherwise is not in the least altered  next to her is her father almost buried in a large easychair where he sits shaking his head from time to time and smiling vacantly at the children then come emily and charlie at the foot and at his other hand caddy and kinchâkinch the invincibleâkinch the dirtyâ kinch the mischievous now metamorphosed into a fullblown dandy with faultless linen elegant vest and fashionablycut coat oh kinch what a changeâfrom the most shabby and careless of all boys to a consummate exquisite with heavy gold waitch and eyeglass and who has been known to dress regularly twice a day 

there was a mighty pouring out of tea at mrs elliss end of the table and baby of course had to be served first with some milk and bread between her and the cat intimate relations seemed to exist for by their united efforts the first cup was soon disposed of and baby was clamouring for the second before the elder portions of the family had been once served round with tea

charlie and emily ate little and whispered a great deal but kinch the voracity of whose appetite had not at all diminished in the length of years makes up for their abstinence by devouring the delicious round shortcakes with astonishing rapidity he did not pretend to make more than two bites to a cake and they slipped away down his throat as if it was a railroad tunnel and they were a train of cars behind time

caddy felt constrained to get up every few moments to look after something and to assure herself by personal inspection that the reserved supplies in the kitchen were not likely to be exhausted esther occupied herself in attending upon her helpless father and fed him as tenderly and carefully as if he was one of her babies

 i left you ladies in council what was decided   said charlie dont be at all bashful as regards speaking before kinch for he is in the secret and has been these two months

kinch is to be groomsman and has had three tailors at work on his suit for a fortnight past he told me this morning that if you did not hurry matters up his wedding coat would be a week out of fashion before he should get a chance to wear it

 how delightfulâkinch to be groomsman said esther  that is very kind in you kinch to assist us to get charlie off our hands

 and who is to be bridesmaid  asked walters

 oh caddy of courseâi couldnt have any one but caddy blushingly answered emily

 that is capital cried charlie giving kinch a facetious poke just the thing isnt it kinchâit will get her accustomed to these matters you remember what you told me this morning eh old boy   he concluded archly

kinch tried to blush but being very darkcomplexioned his efforts in that direction were not at all apparent so he evidenced his confusion by cramming a whole shortcake into his mouth and almost caused a stoppage in the tunnel caddy became excessively red in the face and was sure they wanted more cakes

but mr walters was equally confident they did not and put his back against the door and stood there whilst mrs ellis gravely informed them that she soon expected to be her own housekeeper for that she had detected caddy and kinch in a furniture establishment pricing a chest of drawers and a washstand and that kinch had unblushingly told her they had for some time been engaged to be married but somehow or other had forgotten to mention it to her

this caused a general shout of laughter around the table in which baby tumultuously joined and rattled her spoon against the teaurn until she almost deafened them

this noise frightened mr ellis who cried  there they come there they come  and cowered down in his great chair and looked so exceedingly terrified that the noise was hushed instantly and tears sprang into the eyes of dear old ess who rose and stood by him and laid his withered face upon her soft warm bosom smoothed down the thin grey hair and held him close to her throbbing tender heart until the wild light vanished from his bleared and sunken eyes and the vacant childish smile came back on his thin wan face again when she said  pray dont laugh so very loud it alarms father he is composed now pray dont startle him so again

this sobered them down a little and they quietly recommenced discussing the matrimonial arrangements but they were all in such capital spirits that an occasional hearty and goodhumoured laugh could not be suppressed

mr walters acted in his usual handsome manner and facetiously collaring charlie took him into a corner and informed him that he had an empty house that he wished him to occupy and that if he ever whispered the word rent or offered him any money before he was worth twenty thousand dollars he should believe that he wanted to pick a quarrel with him and should refer him to a friend and then pistols and coffee would be the inevitable result

then it came out that caddy and einch had been courting for some time if not with mrs elliss verbal consent with at least no objection from that good lady for master einch besides being an exceedingly goodnatured fellow was very snug in his boots and had a good many thousand dollars at his disposal bequeathed him by his father

the fates had conspired to make that old gentleman rich

he owned a number of lots on the outskirts of the city on which he had been paying taxes a number of years and he awoke one fine morning to find them worth a large sum of money the city council having determined to cut a street just beside them and the property all around being in the hands of wealthy and fashionable people his own proved to be exceedingly valuable

it was a sad day for the old man as einch and his mother insisted that he should give up business which he did most reluctantly and einch had to be incessantly on the watch thereafter to prevent him from hiring cellars and sequestering their old clothes to et up in business again they were both gone now and einch was his own master with a wellsecured income of a thousand dollars ayear with a prospect of a large increase

they talked matters over fully and settled all their arrangements before the time for parting and then finding the baby had scrambled into mrs elliss lap and gone fast asleep and that it was long after ten oclock each departed taking their several ways for home

there is great bustle and confusion in the house of mr

bates mantuamakers and milliners are coming in at unearthly hours and consultations of deep importance are being duly held with maiden aunts and the young ladies who are to officiate as bridesmaids at the approaching ceremony there are daily excursions to drapers establishments and jewellers and in fact so much to be done and thought of that little birdie is in constant confusion and her dear little curly head is almost turned topsyturvy twenty times in each day is she called upstairs to where the sempstresses are at work to have something tried on or fitted poor little birdie she declares she never can stand it she did not dream that to be married she would have been subjected to such a world of trouble or she would never have consentedânever l and then clarence too comes in every morning and remains half the day teasing her to play to talk or sing

inconsiderate clarence  when she has so much on her mind and when at last he goes and she begins to felicitate herself that she is rid of him back he comes again in the evening and repeats the same annoyance o naughty tiresome clarence how can you plague little birdie so  perhaps you think she doesnt dislike it you may be right very likely she doesnt

she sometimes wonders why he grows paler and thinner each day and his nervous and sometimes distracted manner teases her dreadfully but she supposes all lovers act thus and expects they cannot help itâand then little birdie takes a sly peep in the glass and does not so much wonder after all

yet if she sometimes deems his manner startling and odd what would she say if she knew that night after night when he left her side he wandered for long hours through the cold and dreary streets and then went to his hotel where he paced his room until almost day 

ah little birdie a smile will visit his pale face when you chirp tenderly to him and a faint tinge comes upon his cheek when you lay your soft tiny hand upon it yet all the while there is that desperate secret lying next his heart and like a vampire sucking away drop by drop happiness and peace

not so with little birdie  she is happyâoh so happy she rises with a song upon her lips and is chirping in the sunshine she herself creates the livelong day flowers of innocence bloom and flourish in her peaceful lithesome heart poor poor little birdie those flowers are destined to wither soon and the sunlight fade from thy happy face for ever

one morning clarence little birdie and her intended bridesmaid miss ellstowe were chatting together when a card was handed to the latter who on looking at it exclaimed  oh dear me an old beau of mine show him up

and scampering off to the mirror she gave a hasty glance to see that every curl was in its effective position

 who is it   asked little birdii all alive with curiosity  do say who it is

 hush   whispered miss ellstowe  here he comes my dear he is very richâa great catch are my curls all right  

scarcely had she asked the question and before an answer could be returned the servant announced mr george stevens and the gentleman walked into the room

start not reader it is not the old man we left bent over the prostrate form of his unconscious daughter but george stevens junior the son and heir of the old man aforesaid

the heart of clarence almost ceased to beat at the sound of that wellknown name and had not both the ladies been so engrossed in observing the newcomer they must have noticed the deep flush that suffused his face and the deathly pallor that succeeded it

mr stevens was presented to miss bates and miss ellstowe turned to present him to clarence  mr garieâmr

stevens said she clarence bowed

 pardon me i did not catch the name said the former politely

 mr clarence garie she repeated more distinctly

george stevens bowed and then sitting down opposite clarence eyed him for a few moments intently  i think we have met before said he at last in a cold contemptuous tone not unmingled with surprise have we not

clarence endeavoured to answer but could not he was for a moment incapable of speech a slight gurgling noise was heard in his throat as he bowed affirmatively

we were neighbours at one time i think added george stevens

 we were faintly ejaculated clarence

it is a great surprise to me to meet you here pursued george stevens

 the surprise is mutual i assure you sir rejoined clarence coldly and with slightly agitated manner

hereupon ensued an embarrassing pause in the conversation during which the ladies could not avoid observing the livid hue of clarences face there was a perfect tumult raging in his breast he knew that now his longtreasured secret would be brought out this was to be the end of his struggle to preserve it â to be exposed at last when on the brink of consummating his happiness as he sat there looking at george stevens he became a murderer in his heart and if an invisible dagger could have been placed in his hands he would have driven it to the hilt in his breast and stilled for ever the tongue that was destined to betray him

but it was too late one glance at the contemptuous malignant face of the son of his fathers murderer told him his fate was sealedâthat it was now too late to avert exposure

he grew faint dizzy illâand rising declared hurriedly he must go staggered towards the door and fell upon the carpet with a slight stream of blood spirting from his mouth

little birdie screamed and ran to raise him george stevens and miss ellstowe gave their assistance and by their united efforts he was placed upon the sofa little birdie wiped the bloody foam from his mouth with her tiny lace handkerchief bathed his head and held cold water to his lips but consciousness was long returning and they thought he was dying

poor tom heart pity it was thy beatings were not stilled then for ever it was not thy fate long long months of grief and despair were yet to come before the end approached and day again broke upon thee

just at this crisis mr bates came in and was greatly shocked and alarmed by clarences deathly appearance as he returned to consciousness he looked wildly about him and clasping little birdies hand in his gazed at her with a tender imploring countenance yet it was a despairing lookâsuch a one as a shipwrecked seaman gives when in sight of land he slowly relaxes his hold upon the sustaining spar that he has no longer the strength to clutch and sinks for ever beneath the waters

a physician was brought in who declared he had ruptured a minor bloodvessel and would not let him utter a whisper and assisted by mr bates placed him in his carriage and the three were driven as swiftly as possible to the hotel where clarence was staying little birdie retired to her room in great affliction followed by miss ellstowe and george stevens was left in the room alone

 what can the fellow have been doing here   he soliloquised on intimate terms too apparently it is very singular i will wait miss ellstowes return and ask an explanation

when miss ellstowe reentered the room he immediately inquired  what was that mr garie doing here  he seems on an exceedingly intimate footing and your friend apparently takes a wonderful interest in him

 of course she does that is her fiancã

 impossible  rejoined he with an air of astonishment

 impossibleâwhy so  i assure you he is they are to be married in a few weeks i am here to officiate as bridesmaid

 phew  whistled george stevens and then after pausing a moment he asked  do you know anything about this mr garieâanything i mean respecting his family  

 why noâthat is nothing very definite more than that he is an orphan and a gentleman of education and independent means

 humph  ejaculated george stevens significantly

 humph  repeated miss ellstowe  what do you mean

do you know anything beyond that one might suppose you did from your significant looks and gestures

 yes i do know something about this mr garie he replied after a bhort silence  but tell me what kind of people are these you are visitingâabolitionists or anything of that sort  

 how absurd mr stevens to ask such a question of course they are not said she indignantly  do you suppose i should be here if they were  but why do you askâis this mr garie one  

no my friend answered her visitor  i wish that teas all

 that was allâhow strangely you talkâyou alarm me

continued she with considerable agitation  if you know anything that will injure the happiness of my friendâanything respecting mr garie that she or her father should knowâmake no secret of it but disclose it to me at once

anne is my dearest friend and i of course must be interested in anything that concerns her happiness tell me what is it you know

it is nothing i assure you that it will give me any pleasure to tell answered he

 do speak out mr stevens is there any stain on his character or that of his family  did he ever do anything dishonourable  

 i wish that was all coolly repeated george stevens

 i am afraid he is a villain and has been imposing himself upon this family for what he is not

 good heavens mr stevens how is he a villain or impostor  

 you all suppose him to be a white man do you not  ho asked

 of course we do she promptly answered

 then you are all grievously mistaken for he is not did you not notice how he changed colour how agitated he became when i was presented  it was because he knew that his exposure was at hand i know him wellâin fact he is the illegitimate son of a deceased relative of mine by a mulatto slave

 it cannot be possible exclaimed miss ellstowe with a wild stare of astonishment  are you sure of it  

 sure of it of course i am i should indeed be a rash man to make such a terrible charge unless perfectly able to substantiate it i have played with him frequently when a child and my father made a very liberal provision for this young man and his sister after the death of their father who lost his life through imprudently living with this woman in philadelphia and consequently getting himself mixed up with these detestable abolitionists

 can this be true  asked miss ellstowe incredulously

 i assure you it is we had quite lost sight of them for a few years back and i little supposed we should meet under such circumstances i fear i shall be the cause of great discomfort but i am sure in the end i shall be thanked i could not with any sense of honour or propriety permit such a thing as this marriage to be consummated without at least warning your friends of the real position of this fellow

i trust miss ellstowe you will inform them of what i have told you

 how can i  oh mr stevens  said she in a tone of deep distress  this will be a terrible blowâit will almost kill anne no no the task must not devolve on meâi cannot tell them poor little thing it will break her heart i am afraid

 oh but you must miss ellstowe it would seem very impertinent in meâa strangerâto meddle in such a matter and besides they may be aware of it and not thank me for my interference

 no i assure you they are not i am confident they have not the most distant idea of such a thingâthey would undoubtedly regard it as an act of kindness on your part i shall insist upon your remaining until the return of mr bates when i shall beg you to repeat to him what you have already revealed to me

 as you insist upon it i suppose i must repeated he after some reflection  but i must say i do not like the office of informer concluded he with assumed reluctance

 i am sorry to impose it upoir you  yet rest assured they will thank you excuse me for a few momentsâi will go and see how anne is

miss ellstowe returned after a short interval with ths information that little birdie was much more composed and would no doubt soon recover from her fright

 to receive a worse blow observed george stevens i pity the poor little thingâonly to think of the disgrace of being engaged to a nigger it is fortunate for them that they will make the discovery ere it be too late heavens  only think what the consequences might have been had she married this fellow and his peculiar position became known to them afterwards she would have been completely donefor 

thus conversing respecting clarence they awaited the return of mr bates after the lapse of a couple of hours he entered the drawingroom mr stevens was presented to him by miss ellstowe as a particular friend of herself and family

 i believe you were here when i came in before i regret i was obliged to leave so abruptly courteously spoke mr

bates whilst bowing to his new acquaintance   the sudden and alarming illness of my young friend will i trust be a sufficient apology

how is he now   asked miss elstowe

 betterâmuch better answered he cheerfully  but very wild and distracted in his mannerâalarmingly so in fact he clung to my hand and wrung it when we parted and bid me good bye again and again as if it was for the last time poor fellow  he is frightened at that hemorrhage and is afraid it will be fatal but there is not any danger he only requires to be kept quietâhe will soon come round again no doubt i shall have to ask you to excuse me again said he in conclusion   i must go and see my daughter

mr bates was rising to depart when george stevens gave miss ellstowe a significant look who said in a hesitating tone  mr bates one moment before you go my friend mr stevens has a communication to make to you respecting mr garie which will i fear cause you as it already has me deep distress

indeed rejoined mr bates in a tone of surprise what is it nothing that reflects upon his character i hope

i do not know how my information will influence your conduct towards him for i do not know what your sentiments may be respecting such persons i know society in general do not receive them and my surprise was very great to find him here

i do not understand you  what do you mean   demanded mr bates in a tone of perplexity   has he ever committed any crime 

he is a coloured man answered george stevens briefly mr bates became almost purple and gasped for breath then after staring at his informant for a few seconds incredulously repeated the words coloured manin a dreamy manner as if in doubt whether he had really beard them

yes coloured man said george stevens confidently  it grieves me to be the medium of such disagreeable intelligence  and i assure you i only undertook the office upon the representation of miss ellstowe that you were not aware of the fact and would regard my communication as an act of kindness

 itâit cant be exclaimed mr bates with the air of a man determined not to be convinced of a disagreeable truth  it cannot be possible

hereupon george stevens related to him what he had recently told miss ellstowe respecting the parentage and position of clarence during the narration the old man became almost frantic with rage and sorrow bursting forth once or twice with the most violent exclamations  and when george stevens concluded he rose and said in a husky voiceâ  ill kill him the infernal hypocrite oh  the impostor to come to my house in this nefarious manner and steal the affections of my daughterâthe devilish villain a bastard  a contemptible blackhearted nigger oh my childâmy child

it will break your heart when you know what deep disgrace has come upon you ill go to him added he his face flushed and his white hair almost erect with rage  ill murder himâtheres not a man in the city will blame me for it and he grasped his cane as though he would go at once and inflict summary vengeance upon the offender

 stop sir dont be rash exclaimed george stevens   i would not screen this fellow from the effects of your just and very natural indignationâhe is abundantly worthy of the severest punishment you can bestow but if you go in your present excited state you might be tempted to do something which would make this whole affair public and injure thereby your daughters future youll pardon me i trust and not think me presuming upon my short acquaintance in making the suggestion

mr bates looked about him bewilderedly for a short time and then replied no no you need not apologize you are rightâi thank you i myself should have known better

but my poor child what will become of her and in an agony of sorrow he resumed his seat and buried his face in his hands

george stevens prepared to take his departure but mr

bates pressed him to remain  in a little while said he i shall be more composed and then i wish you to go with me to this worthless scoundrel i must see him at once and warn him what the consequences will be should he dare approach my child again dont fear me he added as he saw george stevens hesitated to remain  that whirlwind of passion is over now i promise you i shall do nothing unworthy of myself or my child

it was not long before they departed together for the hotel at which clarence was staying when they entered his room they found him in his bed with the miniature of little birdie in his hands when he observed the dark scowl on the face of mr bates and saw by whom he was accompanied he knew his secret was discovered he saw it written on their faces he trembled like a leaf and his heart seemed like a lump of ice in his bosom mr bates was about to speak when clarence held up his hand in the attitude of one endeavouring to ward off a blow and whispered hoarselyâ  dont tell meânot yetâa little longer i see you know all i see my sentence written on your face let me dream a little longer ere you speak the words that must for ever part me and little birdie i know you have come to separate usâbutdont tell me yet for when you do said he in an agonized tone  it will kill me 

 i wish to god it would   rejoined mr bates  i wish you had died long ago then you would have never come beneath my roof to destroy its peace for ever you have acted basely palming yourself upon usâcounterfeit as you were and taking in exchange her true love and my honest honourable regard

clarence attempted to speak but mr bates glared at him and continuedâ there are laws to punish thieves and counterfeitsâbut such as you may go unchastised except by the abhorrence of all honourable men had you been unaware of your origin and had the revelation of this gentleman been as new to you as to me you would have deserved sympathy  but you have been acting a lie claiming a position in society to which you knew you had no right and deserve execration and contempt did i treat you as my feelings dictated you would understand what is meant by the weight of a fathers anger but i do not wish the world to know that my daughter has been wasting her affections upon a worthless nigger  that is all that protects you  now hear me he added fiercely â if ever you presume to darken my door again or attempt to approach my daughter i will shoot you as sure as you sit there before me  

 and serve you perfectly right observed george stevens

 silence sir   rejoined clarence sternly  how dare you interfere  he may say what he likesâreproach me as he pleasesâhe is her fatherâi have no other reply  but if you dare again to utter a word ill and clarence paused and looked about him as if in search of something with which to enforce silence

feeblelooking as he was there was an air of determination about him which commanded acquiescence and george stevens did not venture upon another observation during the interview

 i want my daughters lettersâevery line she ever wrote to you get them at onceâi want them now said mr

bates imperatively

i cannot give them to you immediately they are not accessible at present does she want them   he asked feeblyâ has she desired to have them back  

never mind that said the old man sternly no evasions

give me the letters  

tomorrow i will send them said clarence i will read them all over once again thought he

 i cannot believe you said mr bates

 i promise you upon my honour i will send them tomorrow  

 a niggers honour   rejoined mr bates with a contemptuous sneer

 yes sirâa niggers honour  repeated clarence the colour mounting to his pale cheeks  a few drops of negro blood in a mans veins do not entirely deprive him of noble sentiments tis true my past concealment does not argue in my favourâi concealed that which was no fault of my own but what the injustice of society has made a crime

 i am not here for discussion and i suppose i must trust to your honour interrupted mr bates with a sneer  but remember if the letters are not forthcoming tomorrow i shall be here again and then concluded he in a threatening tone  my visit will not be as harmless as this has been  

after they had gone clarence rose and walked feebly to his desk which with great effort and risk he removed to the bed side then taking from it little birdies letters he began their perusal

ay  read them againâand yet again pore over their contentsâdwell on those passages replete with tenderness until every word is stamped upon thy breaking heartâlinger by them as the weary traveller amid saharas sand pauses by some sparkling fountain in a shady oasis tasting of its pure waters ere he launches forth again upon the arid waste beyond this is the last green spot upon thy way to death  beyond whose grim portals let us believe thou and thy  little birdie may meet again

the city clocks had just tolled out the hour of twelve the last omnibus had rumbled by and the silence without was broken only at rare intervals when some belated citizen passed by with hurried footsteps towards his home all was still in the house of mr stevensâso quiet that the ticking of the large clock in the hall could be distinctly heard at the top of the stairway breaking the solemn stillness of the night with its monotonous click clickâclick click 

in a richly furnished chamber overlooking the street a dim light was burning so dimly in fact that the emaciated form of mr stevens was scarcely discernible amidst the pillows and covering of the bed on which he was lying

above him a brass head of curious workmanship held in its clenched teeth the canopy that overshadowed the bed and as the light occasionally flickered and brightened the curiously carved face seemed to light up with a sort of sardonic grin and the grating of the curtainrings as the sick man tossed from side to side in his bed would have suggested the idea that the odd supporter of the canopy was gnashing his brazen teeth at him

on the wall immediately opposite the light hung a portrait of mrs stevens not the sharp hard face we once introduced to the reader but a smoother softer countenance âyet a worn and melancholy one in its expression it looked as if the waves of grief had beaten upon it for along succession of years until they had tempered down its harsher peculiarities giving a subdued appearance to the whole countenance

 there is twelve oclockâgive me my drops again lizzie

he remarked faintly at the sound of his voice lizzie emerged from behind the curtains and essayed to pour into a glass the proper quantity of medicine she was twice obliged to pour back into the phial what she had just emptied forth as the trembling of her hands caused her each time to drop too much at last having succeeded in getting the exact number of drops she handed him the glass the contents of which he eagerly drank

there said he thank you now perhaps i may sleep i have not slept for two nightsâsuch has been my anxiety about that man nor you either my childâi have kept you awake also you can sleep though without drops

tomorrow when you are prepared to start wake me if i am asleep and let me speak to you before you go remember lizzie frighten him if you can  tell him i am ill myselfâthat i cant survive this continued worriment and annoyance tell him moreover i am not made of gold and will not be always giving i dont believe he is sickâdying âdo you   he asked looking into her face as though he did not anticipate an affirmative answer

no father i dont think he is really ill i imagine it is another subterfuge to extract money dont distress yourself unnecessarily  perhaps i may have some influence with him âi had before you know  

 yes yes dear you managed him very well that timeâ very well said he stroking down her hair affectionately  i âiâmy child i could never have told you of that dreadful secret but when i found that you knew it all my heart experienced a sensible relief it was a selfish pleasure i know yet it eased me to share my secret the burden is not half so heavy now

 father would not your mind be easier still if you could be persuaded to make restitution to his children this wealth is valueless to us both you can never ask forgiveness for the sin whilst you cling thus tenaciously to its fruits

tut tutâno more of that  said he impatiently i cannot do it without betraying myself if i gave it back to them what would become of you and george and how am i to stop the clamours of that cormorant no no  it is useless to talk of itâi cannot do it 

 there would be still enough left for george after restoring them their own and you might give this man my share of what is left i would rather work day and night said she determinedly  than ever touch a penny of the money thus accumulated

 ive thought all that over long ago but i dare not do itâ it might cause inquiries to be made that might result to my disadvantage no i cannot do that sit down and let us be quiet now

mr stevens lay back upon his pillow and for a moment seemed to doze then starting up again suddenly he asked  have you told george about it  have you ever confided anything to him  

no papa answered she soothingly not a breath ive been secret as the grave

 thats right  rejoined heâ that is right i love george but not as i do you he only comes to me when he wants money he is not like you darlingâyou take care of and nurse your poor old father has he come in yet 

 not yet he never gets home until almost morning and is then often fearfully intoxicated

the old man shook his head and muttered  the sins of the fathers shallâwhat is that did you hear that noise â hush 

lizzie stood quietly by him for a short while and then walked on tiptoe to the doorâit is george said she after peering into the gloom of their entry  he has admitted him self with his nightkey

the shuffling sound of footsteps was now quite audible upon the stairway and soon the bloated face of mr stevenss hopeful son was seen at the chamber door in society and places where this young gentleman desired to maintain a respectable character he could be as well behaved as choice in his language and as courteous as anybody  but at home where he was well known and where he did not care to place himself under any restraint he was a very different individual

 let me in liz said he in a thick voice  i want the old man to fork over some moneyâim cleaned out

 no noâgo to bed george she answered coaxingly  and talk to him about it in the morning

 im coming in now said he determinedly  and besides i want to tell you something about that nigger garie

 tell us in the morning persisted lizzy

noâim going to tell you now rejoined he forcing his way into the room â its too good to keep till morning

pick up that wick let a fellow see if you are all alive 

lizzie raised the wick of the lamp in accordance with his desire and then sat down with an expression of annoyance and vexation on her countenance

george threw himself into an easy chair and began  i saw that white nigger garie tonight he was in company with a gentleman at thatâthe assurance of that fellow is perfectly incomprehensible he was drinking at the bar of the hotel and as it is no secret why he and miss bates parted i enlightened the company on the subject of his antecedents

he threatened to challenge me ho hoâfight with a niggerâthat is too good a joke and laughing heartily the young ruffian leant back in his chair i want some money tomorrow dad continued he  i say old gentleman wasnt it a lucky go that darkeys father was put out of the way so nicely ehâweve been living in clover ever sinceâhavent we

 how dare you address mein that disrespectful manner 

go out of the room sir  exclaimed mr stevens with a disturbed countenance

 come george go to bed urged his sister wearily

 let father sleepâit is after twelve oclock i am going to wake the nurse and then retire myself

george rose stupidly from his chair and followed his sister from the room on the stairway he grasped her arm rudely and said  i dont understand how it is that you and the old man are so cursed thick all of a sudden you are thick as two thieves always whispering and talking together act fair lizâdont persuade him to leave you all the money

if you do well quarrelâthats flat dont try and cozen him out of my share as well as your ownâyou hear 

 oh george  rejoined she reproachfullyâ i never had such an idea  then what are you so much together for  why is there so much whispering and writing and going off on journeys all alone  what does it all mean eh  

it means nothing at all george you are not yourself tonight said he evasively   you had better go to bed

it is you that are not yourself he retorted what makes you look so pale and worriedâand why do you and the old man start if the door cracks as if the devil was after you  what is the meaning of that   asked he with a drunken leer  you had better look out concluded he  im watching you both and will find out all your secrets byandby

 learn all our secrets  ah my brother  thought she as he disappeared into his room  you need not desire to have their fearful weight upon you or you will soon grow as anxious thin and pale as i am

the next day at noon lizzie started on her journey after a short conference with her father

night had settled upon her native city when she was driven through its straight and seemingly interminable thoroughfares the long straight rows of lamps the snowy steps the scrupulously clean streets the signs over the stores were like the faces of old acquaintances and at any other time would have caused agreeable recollections  but the object of her visit preoccupied her mind to the exclusion of any other and more pleasant associations

she ordered the coachman to take her to an obscure hotel and after having engaged a room she left her baggage and started in search of the residence of mc closkey

she drew her veil down over her face very closely and âwalked quickly through the familiar streets until she arrived at the place indicated in his letter it was a small mean tenement in a by street in which there were but one or two other houses the shutters were closed from the upper story to the lowest and the whole place wore an uninhabited appearance after knocking several times she was about to give up in despair when she discovered through the glass above the door the faint glimmer of a light and shortly after a female voice demanded from the inside  who is there  

 does mr mc closkey live here   asked lizzie

hearing a voice not more formidable than her own the person within partially opened the door and whilst shading with one hand the candle she held in the other gazed out upon the speaker

 does mr mc closkey live here   repeated lizzie

 yes he does answered the woman in a weak voice  but hes got the typers

 has the what   inquired lizzie who did not exactly understand her

 got the typersâgot the fever you know

 the typhus fever  said lizzie with a start  then be is really sick

 really sick  repeated the womanâ really sick  well i should think he was why hes been a raving and swearing awful for days he stormed and screamed so loud that the neighbours complained law they had to even shave his head

is he any better asked lizzie with a sinking heart

 can i see him  

 raps you can if you go to the hospital tomorrow but whether youll find him living or dead is more than i can say

i couldnt keep him hereâi wasnt able to stand him ive had the fever myselfâhe took it from me you must come in continued the woman  if you want to talkâim afraid of catching cold and cant stand at the door maybe youre afraid of the fever she further observed as she saw lizzie esitate on the doorstep

 oh no im not afraid of that answered lizzie quickly âi am not in the least afraid

 come in then reiterated the woman and ill tell you all about it

the woman looked harmless enough and lizzie hesitated no longer but followed her through the entry into a decently furnished room setting the candlestick upon the mantelpiece she offered her visitor a chair and then continuedâ  he came home this last time in an awful state before he left some one sent him a load of money and he did nothing but drink and gamble whilst it lasted i used to tell him that he ought to take care of his money and hed snap his fingers and laugh he used to say that he owned the goose that laid the golden eggs and could have money whenever he wanted it well as i was a saying he went and when he came back he had an awful attack of delirium tremens and then he took the typers oh laws mercy   continued she holding up her bony hands  how that critter raved  he talked about killing people

 he did   interrupted lizzie with a gesture of alarm and laying her hand upon her heart which beat fearfullyâ did he mention any name 

the woman did not stop to answer this question but proceeded as if she had not been interrupted  he was always going on about two orphans and a will and he used to curse and swear awfully about being obliged to keep something hid

it was dreadful to listen toâit would almost make your hair stand on end to hear him

 and he never mentioned names   said lizzie inquiringly

 no that was so strange he never mentioned no names âânever he used to rave a great deal about two orphans and a will and he would ransack the bed and pull up the sheets and look under the pillows as if he thought it was there oh he acted very strange but never mentioned no names

i used to think he had something in his trunk he was so very bpecial about it he was better the day they took him off and the trunk went with himâhe would have it but since then hes had a dreadful relapse and theres no knowin whether he is alive or dead

 i must go to the hospital said lizzie rising from her seat and greatly relieved to learn that nothing of importance had fallen from mc closkey during his delirium  i shall go there as quickly as i can she observed walking to the door

 youll not see him tonight if you do rejoined the woman  are you a relation  

 oh no answered lizzie  my father is an acquaintance of his i learned that he was ill and came to inquire after him

had the woman not been very indifferent or unobservant she would have noticed the striking difference between the manner and appearance of lizzie stevens and the class who generally came to see mc closkey she did not however appear to observe it nor did she manifest any curiosity greater than that evidenced by her inquiring if he was a relative

lizzie walked with a lonely feeling through the quiet streets until she arrived at the porters lodge of the hospital

she pulled the bell with trembling hands and the door was opened by the little baldheaded man whose loquacity was once the reader will remember so painful to mrs ellis

there was no perceptible change in his appearance and he manifestly took as warm an interest in frightful accidents as ever  what is itâwhat is it   he asked eagerly as lizzies pale face became visible in the bright light that shone from the inner office  do you want a stretcher  

the rapidity with which he asked these questions and his eager manner quite startled her and she was for a moment unable to tell her errand

 speak up girlâspeak up  do you want a stretcherâis it burnt or run over cant you speak eh  

it now flashed upon lizzie that the venerable janitor was labouring under the impression that she bad come to make application for the admission of a patient and she quicklyansweredâ  oh no  it is nothing of the kind i am glad to say

 glad to say muttered the old man the eager expectant look disappearing from his face giving place to one of disappointmentâ glad to say  why there hasnt been an accident today and here youve gone and rung the bell and brought me here to the door for nothing what do you want then  

 i wish to inquire after a person who is here

whats his number   gruffly inquired he

 that i cannot tell answered she  his name is mc closkey

 i dont know anything about him couldnt tell who he is unless i go all over the books tonight we dont knowpeople by their names here  come in the morningâten oclock and dont never ring that bell again concluded he sharply unless you want a stretcher ringing the bell and no accident and grumbling at being disturbed for nothing he abruptly closed the door in lizzies face

anxious and discomfited she wandered back to her hotel and after drinking a weak cup of tea locked her roomdoor and retired to bed there she lay tossing from side to side âshe could not sleepâher anxiety respecting her fathers safety her fears lest in the delirium of fever mc closkey should discover their secret kept her awake far into the night and the city clocks struck two ere she fell asleep

when she awoke in the morning the sun was shining brightly into her room  for a few moments she could not realize where she was but the events of the past night soon came freshly to her looking at her watch she remembered that she was to go to the hospital at ten and it was already halfpast nine her wakefulness the previous night having caused her to sleep much later than her usual hour

dressing herself in haste she hurried down to breakfast and after having eaten a slight meal ordered a carriage and drove to the hospital

the janitor was in his accustomed seat and nodded smilingly to her as she entered he beckoned her to him and whispered  i inquired about him mc closkey feverward no  died this morning at two oclock and forty minutes

 dead   echoed lizzie with a start of horror

 yes dead repeated he with a complacent look   any relation of yoursâwant an order for the body  

lizzie was so astounded by this intelligence that she could not reply  and the old man continued mysteriously  came to before he diedâwish he hadntâput me to a deal of troubleâsent for a magistrateâthen for a ministerâhad something on his mindâcouldnt die without telling it you know then there was oaths depositionsâso much trouble

are you his relationâwant an order for the body  

oaths magistrateâa confession no doubt thought lizzie her limbs trembled  she was so overcome with terror that she could scarcely stand clinging to the railing of the desk by which she was standing for support she asked hesitatingly  he had something to confess then  

the janitor looked at her for a few moments attentively and seemed to notice for the first time her ladylike appearance and manners a sort of reserve crept over him at the conclusion of his scrutiny for he made no answer to her question but simply asked with more formality than before  are you a relationâdo you want an order for the body  

ere lizzie could answer his question a man plainly dressed with keen grey eyes that seemed to look restlessly about in every corner of the room came and stood beside the janitor

he looked at lizzie from the bow on the top of her bonnet to the shoes on her feet it was not a stare it was more a hasty glanceâand yet she could not help feeling that he knew every item of her dress and could have described her exactly

 are you a relative of this person he asked in a clear sharp voice whilst his keen eyes seemed to be piercing her through in search of the truth

no sir she answered faintly

a friend then i presume continued he respectfully

 an acquaintance returned she the man paused for a few moments then taking out his watch looked at the time and hastened from the office

this man possessed lizzie with a singular feeling of dreadâ why she could not determine yet after he was gone she imagined those cold grey eyes were resting on her and bidding the old janitor who had grown reserved so suddenly good morning she sprang into her carriage as fast as her trembling limbs could carry her and ordered the coachman to drive back to the hotel

 father must fly  soliloquieed she  the alarm will no doubt lend him energy ive heard of people who have not been able to leave their rooms for months becoming suddenly strong under the influence of terror we must be off to some place of concealment until we can learn whether he is compromised by that wretched mans confession

lizzie quickly paid her bill packed her trunk and started for the station in hopes of catching the midday train for new york

the driver did not spare his horses but at her request drove them at their utmost speedâbut in vain she arrived there only time enough to see the train move away and there standing on the platform looking at her with a sort of triumphant satisfaction was the man with the keen grey eyes

 stop stop   cried she

 too late miss said a bystander sympathizingly   jusf too lateâno other train for three hours

 three hours   said lizzie despairingly  three hours

yet i must be patientâthere is no remedy and she endeavoured to banish her fears and occupy herself in reading the advertisements that were posted up about the station it was of no avail that keenlooking man with his piercing grey eyes haunted her and she could not avoid associating him in her thoughts with her father and mccioskey what was he doing on the train and why did he regard her with that look of triumphant satisfaction

those were to her the three longest hours of her life

wearily and impatiently she paced up and down the long saloon watching the hands of the clock as they appeared to almost creep over the dialplate twenty times during those three hours did she compare the clock with her watch and found they moved on unvaryingly together

at last the hour for the departure of the train arrived  and seated in the car she was soon flying at express speed on the way towards her home  how much sooner does the other train arrive than we   she asked of the conductor

two hours and a half miss replied he courteously  we gain a halfhour upon them

a halfhourâthat is something gained thought she  i may reach my father before that man can he be what i suspect  

on they wentâthirtyâfortyâfifty miles an hour yet she thought it slow dashing by villages through meadows over bridgesârattling screaming puffing on their way to the city of hew york in due time they arrived at the ferry and after crossing the river were in the city itself

lizzie took the first carriage that came to hand and was soon going briskly through the streets towards her fathers house the nearer she approached it the greater grew her fears a horrible presentiment that something awful had occurred grew stronger and stronger as she drew nearer home she tried to brave it offâresist itâcrush itâbut it came back upon her each time with redoubled force

on she went nearer and nearer every moment until at last she was in the avenue itself she gazed eagerly from the carriage and thought she observed one or two persons run across the street opposite her fathers house it could not beâshe looked againâyes there was a group beneath his window  faster faster  she cried frantically  faster if you can the door was at last reached she sprang from the carriage and pressed through the little knot of people who were gathered on the pavement alas her presentiments were correct there lying on the pavement was the mangled form of her father who had desperately sprung from the balcony above to escape arrest from the man with the keen grey eyes who with the warrant in his hand stood contemplating the lifeless body

father father cried lizzie in an anguished voice  father speak once  too late too late the spirit had passed awayâthe murderer had rushed before a higher tribunalâa mightier judgeâinto the presence of one who tempers justice with mercy

the night that lizzie stevens arrived in philadelphia was the one decided upon for the marriage of emily garie and charles ellis and whilst she was wandering so lonely through the streets of one part of the city a scene of mirth and gaiety was transpiring in another some of the actors in which would be made more happy by events that would be productive of great sorrow to her

throughout that day bustle and confusion had reigned supreme in the house of mr walters caddy who had been there since the break of day had taken the domestic reins entirely from the hands of the mistress of the mansion and usurped command herself quiet esther was well satisfied to yield her full control of the domestic arrangements for the festivities and caddy was nothing loath to assume them

she entered upon the discharge of her selfimposed duties with such ardour as to leave no doubt upon the minds of the parties most interested but that they would be thoroughly performed and with an alacrity too that positively appalled quiet esthers easygoing servants

great doubts had been expressed as to whether caddy could successfully sustain the combined characters of chef de cuisine and bridesmaid and a failure had been prophesied

she therefore felt it incumbent upon her to prove these prognostications unfounded and demonstrate the practicability of the undertaking on the whole she went to work with energy and seemed determined to establish the fact that her abilities were greatly underrated and that a woman could accomplish more than one thing at a time when she set about it

the feelings of all such persons about the establishment of mr walters as were  constitutionally tired received that day divers serious shocks at the hands of miss caddyâwho seemed endowed with a singular faculty which enabled her to discover just what people did not want to do and of setting them at it immediately

for instance jane the fat girl hated going upstairs excessively caddy employed her in bringing down glass and china from a thirdstory pantry  and moreover only permitted her to bring a small quantity at a time which rendered a number of trips strictly necessary to the great aggravation and serious discomfort of the fat girl in question

on the other hand julia the slim chambermaid who would have been delighted with such employment and who would have undoubtedly refreshed herself on each excursion upstairs with a lengthened gaze from the window was condemned to the polishing of silver and dusting of plates and glass in an obscure back pantry which contained but one window and that commanding a prospect of a dead wall

miss caddy felt in duty bound to inspect each cake look over the wine and to the great discomfiture of the waiter decant it herself not liking to expose him to any unnecessary temptation she felt too all the more inclined to assume the office of butler from the fact that at a previous party of her sisters she had detected this same gentleman with a bottle of the best sherry at his mouth whilst he held his head thrown back in a most surprising manner with a view no doubt of contemplating the ceiling more effectually from that position

before night such was the increasing demand for help in the kitchen that caddy even kidnapped the nurse and locked the brown baby and her sister in the bathroom where there was no window in their reach nor any other means at hand from which the slightest injury could result to them here they were supplied with a tub half filled with water and spent the time most delightfully in mating boats of their shoes and lading them with small pieces of soap which they bit off from the cake for the occasion  then coasting along to the small towns on the borders of the tub they disposed of their cargoes to imaginary customers to immense advantage

walters had declared the house uninhabitable and had gone out for the day esther and emily busied themselves in arranging the flowers in the drawingroom and hall and hanging amidst the plants on the balcony little stained glass lamps  all of which caddy thought very well in its way but which she was quite confident would be noticed much less by the guests than the supperâin which supposition she was undoubtedly correct

finch also lounged in two or three times during the day to seek consolation at the hands of esther and emily he was in deep distress of mindâin great perturbation his tailor had promised to send home a vest the evening previous and had not fulfilled his agreement after his first visit finch entered the house in the most stealthy manner for fear of being encountered by caddy who having met him in the hall during the morning posted him off for twenty pounds of sugar a ball of twine and a stone jar despite his declaration of preengagements haste and limited knowledge of the articles in question

whilst lizzie stevens was tremblingly ringing the bell at the lodge of the hospital busy hands were also pulling at that of mr walterss dwelling carriage after carriage rolled up and deposited their loads of gay company who skipped nimbly over the carpet that was laid down from the door to the curbstone through the wide hall and up the stairway flowers of various kinds mingled their fragrance and loaded the air with their rich perfume and expressions of delight burst from the lips of the guests as they passed up the brilliantlylighted stairway and thronged the spacious drawingrooms

there were but few whites amongst them and they particular friends there was mrs bird who had travelled from warmouth to be present at the ceremony  mr balch the friend and legal adviser of the brides father father banks who was to tie the happy knot and there too was mrs

burrell and that baby now grown to a promising lad and who would come to the wedding because charlie had sent him a regular invitation written like that sent his p arents

mr and mrs ellis were of course thereâthe latter arrayed in a rich new silk made up expressly for the occasionâ and the former almost hidden in his large easy chair the poor old gentleman scarcely seemed able to comprehend the affair and apparently laboured under the impression that it was another mob and looked a little terrified at times when the laughter or conversation grew louder than usual

the hour for the ceremony was fast approaching and esther left the assembled guests and went up into emily garies room to assist the young ladies in preparing the bride they all besought her to be calm not to agitate herself upon any consideration  and then bustled about her and flurried themselves in the most ridiculous manner with a view no doubt of tranquillizing her feelings more effectually

 little em soon to be mrs ellis was busily engaged in dressing  the toilettable was covered with lighted candles and all the gasburners in the room were in full blaze bringing everything out in bold relief

we are having quite an illumination the glare almost blinds me said emily  put out some of the candles

no no my dear rejoined one of the young ladies engaged in dressing her  we cannot sacrifice a candle

we dont need them to discern your charms em only to enable us to discover how to deck them to the best advantage how sweet you look 

emily gazed into the mirror and from the blush that suffused her face and the look of complacency that followed it was quite evident that she shared her friends opinion

she did indeed look charming there was a deeper colour than usual on her cheeks and her eyes were illumined with a soft tender light her wavy brown hair was parted smoothly on the front and gathered into a cluster of curls at the back around her neck glistened a string of pearls a present from mr winston who had just returned from south america the pure white silk fitted to a nicety and the tiny satin slippers seemed as if they were made upon her feet and never intended to come off again her costume was complete with the exception of the veil and wreath and esther opened the box that she supposed contained them for the purpose of arranging them on the bride

 where have you put the veil my dear she asked after raising the lid of the box and discovering that they were not there

 in the box are they not   answered one of the young ladies

 no they are not there continued esther as she turned over the various articles with which the tables were strewed all in vain the veil and wreath could be nowhere discovered

 are yon sure it came home   asked one

 of course replied another  i had it in my hand an hour ago

then a thorough search was commenced all the drawers ransacked and everything turned over again and again  and just when they were about to abandon the search in despair one of the party returned from the adjoining room dragging along the brown baby who had the veil wrapped about her chubby shoulders as a scarf and the wreath ornamenting her round curly head even goodnatured esther was a little ruffled at this daring act of babys and hastily divested that young lady of her borrowed adornments amidst the laughter of the group

poor baby was quite astonished at the precipitate manner in which she was deprived of her finery and was for a few moments quite overpowered by her loss but perceiving a drawer open in the toilettable she dried her eyes and turned her attention in that direction and in tossing its contents upon the floor amply solaced herself for the deprivation she had just undergone

 caddy is a famous chief bridesmaidâhasnt been here to give the least assistance observed esther   she is not even dressed herself i will ring and ask where she can beâin the kitchen or supperroom ive no doubt where is miss ellis   she asked of the servant who came in answer her summons

 downstairs memâthe boy that brought the icecream kicked over a candy ornament and miss ellis was very busy a shaking of him when i came up

 do beg her to stop rejoined esther with a laugh  and tell her i say she can shake him in the morningâwe are waiting for her to dress now and also tell mr de younge to come here to the doorâi want him

kinch soon made his appearance in accordance with

esthers request and fairly dazzled her with his costume

his blue coat was brazen with buttons and his white cravat tied with choking exactness  spotless vest black pants and such patent leathers as you could have seen your face in with ease

 how fine you look kinch said esther admiringly

 yes he answered   the new vest came homeâhow do you like it  

 oh admirable but kinch cant you go down and implore caddy to come up and dressâtime is slipping away very fast    oh i darent answered kinch with a look of alarmâ  i dont dare to go down now that im dressed shell want me to carry something up to the supperroom if i doâa pile of dishes or something of the kind id like to oblige you mrs walters but its worth my new buit to do it

under these circumstances kinch was excused and a deputation headed by mrwalters was sent into the lower regions to wait upon caddy who prevailed upon her to come up and dress which she did being all the while very red in the face and highly indignant at being sent for so often

 good gracious  she exclaimed  what a pucker you are all in

 why caddy its time to be replied estherâ it wants eight minutes of the hour

and that is just three minutes more than i should want for dressing if i was going to be married myself rejoined she and hastening away she returned in an incredibly short time all prepared for the ceremony

charlie was very handsomely got up for the occasion

emily esther caddyâin fact all of themâagreed that he never looked better in his life  that is owing to meâall my doings said kinch exultingly  he wanted to order his suit of old forbes who hasnt looked at a fashionplate for the last ten years and i wouldnt let him i took him to my man and see what he has made of himâturned him out looking like a bridegroom instead of an old man of fifty its all owing to me said the delighted kinch who skipped about the entry until he upset a a vase of flowers that stood on a bracket behind him whereupon caddy ran and brought a towel and made him take off his white gloves and wipe up the water in spite of his protestations that the shape of his pantaloons would not bear the strain of stooping

at last the hour arrived and the bridal party descended to the drawingroom in appropriate order and stood up before father banks the ceremony was soon over and emily was clasped in mrs elliss arms who called her daughter and kissed her cheek with such warm affection that she no longer felt herself an orphan and paid back with tears and embraces the endearments that were lavished upon her by her new relatives

father banks took an early opportunity to give them each some good advice and managed to draw them apart for that purpose he told them how imperfect and faulty were all mankindâthat married life was not all couleur de roseâthat the trials and cares incident to matrimony fully equalled its pleasures and besought them to bear with each other patiently to be charitable to each others faultsâand a reasonable share of earthly happiness must be the result

then came the supper oh such a supperâbuch quantities of nice things as money and skill alone can bring together there were turkeys innocent of a bone into which you might plunge your knife to the very hilt without coming in contact with a splinterâturkeys from which cunning cooks had extracted every bone leaving the meat alone behind with the skin not perceptibly broken how brown and tempting they looked their capacious bosoms giving rich promise of highseasoned dressing within and looking larger by comparison with the tiny reedbirds beside them which lay cosily on the golden toast looking as much as to say if you want something to remember for ever come and give me a bite

then there were dishes of stewed terrapin into which the initiated dipped at once and to which they for some time gave their undivided attention oblivious apparently of the fact that there was a dish of chickensalad close beside them

then there were oysters in every varietyâsilver dishes containing them stewed their fragrant macey odour wafting itself upward and causing watery sensations about the mouth

waiters were constantly rushing into the room bringing dishes of them fried so richly brown so smoking hot that no man with a heart in his bosom could possibly refuse them

then there were glass dishes of them pickled with little black spots of allspice floating on the pearly liquid that contained them and lastly oysters broiled whose delicious flavour exceeds my powers of descriptionâthese with ham and tongue were the solid comforts there were other things however to which one could turn when the appetite grew more dainty there were jellies blancmange chocolate cream biscuit glace peach ice vanilla ice orangewater ice brandy peaches preserved strawberries and pines not to say a word of towers of candy bonbons kisses champagne rhine wine sparkling catawba liquors and a man in the corner making sherry cobblers of wondrous flavour under the especial supervision of kinch on the whole it was an american supper got up regardless of expenseâand whoever has been to such an entertainment knows very well what an american supper is

what a merry happy party it wasâhow they all seemed to enjoy themselvesâand how they all laughed when the bride essayed to cut the cake and could not get the knife through the icingâand bow the young girls put pieces away privately that they might place them under their pillows to dream upon  what a happy time they had i father banks enjoyed himself amazingly  he eat quantities of stewed terrapin and declared it the best he ever tasted

he talked gravely to the old peopleâcheerfully and amusingly to the young and was in fact having a most delightful timeâwhen a servant whispered to him that there was a person in the entry who wished to see him immediately

 oh dear  he exclaimed to mr balch  i was just congratulating myself that i should have one uninterrupted evening and you see the resultâcalled off at this late hour

father banks followed the servant from the room and inquired of the messenger what was wanted

you must come to the hospital immediately sir the man with the typhusfeverâyou saw him yesterdayâhes dying  he says he must see youâthat he has something important to confess im to go for a magistrate as well

ah said father banks you need go no further alderman balch is hereâhe is quite competent to receive his depositions

 im heartily glad of it replied the man  it will save me another hunt i had a hard time finding you ive been to your house and two or three other places and was at last sent here ill go back and report that you are coming and will bring a magistrate with you

 yery good rejoined father banks  do so i will bo there immediately hastening back to the supper room he discovered mr balch in the act of helping himself to a brandy peach and apprised him of the demand for his services

 now banks said he goodhumouredly  that is outrageous why did you not let him go for some one else 

it is too bad to drag me away just when the fun is about to commence there was no alternative however and mr

balch prepared to follow the minister to the bedside of mc closkey

when they arrived at the hospital they found him fast sinkingâthe livid colour of his face the sunken glassy eyes the white lips and the blue tint that surrounded the eyes and mouth told at once the fearful story death had come

he was in full possession of his faculties and told them all

how stevens had saved him from the gallowsâand how he agreed to murder mr garieâof his failure when the time of action arrived and how in consequence stevens had committed the deed and how he had paid him time after time to keep his secret

in my trunk there said he in a dying whisperâin my trunk is the will i found it that night amongst his papers

i kept it to get money out of his children with when old stevens was gone here continued he handing his key from beneath the pillow  open my trunk and get it

mr balch eagerly unlocked the trunk and there sure enough lay the longsoughtfor and important document

i knew it would be found at last i always told walters so j and now said he exultingly  see my predictions are verified

mc closkey seemed anxious to atone for the past by making an ample confession he told them all he knew of mr stevenss present circumstancesâhow his property was situated and every detail necessary for their guidance

then his confession was sworn to and witnessed and the dying man addressed himself to the affairs of the next world and endeavoured to banish entirely from his mind all thoughts of this

after a life passed in the exercise of every christian virtue âafter a lengthened journey over its narrow stony pathway whereon temptations have been met and triumphed overâ where we have struggled with difficulties and borne afflictions without murmur or complaint cheering on the weary we have found sinking by the wayside comforting and assisting the fallen endeavouring humbly and faithfully to do our duty to god and humanity â even after a life thus passed when we at last lie down to die the most faithful and best may well shrink and tremble when they approach the gloomy portals of death at such an hour memory more active than every other faculty drags all the good and evil from the past and sets them in distinct array before us then we discover how greatly the latter exceeds the former in our lives and how little of our fathers work we have accomplished after all our toils and struggles tis then the most devoted servant of our common master feels compelled to cry  mercy  o my father âfor justice i dare not ask

if thus the christian passes awayâwhat terror must fill the breast of one whose whole life has been a constant warfare upon the laws of god and man  how approaches he the bar of that awful judge whose commands he has set at nought and whose power he has so often contemned with a fainting heart and tongue powerless to crave the mercy his crimes cannot deserve

mc closkey struggled long with deathâdied fearfully hard

the phantoms of his victims seemed to haunt him in his dying hour interposing between him and god  and with distorted face clenched hands and gnashing teeth he passed away to his long account

from the bedside of the corpse mr balch wentâlate as it wasâto the office of the chief of police there he learned to his great satisfaction that the governor was in town  and at an early hour the next morning he procured a requisition for the arrest of mr stevens which he put into the hands of the man with the keen grey eyes for the purpose of securing the criminal and with the result of his efforts the reader is already acquainted

 with such celerity did mr balch work in behalf of his wards that he soon had everything in train for the recovery of the property

at first george stevens was inclined to oppose the execution of the will but he was finally prevailed upon by his advisers to make no difficulty respecting it and quietly resign what he must inevitably sooner or later relinquish lizzie stevens on the contrary seemed rather glad that an opportunity was afforded to do justice to her old playmates and won the good opinion of all parties by her gentleness and evident anxiety to atone for the wrong done them by her father even after the demands of the executors of mr

garie were fully satisfied such had been the thrift of her father that there still remained a comfortable support for her and her brother

to poor clarence this accession of fortune brought no new pleasure he already had sufficient for his modest wants  and now that his greatest hope in life had been blighted this addition of wealth became to him rather a burden than a pleasure

he was now completely excluded from the society in which he had so long been accustomed to move the secret of his birth had become widely known and he was avoided by his former friends and sneered at as a  nigger his large fortune kept some two or three whites about him but he knew they were leeches seeking to bleed his purse and he wisely avoided their society

he was very wretched and lonely he felt ashamed to seek the society of coloured men now that the whites despised and rejected him so he lived apart from both classes of society and grew moody and misanthropic

mr balch endeavoured to persuade him to go abroadâto visit europe he would not he did not confess it but the truth was he could not tear himself away from the city where little birdie dwelt where he now and then could catch a glimpse of her to solace him in his loneliness he was growing paler and more fragilelooking each day and the doctor at last frankly told him that if he desired to live he must seek borne warmer climate for the winter

reluctantly clarence obeyed in the fall he left new york and during the cold months wandered through the west india islands for a while his health improved but when the novelty produced by change of scene began to decline he grew worse again and brooded more deeply than ever over his bitter disappointment and consequently derived but little benefit from the change the spirit was too much broken for the body to mendâhis heart was too sore to beat healthily or happily

he wrote often now to emily and her husband and seemed desirous to atone for his past neglect emily had written to him first she had learned of his disappointment and gave him a sisters sympathy in his loneliness and sorrow

the chilly month of march had scarcely passed away when they received a letter from him informing them of his intention to return he wrote  i am no better and my physician says that a longer residence here will not benefit me in the leastâthat i came too late i cough cough cough incessantly and each day become more feeble i am coming home emmy coming home i fear to die i am but a ghost of my former self i write you this that you may not be alarmed when you see me it is too late now to repine but oh em if my lot had only been cast with yoursâ had we never been separatedâi might have been today as happy as you are

it was a clear bright morning when charlie stepped into a boat to be conveyed to the ship in which clarence had returned to new york she had arrived the evening previous and had not yet come up to the dock the air came up the bay fresh and invigorating from the sea beyond and the water sparkled as it dripped from the oars which with monotonous regularity broke the almost unruffled surface of the bay some of the ships sails were shaken out to dry in the morning sun and the cordage hung loosely and carelessly from the masts and yards a few sailors lounged idly about the deck and leaned over the side to watch the boat as it approached with their aid it was soon secured alongside and charlie clambered up the ladder and stood upon the deck of the vessel on inquiring for clarence he was shown into the cabin where he found him extended on a sofa

he raised himself as he saw charlie approach and extending his hand exclaimedâ how kind  i did not expect you until we reached the shore

for a moment charlie could not speak the shock caused by clarences altered appearance was too greatâthe change was terrible when he had last seen him he was vigorouslooking erect and healthful now he was bent and emaciated to a frightful extent the veins on his temples were clearly discernible the muscles of his throat seemed like great cords his cheeks were hollow his sunken eyes were glassy bright and surrounded with a dark rim and his breathing was short and evidently painful charlie held his thin fleshless hand in his own and gazed in his face with an anguished expression

 i look badlyâdont i charlie   said he with assumed indifference   worse than you expected eh  

charlie hesitated a little and then answeredâfather bad  but it is owing to your seasickness i suppose that has probably reduced you considerably then this close cabin must be most unfavourable to your health ah wait until we get you home we shall soon have you better

home  repeated clarenceâ home how delightful that word sounds  i feel it is going home to go to you and em ana he leant back and repeated the word  home

and paused afterward as one touches some favourite note upon an instrument and then silently listens to its vibrations  how is em  he asked at length

 oh wellâvery well replied charlie  she has been busy as a bee ever since she received your last letter such a charming room as she has prepared for you 

 ah charlie rejoined clarence mournfully  i shall not live long to enjoy it i fear

nonsense  interrupted charlie hopefully  dont be so desponding clary here is spring againâeverything is thriving and bursting into new life you too will catch the spirit of the season and grow in health and strength again

why my dear fellow continued he cheerfully  you cant help getting better when we once get hold of you mothers gruels doctor burdetts prescriptions and ems nursing would lift a man out of his coffin come now dont let us hear anything more about dying

clarence pressed his hand and looked at him affectionately as though he appreciated his efforts to cheer him and felt thankful for them  but he only shook his head and smiled mournfully

 let me help your man to get you up when once you get ashore youll feel better ive no doubt we are not going to an hotel but to the house of a friend who has kindly offered to make you comfortable until you are able to travel

with the assistance of charlie and the servant clarence was gradually prepared to go ashore he was exceedingly weak could scarcely totter across the deck  and it was with some difficulty that they at last succeeded in placing him safely in the boat after they landed a carriage was soon procured and in a short time thereafter clarence was comfortably established in the house of charlies friend

their hostess a dear old motherly creature declared that she knew exactly what clarence needed  and concocted such delicious broths made such strengthening gruels that clarence could not avoid eating and in a day or two he declared himself better than he had been for a month and felt quite equal to the journey to philadelphia

the last night of their stay in new york was unusually warm and clarence informed charlie he wished to go out for a walk  i wish to go a long distanceâdont think me foolish when i tell you where i want to look at the house where little birdie lives it may be for the last time i have a presentiment that i shall see her if i goâi am sure i shall added he positively as though he felt a conviction that his desire would be accomplished

 i would not clary remonstrated charlie  your health wont permit the exertion it is a long distance too you say and moreover dont you think my dear fellow that it is far more prudent to endeavour if possible to banish her from your mind entirely dont permit yourself to think about her if you can help it you know she is unattainable by you and you should make an effort to conquer your attachment

 it is too lateâtoo late now charlie he replied mournfully  i shall continue to love her as i do now until i draw my last breath i know it is hopelessâi know she can never be more to me than she already is  but i cannot help loving her let us go i may see her once again ah charlie you cannot even dream what inexpressible pleasure the merest glimpse of her affords me  come let us go

charlie would not permit him to attempt to walk and they procured a carriage in which they rode to within a short distance of the house the mansion of mr bates appeared quite gloomy as they approached it the blinds were down and no lights visible in any part of the house

i am afraid they are out of town remarked charlie when clarence pointed out the house   everything looks so dull about it let us cross over to the other pavement

and they walked over to the other side of the street and gazed upward at the house

let us sit down here suggested clarenceâhere on this broad stone  it is quite dark now and no one will observe us

no no i  remonstrated charlie   the stone is too damp and cold

is it said clarence vacantly and taking out his handkerchief he spread it out and in spite of charlies dissuasions sat down upon it

charlie said he after gazing at the house a long time in silence i have often come here and remained half the night looking at her windows people have passed by and stared at me as though they thought me crazy  i was half crazy then i think one night i remember i came and sat here for hours far in the night i saw her come to the window throw up the casement and look out

that was in the summer before i went away you know

there she stood in the moonlight gazing upward at the sky so pale so calm and holylooking in her pure white dress that i should not have thought it strange if the heavens had opened and angels descended and borne her away with them on their wings and clarence closed his eyes as he concluded to call back upon the mirror of his mind the image of little birdie as she appeared that night

they waited a long while during which there was no evidence exhibited that there was any one in the house at last just as they were about to move away they descried the glimmer of a light in the room which clarence declared to be her room his frame trembled with expectation and he walked to and fro opposite the house with an apparent strength that surprised his companion at length the light disappeared again and with it clarences hopes

 now then we must go said charlie  it is useless for you to expose yourself in this manner i insist upon your coming home

reluctantly clarence permitted himself to be led across the street again as they were leaving the pavement he turned to look back again and uttering a cry of surprise and joy he startled charlie by clutching his arm

 look  look   he cried  there she isâmy little birdie charlie looked up at the window almost immediately above them and observed a slight pale girl who was gazing up the street in an opposite direction

 little birdieâlittle birdie whispered clarence tenderly she did not look toward them but after standing there a few seconds moved from between the curtains and disappeared

 thank god for that  exclaimed clarence passionately  i knewâi knew i should see her i icneio it repeated he exultingly and then overcome with joy he bowed his head upon charlies shoulder and wept like a child dont think me foolish charlie apologized he  i cannot help it i will go home now oh brother i feel so much happier

and with a step less faint and trembling he walked back to the carriage

the following evening he was at home but so enfeebled with the exertions of the last two days as to be obliged to take to his bed immediately after his arrival his sister greeted him affectionately threw her arms about his neck and kissed him tenderly j years of coldness and estrangement were forgotten in that moment and they were once more to each other as they were before they parted

emily tried to appear as though she did not notice the great change in his appearance and talked cheerfully and encouragingly in his presence  but she wept bitterly when alone over the final separation which she foresaw was not far distant

the next day doctor burdett called and his grave manner and apparent disinclination to encourage any hope confirmed the hopeless impression they already entertained

aunt ada came from sudbury at emilys request she knew her presence would give pleasure to clarence she accordingly wrote her to come and she and emily nursed by turns the failing sufferer

esther and her husband mrs ellis and caddy and even kinch were unremitting in their attentions and did all in their power to amuse and comfort him

day by day be faded perceptibly grew more and more feeble until at last doctor burdett began to number days instead of weeks as bis term of life clarence anticipated death with calmnessâdid not repine or murmur father banks was often with him cheering him with hopes of a happier future beyond the grave

one day he sent for his sister and desired her to write a letter for him  em said he  i am failing fast these fiery spots on my cheek this scorching in my palms these harddrawn difficult breaths warn me that the time is very near dont weep em  continued he kissing herâ there dont weepâi shall be better offâhappierâi am sure 

dont weep nowâi want you to write to little birdie for me

i have tried but my hand trembles so that i cannot write legiblyâi gave it up sit down beside me here and write  here is the pen emily dried her eyes and mechanically sat down to write as he desired motioning to him that she was ready he dictatedâ  my dear little birdieâi once resolved never to write to you again and partially promised your father that i would not then i did not dream that i should be so soon compelled to break my resolution little birdie i am dying

my physician informs me that i have but a few more days to live i have been trying to break away from earths affairs and fix my thoughts on other and better things i have given up all but you and feel that i cannot relinquish you until i see you once again do not refuse me little birdie

show this to your fatherâhe must consent to a request made by one on the brink of the grave

 there that will do let me read it over said he extending his hand for the note  yes i will sign it nowâthen do you add our address send it now emilyâsend it in time for tonights mail

 clary do you think she will come   inquired his sister

 yes replied he confidently  i am sure she will if the note reaches her emily said no more hut sealed and directed the note which she immediately despatched to the postoffice and on the following day it reached little birdie

from the time when the secret of clarences birth had been discovered until the day she had received his note she never mentioned his name at the demand of her father she produced his letters miniature and even the little presents he had given her from time to time and laid them down before him without a murmur  after this even when he cursed and denounced him she only left the room never uttering a word in his defence she moved about like one who had received a stunning blowâshe was dull cold apathetic she would smile vacantly when her father smoothed her hair or kissed her cheek  but she never laughed or sang and played as in days gone by she would recline for hours on the sofa in her room gazing vacantly in the air and taking apparently no interest in anything about her she bent her head when she walked complained of coldness about her temples and kept her hand constantly upon her heart

doctors were at last consulted they pronounced her physically well and thought that time would restore her wonted animation but month after month she grew more dull and silent until her father feared she would become idiotic and grew hopeless and unhappy about her for a week before the receipt of the note from clarence she had been particularly apathetic and indifferent but it seemed to rouse her into life again she started up after reading it and rushed wildly through the hall into her fathers library

 see here  exclaimed she grasping his armâ see there âi knew it ive felt day after day that it was coming to that you separated us and now he is dyingâdying 

cried she  read itâread it 

her father took the note and after perusing it laid it on the table and said coldly  wellâ

 well  repeated she with agitationâ oh father it is not well fathersaid she hurriedly you bid me give him upâtold me he was unworthyâpointed out to me fully and clearly why we could not marry i was convinced we could not for i knew you would never let it be yet i have never ceased to love him i cannot control my heart but i could my voice and never since that day have i spoken his name i gave him upânot that i would not have gladly married knowing what he wasâbecause you desired itâ because i saw either your heart must break or mine i let mine go to please you and have suffered uncomplainingly and will so suffer until the end but i must see him once again

it will be a pleasure to him to see me once again in his dying hour and i must go if you love me continued she pleadingly as her father made a gesture of dissent let us go

you see he is dyingâbegsyou from the brink of the grave

let me go only to say good bye to him and then perhaps

concluded she pressing her hand upon her heart  i shall be better here

her father had not the heart to make any objection and the next day they started for philadelphia they despatched a note to clarence saying they had arrived which emily received and after opening it went to gently break its contents to her brother

 you must prepare yourself for visitors clary said she  no doubt some of our friends will call today the weather is so very delightful

 do you know who is coming   he inquired

 yes dear she answered seating herself beside him  i have received a note stating that a particular friend will call todayâone that you desire to see

ah  he exclaimed it is little birdie is it not  

yes she replied they have arrived in town and will be here today

 did not i tell you so   said he triumphantly  i knew she would come i knew it continued he joyfully let me get upâi am strong enoughâshe is comeâo  she has come

clarence insisted on being dressed with extraordinary care

his long fiercelooking beard was trimmed carefully and he looked much better than he had done for weeks  he was wonderfully stronger walked across the room and chatted over his breakfast with unusual animation

into the drawings them mr bates bowed politely amt expressed a hope that mr garie was better

emily held out her hand to little birdie who clasped it in both her own and said inquiringly   you are his sister 

yes answered emily you i should have known from clarences descriptionâyou are his little birdie 

she did not replyâher lip quivered and she pressed emilys hand and kissed her  he is impatient to see you

resumed emily  and if you are so disposed we will go up immediately

 i will remain here observed mr bates  unless mr

garie particularly desires to see me my daughter will accompany you

emily took the hand of little birdie in her own and they walked together up the stairway you must not be frightened at his appearance she remarked tearfully  he is greatly changed

little birdie only shook her headâher heart seemed too full for speechâand she stepped on a little faster keeping her hand pressed on her breast all the while

when they reached the door emily was about to open it hut her companion stopped her by saying wait a momentâstop  how my heart beatsâit almost suffocates me

they paused for a few moments to permit little birdie to recover from her agitation then throwing open the door they advanced into the room

 clarence  said his sister he did not answer  he was looking down into the garden she approached nearer and gently laying her hand on his shoulder said  here is your little birdie clarence he neither moved nor spoke

clarence cried she louder no answer she touched his faceâit was warm  hes fainted exclaimed she and ringing the bell violently she screamed for help her husband and the nurse rushed into the room then came aunt ada and mr bates they batted his temples held strong salts to his nostrilsâstill he did not revive finaly the nurse opened his bosom and placed her hand upon his heart it was stillâquite still  claeence was dead 

at first they could not believe it  let me speak to him

exclaimed little birdie distractedly  he will hear my voice and answer clarence  clarence  she cried all in rain âall in vain clarence was dead 

they gently bore her away that dull cold look came back again upon her face and left it never more in life she walked about mournfully for a few years pressing her hand upon her heart and then passed away to join her lover where distinctions in race or colour are unknown and where the prejudices of earth cannot mar their happiness

our tale is now soon finished they buried clarence beside his parents coloured people followed him to his last home and wept over his grave of all the many whites that he had known aunt ada and mr balch were the only ones that mingled their tears with those who listened to the solemn words of father banks  ashes to ashes dust to dust

we too clarence cast a tear upon thy tombâpoor victim of prejudice to thy colour and deem thee better off resting upon thy cold pillow of earth than battling with that malignant sentiment that persecuted thee and has crushed energy hope and life from many stronger hearts

aunt ada bell remained for a short time with emily and then returned to sudbury where during the remainder of her life she never omitted an opportunity of doing a kindness to a coloured person j and when the increasing liberality of sentiment opened a way for the admission of coloured pupils to the famous schools of sudbury they could always procure board at her house and aunt ada was a friend and mother to them

walters and dear old ess reared a fine family  and the brown baby and her sister took numberless premiums at school to the infinite delight of their parents they also had a boy whom they named  charlie  he inherited his uncles passionate fondness for marbles which fondness it has been ascertained is fostered by his uncle who tis said furnishes the sinews of war when there is a dearth in the treasury of master walters

kinch and caddy were finally united after various difficulties raised by the latter who found it almost impossible to procure a house in such a state of order as would warrant her entering upon the blissful state of matrimony when it was all over kinch professed to his acquaintances generally to be living in a perfect state of bliss but he privately intimated to charlie that if caddy would permit him to come in at the front door and not condemn him to go through the alley whenever there happened to be a showerâand would let him smoke where he likedâhe would be much more contented when last heard from they had a little caddy the very image of its motherâa wonderful little girl who instead of buying candy and cake with her sixpences as other children did gravely invested them in miniature washboards and dustbrushes and was saving up her money to purchase a tiny stove with a full set of cooking utensils caddy declares her a child worth having

charles and emily took a voyage to europe for the health of the latter and returned after a two years tour to settle permanently in his native city they were unremitting in their attention to father and mother ellis who lived to good old age surrounded by their children and grandchildren
