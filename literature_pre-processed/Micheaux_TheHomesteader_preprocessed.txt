homesteader the micheaux oscar  novel
agnes their cognomen was stewart and three years had gone by since their return from western kansas where they had been on what they now chose to regard as a  wild goose chase the substance was that as farmers they had failed to raise even one crop during the three years they spent there so had in the end therefore returned broken and defeated to the rustic old district of indiana where they had again taken up their residence on a rented farm

welcomed home like the  return of the prodigal the age old gossip of  i told you so had been exchanged and the episode was about forgotten

but there was one in the family the one with whom our story is largely concerned who although she had found little in western kansas to encourage her to stay there had not on the other hand found much cheer back in old indiana so long as they found no place to live but nubbin ridge although but a girl it so happened through circumstances over which she had no control that whatever she thought or did concerned largely the whole familys welfare or destiny

her father was a quaint old scotchman coming directly from scotland to this country a highlander from the highest of the highlands and carried the accent still but concerning her mother she had never known her indeed few had known her mother intimately but it was generally understood that she had been the second wife of her father and that she had died that agnes might live she was the only offspring by this marriage although there were two boys by the first union these lived at home with her and her father but were unfortunately halfwitted naturally agnes was regarded as having been fortunate in being born of the second wife but what seemed rather singular unlike her half brothers who were simple she on the other hand appeared to be possessed with an unusual amount of wit rare wit extraordinary wit

she was now twenty and because she possessed such sweet ways she was often referred to as beautiful although in truth she was not her face was somewhat square and while there was a semblance of red roses in her cheeks when she smiled her complexion was unusually white â almost pale her mouth like her face was also inclined to be square while her lips were the reddest she had a chin that was noticeable due to the fact that it was so prominent and her nose was straight almost to the point where it took a slight turn upwards it was her hair however that was her greatest attraction unusually long it was thick and heavy of a flaxen tint and was her pride her eyes however were a mystery â baffling sometimes when they were observed by others they were called blue but upon second notice they might be taken for brown few really knew their exact color and to most they were a puzzle

there was a flash about them at times that moved people a peculiarity withal that even her father had never been able to understand at such times he was singularly frightened frightened with what he saw and what he didnt see but felt always she then reminded him of her mother whom he had known only briefly before taking her as his wife he had loved her this wife and had also feared her as he now feared this daughter when her eyes flashed

her mother had kept a secret from him â and the world

in trust she left some papers what they contained he did not know and would not until the day before she agnes was to marry and should she not marry by the time she reached thirty the papers were to be given her then anyhow

and so jack stewart had resigned himself to the situation had given her the best education possible which had not been much she had gone through the grade schools however and barely succeeded in completing two years of the high school course the love that he had been deprived of giving her mother because of her early death he had given to agnes she was his joy his pride she read to him because his eyes were not the best she wrote his letters consulted with him assisted and conducted what business he had and had avoided the society of young men

so we have met and know some little of the girl we are to follow in the beginning of our story we find her anything but contented living in quaint old  nubbin ridge

could not to say the most be called illustrious it was a small district where the soil was very poor â as poor perhaps as indiana afforded so poor indeed that it was capable of producing nothing but nubbins corn from which it derived its name when a man went to rent a farm in  nubbin ridge  he was considered all in down and out

   to continue life there was to grow poorer it was a part of the state wherein no one had ever been known to grow rich and stewarts had proven no exception to the rule but this story is to be concerned only briefly with  nubbin ridge so we will come back to the one around whom it will in a measure center

her chief accomplishments since their disastrous conquest of western kansas had been the simple detail of keeping a diary but at other times she had attempted musical composition and had even sent the same to publishers one after another of course all she sent had duly come back and she had by this time grown to expect the returned manuscripts as the inevitable but since sending the same gave her a diversion she had kept it up â and had today received a letter a letter that was all and a short one at that but even a letter in view of her previous experiences was highly appreciated it stated briefly that her composition had been carefully examined â studied but had they very much regretted to inform her been found unavailable for their needs although they had returned the same they wished to say that she had shown some merit â  symptoms  she thought would have sounded better â and that they would always be patient and glad to examine anything she might be so kind as to submit

she read the letter over many times not that she hoped that doing so would bring her anything but because in her little life in  nubbin ridge  there was so little to break the usual monotonous routine when she had read and studied it until she knew every letter by heart she sighed picked up her diary and wrote therein there is little to record tonight today just passed was like yesterday and yesterday was like the day before that except it rained yesterday and it didnt the day before

papa and bill and george have just completed picking cornâ nubbins the kind and only thing that grows in nubbin ridge verily does the name fit the production we will perhaps have enough when it is sold to pay the rent send to sears  roebuck for a few things and thats all

george wants a gun and thinks hes worked hard enough this summer to earn one he has found one in the catalogue that can be had for  and is all heart that papa will get it for him along with four boxes of shells that will all told reach  little enough to say the least for a summers work bill has his mind set on a watch but papa bought him a suit of clothes that cost  two months ago when we sold the hogs so i dont think bill will get in on anything this fall or winter as for me i would like to have a dress that i see can be had through a catalogue for a reasonable sum but if it will crowd papa i will say nothing about it he has the mortgage on the horses to pay and by the time we get the few other necessities it will not leave much if anything

laterâ papa has been growing very restless of late i dont wonder either any one that had any energy any spark of ambition would grow restless or crazy in nubbin ridge the very name smacks of poverty ignorance and degeneration but a real estate man from south dakota has been in the neighborhood for a week and has told some wonderful tales of opportunities out there he has made it plain to papa that western kansas has been a failure to thousands of people for forty years that south dakota is different that the rainfall is abundant the climate is the best and that every renter in indiana should there proceed forthwith im surprised that he should waste his time talking with papa who has no money but he seems to be just as anxious for him to go as he is for others perhaps its because he wishes a crowd a crowd even though some are poor would i imagine appear more like business

bill and george are full for going and papa has hinted to me as to whether i would like it how should i know 

it couldnt be worse than this place even if it was the jumping off place of all creation i have about come to the place where i am willing to try anywhere once there surely must be some place in this wide world where people have a chance to rise of course with us â poor bill and george and papas getting old i dont suppose we will ever get hold of much anywhere but the real estate man says we could all take homesteads that in those partsâi cannot quite call the name ill study a while    the rosebud country is what he called it â there had been a great land opening and there would be another in a few years that we could go out now and rent on a place raise big crops and get in good financial circumstances by the time the opening comes go forth then and all take homesteads and grow rich i it sounds fishy â us growing rich but since we have nothing we couldnt lose

lie says that people have grown wealthy in two years that among the successful men â those who have made it quickly â is a colored man out there who came from â he couldnt say just where but that if a colored man could make it and get money together surely any one else should

i will close this now because it is late the light is low besides im sleepy and since that is surely one thing a person can do with success in  nubbin ridge i will retire and have my share of it

a month later â it has happened we are going westl the real estate man has gone back and papa has been out there he is carried away with the country says it is the greatest place on earth i wont attempt to put down the wonders he has told of rich land to be rented for onethird of the crops â and we pay twofifths in nubbin ridge where there is no soil just a sprinkling of dust over the surface has rented a place already and has made arrangements with the man that we owe to give him a years time to pay the two hundred dollars so we have enough to get out there and buy seed next spring

everybody says we are going on another wild goose chase but they would say that if we were going into the next county it would seem better however if we would wait until spring but papa is getting ready to go right after xmas that settles it i will make no more notes in this diary until we have reached the  promised land in the meantime i am full of dreams dreams dreams i had a strange dream last night a real dream in which things happened always i have those day dreams but last night i had a real dream i dreamed that we went out to this country and that we rented and lived on a farm near the colored man the real estate man spoke of i dreamed that he was an unusual man a wonderful personality and that we â he and i â became very close friends

that a strange murder occurred near where we went a murder that no one could ever understand but that in after years it was all made plain â and i was involved think of such a dream me being involved in anything i of nubbin ridge i am sure that if i told out there the name of the place from where we came they would think we were crazy but that was not all the dream â and it was all so plain it frightens me when i think of it i cannot realize how i could have had such a strange dream

i dreamed after we had been there a while that i fell in love âbut its the man i fell in love with which makes the dream so unusual and â impossible yet there is a saying that nothing is impossible

i will not record here or describe the one with whom i fell in love strangely i feel that i should wait i cannot say why but something seems to caution me to tell me not to say more now

there remains but one thing more yesterday i happened to glance at myself in the mirror as if by magic i was drawn closer and studied myself studied something in my features i had never seen before â at least not in that way i observed then my hands they too appeared unlike they had been before it seems to have been the dream that prompted me to look â and the dream that revealed this about myself that i cannot understand my eyes did not appear the same they were as if â as if they belonged to some other my lips were red as usual but there was about them something too i had not seen before they appeared thicker and as i studied them in the mirror more closely i couldnt resist that singularity in my eyes

they became large and then small they were blue so blue and then they were brown it was when they appeared brown that i could not understand i will close now for i wish to think my brain is afire i must think think think

the homesteader the day was cold and dark and dreary a storm raged over the prairieâ a storm of the kind that seem to come only over the northwest over the wide unbroken country of our story the wind screamed as if terribly angry it raced across the level stretches swept down into the draws where draws were tumbled against the hillsides regained its equilibrium and tore madly down the other side as if to destroy all in its path a heavy snow had fallen all the morning but about noon it had changed to fine grainy missiles that cut the face like cinders and made going against it very difficult notwithstanding through itâdirectly against it at most times the homesteader struggled resolutely forward he was shielded in a measure by the horses he was driving whose bulks prevented the wind from striking him in the face and on the body at all times at other times â and especially when following a level stretch â he got close to the side of the front wagon with its large box loaded with coal which towered above his head and shoulders

before him but not always the dim line of the trail despite the heavy snow that had fallen that morning was outlined perhaps it was because he had followed it â he and his horses â so often before in the two years since he had been west that he was able to keep to its narrow way without difficulty today and still following it was not as difficult as following other trails for it was an old old trail so old indeed was it that nobody knew just how old it was nor how far it reached it was said that custer had gone that way to meet his massacre that sitting bull knew it best but to the homesteader he honed to be able to follow it only as long as the light of day pointed the way when night came â but upon that he had not reckoned to be caught upon it by darkness was certain death and he didnt want to die

he was young the homesteader â just passed twentytwo â and vigorous strong healthy and courageous his height was over six feet and while he was slender he was not too much so his shoulders were slightly round but not stooped his great height gave him an advantage now

he followed his horses with long rangy strides turning his head frequently as if to give the blood a chance to circulate about and under the skin of his wide forehead the fury of the storm appeared to grow worse judging from the way the horses shook their bridled heads or perhaps it was growing colder almost continually some of the horses were striking the ice from their nosepoints while very often the homesteader had to rest the lines he held while he forced the blood to his finger tips with long swings of his arms back and forth across his breast

his claim lay many miles yet before him and his continual gaze toward the west was to ascertain how long the light of day was likely to hold out behind far to the rear lay the little town of bonesteel which he had left that morning and now regretted having done so but the storm had not been so bad then and because the snow was falling he had conjectured it would be better to reach home before it became too deep or badly drifted as it was now he was encountering all this and some more  damn  he cried as they passed down a slope to where the land divided and where the wind seemed to hit hardest

his course lay directly northwest straight against the wind which he could only avoid by hanging the lines over the lever of the brake and fall in behind the trail wagon

but this unfortunately placed him too far away from the horses he had walked all the way for to walk was apparently the only way to keep from freezing he soon reached the other side of the draw and when he had come to the summit beyond he groaned ahead of him just above the dark horizon the sun came suddenly from beneath the clouds on either side of it great gasping sundogs struggled they seemed to vie with the red sinking orbit and as he continued his anxious gazing in that direction they seemed to have triumphed for as the sun sank lower and lower they appeared suddenly empowered with a mighty force for only a few minutes later the sun had fallen into the great abyss below and the night was on

 we can make it yet boys he cried to his horses as if to cheer them and as if they understood they crashed forward with such vigor that he was thrown almost into a trot to keep up

as to how long it went on thus or as to how far they had gone he was not able to reckon but out of the now pitch darkness he became conscious of a peculiar longing

he had a vision of his sod house that stood on the claim and he saw the small barn with its shed and the stalls for four he saw the little house again with its one room the little monkey stove with an oven on the chimney and imagined himself putting a pan of baking powder bread therein he saw his bed a large wide dirtyâtis true â but a warm bed nevertheless he fancied himself creeping under the covers and sleeping the sound way he always did

he could not understand his prolific thoughts that followed

he thought of his boyhood back in old illinois he took stock of the surroundings he had left there he lived briefly through the discontentment that had ultimately inspired him to come west and then he had again those dreams regardless of where his train of wandering thoughts began or of where they followed always they were sure to end upon this given point the girl the girl of his dreams â for he had no real girl

there had never been a real girl for jean baptiste for this was his name in the years that had preceded his coming hither it had been one relentless effort to get the few thousands together with which to start when he finally came west at that he had been called lucky he had no heritage had jean baptiste his father had given him only the french name that was his for his father had been poor â but this instant belongs elsewhere his heritage then had been his indefatigable will his firm determination to make his way his great desire to make good but we follow jean baptiste and the girl

only a myth was she she had come in a day dream when he came west but strangely she had stayed and singularly as it may seem he was confident she would come in person some day he talked with her when he was lonely and that was almost every day he told her why he had come west because he felt it was the place for young manhood here with the unbroken prairie all about him with its virgin soil and undeveloped resources and the fact that all the east that part of the east that was iowa and illinois had once been as this now was had once been as wild and undeveloped and had not then been worth any more â indeed not so much here could a young man work out his own destiny as iowa and illinois had been developed so could this â so would this also be developed

and as railways had formed a network of those states so in time would they reach this territory as well in fact it was inevitable what was to come the prime essential therefore for his youth was to begin with the beginning â and so he had done

so he had come had jean baptiste and was living alone with a great hope with a great hope for the future of this little empire out there in the hollow of gods hand with a great love too for her his dream girl so in his prolific visions he talked on with her he told her that it was a long way to the railroad now â thirtytwo miles he had that far to haul the coal he and others burned there were yet no fences and while there were section lines they were rarely followed it was nearer by trail but he was patient he was perseverant time would bring all else â and her he had visions of her she was not beautiful she might not be vivacious for that belonged to the city but she was good always he understood everything that was hers and he was confident she would understand him her name was sweet and easily pronounced how he loved to call it  he staggered at times now and didnt know why he had wanted to be home and in his bed where he could sleep but home as he now regarded it was too far he couldnt make it and didnt need to why should they blunder and pull so hard to get home when all about them was a place where they could rest the prairie was all about and he had slept on the ground before with only the soft grass beneath him why then must he continue on and on

the air was pleasant â warm and luxuriant and he jean baptiste was very tired â oh how tired he really was

it was settled he had gone far enough he would make his bed right where he was he called to the horses

but somehow they didnt seem to hear he called again then he thought louder and still they failed to hear he wondered at their stubbornness they were good horses and had never disobeyed before he called now again at the top of his voice but they heeded him not in the meantime forging onward onward and onward it occurred to him to drop the reins but such had never been a custom

within his tired freezing and brainfagged mind there was a resolution that made him cling to them but struggling to pull them down to a stop he continued

and as he followed them now onward toward the sod house that stood on the claim all realism seemed to desert him he became a chilled mechanician he seemed to have passed into the infinite where all was vague where turmoil and peculiar strife only abided    for jean baptiste did not understand that he was on the verge of freezing

stewarts were pleased with the country they had arrived in early january the weather had not been bad although the wind blew much stronger here than it did in indiana however they had not forgotten how it blew in western kansas and were therefore accustomed to it

the house upon the place they had rented was small just four rooms but it was well built and was warm a village was not far the people in it called it a town but you see they were enthusiastic to be more amply provided they could get what they needed at gregory which was seven miles seven miles was not far to one who could ride horseback and this agnes had learned in western kansas

 you had best not go to town today my girl cautioned jack stewart her father as she made ready to ride to gregory after ordering bill to saddle dolly the gray mare that was their best

 tut tut papa she chided  this is a day to take the benefit of this wonderful air the low altitude of nubbin ridge made me sallow there was no blood in my checks

here â ah a nice horseback ride to gregory will be the best yet for me

 i dont like the wind â and so much snow with it he muttered looking out with a frown upon his face

 but the snow is not like it was she argued almost ready  its letting up

 its growing finer which is evidence that it is growing colder

 better still she cried jumping about frolickingly her lithe young body as agile as an athletes  now dada she let out winsomely  i shall dash up to gregory get all we need and be back before the sun goes down and with that she kissed away further protest swung open wide the door stepped out and vaulted lightly into the saddle a moment later she was gone but not before her father cried if you should be delayed stay the night in town above all things dont let the darkness catch you upon the prairie

at the sod house she enjoyed the horseback ride to gregory although she trembled at times from the sting of the intense cold the exercise the riding gave her body kept the brood circulating freely and she made the trip to the little town without event

once there after thawing the cold out of her face and eyes she proceeded to do her trading filling the saddlebags to their fullest

which way do you live from town inquired the elderly man who waited upon her at the general store where she was doing her trading

 seven miles southeast she replied

 indeed  he cried as if surprised  but you didnt come from there today â this afternoon that would be directly against this storm

she nodded

 well now who would have thought you could have made it tis an awful day without he cried as he regarded her in wonder

 it wasnt warm i admit she agreed  but i didnt seem to mind it so much

 you will not go back todayâ rather tonight 

 oh yes

 but it would be very risky look its grown dark already  she looked out and observed that it had really grown almost pitch dark during the few minutes she had lingered inside she was for a moment at a loss for a reply then conscious that the wind would be to her back she laughed lightly as she said  oh i shant mind it will take me less than forty minutes and then itll all be over and she laughed low and easily again the man frowned as he pursued  i dont like to see you start a stranger in such a night as this since settlement following a trail is rather treacherous one may leave town on one but be on some other before they have gone two miles and while the wind will be to your back the uncertainty of direction should you happen to look back or even around is confusing one loses sense of the way they are going id suggest that you stick over until morning it would be safer he concluded shaking his head dubiously

 oh i am not afraid she cried cheerfully she was ready then and with her usual dash she crossed the short board walk vaulted into the saddle and a few minutes later the dull clatter of her horses hoofs died in the distance

with the wind to her back she rode easily she enjoyed the exercise the riding gave her and was thrilled instead of being frightened over what was before her she followed quite easily the trail that had taken her into the village

in due time she passed a house that she had observed when going in that stood to one side of the trail and then suddenly the mare came to an abrupt halt she peered into the darkness before her a barbwire fence was across the trail

she could not seem to recall it being there on her way in

yet she argued with herself that she might have come around and not noticed it for a moment she was in doubt as to which way to go to get around it as she viewed it it did not extend perhaps more than a quarter mile or a half at the most after which she could come around to the other side and strike the trail again she gave the ever faithful mare rein and they sailed down the fence line to where she estimated it must shortly end

she did not know that this was the old ucross fence and that because it stood on indian land it had not been taken up when the great ranch had been moved into the next county when giving up to the settler in truth only a few steps to her right she had left the trail she had followed into town the old trail had been cut off when the homesteader in whose house she had seen the light had laid out his claim and it was this which caused the confusion she did not know that one could go to town or to the railroad today and returning on the morrow find the route changed

homesteaders were without scruples very often in such matters the law of the state was that before a followed trail was cut off it should be advertised for five weeks in advance to that effect but not one in twenty of the settlers knew that such a law existed

so agnes stewart had ridden fully two miles before she became apprehensive of the fact that she had lost her way

now the most practical plan for her would been to have turned directly about and gone back to where she had started down the fence but charged with impatient youth she sought what she felt to be the quickest way about now upon looking closely she could see that wires hung down in places and that a post here and there had sagged she urged the mare over a place and then once over went in the direction she felt was home the stiff zero night air had somewhat dulled her and she made the mistake of looking back thereby confusing her direction to the point where after a few minutes she could not have sworn in what direction she was going except that the wind was still at her back

she peered into the darkness before her she thought there would be lights of homesteaders about and while there was the storm made it impossible for her to see them

after a time she became alarmed and recalled her fathers warning also the storekeepers but her natural determination was to go on that she would get her bearings presently so with a jerking of her body as if to stimulate circulation of the blood she bent in the saddle and rode another mile or more she had crossed draws ascended hills had stumbled over trails that always appeared to lead in the wrong direction and at last gave up for lost at a summit where the wind and fine snow chilled her to the marrow she was thoroughly frightened now she thought to return to gregory but when she turned her eyes against the wind she could catch no sight of anything

she was sure then that she could not make it back there had she wished to not knowing what to do she allowed the mare to trot ahead without any effort to direct her she had not gone far before she realized that they were following a level stretch and because she seemed to keep warm when the horse moved she allowed the mare to continue

a half mile she estimated had been covered when out of the darkness some dark shape took outline she peered ahead the mare was ambling gently toward it and she saw after a time that it was a quaint oblong structure a sod house apparently many of which she had observed since coming west into the new country she was relieved at least she was not to freeze to death upon the prairie a fact that she had begun to regard as a possibility a few minutes before the mare fell into a walk and presently came up to a low square house built of sod with its odd hip roof reposing darkly in the outline she called  hello and was patient the wind bit into her and she was conscious of the bitter cold and that she was beginning to feel its severe effects there was no response and she called again dismounting in the meantime when she saw no one she went around to where she observed a low door at which she knocked vigorously from all appearances the place was occupied but no one was at home she tried the knob it gave and she pushed the door open cautiously

all was darkness within then dropping the bridle reins she ventured inside she could not understand why her feet made no sound upon the floor but in truth there was no floor except the earth she felt in her coat pocket and presently produced a match when the flaring light illuminated the surroundings she gazed about it was she quickly observed a one room house there was at her side a monkey stove with an oven on the pipe while at her left stood a table with dishes piled thereupon there was also a lantern on the table and this she adjusted and lighted before the blaze died she swung this about and saw there was a bed with dirty bed clothing also a trunk some boxes and what nots

 a bachelor id wager she muttered and then blushed when she considered her position she looked about further and upon seeing fuel proceeded to build a fire this done she passed outside found a path that extended northwest and leading the horse soon came to a small barn

here she saw two stalls with a manger filled with hay

she had to push the mare back to keep her from entering and making herself at home she passed around the barn and entered the door of a small shed for cattle obviously but empty hay was in the manger and taking the bits from the mares mouth she tied the reins to the manger unsaddled and leaving the shed after fastening the door she carried the saddle with her to the house

the little stove was roaring from the fire she had started and she was surprised to find the room becoming warm

she placed the saddle in a convenient position and lifted her cap whereupon her heavy hair fell over her shoulders

she caught it up and wound it into a braid quickly guiltily

   she unbuttoned her coat then and took a seat

there is no one here she muttered to herself so since i dont know the way home and theres no one here to tell me guess ill have to give it up until morning she was thoughtful then this was something of an adventure

lost upon the prairie a bachelors homestead there alone

then suddenly he started from the storm swept outside she thought she caught a sound and thereupon became quickly alert but the next moment her tension relaxed it was only the wind at the corner of the house the room had become warm she was uncomfortable with the heavy coat about her she was conscious moreover that her eyes were heavy sleep was knocking at her door she shook off the depression and fell again to thinking she wondered who could live there and she continued in her random thinking until shortly unconsciously she fell into a doze

she could not recall whether she had dozed an hour or a minute but she was awakened suddenly and jumped to her feet for from the storm she had caught the sound of horses and wagons passing the house at only a short distance she stood terrified her eyes were wide her lips were apart as she listened to the grinding of the wagon wheels â and they went directly toward the barn then all was silent and she placed her hand to her heart to still the frightened beating there she heard the horses shake in their harness and came to herself the man of the place had returned  she had taken charge of his house he a bachelor and she a maid she felt embarrassed she got into her coat and buttoned it about her hurriedly and then drawing the cap over her head she waited expectantly although she was sure that time sufficient had expired whoever drove the teams had not come toward the house she could hear the horses but she could not ascertain that they were being unhitched she was undecided for a moment then catching up the lantern she quickly went outside two wagons loaded heavily with coal greeted her she passed to the front and found four horses white with the frost from perspiration standing hitched to the loads she passed to their heads no one was about and she was puzzled she passed around to the other side and as she did so stumbled over something with the lantern raised she peered down and then suddenly screamed when she discovered it was a man then on second thought fearing he had fallen from the wagon and become injured she put her arm through the bail of the lantern reached down caught him by the shoulders and shook him he was not injured she was relieved to see but what was the matter in the next moment she gave a quick start she realized in a twinkling then that the man was freezing â perhaps already frozen

with quick intuition she reached and caught him beneath the arms and turning dragged him to the house she opened the door and lifting his body carried him in her arms across the room and laid him upon the bed then realizing that the night was severely cold she rushed out closing the door behind her and a half hour later had the horses unhitched unharnessed and tied in their stalls this done she returned hurriedly to the house to find the man still unconscious but breathing heavily she did not know at once what to do but going to his feet took off his shoes

this was rather difficult and she feared that from the way they felt his feet were frozen she rubbed them vigorously and was relieved after a time to feel the blood circulating and the same giving forth warmth she sighed with relief and then pulling off the heavy gloves she exercised the same proceeding with the hands and was cheered to feel them give forth warmth after a time she unbuttoned the coat at his throat and rolling him over managed to get it off of him next she unbuttoned the collar drew off the cap and for the first time saw his face it was swollen and very dark she thought she brought the lantern closer and looked again she gave a start then and opened her mouth in surprise then she fell to thinking

she went back to the chair beside the fire and reflected

 it is all the same of course she said to herself  but i was just surprised it all seems rather singular she mused and tried to compose herself the surprise she had just experienced had notwithstanding her effort at self possession disconcerted her she turned suddenly for she had caught the sound of a noise from the bed she got up quickly and went to him he had turned from his side to his back she stood over him with the lantern raised to see him better she leaned over holding the lantern so that her face was full in the light she had unbuttoned her coat at the throat and seeking more comfort had also removed the cap she wore she had however forgotten her hair which had been held about her head by the cap and it now fell in braids over her slender shoulders on the instant the mans eyes opened he raised on an elbow looked into her face smiled wanly and murmured  it is you agnes you have come and oh i am glad for i have waited for you so long in the next breath he had fallen back upon the bed and was sleeping again while she staggered in great surprise who was this man that he should call her name and say that he had waited

but with jean baptiste he snored in peace his dream had come true the one of his vision had come as he had hoped she would but jean baptiste was not aware of the debt he owed her that through strange providence in getting lost she had come into his sod house and saved his life

but what he was yet to know and which is the great problem of our story the girl his dream girl agnes stewart happened to be white while he jean baptiste the homesteader was a negro

she could never be anything to him jean baptiste slept soundly all the night through snoring loudly at times turning frequently but never awakening and while he slept unconscious of how near he had come to freezing to death upon the prairie but for the strange coincidence of agnes stewarts having gotten lost and finding him she sat near listening to the dull roar of the storm outside at times at other times casting furtive anxious and apprehensive glances toward the bed half in fear more because the position she realized herself to be in was awkward not to say embarrassing

her eyes became heavy as the night wore on and she arose and walked about over the dirt floor in an attempt to shake off the inertia and in the meantime the man she had saved slept on apparently disturbed by nothing presently she approached him shyly and taking the coat he had worn and which lay near she spread it carefully over him then tiptoed away and regarded him curiously her life had never afforded character study in a broad sense but for some reason which she could not account for she strangely trusted the sleeping man and because she did she was not in fear lest he awaken and take advantage of the compromising circumstances but in her life she had met and known no colored people and knew directly little about the negro race beyond what she had read therefore to find herself lost on the wide plains in a house alone with one a bachelor homesteader with a terrific storm without gave her a peculiar sensation

when the hand of the little clock upon the table pointed to two oclock a m she put coal on the fire became seated in a crude rocking chair that proved notwithstanding to be comfortable and before she was aware of it had fallen asleep worn out by the nights vigil and the unusual circumstances in which she found herself she slept soundly and all sense of flying time was lost upon her the storm subsided with the approach of morn and the suh was peeping out of a clear sky in the east when she awakened with a start she jumped to her feet quickly her eyes sought the bed it was empty the man had arisen she looked out through the little window the blizzard had left the country gray and streaked buttoning her coat collar about her throat she adjusted her cap by pulling it well down over her head and ventured outside

never had she looked upon such a scene as met her eyes

everywhere as fax as she could see was a mantle of snow and ice here the snow had been swept into huge drifts or long ridges while there it sparkled in the sun one endless unbroken sheet of white frost and ice here and there over the wide expanse a lonesome claim shack reposed as if lost while to the northwest she could see the little town to which she had gone the afternoon before rising heroically out of the snow upon hearing a sound she turned to find the homesteader leading her horse saddled and bridled from the barn she turned her eyes away to hide the confusion with which she was suddenly overcome and at the same time to try to find words with which to greet him

good morning she heard from his lips and turned her face to see him touch the cap he wore

 good morning sir she returned smiling with ease notwithstanding her confusion of a moment before

 i judge that you must have become lost the why you happened along said he pleasantly courteously

 i did she acknowledged marveled at finding herself so much at ease in his presence and him conscious in the same instance she took quick note of his speech and manner and was strangely pleased

 i see she heard him mutter she had cast her eyes away as if to think but now turned again toward him to find him regarding her intently she saw him give a quick start and catch his breath as if in surprise whereupon she turned her eyes away but she did not understand the cause of his start she did not understand that while he had recognized her as his dream girl that only then had he realized that she was white while he had naturally supposed his dream girl would be of his own blood ethiopian

he lowered his eyes as this fact played in his mind and as he hesitated she again turned her eyes upon him and regarded him wonderingly and in that moment the instance of the night before when he had awakened and looked up into her eyes for the first time when she stood over him and had uttered the words she would never as long as she lived forget came back it is you agnes you have come and oh i am glad for i have waited for you so long

 how did he know my name and come to say what he did was the question she now again as she had been doing all the night through asked herself she prayed that she might find a way to ask him â how deeply her curiosity to know was aroused and then while she was so deeply engrossed abruptly he raised his head and his eyes fell searchingly again upon her he saw and wondered at the curious intentness he saw there and as he did so he caught that something in her eyes he saw what she had seen before leaving indiana and as she had been when she had seen it he too was strangely moved and could not understand

apparently he forgot all else as the changing color of her eyes held him and while so unconsciously he advanced a step nearer her she did not move away but stood as if in a thraldom with a feeling stealing over her that somewhere she had seen and known him once    but where â where where she had never known an ethiopian she full well recalled but she was positive that she had seen this man somewhere before then where â where where

as for the man jean baptiste he seemed to relax after a time and looked away he had seen her at last she had been his dream girl had come in a dream and as she stood before him she was all his wondrous vision had portrayed

her face was hushed by the cold air and red roses in full bloom were in her cheeks while her beautiful hair spread over her shoulders and fanned by a light breeze made her in his eyes a picture of enchantment when he observed her again and saw that her eyes were blue and then again were brown he was still mystified but what was come over jean baptiste now was the fact the great fact the fact that between him and his dream girl was a chasm so deep socially that bridging was impossible because she was white while he was black according to the custom of the country and its law she could never be anything to him

her back was to the rising sun and neither had observed that it was mounting higher in the eastern skies she suppressed the question that was on her lips to ask him the eternal question and in that instant he came out of his trance he turned to her and said  it was sure fortunate for me that you lost your way

and so saying his eyes went toward the place she had found him and she understood she could not repress a happy smile that overspread her face he saw it and was pleased

it was rather providential but i would forget it to think that you might have frozen to death out there makes me shudder when i recall it

 i cannot seem to understand what came over me â that i was in the act of freezing while i walked

 it was a terrible night she commented  i too might have frozen but for the good fortune of my horse finding your house

 isnt it strange he muttered abstractedly

 i hadnt the least idea where i was said she musingly

 such a coincidence

 indeed it was ââ but please shall we forget it and she shuddered slightly

 yes he replied readily  where do you live  

she pointed to where the smoke curled from the chimney of their home a mile and a half away

the watson place i see you are perhaps then newcomers here

 we are and she smiled easily he did also he handed her the bridle reins then and said  i trust you will pardon my forgetfulness indeed i was so absorbed in the fact that i had been saved that i forgot to â to be courteous

oh no sir she cried quickly you did not

you â and then she broke off in her speech it occurred to her that she was saying too much but strangely she wanted to go on strangely she wanted to know more of him from where he had come of his life for already she could see that he was a gentleman an unusual person â but he was speaking again

you have become chilled standing there â it is severely cold step back into the house and warm yourself before you start i will hold your horse while you do so and he reached for the bridle reins

she looked up into his face and again trusted him again she experienced a peculiar gratitude and turning she obeyed him as she stood inside over the little monkey stove a moment later she could see him and appreciated how thoughtful he was

she returned after a few minutes stood beside the animal he had brought and was ready to go suddenly she vaulted into the saddle she regarded him again intently while he returned the same a bit abstractedly she started to urge the mare forward and then she drew her to a stop before she had gotten fully started impulsively she leaned forward and stretched her hand toward him mechanically he took it she unconsciously gripped his as she said  im glad it happened    that i became lost and â and â you were saved his dark face colored with gratitude and he had an effort to keep from choking when he tried to reply in the meantime she bestowed upon him a happy smile and the next moment her horse had found the trail and was dashing along it toward the place she lived

and as she went homeward over the hill the man in whose life she was later to play such a strange and intimate part stood looking after her long and silently

when the indians shot the town up the claim of jean baptiste containing  acres b of land adjoined the little town of dallas on the north and it was one of the surprises that agnes stewart had not wandered into it when she found the sod house and had later found jean baptiste in the snow

the town had been started the winter before a creek of considerable depth and plenty of water ran to the south of it a half mile and up this valley the promoters of the town contended that the railroad would build it came up the same valley many miles below where at a way station it suddenly lifted out of it and sought the higher land to bonesteel now the promoters because the railroad company owned considerable land where the tracks left the valley to ascend to the highland contended that it was the purpose of the railroad to split the trade country by coming up the valley and that was why the town had been located where it was on a piece of land that had once belonged to an indian

there were three other towns platted by the government along a route that did not strike dallas and if the railroad should continue the route it was following where its tracks stopped west of bonesteel it was a foregone conclusion that it must hit the three government townsites

this had ever been and was the great contention in the early days of the country of our story but to get back to the characters in question we must come back to the little town near the creek valley

the winter preceding when the town had been started men had chosen to cast their lot with it and by the time spring arrived there was a half dozen or more business places represented from des moines a man had come and started a lumber yard while from elsewhere a man had cooperated with the promoters in establishing a bank two men whose reputations were rather notorious but who nevertheless were well fitted for what they chose started a saloon from a town that had no railroad in the state on the south a man came with a great stock of merchandise

a weazened creature had been made postmaster while a doctor beliquored until he was uncertain had come hither with a hope of redemption and had hung out his shingle

he was succeeding in the game of reform  as the best customer the saloon had a tired man was conducting a business in a building that had been hauled many miles and was being used as a hotel many other lines of business were expected but at this time the interest was largely in who the settlers were that had come and those who were to come

a beautiful quarter section of land joined the town on the east and the man who had drawn it had already established his residence thereupon so that he was known on the south the land was the allotment of an indian while the same was true on the west naturally when it was reported that a negro held the place on the north considerable curiosity prevailed to meet this lone ethiopian

but jean baptiste was a mixer a jolly good fellow of the best type and by this time such was well known as to where he had come from we know but his name had occasioned much comment because it was odd to make it more illustrious the settlers had added  saint so he was now commonly know as st jean baptiste the doctor whose name was slater had improved even upon this he called him  st john the baptist but nobody took doc very seriously so full was he of red liquor most of the time that he was regarded as a joke except in his profession here he was considered one of the bestâ his redeeming feature

the coal the homesteader had hauled from bonesteel was not all for himself but for the lumber yard which sold it at fifteen dollars the ton and the quality was soft and not of the best grade at that he hauled it into town the morning following the episode of our story and after unloading it and taking his check for the hauling returned home took care of his stock and upon returning to town forgot to relate anything concerning his experiences    perhaps he forgot    jean baptiste could be depended upon to forget some things

   especially the things that were best forgotten

he walked across the quarter mile that lay between his claim and the town and up to the saloon inside he encountered the usual crowd doc among them

 hello there st john the baptist cried that one in beliquored delight  did you crawl through all that storm  

im here laughed baptiste hows doc

 finern a fiddle both ends in the middle and called for another drink just one it is said that saloons would not be so bad if it was not for the treating nuisance well doc could be regarded here then as practical for he never bought others a drink

 see you got your nose freezed baptiste doc laughed

baptiste went toward the bar took a look at himself and laughed amusedly upon seeing the telltale darkness at the point of his nose his cheeks and his forehead

 t hell i didnt know that he muttered the crowd laughed

 play you a game of casino suggested doc

 youre on  cried baptiste

after they had played awhile a swede who lived across the creek entered took a seat and drawing his chair near watched the game presently he spoke  the indians are coming in today so i guess there will be a shooting up the town

the players paused and regarded each other apprehensively others overheard the remark and now exchanged significant glances this had been the one diversion of the long winter indians who lived on the creek coming into town getting drunk and then as a sally ride up and down the main street and shoot up the town the last time this had taken place the bartenders wife had been frightened into hysterics and thereupon the bartender had sworn that the next time this was attempted they would have to reckon with him

the few people about became serious they knew the bartender was dangerous and they feared the indians breeds mostly who made this act their pastime they were annoyed with such doings but were inclined to lay the blame at the saloon door for although the law decreed that indians should not be sold liquor they were always allowed to purchase all that they could possibly carry away with them inside and out so upon this announcement those about prepared themselves for excitement the news quickly spread and to augment the excitement a few minutes later the breeds in full regalia dashed into town they tied their horses at the front and proceeded at once to the bar

 whiskey they cried shifting their spurred boots on the barroom floor

 sorry boys but i cant serve you advised the bartender carelessly

what they cried

 cant serve you its agin the law yu know

 t hell with the law  exclaimed one

 i didnt make it muttered the bartender

 youve been playing hell enforcing it retorted another

 now dont get rough my worthy cautioned the bartender

 give us what we called for and none of this damn slush then cried one toying with the gun at his holster

the bartender observed this and got closer to the bar for a purpose those about being of the peaceful kind began shifting toward the door

 weve been breakin the law to serve you said the bartender  and youve been breaking the law after we done it

now the last time you were here you pulled off a  stunt that caused trouble so ill not serve you whiskey and advise you that if you try shooting up the town again therell be trouble

 oh is that so  cried the bunch  well sniffed one who was more forward than the rest  well just show you a trick or two and remember when weve shot your little chicken coops full of holes we are going to return and be served with a hilarious laugh they went outside got into the saddles and had their fun the population took refuge in the cellars in awed silence

it was over in a few minutes and the breeds true to their statement returned to the saloon and stood before the bar

 whiskey they cried and couldnt repress a grin

ordinarily they were cowards and their boldness had surprised even themselves

whiskey said the bartender nodding toward the speaker

 thats my order the other cried uproarously the bartender arranged several bottles in a row this they did not understand at first they did however a moment later

 very well he cried of a sudden as his eyes narrowed whereupon with deliberation he caught the bottles one by one by the neck and as fast as he could let go threw the same into the faces before him with all the force he could concentrate quickly so quickly was it all done that those before him had not time to duck below the bar before many had been the recipients of the deluge within the minute there was a wild scramble for the door â all but three

for while the others disappeared over the hill toward the creek dr slater took thirty stitches or thereabouts in the faces of the recalcitrants

the infidel a jew and a german a mile north from where stood the house of st

jean baptiste there lived a quaint old man

he was a widower at least this was the general opinion especially when he so claimed to be in a new country there may be found among those who settle much that is unusual not to say quaint and oftentimes mysterious

and in the case of this man by name illustrious there was all this and some more

augustus m barr he registered and from england he hailed how long since does not concern this story at this stage besides he never told any one when or why â well he had been in america long enough to secure the claim he held and that was sufficient but that barr had been a man of some note back from where he came there could be little doubt among the things to prove it he was very much of a linguist being well versed in english french polish german the scandinavian he thoroughly understood â and latin that was easy

pie had been a preacher and had pastored many years in a baker street church london then it seems he concluded after all that there was no god there was no satan nor hell either â so he gave up the ministry and became an infidel and so we have him but there was something a m barr had never told â but that was the mystery

and while he will be concerned with our story let us not forget that two miles and more west of the little town of dallas there lived another a jew he was not a merchant nor was he a trader then jews who are not the one or the other are not the usual jew apparently well syfe wasnt for that was his name isaac syfe and from far away assyria he had come he was dark of visage with dark hair and piercing but lurking eyes with brows that ran together while his nose was long and seemed to hang down at the point reminding one of the ancient judas

his mouth was small and close and there was always a cigarette between the dark lips he was of medium size somewhere in the thirties perhaps lived alone on a homestead that was his own and so we have isaac syfe but there is another still

he lived about as far southwest of dallas as syfe lived to the west and unlike syfe he was light a blond thick short and stout his neck was muscular and slightly bull like while his features were distinctly germanic his face was rounded and healthy with cheeks soft and red and they called him kaden peter kaden he also held a claim having purchased a relinquishment in the opening lived alone as did syfe and numerous other bachelors and did his own cooking washing and ironing

augustus m barr appeared very much impressed with jean baptiste he was a judge of men withal and much impressed with baptiste as a personality but the fact that baptiste had broken one hundred and thirty acres on his homestead and now had it ready for crop the first year of settlement and had wisely invested in another quarter upon which a girl had made proof delighted barr he admired the younger mans viewpoint and optimism so when barr was in town and the conversation happened around that way he was ever pleased to speak his praise of baptiste

it was the day of the indian episode when barr driving a team hitched to a spring wagon came to town hoping that the lumber yard had received the much needed coal

 and how about the coal cried barr to the lumberman before he drew his team to a stop

 coal a plenty replied the lumberman cheerfully

good good good exclaimed barr his distinguished old face lighting up with great delight

 yep let out the lumberman coming toward the buggy

 ive weighed you and round to the bin is the coal st

jean baptiste arrived last night â that is i think he got home last night although he brought the coal this morning two loads four tons

 eighty hundred pounds of coal you dont say and it was jean baptiste who brought it now say wasnt that great not another man on this whole reservation save he could have made it he ended admiringly

jean baptiste is the man who can bring it if anybody

rejoined the other

at this moment a large stout man came driving up in a one horse rig

any coal he called lazily from his seat

 plenty cried barr

 thank god exclaimed the other whose name was stark and who held the claim that cornered with the town on the northeast and therefore joined with the baptiste claim on the east

thank jean baptiste advised barr hes the man that brought it

so said stark thoughtfully when

yesterday

 yesterday

 thats what the lumberman said

 well ill be blowed  

 youll be warmed i guess

well i should say

 that baptiste is some fellow

 well yes although i sometimes think he is a fool

 oh not so rash 

 any mans a fool that would have left bonesteel with loads yesterday

 then i suppose we should be thankful to the fool a fools errand will in this case mean many lazy mens comfort

 and last summer you recall how it rained 

 i sure do

 well you know that fellow would go out and work in the rain

 and has a hundred and thirty acres ready and into crop while i have but thirty

 i have but ten but â

 you will be in the hole â at least behind at the end of this summer

 but im advertised to prove up

 and leave the country when you have done so

 well of course i have a house and lot and three acres back in iowa

 and jean baptiste has  acres in a few years he will have a rich wonderful farm that will be a factor in the local history and development of this country it will also mean something for posterity

 well i dont care

 you drew your land and got it free excepting four dollars an acre to the government baptiste bought his and paid for the relinquishment you were lucky but it will be up to jean baptiste and his kind to make the country

had they been as you appear to be we would perhaps all be in jerusalem or the jungle lets load the coal

 good lecture that muttered the lumberman when the two were at the bin  lots o truth in it too old stark needed it hes too lazy to hitch up a team so rides to town in that little buggy with one horse hitched to it

 what are you talking about  inquired another coming up at this moment

jean baptiste

so

 barr and stark have just had a setto about him

 mm  

 stark says a man that would come from bonesteel a day like yesterday was a fool

 why will he partake of the fuel he brought to keep from freezing then

well stark is too lazy to care hes advertised to prove up you know and he always has something to say about working

 used to come to town after the mail during the rainy spell last summer and upon seeing baptiste at work in the field cry just look at that fool nigger a workin in the rain  both laughed a few minutes later the town was thrown into an uproar over the incident related in the last chapter

now it happened that day that augustus m barr went to the postoffice and received a heavy envelope he glanced through the contents with a serious face and put the papers in his pocket on the way to his claim he took them out and went through them again and returned them to his pocket a few minutes later he reached into the pocket drew out what he thought to be the papers and silently tore them to threads and flung the bundle of paper to the winds

when jean baptiste left the town for his little sod house on the hill he saw a m barr just ahead of him he followed the same route that barr had taken and when he reached the draw on the town site that lay between his place and the town he espied some papers he picked them up continued on his way and presently observed the torn ball of paper that barr had cast away he idly opened the package he held he wondered at the contents and as he read them through he became curious the papers had to do with something between augustus m barr isaac syfe and peter kaden

 now that is singular he said to himself he continued to read through the papers and as he did so another fact became clear to him kaden was a sad character

and because he was so forlorn never cultivated any friendship lived alone and never visited the people had begun to regard him as crazy but now jean baptiste understood something that neither he nor any of the people in the country had dreamed of he read on he recalled that the summer before a young lady beautiful refined but strange at times had stayed at the barr claim barr had introduced her as his niece the people wondered at her seclusion she had a fine claim barr had come to him once and spoken about selling it stating that the girl had fallen heir to an estate in england and was compelled to return therewith    later he had succeeded in selling the place she had disappeared but he had never forgotten the expressions he had observed upon the face of christine

 he had thought it singular at the time but had thought little of it since he read further into the papers and learned about some other person a woman but concerning her he could gather nothing definite he could not understand about christine either except that she had fallen heir to nothing in england was not there but not more than three hundred miles from where he stood at that moment

but there was before him what he did understand and which was that there was something between augustus m

barr isaac syfe and peter kaden and something was going to happen the day before never since the night at the sod house had agnes stewart been the same person she could not seem to dismiss jean baptiste and the instance of her providence in getting lost and thereby saving him from her mind his strange words and singular recognition of her was baffling being so very curious therefore she had since learned that he was well known in the community and held in popular favor

she knew little and understood less with regard to predestination  but she had since meeting him recalled that he was the one she had seen in her dream â and loved she tried to laugh away such a freak but do what she might she grew more curious to see him again as the days passed to talk with him and learn at last what she was anxious to know â curious to know how did he come to utter her name and say that he had waited

and coincident with this she recalled anew what she had learned â which positively was littleâregarding her mother she had been told that she inherited that ones peculiarity that her mother had possessed rare eyes which in a measure explained her own but she had not been told or knew why her mother had arranged the legacy as she had not until the day before she was to marry must she know and then should she not have won a husband to herself by the time she had reached thirty she was to have the same then anyhow singular but in a sense practical

well it was so and she could only sigh and be patient

most girls she had known back in  nubbin ridge  were usually married by the time they had reached her present age but she was not quite like other girls and did not even have a beau

she wondered if the man she had saved had a sweetheart and when she thought of this she had a feeling that she would know in time and as the days passed she began at last to believe that in some manner he would play a part in her own life but agnes stewart was too innocent to know â at least appeared not to be aware of â the custom of the country and its law and therefore could not appreciate the invisible and socially invincible barrier between them twas only the man jean baptiste she saw and reckoned according to what she understood

therefore because she could get nowhere in her wonderings as a diversion she turned to the little diary and recorded therein january th  â i have not had the patience since arriving here to record any of the events that have transpired since we left indiana we have been here now nearly three weeks have not as yet had time to draw any conclusion with regard to the country but this much i can cheerfully say â and which did not prevail back where we came from â there is spirit in the country the spirit of the pioneer

the weather has been cold cold every day since we arrived because we ran out of urgent provisions soon after coming here i ventured to go to gregory which is seven miles distant for some more i have been too much upset over what took place on that memorable trip to say much about it because i have never kept anything from him i told papa how i started from the town became lost and stayed all night at a house and saved a man thereby he has been so frightened over what happened that he will not let me go anywhere alone again â not even in the daytime

 just think my girl he has said time and again  supposing you had not stumbled into that house you would surely have frozen to death on the plains   i somehow feel that dolly would have brought me home but that is a matter for conjecture but what i say to papa in return is  had i not gotten lost that man that is known so well about the country must surely have suffered death  this seems to pacify him and he is pleased after all to know that my getting lost was so provident and opportune

he has met the man jean baptiste such an odd name and likes him very much â in fact he is very much carried away with him i have not seen him since the morning i left him at his sod house but i cannot get out of my mind the events that passed while i was there always i can see him look up into my eyes with that strange recognition and then as he turned call  agnes it is you im glad you have come for ive waited for you so long what that means i would give most half my life to know i know that i shall never rest in peace until i have become well enough acquainted with him to ask him why and how he knew me

then followed the morning when he talked to himself and did not know i heard it is all so vivid in my mind

of late i have had an uncontrollable desire i have wanted to know more of my mother it seems that if i could have known her i would understand myself better

 am positive now that she must have been a rare person

that she was french and very high tempered papa has told me and also that she had lived in the west indies before he met her but that she was born in france as to the legacy he lays that to her peculiarity she was always peculiar in a way says he and that at all times she was mysterious she had been over almost all the world and was wise in many things he thinks i have inherited much of her wit and that eventually it will express itself in some manner which is all so strange i hope however it will

to rise in some manner out of the simple uneventful life ive lived would certainly be appreciated but whatever it is i cannot conclude

should i ever rise in any way i feel now it would be due in some manner to my meeting that strange colored man

i have wondered so often since meeting him how it feels to be a negro papa and i have discussed it often since

i understand there is a sort of prejudice against the race in this country that in the south they are held down and badly treated that in the north even they are not fairly treated papa and i were both agreed about it we cannot understand why one should be disliked because his skin is dark or because his ancestors were slaves but withal i cannot understand how one could deal unfairly with them because of this it is said that some of the race are very ignorant and vicious that they very often commit the unspeakable crime i suppose that is possible if so then they should be educated take this jean baptiste for instance an educated man and what a gentleman but papa he is very vindictive he says that only about half the colored people in this country are full blood that in the days of slavery and since even the white man who is very often ready to abuse the black men has been the cause of this mixture  i should think their consciences would disturb them

oh well i am glad that i have grown up where prejudice against races is not a custom my mother was french my father scotch all through and because i know him and am so ingrained with his liberal traditions â even tho he be poorâ i am at peace with all mankind

we havent all the money we need and the fact worries me papa says he will hire bill to some one if any one should need help it might be that the colored man will hire him maybe they say he is going to hire a man

papa intends to speak to him about it the only thing that worries us is that we have to explain that weakness in bill and george george is impossible too slow talks too much and would never earn his salt but if one is patient with bill until he catches on he is an excellent worker and faithful i wish the colored man would give him the job

pie owns the quarter that corners with us which he expects to complete breaking out and putting into flax next summer so we are told if bill could get that job it would be handy handy for bill for mr baptiste and for us

we have not met many people as yet because it is so cold to get out i havent met any so to speak but papa appears to be getting acquainted right along we are going to town â to gregory again saturday i am looking forward to it with pleasant anticipation i sincerely trust it will be a beautiful day in the meantime the clock has struck one papa is turning over in bed and i can hear him ill hear his voice presently so i will close this with hopes that saturday will be a beautiful day and that ill meet and become acquainted with some nice people

an enterprising young man when jean baptiste had found the papers belonging to barr and had come to understand that it had been barrs intention to destroy the same natural curiosity had prompted him to read into and examine what was in his possession

but after having read them and realizing fully to return the same then would be to have barr know at least feel that he was in possession of such a grave secret would make their up to this time agreeable relationship rather awkward he was at a loss as to what to do so in the end he laid the papers away and waited if barr should make inquiries for them he would try to find some convenient way to return the same but on after thought he knew that barr would hardly start an inquiry about the matter â even if he did come to realize he had lost instead of destroyed the papers

a few days later he saw peter kaden in the village and this time observed him more closely than had been his wont theretofore always sad he so remained and down in baptistes heart he was sorry for the wretch it was after he had returned home and lingered at the fire that he heard a light knock at the door he called  come in the door was opened and augustus m barr stood in the doorway

baptiste was for a time slightly nervous he was glad then that it was dark within the room otherwise barr must have seen him give a quick start

 ahha began barr cheerfully coming forward and taking the chair baptiste placed at his disposal  quite comfortable in the little sod house on the claim

 quite comfortable returned baptiste evenly his mind upon the papers so near he didnt trust himself to comment he waited for whatever was to happen

 suppose you are thinking about the big crop you will seed in the springtime ventured barr

 yes admitted baptiste for in truth the same had been on his mind before barr put in his appearance  suppose you will put out quite a crop yourself in the spring he ventured in return

 well i dont know said barr thoughtfully  i fear im getting a little old to farm â and this baching

baptiste thought about christine who was not so far away instead of in england    he marveled at the mans calm nerve it did not seem possible that a man of this ones broad education could be so low as to resort to fallacies

 no he heard barr again  i dont think that i shall farm next summer in fact i have about decided to make proof on my claim and that is what i have called on you in regard to i suppose i can count you as witness to the fact baptiste was relieved barr still thought he had destroyed the papers he was smiling when he replied  indeed i shall be glad to attest to the fact you refer to

 thanks said barr and rose to go

 no hurry

 i must go into town on a matter of business said barr from the doorway  well he paused briefly and then said  i am applying for a date and when that is settled i shall let you know

 very well good day

 good day my friend and he went over the hill

baptiste was thoughtful when he was gone he looked after him and thought about the papers he marveled again at the mans calmness    then suddenly he arose as a thought struck him and going to his trunk lifted from the top the last issue of the dallas enterprise he glanced quickly through the columns and then his eyes rested on a legal notice he smiled

 old peter is going to make proof  so is barr

the eternal triangle begins to take shape    he got up and went to the door over the hill he saw barr just entering the town     this is beginning to get interesting    but i dont like the kaden end of it  i wish i could do something    something to help kaden   

saturday was a beautiful day to gregory from miles around went almost everybody so along with the rest went jean baptiste he fostered certain hopesâ had ulterior purposes in view firstly it was a nice day the town he knew would be filled and secondly he was subtly interested in kaden he had seen by the paper that he was advertised to make proof that day on his homestead   

another thing whenever he thought of kaden he could not keep barr and syfe and lastly christine out of his mind   

he found the little town filled almost to overflowing when he arrived teams were tied seemingly to every available post the narrow board walks were crowded the saloons were full red liquor was doing its bit while the general stores were alive with girls women and children

a jovial day was ahead and old friendships were revived and new ones made there is about a new country an air of hopefulness that is contagious here in this land had come the best from everywhere the best because they were for the most part hopeful and courageous that great army of discontented persons that have been the forerunners of the new world mingled in the crowd jean baptiste regarded the unusual conglomeration of kinds there were germans from germany and there were swedes from sweden danes from denmark norwegians from norway

there were poles and finns and lithuanians and russians there were french and a few english but of his race he was the only one

as a whole the greater portion were from the northern parts of the united states and he was glad that they were

with them there was no  negro problem and he was glad there was not the world was too busy to bother with such he was glad to know he could work unhampered he was looked at curiously by many to the young a man of his skin was something rare something new he smiled over it with equal amusement and then in a store he walked right into agnes the first time he had seen her since the morning at the sod house he was greatly surprised and rather flustratedâ and was glad again his skin was dark

she could not see the blood that went to his face while with her it showed most furiously

as the meeting was unexpected all she had thought and felt in the weeks since came suddenly to the surface in her expression in spite of her effort at self control her blushing face evidenced her confusion upon seeing him again

but with an effort she managed to bow courteously while he was just as dignified they would have passed and gone their ways had it not been that in that instant another a lady a neighbor and friend of baptistes came upon them

she had become acquainted with agnes that day and was very fond of baptiste although her name was reynolds she was a red blooded german sociable kind and obliging

she had not observed that they had exchanged greetings â did not know obviously that the two were acquainted wherefore her neighborly instincts became assertive

coming forward volubly anxiously she caught baptiste by the hand and shook it vigorously  mr baptiste mr

baptiste  she cried punctuating the hand shaking with her voice full of joy her red healthy face beaming with smiles

how very glad i am to see you you have not been to see us for an age and i have asked tom where you were

we feared you had gone off and done something serious

whereupon she winked mischievously baptiste understood and smiled

 you are certainly looking well for an old bachelor she commented after releasing his hand and looking into his face seriously albeit amusedly mischievously  we were at dallas and got some of the coal you were brave enough to bring from bonesteel that awful cold day my jean you certainly are possessed with great nerve while that coal to everybody was a godsend yet think of the risk you took why supposing you had gotten lost in that terrific storm lost as people have been in the west before

you must be careful she admonished kindly  you are really too fine a young man to go out here and get frozen to death indeed  baptiste started perceptibly she regarded him questioningly unconsciously his eyes wandered toward agnes who stood near absorbed in all mrs

reynolds had been saying his eyes met hers briefly and the events of the night at the sod house passed through the minds of both the next moment they looked away and mrs reynolds not understanding glanced toward agnes

she was by disposition versatile but she caught her breath now with sudden equanimity as she turned to agnes and cried  oh miss stewart you  she smiled with her usual delight and going toward agnes caught her arm affectionately and then with face still beaming she turned to where baptiste stood

 i want you miss stewart she said with much ostentation  to meet one of our neighbors and friends one of the most enterprising young men of the country mr jean baptiste mr baptiste miss agnes stewart she did it gracefully and for a time was overcome by her own vanity

in the meantime the lips of both those before her parted to say that they had met and then slowly understandingly they saw that this would mean to explain    their faces lighted with the logic of meeting formally and greetings were exchanged to fit the occasion

for the first time he was permitted to see her to regard her as the real agnes there was no embarrassment in her face but composure as she extended her small ungloved hand this time and permitted it to rest lightly in his palm she smiled easily as she accepted his ardent gaze and showed a row of even white teeth momentarily before turning coquetishly away

he regarded her intimately in one sweep of his eyes

she accepted this also with apparent composure she was now fully normal in her composition that about her which others had understood and were inspired to call beautiful now seemed to strangely affect him

was it because he was hungry for womans love because since he had looked upon this land of promise and out of the visions she had come to him in those long silent days because of his lonely young life there in the sod house she had communed with him was it that he had imagined her sweet radiance that now caused him to feel that she was beautiful

she had looked away only briefly as if to give him time to think to consider her and then she turned her eyes upon him again she regarded him frankly then albeit admiringly she wanted to hear him say something she was not herself aware of how anxious she was to hear him speak for him to say anything would please her and as she stood before him in her sweet innocence all the goodness she possessed the heart and desire always to be kind to do for others as she had always was revealed to him his dream girl she was and in reality she had not disappointed him

if visionary he had loved her he now saw her and what was hers her wondrous hair rolled into a frivolous knot at the back of her head made her face appear the least slender when it was really square the chestnut glint of it seemed to contrast coquettishly with her white skin and the life the healthy cheerful life that now gave vigor to her blood brought faint red roses to her cheeks roses that seemed to come and go her red lips seemed to tempt him he was captivated he forgot in this intimate survey that she was of one race while he jean baptiste was of another

   and that between their two races the invisible barrier the barrier which while invisible was so absolute so strong so impossible of melting that it was best for the moment that he forget it

while all he saw passed in a moment he regarded her slenderness as she stood buttoned in the long coat and wondered how she so slight and fragile had been able to lift his heavy frame upon the bed where he had found himself and still before words had passed between them lie saw her again and that singularity in the eyes had come back they were blue and then they were brown but withal they were so baffling he did not seem to understand her when they were like this yet when so he felt strangely a greater right the right to look into and feast in what he saw regardless of the custom of the country and its law    and still while he was not aware of it jean baptiste came to feel that there was something between them

though infinite in the life that was to come he now came strangely to feel sure that he was to know her to become more intimately acquainted with her and with this consciousness he relaxed the spell that had come from meeting her again from being near her from holding her hand in his though formally the exchange of words passed and he gradually became his usual self the self that had always been his in this land where others than those of the race to which he belonged were the sole inhabitants he was relieved when he heard mrs reynolds voice  miss stewart and her folks have just moved out from indiana jean and are renting on the watson place over east of you the place that corners with the quarter you purchased last fall you understand

 indeed  baptiste echoed with feigned ignorance his eyebrows dilating

 yes she went on with concern  and you are neighbors

 im glad â honored baptiste essayed

 he is flattering blushed agnes but she was pleased

 and youll find mr baptiste the finest kind of neighbor too cried mrs reynolds with equal delight

 im a bad neighbor miss stewart he disdained  our friend here mrs reynolds you see is full of flattery

 i dont believe so mr baptiste she defended glad to be given an opportunity to speak we have just become acquainted but papa has told me of her and the family and im sure we will be the best of friends wont we she ended with her eyes upon mrs reynolds

bless you yes who could keep from liking you

whereupon she caught agnes close and kissed her impulsively

 oh say now cried baptiste and then stopped

 youre not a woman laughed mrs reynolds  but you understand she added reprovingly suddenly her face lit up with a new thought and the usual smiling gave way to seriousness as she cried  by the way jean we hear that you are going to hire a man this spring and that reminds me that miss stewarts father has two boys â her brothers â whom he has not work enough nor horses enough to use so he wishes to hire one out she paused to observe agnes who had also become serious and was looking up at her

at this point she turned to baptiste and with a slight hesitation she said do you really wish to hire a man â mrâ a â mr

baptiste   saying it had heightened her color and the anxiety in her tone caused her to appear more serious she had turned her eyes up to his and he was for the instant captivated again with the thought that she was beautiful his answer however was calm

 i must have a man he acknowledged  i have more work than i can do alone

 why papa wishes to hire bill â it was natural to say bill because it was bill they always hired although george was the older but since we know why george was never offered we return to her  i should say william she corrected awkwardlv and with an effort she cast it out of her mind and went on  so if â if you think you could â a â use him or would care to give him the job she was annoyed with the fact that bill was halfwitted and it confused her which explains the slight catches in her voice

but bravely she continued  that is if you have not already given some one else the job you could speak to papa and he would be pleased im sure she ended with evident relief but the thought that had confused her being still in her mind her face was dark with a confusion that he did not understand

hoping to relieve the annoyance he could see although not understanding the cause of it he spoke up quickly

 i have not hired a man and have no other in sight so your suggestion miss regarding your brother meets with my favor i will endeavor therefore to see your father today if possible if not later and discuss the matter pro and con

he had made it so easy for her and she was overly gracious as she attempted to have him understand in some manner that her brother was afflicted so her effort this time was a bit braver notwithstanding as anxious however as before

 oh papa will be glad to have my brother work for you and i wish you would â would please not hire any other until you have talked with him she paused again as if to gather courage for the final drive

you will find my brother faithful and honest and a good worker but â butâ it seemed that she could not avoid the break in her voice when she came to this all embarrassing point  but sometimes â he â he makes mistakes he is a little awkward a little bunglesome in starting but if you would â could exercise just a little patience for a few days â a day i am sure he would please you

it was out at last she was sure he would understand

it had cost her such an effort to try to make it plain without just coming out and saying he was halfwitted she was not aware that in concluding she had done so appealingly he had observed it and his mans heart went out to her in her distress he remembered then too although he had on their first meeting forgotten that he had been told all about her brothers and had also heard of her

 you need have no fear there miss stewart he wilfully lied  i am the most patient man in the world

he wondered then at himself that he could lie so easily

his one great failing was his impatience and he knew it

because he did and felt that he tried to crush it was his redeeming feature in this respect but the words had lightened her burden and there was heightening of her color as she spoke now with unfeigned delight  oh that is indeed kind of you i am so glad to hear you say so bill is a good hand â everybody likes him after he has worked a while it is because he is a little awkward and forgetful in the beginning that worries my father and me so im glad you know now and will not be impatient

in truth while she did not know it jean was pleased with the prospect he had not lived two years in the country the new country without having experienced the difficulty that comes with the usual hired man the class of men with the exception of a homesteader who came to the country for work usually fell into the pastime of gambling and drinking which seemed to be contagious and many were the griefs they gave those by whom they were employed and jean baptiste now that she had made it plain regarding her brother had something to say himself

there is one little thing i should like to mention miss stewart he said with apparent seriousness she caught her breath with renewed anxiety as she returned his look

in the next instant she was relieved however as he said  you understand that i am baching a bachelor and the fareof bachelors is i trust you will appreciate not always the best he paused as he thought of how she must feel after having seen the way he kept his house and hoped that she could overlook the condition in which she knew he kept it but if he was embarrassed at the thought of it it was not so with her for her sympathy went out to him

she was conscious of how inconvenient it must be to bach to live alone as he was doing and to work so hard

 it is not always to hired mens liking to forego the meals that only women can prepare and for that reason it is sometimes difficult for us to keep men

 oh you will not have to worry as to that mr baptiste she assured hint pleasantly she caught her breath with something joyous apparently as she turned to him

 you see we live almost directly between your two places and my brother can stay home and save you that trouble and bother she was glad that she could be of assistance to him in some way though it be indirectly with sudden impulse she turned to mrs reynolds who had not interrupted   it will be nice now wont it  

just dandy the other agreed readily i am so glad we all three met here she went on  in meeting we have fortunately been of some service to each other you will find mr baptiste a fine fellow to work for we let our boys go over and help him out when hes pushed and we know he appreciates it to the fullest she halted turned now mischievously to baptiste and cried  we are always after jean that he should marry why just think what a good husband he would make some nice girl she had found her topic had mrs reynolds of all topics she preferred to jolly the single with getting married to anything else so she went on with delight

 he goes off down to chicago every winter and we wait to see the girl when he returns but always he disappoints us she affected a frown a moment before resuming  it is certainly too bad that some good girl must do without a home and the happiness that is due her while he lives there alone having no comfort but what he gets when he goes visiting she affected to appear serious and to have him feel it while he could do nothing but grin awkwardly

oh mrs reynolds youre hard on a fellow my

give him a chance it takes two to make a bargain i cant marry myself he caught the eyes of agnes who was enjoying his tender expression indeed the subject appealed to him and he had found it to his liking she blushed she enjoyed the humor

 i suspect mrs reynolds speaks the truth she said with affected seriousness but found it impossible to down the color in her flaming cheeks nevertheless

 oh but you two can jolly a fellow lie became serious now as he went on  cut it isnt fair there is no girl back in chicago there is no girl anywhere for me

he was successful in his affectation of self pity and her feelings went out to him in her words that followed  now that is indeed too bad for him mrs reynolds isnt it perhaps he is telling the truth the girls in chicago do not always understand the life out here and cannot make one feel very much encouraged she wondered at her own words but she went on nevertheless

 even back in indiana they do not understand the west

they are â seem to be so narrow they feel that they are living in the only place of civilization on earth her logical statement took away the joke they became serious

the store was filling and the crowd was pushing so they parted

a few minutes later as baptiste passed down the street he saw peter kaden coming from the commissioners office

across the way he observed barr and syfe stop and exchange a few words the next moment they went their two ways while he stood looking after them

 christine christine

one week from the day peter kaden made proof at gregory on the homestead he held the court record showed that he had transferred the same to some unknown person in the course of events it was not noticed by the masses it was because jean baptiste was expecting something of the kind that he happened to observe the record of the transfer in the following weeks issue of the paper

he couldnt get the incident out of his mind and he found his eyes wandering time and again in the direction of the house of augustus m barr in the days that followed

from what he had gleaned from the papers he was sure that something sinister was to occur in that new land soon

he tried in vain to formulate some plan of action â rather some plan of prevention but the plot the intrigue or whatever it may be called was deep it had taken root before either had ever seen the country they now called home

and because of its intricate nature he could formulate no plan toward combatting the thing he felt positively in his veins was to take place

over the hill two miles and more the claim shack of peter kaden could not be seen but he could always feel where it was and the events that went on therein this healthy but sad forlorn german had aroused his sympathy and always when he thought of him strangely he thought of christine

the days passed slowly and things went on as usual

he saw barr occasionally and as often saw the dark syfe

he read as was his wont and then one evening when his few chores were done he had a desire to walk lie drew on his overcoat and taking a bucket he walked slowly down the slope that led up to his house to the well a quarter mile distant he could never after account for the strange feeling that came and went as he ambled toward the well he reached it in due time filled his bucket and was in the act of returning when out of the night he caught the unmistakable sound of horses hoofs some one on horseback was coming he set the bucket down and bent his ears more keenly to hear the sound

yes they were hoof beats an unusual clatter he gave a start only one horse in the neighborhood made such a noise with the hoofs when moving for he had heard the same before and that horse belonged to a m barr and was a pacer christine had use to ride him and when he recalled it he became curious christine was not there he knew unless she had come that day which was not likely    then ivho rode the horse he had never seen barr on horseback    they were coming from about where barrs house stood coming in his direction along the road he estimated at that moment they must be about a quarter of a mile away he listened intently onward they came drawing closer all the while he got an inspiration why should he be seen he moved back from the road some distance there was no moon and the night was dark but the stars filled the night air with a dim ray

he lay upon the ground as the horseman drew nearer

presently out of the shadow he caught the dim outline of the rider he saw that a heavy ulster was worn and the collar of the same was around the riders neck almost concealing the head but he recognized the rider as a m barr

 now where can he be going he muttered to himself standing erect as he listened to the hoof beats on the road below he pondered briefly  why does he never ride in the daytime from down the road the sound of hoof beats continued and then baptiste was again inspired

 kaden  he cried and fell into deep thought

at his left was a small creek usually dry this stream led in an angling direction down toward the larger stream south of the town it led directly toward the claim of peter kaden although the homestead lay beyond the creek

by following it one could reach kadens house in about twothirds the distance if going by trail

a few minutes later jean baptiste was speedily following the route that led to the creek he paused at intervals and upon listening could hear the hoof beats along the trail in the inevitable direction hie reached the creek in a short time found his way across it and once on the other side he hurried through a school section to kadens cabin that was joined with this on the south he crossed the school section quickly and in the night air he could smell and presently came to see the smoke curling from the chimney

he approached the house cautiously he was glad that poor kaden didnt keep a dog when he had drawn close enough to distinguish the objects before him he saw barrs horse tied out of the wind on the south side of the little barn he looked closer and observed another near he reckoned that one to be syfes  so the triangle is forming he muttered

he went up to the house noiselessly he passed around its dark side to where he saw light emanating from the small window he peered cautiously through it sitting on the side of the bed kadens face met his gaze he regarded it briefly before seeking out the others never he felt if he lived a hundred years would he ever forget the expression of agony that face wore upon its usual roundness perceptible lines had formed in the light of the dim lamp he caught the darkness about the eyes the skin under almost sagging and swollen he permitted his gaze to drift further and to take in the proportions of the room

on a stool near sat syfe the jew he wore his overcoat indeed baptiste could not recall having ever seen him without it about him also he wore his thick dark cap his little mustache stood out over the small mouth between the lips of which reposed the usual cigarette he was drawing away easily at this while his ears appeared to be attentive to what was going on he was listening to barr who stood in the center of the room talking in much excitement making gestures while he could see the agonized kaden protesting he could not catch all that was being said but some of it barr in particular he observed while speaking forcibly was nevertheless controlled it was kaden whose voice reached his ears more often on the outside

 i kept you from australia    this from barr

 they had you on shipboard    your carcass would be fit for the vultures now on that sand swept desert you were headed for  

 but i was innocent i was innocent protested kaden

 i didnt go to russia that trip i didnt go to russia and to jerusalem i have never been 

 but you hadnt proved it you were done for they had you and all you could do or say wouldnt have kept you in england it was i me do you understand    you do understand that i kept you from going i me who saved you no law in this land could keep you here if they knew now where you were  

 but you forget christine my poor christine you have her is that not enough  oh you are hard you drive me most insane tell me about christine give her back to me and all is yours

a wind rose suddenly out of the west a shed stood near a shed covered over with hay and some poles that had been cut green and the now dry leaves gave forth a moaning sound he saw those inside start with the noise baptiste knew he could hear no more and might be apprehended stealthily he departed

and all the way to the sod house that night he kept repeating what he had heard  christine christine you have her is she not enough give her back and all is yours

if he could only ascertain what was between kaden and christine â but it was all coming to something soon and he knew that augustus m barr was taking the advantage of some one that kaden was innocent but couldnt prove it that syfe was in some way darkly connected and the eternal triangle held to its sinister purpose

you have never been this way before when agnes stewart found her father and they were ready to return home she inquired did he see you

 see who you you dont understand i mean the colored gentleman mr baptiste

 why no my dear her father replied wonderingly

 i saw him but i had no word with him i dont understand

 why i met him mrs reynolds who knows you â she and i became acquainted and we met and had a long talk with mr baptiste and he is going to hire a man so we discussed bill he said he would see you her father drew the team to a stop

 i dont understand i should see him and i did but he was talking with some fellows who live north of town

i think it was about horses he went with them so i suppose we may as well go on home and see him later

 im so sorry she said and showed it in her face  i had hoped he would get to see you and that it would all be settled and bill would get the job

 dont be so out of hope said he i have no doubt that we will get to see mr baptiste and talk it over

 i am worried because â you know papa when we have paid for the seed and feed we will have very little left

 such a wonderful such a thoughtful little girl i have

he said admiringly stroking her hand fondly in the meantime  i cant imagine how i could get along without my aggie

 see him and get bill hired and ill not worry any more

 ill do so ill do so tomorrow

 you say you saw him going north of town

yes

she was silent while he was thoughtful presently he inquired of what passed when she met him

she told him

 i never spoke of having met him before

you didnt

 why no papa how could i  it would be hard to explain

 well now coming to think of it it would wouldnt it 

 it shouldnt she said she didnt relish the situation

did he

 what

 speak of it

 oh no he didnt   

 i wonder has he ever

 i dont think so

 that is very thoughtful of him

 it is he is a real gentleman

 so everybody says

 and so pleasant to listen to

 indeed

 mrs reynolds is carried away with him says hes one of the most industrious and energetic young men of the country

isnt that fine but it seems rather odd doesnt it

him out here alone

 it is indeed singular but he is just the kind of man a new country needs

 if the country had a few hundred more like him we wouldnt know it in five years

in three years  she said admiringly

 how shall we explain in regards to bill    

 ive explained

you have

 oh i didnt come out and say it in words of course i didnt need to

 then how how did you make him understand 

 it was easy it was easy because he is so quick witted

he seems to readily understand anything

ill bet

 he spoke of the fact that being a bachelor it was awkward to keep hired men and this fact seemed to worry him

 but why didnt you explain that bill could stay home 

 i did

oh

 and he was so relieved

 im sure he was it is very inconvenient

 it is and i feel rather sorry for him

 needs a wife

she was silent

wonder why he doesnt marry

 i dont know

will make some girl a fine husband

silence

 i guess he has a girl though and will likely marry soon

 i dont think so

 why

well she said slowly she blushed unseen and went on  mrs reynolds joked him about it and he denied it

 but any man would do that they like to be modest to appear like they have no loves it creates sympathy

men are sentimental too they like sympathy

 yes i suppose so she said slowly thoughtfully  but i dont think he has a girl in my mind he is a poor lonesome fellow just like he has no close friends    

he was silent now

 i have thought about it since i met him

you have

 why yes certainly

her father laughed

why are you laughing she asked somewhat nettled

 i was thinking

 thinking  thinking of what  

 of jean baptiste

 what do you mean 

 why there is a good chance for you

father

why not

 father how can you  

he laughed she acted as if angry he looked at her mischievously she did not grant him a smile

 tut tut aggie cant you take a joke 

 but you should not joke like that

 oh come now it pleased me to joke like that

 why should it please you  

 why i have a sense of humor

a sense of humor

 yes

 but i dont see the joke 

 why aggie he turned to her seriously  almost i dont think it is a joke

 father 

 well dear you seem to be so interested in the man

 father oh father and the next instant she was crying

he reached out and caught her fondly to him my girl my girl i didnt intend to upset you now be papas little darling and dont cry any more

 you have never been this way before she sobbed

he caressed her more now

well dearest you see well your motherâ

 my mother  she sat quickly up

 we are going to raise a great crop this year i feel sure of it

 but my mother

 i think i know where i can get some good seed oats

they rode along in silence the rest of the way consumed with their own thoughts no words passed but agnes was thinking she would never get out of her mind what her father had started to say but he had stopped in time    her mind went back to the strange incidents in her life she lived over again the day she had looked in the mirror and had seen that strange look she connected it singularly with what her father had started to say she was silent thereafter but her soul was on fire

what jean baptiste pound in the well well my friend said a m barr stopping before baptistes hut one day shortly after his visit to kadens  i have my date and will make proof on the nd of march i have listed you as one of my witnesses guess i may depend on you to be ready that day 

 i shall remember it mr barr answered baptiste

 have you rented your place yet

 no i have not rather not the buildings my neighbor across the road however will put the thirty acres i have broken into crop and break a few more

 mm

 how much do you plan seeding this season 

all of both places anyhow

ah young man i tell you you are a worker such young men as you will be the making of this country

and youll be rich in time

 oh no cried baptiste disdainfully

 if i were young and strong like you i would be doing the same

 you expect to go away when you have completed your proof  

 well i dont know whereupon a m barr cast a furtive glance in his direction baptiste pretended not to see it

whatll you do with your horses another furtive glance

 well i might advertise a sale he said boldly he cast a dark look in baptistes direction which the other pretended not to see â but did see nevertheless  why what could he know was in barrs mind  nothing he answered his own question a moment later he was the same barr the officious englishman when he drove down the road a few minutes later and none the wiser therefor

march the twentysecond came and went and augustus offered proof on his homestead and passed baptiste assisting him as witness

sunday was the next day and when it came all calm and beautiful baptiste realized that he did not have enough seed wheat to sow all his land that he wished put in wheat

a squaw man had raised a large crop to the southwest of him the year before and this he understood was for sale

he decided to call on the squaw man ascertain the fact and if so purchase a share of it for his purpose

accordingly sunday morning after he had breakfasted and piled the dishes bachelor fashion unwashed he started out

the route he took carried him directly by peter kadens claim and when he had gone that far and found himself looking at the low sod house that stood a few paces back from the road he was curious he paused unconsciously before the house and observed it idly a few moments

he was struck with the quietness about and at once became curiously apprehensive no smoke emerged from the chimney there was no evidence that any one was about

impelled by his growing curiosity he approached the house and knocked at the door there was no response from within he tried it again still no response he tried the knob it gave he pushed the door open cautiously and peered in the house was empty but for the crude furniture he entered curiously and looked about the bed was spread over there was no fire in the stove the coldness of the atmosphere within impressed him with a theory that no fire had been in the stove that day or the night before

the dishes were clean and piled on the table with a cloth spread over them he went outside closing the door behind him and swept the surrounding country with his gaze which revealed no peter kaden he lowered his eyes in thought as his lips muttered  wonder where he is 

a path began at his feet it led down to a draw some two hundred yards away he fell into it aimlessly and followed its course for a short way presently upon looking up he saw a well at the side of the draw which obviously was the terminus of the path

forthwith he made the well his objective in that country wells were not plentiful the soil was of the richest and blackest loam with a clay subsoil but water except where there was sand was not easily found only in or near a draw or a flat he reached the well and drawing aside the bucket that reposed on the lid he opened the well and lowered the bucket to the water some thirty feet below

the bright sun rays somewhat blinded him and for a moment he could not see the water clearly the bucket struck in due time however and he wondered why there was no splash pie jerked it over and when it struck again there was the sound of water but it appeared difficult to sink it he peered down into it again to ascertain what the matter was a wave of ripples caught his gaze while the bucket seemed to be resting on something he gave the rope another jerk and twist and it came down bottomside up on the dark object

 hell he muttered  this well is dry he took another look  no it isnt dry there is something in the well bending until his face was shaded by the shadow of the well he searched below very closely with his eyes

he could distinguish that there was something and that the something seemed to bobble he withdrew the bucket unfilled and allowing a few moments for the ripples to subside he searched the darkness below again closely

he became conscious of a cold feeling stealing up his spine then he caught and held his breath as slowly what was below took outline it was not a dog a coyote a pig or an animal of any kind it was something else    and the something else had features that were familiar at last realization was upon him his fingers gripped the boards they held as he gradually straightened up

 my god he cried at last terror stricken

for below him with white face turned upward as if laughing was the dead body of peter kaden

miss stewart receives a caller coincident with the finding of peter kadens body in the well certain things became public with regard to others but to complete this part of it after finding the body jean baptiste hurried into dallas and gave the alarm excitement ran high for a time and as it was sunday in a few hours the spot around the well was crowded from over all the reservation the people came and the consensus of opinion was that it was suicide   

perhaps jean baptiste was the only one who had his doubts

if it was suicide then he was positive it was a precipitated suicide

until the coroner arrived there was no disposition made of the remains and when he did the decision of suicide was sustained

since the man baptiste had started to see was brought to the spot by the excitement the business in hand was settled thereupon and that evening he went to call on the stewarts with a view to hiring bill

he found agnes alone but was invited to enter from her expression he could see that he was expected and while he waited for her father who had gone across the road they fell into amiable conversation

 springtime is knocking at our door he ventured

 and i am glad to see it and suppose you are also she answered

 who isnt it has been a very severe winter

 i think so too are the winters here as a rule as cold as this one has been how modest he thought she was

she was dressed neatly in a satin shirtwaist and tailored skirt while from beneath the skirts her small feet incased in heavy shoes peeped like mice her neck rose out of her bodice and he thought her throat was so very round and white while he noticed her prominent chin more today than he had before he liked it nature had been his study and he didnt like a retreating chin it to his mind was an indication of weak will with exceptions perhaps here and there he reposed more confidence in the person however when the chin was like hers so naturally he was interested as she sat before him with folded hands he also observed her heavy hair done into braids and gathered about her head it gave her an unostentatious expression while her eyes were as he had found them before baffling

 why no they are not he said  of course i have not seen many â in fact this is the second but i am advised that as a rule the winters are very mild for this latitude

 i see i hope they will always be so if we continue to live here and she laughed pleasantly

 how do you like it in our country he inquired now pleased to be in conversation with her

 why i like it very well she replied amiably  what i have seen of it i think i would as soon live here as back in indiana

 i have been in indiana myself

you have she was cheered with the fact he nodded

yes all over what part of indiana do you come from

rensselaer she replied shifting with comfort and delighted that by his having been in indiana he was making their conversation easier

 oh i see she heard him  that is toward the northern part of the state

 yes she replied in obvious delight

 i have never been to that town but i have been all around it

 well well  she was at a loss in the moment how to proceed and then presently she said  you have traveled considerably mr baptiste i understand

he felt somewhat flattered to know that she had discussed him with others apparently

 well yes i have he replied slowly

 that must be fine i long so much to travel

you have not traveled far

 no from indiana to western kansas where we were most starved out and then back to indiana and out here

he laughed she also joined in and they felt nearer each other by it

and how do you like it mr baptiste

 out here you mean  

yes why yes of course she added hastily  why i like it fine im thoroughly in love with the country

 thats nice and you own such nice land i dont wonder she said thoughtfully

 oh well he replied modestly  i think i should like it anyhow

of course but when one has property â such nice land as you own they have everything to like it for

 im compelled to agree with you

 im sorry we dont own any she said regretfully

 but of course in a way we are not entitled to we didnt get in  on the ground floor therefore we must be satisfied as renters

pie was silent but attentive

 papa never seems to have been very fortunate it may be due to his quaint old fashioned manner but he has never owned any land at all poor fellow she said the last more to herself than to him he was interested and continued to listen

 we went to western kansas with a little money and very good stock and were dried out two years straight and the third year when we had a good crop with a chance to get back at least a little of what we had lost along came a big hail storm and pounded everything into the ground

 wasnt that too bad he cried sympathetically

 it sure was it is awfully discouraging to work as hard and to have sacrificed as much as we had and then come out as we did it just took all the ambition out of him

 i shouldnt wonder he commented tenderly

and then we went back to indiana â broke of course and having no money and no stock because we had to sell what we had left to get out of western kansas so since  beggars cant be choosers  we had to take what we could get and that was a poor farm in a remote part of indiana in a little place that was so poor that the corn was all nubbins they called it nubbin ridge 

he laughed and she had to also when she thought of it

 well we were able to live and pay a little on some more stock because my brothers didnt take much to run around with like other boys but stayed home and worked we finally succeeded in getting just a little something together again and then a real estate man came along and told us about this place so here we are she bestowed a smile upon him and sighed she had told more of themselves than she had intended but it had been a pleasant diversion at that moreover she was delighted because he was such an attentive listener

 so that is how you came here he essayed  i have enjoyed listening to you your lives read like an interesting book

oh that isnt fair you are joking with me notwithstanding she blushed furiously

 no no indeed he protested

she believed him strangely she reposed such confidence in the man that she felt she could sit and talk with him forever

 but it is certainly too bad that you have been so unfortunate i am sure it will not always be so you are perseverant i see and  riches come to him who waits 

 an old saying but i hope it will not wait too long

papa is getting old and â my brothers would be unable to manage with any effect alone   he understood her and the incident was overlooked

 your mother is dead 

â yes my mother is dead mr baptiste

 oh

 died when i was a baby

 well well 

 i never knew her

well i do say he paused briefly while she was silent but thinking deeply    thinking of what her father had started to say and never finished

and i venture to say that you have just about raised yourself

she blushed

 you must be a wonderful girl

she blushed again and twisted her hands about she tried to protest but couldnt trust herself to say anything just then how she liked to hear him talk

 you have my best wishes believe me he was at a loss for the moment as to how to proceed

 oh thank you she didnt dare raise her eyes he regarded her as she sat before him blushing so beautifully and wished they were of the same race    footsteps were heard at that moment and both sat up expectantly

quickly then she rose to her feet and went to the door and opened it in time to meet her father who was about to enter

 oh its you father im glad youve come mr baptiste is here to see you

 ahha mr baptiste i am honored cried jack stewart her father and he marched forward with outstretched hand and much ado scotch propriety

glad to know you judge baptiste returned warmly grasping the proffered hand

 be seated be seated and make yourself comfortable make yourself at home he said pushing forward the chair out of which baptiste had risen agnes was smiling pleasantly she could see that the two were going to become friends for both were so frank in their demeanor

 now aggie you must prepare supper for mr baptiste and myself he said taking hold of her arm

oh no disdained baptiste dont think of it

 now now my worthy friend admonished stewart and then stopped why â you have met my daughter 

 yes we have met they spoke in the same breath exchanging glances

 then while you fix us something good to eat we will discuss our business

they found no difficulty in reaching a bargain in regard to bill the bargain being that bill was to board home and sleep there also and the consideration was to be one dollar per day and by the time this was completed agnes called them to supper

 this is an unexpected pleasure even though it be an intrusion said baptiste as he was gently urged into a scat

 ahha and i see you have a sense of humor whereupon jack stewarts eyes glistened humorously behind the old style glasses he wore baptist colored unseen while agnes regarded him smilingly

 we havent much but what is here you are welcome to

she said

 its a feast said he

about as good as baching anyhow joined stewart

hush

how do you like it

 didnt i say hush that should be sufficient  agnes took a seat and surveyed the table carefully to see that all was there her father was pious he blessed the table and when this was over fell to eating with his knife

 by the way cried baptiste near the end of the meal

 did you hear the news  

 what news they asked in chorus

 the man dead in the well

 is that so they exclaimed shocked

he then told them in detail all about the finding of the body and the opinion that it was a suicide they listened with the usual awe and curiosity but jean baptiste did not voice his suspicions or tell them anything he knew at a later hour he took his leave

and neither of the three realized then that the selfsame tragedy linked strangely an after event in their lives but when jean baptiste went over the hill to his sod house that stood on the claim jack stewart went outside and walked around for almost an hour he was thinking thinking of something he knew and had never told

the coming of the railroad it is not likely that the people in the neighborhood of dallas would have ever known any more than they did regarding a m barr had it not been for two accounts

when proof had been offered by him on his homestead and a loan sought to keep from invalidating the title to his land he was compelled to admit that he was married but fortunately for him it was not necessary to state when or how long he had been married and this he obligingly did not state but the surprise came when upon admittance he then confessed to the promoters that he had married christine    of course everybody was positive then that he had been married to christine when he came to the country and that he was married to her at the time she was holding the claim perjury was a penitentiary offense he had sold her claim on pretense that she must go to england christine as baptiste had come to know by the papers he found had not of course gone to england but merely to lincoln nebraska where she was safe to keep silent about what she knew in regard to the subtle transactions of augustus m barr

the incident went the usual route of gossip the people wondering how such a beautiful girl as christine could be happy as the wife of an old broken down infidel like barr

but they never came into the truth the whole truth they never connected barr with the dark assyrian jew isaac syfe nor were they aware that he had ever known the forlorn peter kaden only jean baptiste knew this and that although barr called a sale and immediately left the country there was something still to be completed but jean baptiste didnt know then that it would all come back to him in such an unusual manner however the public learned a little more concerning the previous activities of this august contemporary before long it came in the form of a sensational newspaper feature story and was in brief to wit while pastor of the baker street church london isaac m barr and not augustus mind you although there was no question about the two being one and the same became very much in the confidence of his flock of londons great middle class they were and possessed ambition which barr apparently appealed to the result was that a great colony set sail for a land of promise the land being western canada the full details were not given  but it seems that barr was the trustee and handled the money on arrival barr suddenly disappeared and the good people from england never saw him again which perhaps accounts in some measure for his becoming an infidel    who would not under such circumstances

there is a feature regarding a new countryâthat is a country that lays toward the western portion of the great central valley that is always questioned and is ever a source for knockers but we should explain one thing that might be of benefit to those who would go west to settle and develop with hopes of success and this is rainfall in tills country of our story which lay near the line where central time is changed to mountain time near the fifth principal meridian the altitude is about  feet above the level of the sea and the rainfall may be estimated accordingly

rainfall is governed by altitude and is a feature beyond discussion this is a very serious matter and could multitudes of people going west to take homesteads or settle be impressed with the facts and know then what to expect much grief could be avoided

but unfortunately this is not so masses can be convincedâ were convinced in the country of our story and all the west beyond in other parts that rainfall was governed by cultivation an erroneous idea as has been stated rainfall is governed by elevation air pressures are such that when in contact with the heavy air due to the lower elevation thunder showers and general rains fall more frequently on the whole and this can be certified by the record of any weather bureau comparing the elevation to the amount of precipitation over a given period say five or ten years it is a fact however that in the most arid districts cloudbursts do occur but they are always a detriment to the parts over which they may fall and it is also true that in a given year or season more rain may fall over a certain arid district than some well cultivated portion in a country where the fall of rain is beyond question

because of these contending features many portions of the country have received a boom one season and failed to produce the next when one year had proven exceedingly wet the theory was that the whole climatic origin of the country had changed drought had passed forever and people and capital flowed in to sometimes go out broken and shattered in spirits hopes and finances later such instances hurt and hinder a country instead of helping it if in coming to the country of our story the masses of people could have understood that at an elevation of from two thousand to twentytwo hundred feet the rainfall over a period of ten years would approximate an average of twentyfive inches annually it is reasonable to suppose that they would expect dry years and wet years some cold winters and some fair open winters some cloudbursts and some protracted droughts but when the first years of settlement were accompanied by heavy rains the boom that followed is almost beyond our pen to detail

from over all the country people came hither people with means for it was the land of opportunity the man who was in many cases wealthy in older portions of the country had come there with next to and very often with nothing and had grown rich â not by any particular ability or concentrated effort on the part of himself not by the making and saving investing and profiting but because in the early days the land was of such little value and brought so little when offered for sale that it had been a case of staying thereon result riches came in the advance later in the price according to demand

such was not the circumstances altogether in the land where jean baptiste had cast his lot in the hope for ultimate success while opportunity was ripe a few thousands had been expedient for what could be had for a small amount here would have cost a far greater amount back east but while land was selling and selling readily the country would and could not maintain its possible quota of development without railroad facilities this question therefore was of the most urgent anxiety when would the railroad be extended out of bonesteel westward at bonesteel they said never others somewhat more liberal said it might be extended in twenty years they argued that since it had taken that many years after bonesteel had been started before the company placed their tracks there the same would in all probability hold with regards to the country and the towns west so be it

the promoters of the town of dallas argued that it would not be extended from bonesteel at all that when it was extended it would come up the valley from the town some miles below bonesteel where the tracks lifted to the highlands meaning of course that dallas would be the only town in the newly opened portion of the country to get the railroad

jean baptiste and bill had seeded all the land that was under cultivation on baptistes property and were well under way of breaking what was left unbroken when baptiste was offered a proposition that looked good to him it was  acres joining his place near stewarts the property of an indian the allotee having recently expired under a ruling of the department of the interior an indian cannot dispose of an allotment under twentyfive years from the time he is alloted this ruling is dissatisfactory to the indian  for notwithstanding all the roles in which he is characterized in the movies and dramas as the great primitive hero brave and courageous the people of the west who are surrounded with red men and know them know that they wish to sell anything they might happen to possess as soon as selling is possible therefore when one happens to expire leaving his land to his heirs who can thereupon sell dispose give away or do what they may wish with the land as long as it accords with the dictates of the indian agent the tract of land in question can be expected to pass into other hands forthwith

the two hundred acres offered jean baptiste was convenient to his land and was offered at twenty dollars per acre other lands about had sold as high as thirty dollars the acre a thousand dollars down and a thousand dollars a year until paid was the bargain and he accepted it paying over the thousand which was the last of the money he had brought from the east with him

this was before something happened that turned the whole country into an orgy of excitement

a few days after this one of the long rainy periods set in and the little town was overrun with homesteaders agreeing that the land that was broken was acting to their advantage bringing all the good rains and drought would never be again

then one day a man brought the news the surveyors were in bonesteel it was verified by others and really turned out to be true the surveyors being in bonesteel was an evident fact that the railroad would follow the highlands and would not come up the valley and that settled dallas as a town it was doomed before a stake was set and here passes out of our story in so far as a railway in its present location was concerned but whatever route a railroad took it meant that the value to a homestead by the extension of the railroad would approximate to exceed ten dollars per acre and jean baptiste now owned five hundred and twenty acres

since the work now in breaking the extra two hundred acres was before him and was more than three miles from his homestead he sought more convenience by determining to approach the stewarts with a request to board him

it was a rainy day when he called only to find jack stewart out while george and bill were tinkering about the barn they had not been informed of his purchase

 oh it is you â mr baptiste cried agnes upon opening the door in response to his knock  come right in

 wheres the governor he inquired when seated

 search me she laughed  papas always out rain or shine

 busy man

 yes busy but never gets anything by it apparently

she was full of humor her eyes twinkled he was also

it was a day to be grateful rainfall tnough it bring delay in the work such days always are appreciated in a new country it made those there feel more confident

 lots of rain

 yes i suppose you are glad she said interestedly

 well i should be

 we are too it looks as if should this keep up we will really raise a crop

 oh itll keep up he said cheerfully confidently  it always rains in this country

 iiow optimistic you are she said regarding him admiringly

 thanks

she smiled then and bit her lip

hows your neighbors across the road ive never become acquainted with them

 their name is prescott i dont know much about them but papa has met them

 how many of them

 three the man and wife and a son

a son

 mm

 how old is he â a young man  

 mm

he smiled mischievously

 oh it will be great and she laughed amusedly

he farms with his parents

i dont think so he has rented a few acres on the place north of us dont seem to be much force

you should wake him up

 humph

 my congratulations irrelevantly

 please dont hes too ugly too lazy loves nothing but a stallion he owns and is very uninteresting

 indeed suddenly he jumped up  i have forgotten that i came to see your dad

 i cant say when papa will be home she answered going toward the door and looking out

 i wanted to see him regarding a little business about boarding i wonder if he could board me

 hell be home about noon anyhow

 that wont be so long now said he regarding the clock

 so you are tired of baching she said with a little twinkle of the eyes

 oh baching before i started but that is not what has expedited my wishing to board i bought some more land couple hundred acres of that dead indian land over south

 you did

 why yes he did not understand her exclamation

 oh but you are such a wonderful man and to be such a young man  she was not aware of the intimacy in her reference and spoke thoughtfully as if to herself more than to him

he was flattered and didnt know how to reply

 you are certainly deserving of the high esteem in which you are held throughout the community and still she was as if speaking to herself and thoughtful

he could not shut out at once the vanity she had aroused in him he wished to appear and to feel modest about it however after all he had most of the other land to pay for which nevertheless gave him no worry his confidence was supreme he continued silent while she went on  it must be wonderful to be a young man and to be so courageous to be so forceful and to be admired

 oh you flatter me

no i do not mean to i am speaking frankly and what i feel i admire the qualities you are possessed with

i read a great deal and when i see a young man like you going ahead so in the world i think he should be encouraged

how very frankly and considerately she had said it all

his vanity was gone he saw her as the real agnes he saw in her moreover that which he had alvvays longed for in his race how much he would have given to have heard those words uttered by a girl of his blood on his trips back east but of course the west was foreign to them they could not have understood as she did but the kindness she had shown had its effect he could at least admire her openly for what she was he spoke now

 i think you are very kind miss stewart i cant say when any one has spoken so sensibly to me as you have and you will believe me when i say that such shall never be forgotten he paused briefly before going on  and it will always be my earnest wish that i shall prove worthy of such kind words he stopped then for in truth he was too overcome with emotion and could not trust himself to go on

she stood with her back to him and could he have seen her eyes he would also have observed tears of emotion

they were honest tears she had spoken the truth she admired the man in jean baptiste and she had not thought of his color in speaking her conviction but withal she felt strangely that her life was linked in some manner with this mans

her fathers appearance at this moment served to break the silent embarrassment between them the embarrassment that had come out of what she had said

they settled with regards to his boarding with them and a few minutes later he took his leave as he was passing out their eyes met never had they appeared so deep never before so soft but in the same he saw again that which he had seen before and as yet could not understand

the administrating angel never before since jean baptiste had come west and staked his lot and future there doing his part toward the building of that little empire out there in the hollow of gods hand had he worked so hard as he did in the days that followed that summer when the rains for a time ceased and the warm porous soil had dried sufficiently to permit a return to the fields from early morn until the sun had disappeared in the west late afternoons did he labor observation with him seemed to be inherent

ever since he had played as a boy back in old illinois he had been deeply sensitive with regards to his race to him notwithstanding the fact that he realized that less than fifty years had passed since freedom they appeared â even considering their adverse circumstances â to progress rather slowly he had not as yet come fully to appreciate and understand why they remained always so poor always the serf always in the position to gain so little â but withal to suffer so much oh the anguish it had so often given his being in the west had come of an ulterior purpose

it has been stated that he was a keen observer while so he had cultivated also the faculty of determination by now it had became a sort of habit a sort of second nature as it were but there were certain things he could not seem to get away from for instance it seemed to him that the most difficult task he had ever encountered was to convince the average colored man that the negro race could ever be anything in after years he understood more fully why this him

was â but we deal with the present those days when jean baptiste with a great ambition was struggling to  do his bit  in the development of the country of our story he struggled with these problems at times until he became fatigued not knowing that he could never understand until the time came for him to

when he dined late one afternoon and found himself alone with agnes he spoke of being tired

 you work too hard jean she said kindly

 perhaps so he admitted  and still the way i choose to see that is that ill not know the difference this time next year

 that is quite possible she agreed thoughtfully  but your case is this i think you seem inspired by some high compulsion some infinite purpose in the way you work and in your mind this is so uppermost that you forget the limit of your physical self she paused and gazed at the knife she held pier mind appeared to deliberate and he wondered at her deep logic what a really mindful person she was and still but a girl

 i cannot help thinking of you and your effort here she resumed  and if i was asked i would advise you to exercise more discretion in regard to yourself to labor as you do without regard to rain sun or time is not practical it would be very sad if in conducting yourself as you do something should happen to you before you had quite fulfilled that to which you are aspiringânot to accomplish altogether but to demonstrate

 you seem to have such a complete understanding of everything agnes he said  you appear to see so much deeper than the people i have met to look so much beneath the surface and read what is there i cannot always understand you he paused while she continued in that thoughtful manner as if she had not heard what he said

 now in your remark of a moment ago you so defined a certain thing i would like to tell you    but i shall not now the instance is always so much in my mind that indeed i lose sense of physical endurance i lose sight of everything but the one object it is not that i care so much for the fruits of my labor but if i could actually succeed it would mean so much to the credit of a multitude of othersâ others who need the example    he paused and thought of his race the individual here did not count so much it was the cause his race needed examples they needed instances of successes to overcome the effect of ignorance and an animal viciousness that was prevalent among them

in this land for instance which had been advertised from one end of the country to the other this land where four hundred thousand acres of virgin soil had been opened to the settler he was about the only one of that race who had come hither or paid the instance any attention such examples of neglected opportunity stood out clearly and were recorded and the record would give his race claiming to be discriminated against no credit    such examples of obliviousness to what was around them would be hard to explain away so in his ambitious youth jean baptistes dream was to own one thousand acres of land he was now twentythree and possessed half that much he conjectured that he could reach the amount by the time he was thirty â providing nothing serious happened to retard him   

he had finished his meal and was ready to go back to that little place over the hill the girl who had made proof on the homestead he had purchased had lived fourteen months alone in a little sod house her father had built for her in which he now had his bed she had come of a prosperous family in the east she had come hither and put in the time and the requirements and had sold the land that he had bought at a good profit to herself such instances were common in that country so common indeed that little was thought of it in his trips back east when baptiste told of such opportunities he was not taken seriously the fact that the wealth of the great central valley was right at their door that from the production there they purchased the food they ate that sheep were raised whose wool was later manufactured into the very clothes they wore had no meaning to them and always he felt discouraged when he returned from a visit among them

he had never seen agnes so serious as she was that night

she arose and followed him to the door and stood with him a moment before he left her eyes were tired and she appeared worried he became possessed with an impulse to shake her hand she seemed to sense his desire and as he stepped out into the night she extended it he grasped and held it briefly he whispered goodnight to her and as he went through the yard and out into the road she watched him from the open door until he was out of sight

jean baptiste thought he had secured a bargain in a team he had purchased a week before and from all appearances he had for after working them a week he found them model horses â apparently as stated he slept in the little sod house on the place near stewarts and also had a barn there in which he kept his horses white working the morning following the conversation with agnes just related he went out to curry and feed this team along with the other horses and received a kick that was almost his ending right at the temple one spiked him and he knew no more for hours

 i wonder why jean is so late said agnes going to the window and gazing up the road he was a hardy eater and the fact that he was late for breakfast was unusual they waited a while longer and then ate without him bill who had been to care for his horses at the place before breakfast reported that he had seen baptiste go into the barn

so he had arisen that was sure but why had he not come for his meal the subject was dismissed by all except agnes who was strangely uneasy

 bill said she  see what is the matter with your boss when you go over and tell him to come to breakfast

bill had no difficulty ascertaining and returned quickly with the news

i knew it exclaimed agnes excitedly i just felt that something was the matter whereupon she got into a light coat and followed her father and brothers to where he lay outside the barn door bleeding freely from the temple

they carried him into their house and were cheered to see that the blood had ceased to flow his head was bandaged while bill went for doc slater who pronounced the wound serious but not fatal lie awakened later in the day and called for water it was brought him forthwith by agnes

when he had drunk deeply and lay back weakly upon the pillow he heard how do you feel jean he looked around in the semidarkness of the room and upon seeing her sighed before answering when he did it was a groan she came quickly to where he lay and bent over him

jean she repeated softly tenderly how do you feel does your head pain you much

where am i he said turning his face toward her

she put her hand lightly over his bandaged head youre here jean at stewarts you are hurt do you understand  

 hurt   he repeated abstractedly

 yes hurt jean you were kicked on the temple by one of your horses

 is that so and he suddenly sat up in the bed

 careful careful she cried excitedly pushing him gently back upon the pillow he was silent as if in deep thought while she waited eagerly presently she said in a low voice do you feel hurt badly jean

 i dont know he raised his hand to his head as if trying to think more clearly she caught his hands and held them as if trying to estimate his pulse to see if he had any fever

how did you come to get kicked jean she asked speaking in the same low tone

 i dont know when i opened the barn door i had a vision of one of the horses moving and i knew no more

 you must be very careful and not start the bleeding again she advised  you bled considerably

 and you say i am at your house at where i board 

 yes jean

he turned and stared at her and for the first time seemed to be himself he closed his eyes a moment as if to shut out something he did not wish to see

 and you have me here and are caring for me  

 we brought you here and are caring for you jean

she repeated

 it is singular said he

what is singular

 that you have twice happened to be where you can serve me when i am injured or in danger she was silent she didnt know how to answer or that there was to be any answer

 has a doctor been here  

 yes

 what did he seem to think of it 

 he said your wound was serious but not fatal

 did he say i could get up soon  

 he didnt say jean but i dont think it would be wise

he groaned

 now you must be patient and not fret yourself into a fever she said seriously

 but i have so much work to do

that will have to wait your health is first she said firmly

 but the work should be done he insisted

 but you must consider your health before you can even think about the work

he groaned again she was thoughtful she was considerate and she could see that he would worry about his work and injure himself or risk fever

 ill speak to papa and perhaps george can take your place for a few days a week or until you can get out

 you are so kind agnes he said then  you are always so thoughtful i dont know how i can accept all you do for me

 please hushâdont mention it she arose and presently returned with her father

 ahha he always greeted  so youve come to

thought something would show up in that  bargain 

 please dont father admonished agnes frowningly

 ill look after everything while you are down old man said stewart  ill start the horses youve been working this afternoon aggie has explained everything i understand

 im so thankful he said then closing his eyes and a few minutes later had fallen asleep

oh my jean 

when jack stewart left indiana and left owing the two hundred dollars which was secured by a chattel mortgage on his horses he failed to do something he now had cause to regret the man to whom he owed this money agreed to give him one year in which to pay it but didnt renew the mortgage he was a close friend of jacks and there had been no worry but the man died his affairs fell into the hands of an administrator whose duties were to clean up to realize on all due and past due matter and because the note of jack stewarts was due and past due the extension being simply a verbal one the administrator wrote jack demanding that he take up his note at once

we know the circumstances of jack stewart that because jean baptiste had hired his son bill and now was boarding with them he was able to get along but jack stewart had nothing with which to pay  notes   

so while jean baptiste was recovering from his illness jack stewart had cause to be very much worried possessed however with a confidence jack took the matter up with the banker in the town where he received his mail now a common saying in a new country is  im going to borrow five dollars and start a bank  

inferring that while there is as a whole an abundance of banks in a new country they do not always have the wherewithal to loan what they have is usually retained for the accommodation of their regular patrons and they were unable to accommodate jack even had they wished to do so

now he could have secured the money had he been a claimholder or a land owner but jack being neither found himself in a bad plight he had aggie write a long letter in which he tried to explain matters and requested until fall to pay as had been verbally agreed upon

but the class of people in the old east who regard the new west as a land of impossibilities where drought burns all planted crops to crisp where grasshoppers eat what is left who still regard those who would stake their fortunes and chances in the west as fools were not all dead

the administrator happened to be one of this kind he had no confidence in the country jack wrote about the crops he had planted what he expected to reap and no patience withal into the bargain so he wrote jack a brief letter and also one to the bank in the town sending the papers with it at the same time with instructions to foreclose at a given time and when jack knew more of it he was confronted with paying the note in thirty days or having his horse taken and sold at auction

jean baptiste recovered went back to his work and noticed that jack stewart and agnes were much worried but of course didnt understand the cause of it

have you tried elsewhere father said agnes when they had gotten the notice giving them thirty days grace

 but i am not known dear there is not much money in a new country and it is very difficult to get credit where there is nothing to lend

 there must be some way to avoid this oh that man why couldnt he be reasonable

 it is always bad when one has to write if i were back in indiana i could go and see this man and reason it out but when a thousand miles is between us â its bad 

if we could have only just three months

two months he exclaimed

the days that followed were days of grave anxiety of nervous anticipation for them there was but one person they could turn to at such a time and that was jean baptiste agnes thought of him she started to speak with her father regarding him but in the end did not bring herself to do so

so the time went on and the thirty days became twenty and the twenty fell to ten and the ten fell to five and then jean baptiste could bear their worry no longer without speaking

you and your father have been very kind to me agnes and i can see you are greatly worried about something if i could help you in any way i would be glad to do so

she was so near to crying when she heard this that she had much difficulty keeping back the tears but she managed to say why its nothing serious just a little matter thats all and she went into her room he pondered it was more than that of this he was sure he left the house and came around to where jack sat and was moved by his expression but jack would say nothing he could not understand he tried to dismiss the subject from his mind and so came sunday the day of days

he was walking from his meal to his place to look over his crops when from up the road he caught the sound of buggywheels two men driving a single horse hitched to a light buggy were coming his way when they caught sight of him they hurried the animal forward slightly by touching him up with the whip and beckoned to him to stop

presently they drew up to where he stood and he recognized one as a homesteader and having a claim near and the other as a professional dealer in horses they exchanged greetings and some remarks about the weather and crops and then the trader said  by the way jean where does that old scotchman live out this way the old fellow who moved out here recently from indiana

 thats the place there and baptiste pointed to the top of the house that could just be seen from where they stood

 i see said the other thoughtfully  wonder where that dappled gray mare he owns is grazing id like to take a look at er

 i think you will see her grazing in the pasture said baptiste curiously

how â what kind of animal is it

 why shes a humdinger returned baptiste more curiously his curiosity aroused the other who looking at him said  well you see the old man is to be sold outâ foreclosed and i thought id take a look at his stuff and if i thought there was anything in it i might save the old scout the humiliation by buying it

t hell you say exclaimed baptiste

 oh yes hadnt you heard about it 

 this is my first knowledge of it

yes the sheriffs coming to get the stuff tuesday â that is providing the old man dont come across with a couple of hundred before that time and it is not likely he can i dont think

well well baptiste exclaimed thinking of the worry he had observed in the faces of agnes and her father and at last beginning to understand

 yes its rather bad that but this follows the old gent from where he comes and he is not known here so i guess ill mosey along and take a look at the stuff â just a glance at it from the road you understand and if things look good ill drop by n see him later whereupon they went their way cheerfully while baptiste resumed his thoughtfully

he returned to his house by a roundabout way and later hitching a team to a light buggy he drove into the town where jack traded and looked up the banker

 say brookings he opened  what kind of deal is the old scotchman up against out there you understand

 oh yes exclaimed the cashier  the old man out there on the watson homestead well it seems like the old fellow stands a good chance of being sold out he then explained to baptiste regarding the note and the circumstances

that dont look just right to me muttered baptiste when he had heard the circumstances

well now it isnt right but what can be done

cant you loan the old man the money

 i could but i dont like letting credit to strangers and renters if he could get a good man on his note id fix it out for him since weve just received quite a sum for deposit

 well if i should go it said baptiste suggestively

the other looked quickly up

 why you gee id take care of him for ten times the amount if youd put your john henry  on the note

 well ill be in town early in the morning said baptiste turning to drive away

all right jean sure ill look for you the day was bright and lovely for driving and baptiste drove to his homestead and from there to the reynolds where he had dinner and visited late the next morning he went to the town and when jack stewart exhausted by the strain of worry under which he was laboring came into town having decided to try and sell the mare and one of the other horses thereby leaving him only one with which to complete the cultivating of his corn and the reaping of his crops he was called into the bank

 now if youll just sign this mr stewart said brookings  you can have until december first on that stuff

 you mean the note  the old man exclaimed afraid to believe that he had heard aright

 yes the note that is about to be foreclosed youve been granted an extension jack stewart was too overcome to attempt to comment the realization that he was to be allowed to go on and not be sold out or be forced to dispose of his little stock at such a critical time was too much for words he caught up the pen steadied his nerves and wrote his name not observing that the banker held a blotter over the lower line of the note jean baptiste had cautioned him to do this in view of the circumstances he had not wished stewart or agnes to know that he had gone en the note

jack stewart hurried home in a fever of excitement he could not get there fast enough he thought of agnes he did not wish her to have a minute more grief than what she had endured he reached home and stumbled into the house and to agnes he said  oh girl girl girl they have extended the note the sheriff is not coming we are saved saved saved he was too overcome with emotion and joy then to proceed

he sank into a chair while agnes carried away with excitement over the news caressed him said words of love and care until both had been exhausted by their own emotions when they at last became calm she turned to her father who now walked the floor in great joy

 how did they come to extend the note father  

 why â why dear that had never occurred to me i became so excited when they told me that i had been granted an extension i can only recall that i signed the note and almost ran out of the bank the man had to call me back to give me my old note and mortgage i dont know why they granted the extension he stood holding his chin now and looking down at the floor as if trying to understand after all how it happened then his eyes opened suddenly wide  why and do you know now since i come to think of it they did not take a new mortgage on the stock

 i dont believe that the administrator had anything to do with it she said after a time  i know that man he would sell his mother out into the streets now i wonder who has influenced the bank into giving us this time   

 bless me dear lord but right now i am too tickled to try to think who to be saved is enough all at once later i shall try to figure out who has been my benefactor and with this he left the house and went to walk with his joy in the fields where george was plowing corn unconscious of the fact that the team he was driving was to have been seized on the morrow and sold for debt

 now i wonder who saved papa agnes said to herself taking a seat by the window and gazing abstractedly out into the road she employed her wits to estimate what had brought it about and as she sat there jean baptiste came driving down the road he had not been there since breakfast the morning before he had taken his mornings meal at the restaurant in the town as he drove down the slope that began above the house wherein she sat his dark face was lighted with a peaceful smile he drove leisurely along concerned with the bright prospects of his four hundred acres of crop he was so absorbed in his thoughts that he passed on by without seeing agnes at the window without even looking toward the house

upon seeing him agnes had for the moment forgotten what she was thinking about but when he had passed by she was suddenly struck with an inspiration she jumped quickly to her feet she raised her hands to her breast and held them there as if to still a great excitement as she cried jean jean jean baptiste it was you you who did it it was you who saved my father saved me saved us all oh my jean

she was overcome then with a great emotion she sank slowly upon a chair and as she did so sobs broke from her lips and she wept long and silently

bill prescott proposes summertime over the prairie country summertime when the rainfall has been abundant is a time of happiness to all settlers in a new land and such a summer it was in the land of our story god had been unusually kind to the settlers he had blessed them with abundant moisture with sunshine not too warm and not too cold the railroad was under course of construction and would be completed far enough west for the settlers from the most remote part â from the farthest corner of the reservation to journey with their grain or hogs chickens or cattle to it and return to home the same day and now the fields which had been seeded to winter wheat had turned to gold only a few thousand acres had been sowed over the county and of this amount one hundred thirty acres grew on the homestead of jean baptiste the season for its growth had been ideal and the prospects for a bumper yield was the best ripe now and ready to cut the air was filled with its aroma

he had brought a new selfbinder from gregory which now stood in the yard ready for action its various colors green red blue and white resplendent in the sunlight

so now we see jean baptiste the cheerful jean baptiste the hopeful with hopes in a measure about realized jean baptiste the ethiopian in a country where he alone was black he whistles at times he sings he is merry cheery and gay

but while jean baptiste was happy cheerful and gay there was in him what has been what always will be that which makes us appreciate the courage that is in some men

bill prescott from the first day he had seen agnes had considered a match between her and himself a suggestive proposition bill prescott might be referred to as a  feature he was not so fortunate as to have been born handsome and could not be called attractive he had not moreover improved the situation by cultivation of wit of art or pride the west had meant no more to him than had the east the south â or the west indies for that matter

because bill had no homestead no deeded land and had not tried to get any his wealth consisted of a few horses among which an old worn out boughtoncreditstallion was his pride

of this stallion bill talked he told of his pedigree tracing him back almost to the ark he was fond of tobacco was bill prescott he chewed apparently all the time he had lost his front teeth wore his thin hair long and upon his small head a hat oiled to the point where its age was a matter for conjecture he had apparently appreciated that the wind blew outrageously over those parts at times and therefore had hung a leather string to his hat which he pulled down over the back of his head to hold his hat in place this succeeded in frumpling the long thin hair and kept it in a dishevelled condition

now bill had been a frequent caller at the stewarts home since they had come west he did not always take the trouble to remove his hat when inside that he was fond of agnes was apparent and smiled always upon seeing her and at such times showed where his front teeth had been but where tobacco more frequently now was with lazy delight

he called this day wearing a clean patched jumper over his cotton shirt when once inside sprawling his legs before him and while jack stewart worked in the sun outside repairing harness he said to agnes well old girl howd you like to marry agnes changed color a few times before she could decide whether to answer or not in the meantime patient and in no hurry bill grinned with pleasure at the ease with which he had started showed tobacco where his teeth had been and spat a pound of juice with plenty of drippings trailing out the window by which she sat it made considerable argument getting through the screen but succeeded finally â most of it the remainder clung hesitated wavered and finally giving up dripped slowly to the ledge below

 doggone myself said bill getting up heavily from his chair and going to the window and thumping it lightly whereupon the hesitant amber dashed in many directions about agnes had observed it all with calm disgust bill however not the least perturbed over his apparent breach of impropriety became reseated and resumed  well  

she turned her eyes slowly toward him surveyed him coldly and continued at her sewing

bill muttered something

she regarded him again with cold disdain

haw haw he laughed loudly you dont pretend t hear me haw haw then i guess youre stuck on that nigger you got a hangin round here

 will you go  she cried as she quickly jumped to her feet and swung open the door she controlled herself with considerable effort

 oh ho so thats the way you treat a white man â and honor a d ân nigger and with that he dashed out and passed to where the senior worked away over his harness jack stewart saw and heard bill approaching without looking up he greeted  ahha william and how are you today

bill was struck with a sudden inspiration in his way he really liked agnes and it was all settled in his mind to wed her he realized now that he had rather bungled matters and thereupon decided to exercise a little more discretion so choking down the anger that was in him and swallowing a bit of tobacco juice at the same time he said to stewart

 good morning ah by the way jack id like to marry agnes so saying he was pleased with himself again and spat tobacco juice more easily in the next squirt jack continued working at his harness for the moment he did not appear to comprehend but presently he raised his eyes with the old style glasses before them and surveyed bill slowly

 you want to do what  he said uncomprehendingly

to marry agnes bill repeated calmly he paused looked away sucked his soft mouth dean of amber and spat it tricklingly at jacks feet and looked up and at jack with a wondrous smile

now jack stewart was possessed with certain virtues

he did not smoke chew drink swear nor shave he was rather put out but with considerable effort at self control he managed to say well if thats the way you feel about it why dont you take it up with the girl bill hesitated at this point sucked his mouth clear again of tobacco juice cleared his throat spat the juice and after a hasty glance toward the house decided not to mention that he had spoken with agnes he replied  well i thought it best to speak to you and if its all right with you jt ought to be all right with the gal

jack stewart drew up and then tried to relax he did not think so much of bill but he did think the world of agnes and wanted her respected by everybody moreover he did not like to hear her galled he turned to william he regarded him keenly and then in a voice and words that were english but accent that was very much scotch the which we will not attempt to characterize he said  youre a joke just a great big joke he paused briefly and then continued id like to be patient with you but honestly with you it wouldnt pay you are not worth it and in so far as my girl â any girl is concerned i cannot imagine how you could even expect them to be interested he paused and looked away too full up to go ahead in the meantime he heard bill  is that so  is it so  cried stewart with a touch of vehemence

gad see yourself see how you go dont you observe whats around you close enough to see that girls want some sedateness they admire in some measure cleverness clothes and â well manhood 

so i dont guess i have it retorted william sneeringly

 oh you bore me  jack returned disgustingly he bent to his work in an attempt to forget it and then he again heard from bill  so thats the way yu got it figgered out eh  he drew his mouth tight shut he gave another soft suck that drew his skin close to his gums and with his tongue he cleared his mouth and spat tobacco juice and all in a soft lump at stewarts feet and said in unconcealed anger so thats the way you got me figgered out and i want to say now that i dont think i want yer gal anyhow im a white man i am and what white man would want a gal that a nigger is allowed to hang aroun and court 

jack stewart was struck below the belt he was fouled and for a time everything went dark around him he was so angry he did not know that jean baptiste had saved him from losing his stock or being forced to sell them he had never connected baptiste and agnes as being other than friends and friends they had a right to be but jack stewart did regard jean baptiste as a gentleman and gentlemen he respected his knockout therefore was brief he soon recovered he could not speak he could not even stammer but with a sudden twitch of the tug his hands held he came away around with it and the heavy leather took bill fairly in the mouth in the middle of the mouth

and then jack got his voice and ready for another swing but not before bill found something too it was his feet

you stinkin low down pup cried stewart falling over from the force of the swing he had missed you trash of the sand hills you tobacco chewin raggamuffin  getting his balance and turning after william madly he resumed  you ornery nasty filthy houn if i get my hans on you i swear t god ill kill you

but bill prescott now held the advantage he was younger and more fleet of foot so therefore out ran jack who was left before he reached the gate far to the rear and bill gained his side of the wide road with a safe lead

jack finally came to a stop before getting of the premises with his blood boiling with such heat that he drew his hat off and beat himself with it in the meantime agnes who had witnessed the controversy from the gate ventured out to where her father stood and taking him gently by the arm she led him inside

 my bloods up my bloods up  jack kept crying and repeating  that stinkin triflin peace a nothin has been gittin smart tryin to low rate me tryin to low rate my girl insultin jean baptiste dang him dang him

 father father  cried agnes soothingly

did you hearml did you hearm why the low down good for nothin im a good mind to go cross the road and skin him alive

 father father  begged agnes

did you hear what he said insisted the infuriated senior

yes father she confessed i heard him

 you did n thats worse  whereupon he tore loose and threw up his arms in an angered gesture

 now papa agnes argued kindly  i heard him and what he said to you he was in here and insul â spoke to me before he went out there  i understand all about it    so you must simply be calm â and forget it

thats all   

 i dont care so much for myself but that he should speak about you and baptiste i just wish baptiste could have heard him and just beat the gosh danged manure right out of him

 please be quiet papa forget bill prescott and what he has tried to insinuate    we understand him and what he is and we understand mr baptiste â and what he is so let us just think of other things

yes aggie i suppose youre right you always seem to be right and i will try to forget it but ill say this much if that ornery lazy cuss ever crosses this road to my place again ill thresh him within an inch of his life

youve agreed to forget it father   

 i agree again but its outrageous that he should say what he did about jean baptiste now isnt it

 it is father she admitted with downcast eyes

of course it is never was there more of a gentleman in the world than jean baptiste

 mr baptiste is a real gentleman acknowledged agnes again

 there never was and he knows it the pup

agnes was strangely silent which jack in his excitement overlooked

 and even if he should like my girlâ

father

well

 oh please hush 

 i will aggie he said slowly he bent forward presently folded her close kissed her and then placing his hat on his head went back to his work   

harvest time and what came with it harvest time harvest time when the harvest time is all worries have passed when the harvest time is all doubts droughts fears and tears are no more when the golden grain falls upon the canvas when the meadow larks the robins and all the birds of the land sing the song of harvest time the farmer is happy is gay and confident

and harvest time was on in the country of our story

jean baptiste pulled his new binder before the barn jumped from the seat and before he started to unhitch he gazed out over a stretch of land which two years before had been a mass of unbroken prairie but was now a world of shocked grain thousands upon thousands of shocks stood over the field like a great army in the distance his crop was good â the best and no crops are like the crop on new land never since the beginning of time had that soil tasted tamed plant life it had seemed to appreciate the change and the countless shocks before him were evidence to the fact

from where he stood when he had unhitched he gazed across country toward the southeast where lay his other land only a part of which he could see as it rose in the distance he could see the white topped oats and just beyond he could see the deep purple of the flaxseed blossoms he sighed contentedly unharnessed his horses let them drink and turned them toward the pasture he was not tired but he went to the side of the house which the sun did not strike and sat him down at the furthest side of the field he observed bill and george as they shocked away to finish

he was at peace again as he always was and thereupon fell into deep thought

 my crop of wheat will yield not less than thirty bushels to the acre he whispered to himself  and one hundred and thirty acres should then yield almost four thousand bushels i should receive at least eighty cents the bushel and that would approximate about three thousand dollars with seed left to sow the land again he paused in his meditation and considered what even that alone would mean to him lie could pay the entire amount on the land he had purchased and perhaps a thousand or two more from the flax crop that would leave him owing but four hundred dollars on the land he had bought and that amount he felt he would be able to squeeze out somewhere and have  acres clear

he could not help being cheerful perhaps somewhat vain over his prospects he was now just twentythree and appreciated that most of his life was yet before him with at the most two or three more seasons like the present one he could own the coveted thousand acres and the example would be completed

that was the goal toward which he was working if he or any other man of the black race could acquire one thousand acres of such land it would stand out with more credit to the negro race than all the protestations of a world of agitators in so far as the individual was concerned

 it is things accomplished he often said to himself

 it is what is actually accomplished that will get notice â and credit damn excuses the best an excuse can secure is dismissal and positively that is no asset he would then invariably think deeply into the conditions of his race the race who protested loudly that they were being held down truly it was an intricate delicate subject to try to solve with prolific thinkings he compared them with the jew â went away back to thousands of years before out of the past he could not solve it cither all had begun together the jew was hated but was a merchant enjoying a large portion of the world commerce and success the negro was disliked because of his black skin â and sometimes seemingly for daring to be human

at such times he would live over again the life that had been his before coming west he thought of the multitudes in the employment of a great corporation who monopolized the sleeping car trade indeed this company after all was said afforded great opportunities to the men

not so much in what was collected in tips and in other devious ways nor from the small salary but from the great opportunity of observation that that particular form of travel afforded

but so few made the proper effort to benefit themselves thereby he continued to think along these lines until his thoughts came back to a point where in the past they were wont to come and stop he could not in that moment understand why they had not been coming back to that selfsame point in recent months    since one cold day during the first month of that year    he gave a start when he realized why then sighed it seemed too much for his thoughts just then he regarded bill and george at their task of trying to finish their work upon hearing a sound he turned behind him stood agnes

 my how you frightened me   he cried

she held in her hand a basket containing lunch for him and her brothers this she had brought every day but he had been so absorbed in his thoughts that he had quite forgotten that she was coming on this day as well as she stood quietly before him she seemed rather shorter than she really was also more slender and appeared withal more girlish than usual her eyes twinkled and her heavy hair drawn together at the back of her head hung over her shoulders her sunkist skin was a bit tanned her arms almost to the elbows were bare brown and were very round and as jean baptiste regarded her there in the bright golden sunlight she appeared to him like the virgin mary

 you are tired he cried and pointed to a crude bench that reposed against the sod house which he had just left in his prolific thinking of a moment before

 sit down please and rest yourself he commanded

she obeyed him modestly with a smile still upon her pleasant face

 i judge that bill and george will finish in a few minutes so ill wait that we may all dine together youll be so kind as to wait until then will you not he asked graciously and bowed

 until then my lord she smiled coquettishly

 thanks  he laughed good humoredly suddenly she cried  oh isnt it beautiful  and swept her hands toward the field of shocked wheat he had been looking away but as she spoke he turned and smiled with satisfaction

it is

just lovely she cried her eyes sparkling

 and all safe thats the best part about it he said

 grand im so glad you have saved it she said with feeling

thank you

 you have earned it

 i hope so still i thank you

 it will bring you lots of money

 i am hoping it will

 oh it will

 i was thinking of it before you came up

i knew it

 you knew it 

 i saw you from a distance

 oh 

 and i knew you were thinking

 oh come now

 why shouldnt i  youre always thinking the only time when you are not is when you are sleeping

 you can say such wonderful things he said standing before her the sun shining on his tanned features

wont â ah â wont you be seated she invited he colored unseen she made room for him and he hesitatingly took a seat at a conventional distance on the bench beside her

 your other crops are fine too she said sociably

 im going over to look at them this afternoon

you should

where is your father today

 gone to town

wish id known he was going id had him bring out some twine for me i think the oats will be ready to cut over on the other place right away and i dont want to miss any time

 no indeed a hail storm might come up he glanced at her quickly she was gazing across the field to where her halfwitted brothers worked while he was thinking how thoughtful she was presently he heard her again

 why if it is urgent â you are out i â i could go to town and get the twine for you she was looking at him now and he was confused her offer was so like her so natural why was it that they understood each other so well

 oh why agnes he stammered  that would be asking too much of you 

why so i shall be gladâglad to oblige you in any way and it is not too much if one takes into consideration what you have done forâill be glad to go   

 done for what   he said catching up where she had broken off and eyeing her inquiringly

she was confused and the same showed in her face

she blushed she had not meant to say what she did

but he was regarding her curiously he hadnt thought about the note she turned then and regarded him out of tender eyes she played with the bonnet she held in her lap she looked away and then back up into his face and her eyes were more tender still in her expression there was almost an appeal

 what did you mean by what you started to say agnes

he repeated evenly but kindly

i â i â mean what you did for papa what â you â you did about that â that â note it was out at last and she lowered her eyes and struggled to hold back the tears with great effort

 oh he laughed lowly relievedly  that was nothing and he laughed again as if to dismiss it

 but it was something she cried protestingly  it was something it was everything to us she ended with great emotion apparent in her shaking voice he shifted

it was awkward and he was a trifle confused

 please dont think of it agnes

but how can i keep from thinking of it when i know that had it not been your graciousness your wonderful thoughtfulness your great kindness we would have been sold out â bankrupted disgraced oh me she covered her face with her hands but he could see the tears now raining down her face and dropping upon her lap

 oh agnes he cried  i wish you wouldnt do that

please dont it hurts me besides how did you know it i told brookings that your father was not to know it

i did not want it known he paused and his voice shook slightly they had drawn closer and now she reached out and placed her small hand upon his arm

brookings didnt tell he didnt tell papa but i knew she was looking down at the earth

 i dont understand she heard him say wondcringly

but didnt you think jean that i understood i understood the very day â a few minutes after papa returned home brought the old note and told me about the extension she paused and looked thoughtfully away across the field  i understood when you drove by a few minutes later you had forgotten about it i could see and your mind was on other things but the moment you came into my sight and i looked out upon you from the window i knew you had saved us

her hand still rested lightly upon his arm she was not aware of it but deeply concerned with what she was saying presently when he did not speak she went on

 i understood and knew that you had forgotten it â that you were too much of a man to let us know what you had done i cant forget it i have wanted to tell you how i felt â i felt that i owed it to you to tell you but i couldnt before

 please lets forget it agnes she heard him whisper

 i can keep from speaking of it but forget it â never

it was so much like you like the man thats in you  and the tears fell again

 agnes agnes if you dont hush almost i will forget myself  

 i had to tell you i had to  she sobbed

 but it is only a small return for what you did for me

do you realize agnes had it not been for you i â i â would not be sitting here now oh think of that and then you will see how little i have done â how very little i can ever do to repay  his voice was brave albeit emotional

he leaned toward her and the passion was in his face she grasped his arm tighter as she looked up again into his face out of her tear bedimmed eyes and cried brokenly  but jean the cases are not parallel what i did for you i would have done for anybody it was merely an act of providence but yours â oh jean cant you understand he was silent

 yours was the act of kindness she went on again the act of a man and you would have kept it secret because you would never have had it known because you would not have us feel under obligation to you oh that is what makes me â oh it makes me cry when i think of it the tears flowed freely while her slender shoulders shook with emotion

and when she had concluded the man beside her had forgotten the custom of the country and its law had passed beyond him he was as a man toward the maid now beside him wept the one he had loved as a dream girl behind him was the house with the bed she had laid him upon when she saved his life and when he had awakened before being conscious of where he was or what had happened to him he had looked into her eyes and had seen therein his dream girl she was his by the right of god he forgot now that she was white while he was black he only remembered that she was his and he loved her

his voice was husky when he answered agnes oh agnes i begged you not to i almost beseeched you because â oh dont you understand what is in me that i am as all men weak to have seen you that night â the night i can never forget the night when you stood over me and i cameback to life and saw you you didnt know then and understand that i had dreamed of you these two years since i had come here that out of my vision i had seen you had talked with you oh agnes  she straightened perceptibly she looked up at him with that peculiarity in her eyes that even she had never come to understand they became oblivious to all that was about them and had unconsciously drawn closer together now and regarded each other as if in some enchanted garden she sang to him then the music that was in her and the words were  jean oh jean baptiste you have spoken and now at last i understand and do you know that before i left back there from where i came i saw you i dreamed of you and that i would know you and then i came and so strangely met and have known you now for the man you are oh jean 

gradually as the composure that had been theirs passed momentarily into oblivion and the harvest birds twittered gayly about them his mans arm went out and into the embrace her slender body found its way his lips found hers and all else was forgotten

epoch the second regarding the intermarriage of races it was winter and the white snow lay everywhere icicles hung from the eaves all work on the farms was completed people were journeying to a town half way between bonesteel and gregory to take the train for their former homes others to spend it with their relatives and jean baptiste was taking it for chicago and new york where he went as a rule at the end of each year

he was going with an air of satisfaction apparently for in truth he had everything to make him feel so â that is almost everything he had succeeded in the west

the country had experienced a most profitable season and the crop he reaped and sold had made him in round numbers the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars he had paid for the two hundred acres of land he had bargained for he had seeded more land in the autumn just passed to winter wheat which had gone into the winter in the best of shape his health was the best for what more could he have wished

and yet no man was more worried than he when he stepped from the stage onto the platform of the station where he was to entrain for the east  it is barely possible that any man could have been more sad  to explain this we are compelled to go back a few months back to the harvest time to his homestead and where he sat with some one near very near and what followed

 i couldnt help it â i loved you love you â have loved you always  he passionately told her

for answer she had yielded again her lips and all the love of her warm young heart went out to him

 i dont understand you always dear he whispered

 sometimes there is something about you that puzzles me i think its in your eyes but i do understand that whatever it is it is something good â it couldnt be otherwise could it

 no jean she faltered

 and did you wonder at my calling your name that night  

 i have never understood that fully until now she replied

 you came in a vision and it must have been divine two years ago gone now she heard him  and ever since your face dear has been before me i have loved it and of course i knew that i would surely love you when you came

isnt it strange she whispered

 but beautiful

 so beautiful

 was it providence or was it god that brought you that night and saved me from the slow death that was coming over me agnes

please jean dont dont speak again of that awful night surely it must have been some divine providence that brought me to this place but i can never recall it without a tremor to think that you would have died out there please never tell me of it again dear she trembled and nestled closer to him while her little heart beat a tattoo against her ribs they looked up then as across the field her halfwitted brothers were approaching

it was only then that they seemed to realize what had transpired and upon realization they silently disembraced what had passed was the most natural thing in the world true and to them it had come because it was in them to assert themselves but now before him rose the custom of the country and its law so vital is this custom so much is it a part of the body politic that certain states have went on record against it not because any bad or good any wealth or poverty was involved it had been because of sentiment the sentiment of the stronger faction   

so it ruled

in the lives of the two in our story no thought but to live according to gods law and the law of the land had ever entered their minds but now they had while laboring under the stress of the pentup excitement and emotion overruled and forgot the law two races are wont to observe and had given vent and words to the feeling which was in them    they stood conventionally apart now each absorbed in the calm realization of their positions in our great american society they were obviously disturbed  but that which had drawn them to the position they had occupied and declared still remained and that was love

so time had gone on as time will never stopping for anything never hesitating never delaying so the day went and the week and the month and the month after that and the month after that until in time the holidays were near and jean baptiste was going away away to forget that which was more to him than all the world â the love of agnes stewart

he had considered it â he had considered it before he caught the one he loved into his arms and said the truth that was in him    but there was another side to it that will have much space in our story

down the line a few stations from where he now was there lived an example a man had come years ago into the country there a strong powerfully built man he was healthy he was courageous and he was dark because forsooth the man was a negro and so it had been with time this mans heart went out to one near by a white because of his race it was with him as with jean baptiste

near him there had been none of his kind so unto himself he had taken a white wife he had loved her and she had loved him and because it was so she had given to him children and when the children had come she died

and after she had died and some years had passed he took unto himself another wife of the same blood and to that union there had come other children

so when years had passed and these selfsame children had reached their majority they too took unto themselves wives and the wives were of the caucasian blood but when this dark man had settled in the land below which at that time had been a new country he decided to claim himself as otherwise than he was he said and said again that he was of mexican descent mongrel forsooth but there was no custom of the country with regard to the mexican mongrel though he be but the people and the neighbors all knew that he lied and that he was ethiopian the which looked out through his eyes but even to merely claim being something else was a sort of compromise

so his family had grown to men and women and they in turn brought more children into the world and all claimed allegiance to a race other than the one to which they belonged

once lived a man who was acknowledged as great and much that goes with greatness was given unto him by the public a negro he was but as a climax in his great life he had married a wife of that race that is superior in life wealth and achievements to his own the caucasian so it had gone

the first named jean baptiste never felt he could be quite like even if he should disregard the custom of the country and its law and marry agnes he did not feel he would ever attempt that but to marry out of the race to which he belonged especially into the race in which she belonged would be the most unpopular thing he could do he had set himself in this new land to succeed  he had worked and slaved to that end he liked his people he wanted to help them examples they needed and such he was glad he had become but if he married now the one he loved the example was lost he would be condemned he would be despised by the race that was his

moreover last but not least he would perhaps by such a union bring into her life much unhappiness and he loved her too well for that

jean baptiste had decided he loved agnes and had every reason to but he forswore he would change it

he would go back from where he had come he would be a man as befitted him to be he would find a girl he would marry in his race they had education they were refined â well he would marry one of them anyhow

so jean baptiste was going he would forget agnes

he would court one in his own race so to chicago he now sped

he had lived in the windy city before going west and was very familiar with that section of the city on the south side that is the center of the negro life of that great metropolis accordingly he approached a station in the loop district entered one of the yellow cars and took a seat

he looked below at the hurlyburly of life and action and then his eyes took survey of the car it was empty all save himself and another and that other was a girl a girl of his race the first he had seen since last he was in the city how little did she know as she sat across the aisle from him that she was the first of his race his eyes had looked upon for the past twelve months he regarded her curiously she was of that cross bred type that are so numerous full bloods seemingly to have become rare about those parts she was of a light brown complexion almost a mulatto she seemed about twentytwo years of age of the curious eyes upon her she seemed entirely unaware finally leaving the train at a station that he was familiar with and disappeared

at thirtyfirst street he left the train fell in with the scattered crowd below and the dash of the city life was his again in a twinkling he found his way to state street the great thoroughfare of his people the novelty in viewing those of his clan now had left him for they were all about even had he been blind he could have known he was among them for was not there the usual noise the old laugh and all that went with it

he hurried across and passed down thirtyfirst to dearborn street darktown proper but even when he had reached federal then called armour he had seen nothing but his race he had friends â at least acquaintances so to where they lived he walked briskly

 and if it isnt jean baptiste so elp me jesus cried the woman as she opened the door in response to his knock and without further ceremony encircled his neck with her arms and kissed his lips once and twice  you old dear

she exclaimed with him inside holding him at arms length and regarding him fondly how arc you anyhow

 oh fine he replied regarding her pleasantly

 you arc certainly looking good she said looking up into his face with fun in her eyes  sit down sit down and make yourself at home she invited drawing up a chair

well hows chicago he inquired irrelevantly

 same old burg she replied drawing a chair up close

 and hows hubby 

fine

and the rest of the family

 the same pearl too

 oh pearl â   how is pearl 

 still single  

 thought she was engaged to be married when i was here last year

 oh that fellow was no good 

 what was the matter 

 whats the matter with lots of these nigga men round chicago they cant keep a wife a posing on state street

 humph

 its the truth 

and how about the women they seem to be fond of passing along to be posed at   

 oh youre mean she pouted then  are you married yet 

oh lordy how could i get married not thirty minutes ago i saw the first colored girl i have seen in a year

 oh youre a liar

 its the truth 

 is it so jean have you really not seen a colored girl in a whole year 

 i have never lied to you have i  

well no of course you havent but i dont know what i would do under such circumstances not seeing niggas for a year

 but ive seen enough already to make up

she laughed  lordy me did you ever see so many shines as there are on state street she paused and her face became a little serious for a moment  by the way jean why dont you marry my sister

 youre shameful your sister wouldnt have me im a farmer

 oh yes she would pearls getting tired of getting engaged to these negroes around chicago she likes you anyhow

tut tut he laughed depreciatingly pearl would run me ragged out there on that farm  she laughed too

 shes good looking all right and perhaps tired of working but she wouldnt do out there on the farm

 oh you wont do ill bet you are married already

oh mrs white

 but youre engaged 

nope

jean ill bet youll marry a white girl out there and have nothing more to do with niggas

 now youre worse

 and when you marry a white woman i want to be the first one to shoot you â in the leg

he laughed long and uproariously

 you can laf all you want but you aint goin through life lovin nobody you gotta girl somewhere but do what you please so long as it dont come to that

 come to what 

 marrying a white woman

 wouldnt that be all right 

she looked up at him with a glare he smiled amusedly

 dont you laf here on a subject like that lord i think lots of you but if i should hear that you had married a white woman man id steal money enough to come there and kill you dead 

 why would you want to do that 

why would i want to do that humph i what you want to ask me such a question for the idea

but you havent answered my question

she glared at him again all the humor gone out of her face

presently biting at the thread in some sewing she was doing she said in the first place white people and negroes have no business marrying each other in the second place a nigga only gets a po white woman and in the third place white people and niggas dont mix well when it comes to society now supposin you married a white woman and brought her here to chicago who would you associate with we niggas s sho goin to pass er up and the white folksâyou better not look their way

he was silent

 aint i done outlined it right 

 youve revealed some very delicate points with regard to the matter he acknowledged

 of course i have and you cant get away from it but that aint all now to be frank with yu i wouldnt ceh so much about some triflin no count nigga marrying some old white woman but that aint the kind no white woman wants when she stoops so low as to marry a nigga uh naw naw indeedy she dont fool with nothin like that i she leaves that kind for some poor colored woman to break her heart and get her head broken over she marries somebody like you with plenty of money and sense with it see

he laughed amusedly

 no laffin in it you know im tellin the truth so take warning i dont marry no white woman up there and come trottin down here expectin me to give you blessin

because if you do and just as sure as my name is ida white im going to do something to you 

 but a white woman might help a fellow to get up in the world he argued

 yes ill admit that too but ouh burden is ouh burden and weve got to bear it and besides you cn get a girl thatll help you when you really want a wife that aint no argument of course id like to see pearl married but you aint going to fool with her and i know it

pearl thinks she would like it better if she could marry somebody from out of chicago but theyd all be the same after a month or so with her

 well said he  id better get over to the keystone

youve interested me today ive learned something regarding the amalgamation of races   

 i hope you have if you had it in your mind anything else might be forgiven but marrying a white woman â never

they parted then she to her sewing and jean baptiste to his thoughts 

which 

jean baptiste returned to the west after two months travel through the east and the spring following sowed a large crop of small grain and reaped a bountiful yield that fall about this time the county just west of where he lived was opened to settlement and a still larger crowd than had registered for the land in the county he lived came hither and sought a quarter section

the opening passed to the day of the drawing and when all the lucky numbers had secured their filings contracts for the purchases of relinquishments began by this time the lands had reached great values and that which he had purchased a short time before for twenty dollars the acre had by this time reached the value of fifty dollars the acre and now he had an opportunity of increasing his possessions to the number coveted one thousand acres

he had paid a visit to his parents that winter and found his sisters who were mere children when he had left home grown to womanhood and old enough to take claims so with them he had discussed the matter inspired by his great success they were all heart and soul to follow his bidding so thereupon it was agreed that he would try to secure three relinquishments on good quarters and upon one or more of these they would make filings

his grandmother who had raised a family in the days of slavery agreed and was anxious to file on one one sister on another and the third placeâ was to be his brides

by doing this he could have her use her homestead right providing she filed on the claim before marrying him

so it was planned but jean baptiste knew no girl that he could ask to become his wife therefore this was yet to be when he had given up his real love to be loyal to his race he had determined on one thing that marriage was a business even if it was supposed to be inspired by love but when agnes was left out he loved no one

therefore it must be resolved into a business proposition â and the love to come after

so resigned to the fact he set himself to choose a wife

on his trip east the winter before he met two persons with whom he had since corresponded one the first was a young man not long out of an agricultural college whose father was a great success as a potato grower he and jean became intimate friends it now so happened that the one mentioned had a sister and through him jean baptiste was introduced to her by mail

correspondence followed and by this time it had become very agreeable she proved to be a very logical young woman and jean baptiste was favorably impressed she was moreover industrious ambitious and well educated

her age was about the same as his so on the surface he thought that they should make a very good match so be it

in the meantime however he had opened a correspondence with another whom he had met on his trip the winter before where she had been teaching in a coal mining town south of chicago the same had developed mutually and he had found her agreeable and obviously eligible her father was a minister a dispenser of the gospel and while for reasons we will become acquainted with in due time he had cultivated small acquaintance with preachers he took only such slight consideration of the girls fathers profession that he had good cause to recall some time later

about the time he was deeply engrossed in his correspondence with both the farmers daughter and the young school teacher he received a letter from a friend in chicago introducing him to a lady friend of hers through mail

this one happened to be a maid on the twentieth century limited running between new york and chicago well jean baptiste was looking for a wife sentiment was in order but it was with him first of all a business proposition so be it he would give her too a chance

he was somewhat ashamed of himself when he addressed three letters when perhaps he should have been addressing but one it was not fair to either of the three he guiltily felt but business was business with him

from his friends sister he received most delightful epistles not altogether frivolous with a great amount of common sense between the lines but what was more to the point her father was wealthy and she must have some conception of what was required to accumulate and to hold he rather liked her it now seemed

now from the preachers daughter he received also pleasing letters encouraging but not to say unconventionally forward he appreciated the fact that she was a preachers child and naturally expected to conform to a certain custom

but from new york he received the most encouragement the position the maid held rather thrilled him he loved the road â and she wrote such letters it was plain to be seen here what the answer would be

which

he borrowed ten thousand dollars giving a mortgage upon his land in security therefor he purchased relinquishments upon three beautiful quarter sections of land in the county lying just to the west the same having to be homesteaded before title was acquired had all ready been in part arranged for his grandmother and sister were waiting to file on a place each â the third was for the bridetobe there remained a few weeks yet in which to make said selection but notwithstanding all must be ready to make filing not later than the first day of october â and september at last arrived

he became serious then uneasy which he wrote all three letters that would give either or all a right to hear the words from him but did not say sufficient to any to give grounds for a possible breach of promise suit later

he rather liked the girl whose father had made money

yes it so seemed â more than either of the other two a match with her on the surface seemed more practical but for some reason she did not reply within the time to the letter he had written her oh if he could only have courted her could have been in the position to have seen her of a warm night to have said to her 

poor jean baptiste your life might not have later come to what it did   

he waited â but in vain october was drawing dangerously near when at last he left for somewhere indeed he had not a complete idea where but of one thing he had concluded when he returned he would bring the bridetobe

at omaha he made up his mind the girl whose father had made money had had her chance and failed he regretted it very much but this was a business proposition and he had two thousand dollars at stake that he would lose if he failed to get some one to file on that quarter section he had provided on october first

he was rather disturbed over the idea he really would have preferred a little more sentiment â but time had become the expedient of course he argued as he sped toward chicago ill be awfully good to the one i choose so if it is a little out of the ordinary â why ill try to make up for it when she is mine

with this consolation he arrived in chicago wishing that the girl who lived two hundred miles south of omaha and whose father was welltodo had replied to his letter he really had chosen her out of the three however he resigned himself to the inevitable â one of the other two

he left the train and boarded the south side l he got off again at thirtyfirst street and found what he had always found before state street and negroes he was not interested in either this time he had sent a telegram to new york from omaha to the effect that he was headed for chicago it was to the maid for she had drawn second choice he planned to meet her at the number her dear friend â and the match maker lived

so it was to this number he now hurried

 oh mr baptiste cried this little woman whose name happened to be rankin and she was an old maid she gave him her little hand and was  delighted  to see him

 and youve come miss pitt will be so glad she has talked of nobody but mr baptiste this summer oh im so glad you have come  and she shook his hand again

 i sent her a telegram that i was coming and i trust she will let me know  

 she is due in tomorrow cried their little friend and her voice was like delicate music

i expect a telegram he said evenly  i am somewhat rushed

indeed but of course you are a business man mr

baptiste chimed miss rankin with much admiration in her little voice  how miss pitt will like you

jean baptiste smiled a smile of vanity he was getting anxious to meet miss pitt himself â inasmuch as he expected to ask her to become his wife on the morrow

 tingalingaling  went the bell on the street door and little miss rankin rushed forth to open it

 special for mr jean baptiste he heard and went to get it after signing he broke the seal a little nervously and drawing the contents forth read the enclosed message

he sighed when it was over miss pitt had been taken with a severe attack of neuralgia in new york was indisposed and under the care of a physician but would be in chicago in six days he studied the calendar on the wall

six days would mean october second

too late miss pitt your chance is gone and now we turn to the party of the third part who will follow us through our story memories â n justine mccarthy she will not be in tomorrow said baptiste handing the letter to miss rankin

 oh is that so  cried miss rankin in a tone of deep disappointment as she took the letter now isnt that just too bad

 it is agreed baptiste  i will not get to see her since i shall have to return to the west not later than two or three days he was extremely disappointed he sat down with a sigh and rested his chin in his palm looking before him thoughtfully

 im sure sorry so sorry mused miss rankin abstractedly  and you cannot possibly wait until next week   she asked anxiously

he shook his head sadly

 impossible absolutely impossible

 it is certainly too bad miss pitt was so anxious to meet you and i was too because i think you and her would like each each other shes an awfully good girl and willing to help a fellow just the kind of a girl you he shifted his position now and was absorbed in his thoughts he had come back to his purpose he was sorry for miss pitt but he had also been sorry that miss grey had not answered his letter    the association with neither true had developed into a love affair so would not need

be hard to forget he had agreed with himself that love was to come later he had exercised discretion any one of the three was a desirable mate from a practical point of view after marriage he was confident that they could conform sufficiently to each others views to get along perhaps be happy miss mc carthy was in his opinion the most intelligent of the three as she had been to school and had graduated from college he had confidence in education uplifting people it made them more observing it helped them morally and with him this meant much

he was very critical when it came to morals he had studied his race along this line and he was very exacting because unfortunately as a whole their standard of morals were not so high as it should be of course he understood that the same began back in the time of slavery they had not been brought up to a regard of morality in a higher sense and they were possessed with certain weaknesses he was aware that in the days of slavery the negro to begin with had had as a rule only what he could steal therefore stealing became a virtue

when accused as he naturally was sure to be he had resorted to the subtle art of lying so lying became an expedient so it had gone then he came down to the point of physical morality

the masters had so often the slave women lustful by disposition as concubine he had in so doing of course mixed the races jean baptiste knew until not more than one half of the entire race in america are without some trait of caucasian blood there had been no defense then and for some time after there was no law that exacted punishment for a masters cohabitation with slave women so it had grown into a custom and was practiced in the south in a measure still

so with freedom his race had not gotten away from these loose practices they were given still to lustful undependable habits which he at times became very impatient with his version was that a race could not rise higher than their morals so in his business procedure of choosing a wife one thing over all else was unalterable she must be chaste and of high morals

orlean mc carthy however she as yet appeared from a practical standpoint could he estimated rightly boast of this virtue no doubt she was equally as high in all other perquisites but strangely he did not just wish to ask miss mc carthy to become his wife he could not understand it altogether he was confident that no girl lived who perhaps was likely as likely to conform to his desires as she but plan do as he would that lurking aversion still remained â infinitely worse it grew to a fear

he sighed perceptibly and miss rankin catching the same was deeply sympathetic because she thought it was due to the disappointment he felt in realizing that he was not to see miss pitt on the morrow she placed her arm gently about his shoulders leaned her small head close to his and stroked his hair with her other hand

 well said he after a time and to himself  i left the west to find a wife ive lived out there alone long enough i want a home love and comfort and only a wife can bring that he paused briefly in his mutterings his face became firm that will that had asserted itself and made him what he was today became uppermost he slowly let the sentiment out of him which was at once mechanically replaced by a cold set purpose he smiled then not a sentimental smile but one cold hard and singularly dry

 oh by the way miss rankin he essayed rising apbecause his older brothers had been hunting they had caught several rabbits and shot a few partridges he had been allowed to follow for the first time and had carried the game    how distinctly it came back to him now

he had picked the feathers from the quail and had held the rabbits while his brothers skinned them and later they had placed the game in cold water from their deep well and had thereupon placed the pan holding the same upon the roof of the summer kitchen and that night the frost had come and when morning was again the ice cold water had drawn the blood from the meat of the game and the same was clear and white

 now young man his mother said to him the following morning  you will get into clean cothes and stay clean do you understand 

 yes mama i understand he answered  but mama why he inquired jean baptiste had always asked such questions and for his doing so his mother had always rebuked him

 you will ask the questions my son she said raising his child body in her arms and kissing him fondly  but i dont mind telling you she stood him on the ground then and pointed to him with her forefinger  because we are going to have company from town big people the preachers lots of them so little boys should be good and clean and be scarce when the preachers are around they are big men with no time or care to waste with little boys

 mum he had chimed

and why mama do the preachers have no time for little boys  were they not little boys once themselves  

 now jean she had admonished thereupon  you are entirely too inquisitive for a little boy there will be other company also teachers and mrs winston do you understand so be good with that she went about her dinner cooking the rabbits and the quail that he had brought home the day before

it had seemed an age before in their spring wagon followed by the lumber wagon the dignitaries of the occasion wheeled into the yard he could not recall now how many preachers there were except that there were many he was in the way he recalled however because unlike his other brothers he was not bashful but the preachers did not seem to see him they were all large and tall and stout he could well remember but the teachers took notice of him one had caught him up fondly kissed him and thereupon carried him into the house in her arms she talked with him and he with her and he could well recall that she listened intently to all he told her regarding his adventures of the day before in the big woods that was at their back how beautiful and sweet he had thought she was when she smiled she showed a golden tooth something new to him and he did not understand except that it was different from anything he had ever seen before

after a long time he thought dinner was called and as was the custom he was expected to wait he had very often tried to reason with his mother that he could sit at the corner of the table in a high chair and eat out of a saucer he had promised always to be good just as good as he could be and he would not talk but his mother would not trust him and it was understood that he should wait

at the call of dinner he slid from the teachers lap upon the floor and went outside he peeped through the window from where he stood on a block he saw them eat and eat and eat he saw the quail the boys had shot disappear one after another into the mouths of the big preachers and since he had counted and knew how many quail there were he had watched with a growing fear  will they not leave one  he cried

at last when he could endure it no longer he ran into the house walked into the dining room unseen and stood looking on now the teacher who had the golden tooth happened to turn and espy him and thereupon she cried  oh there is my little man and i know he is hungry

where did you go sweet one come now quick to me whereupon she held out loving arms into which he went and he had great difficulty in keeping back the tears

but he was hungry and he had seen the last quail taken from the plate by a preacher who had previously taken two

upon her knee she had sat him and he looked up into all the faces about he then looked down into her plate and saw a half of quail his anxious eyes found hers and then went back to the plate and the half of quail thereon

 that is for you sweetness she cried and began to take from the table other good things while he fell to eating feeding his mouth with both hands for he was never before so hungry

after a few moments he happened to lift his eyes from the plate just to the side of the beloved teacher he observed a large tall and stout preacher he wore a jet black suit and around his throat a clerical vest fit closely while around his neck he wore a white collar hind part before the preachers eyes had found jeans and he gave a start the eyes of the other were upon him and they were angry eyes he paused in his eats and gazed not understanding into the eyes that were upon him then suddenly he recalled that he had observed that the preacher had been smiling upon the teacher he had laughed and joked and said many things that little jean had not understood as far as he could see it appeared as if the teacher had not wished it but the flirtation had been kept up

at last in his child mind he had understood his crawling upon the teachers lap had spoiled it allthe preacher was angry therefore the expression in his eyes

from across the table his mother stood observing him

she seemed not to know what to say or do for it had always been so very hard to keep this one out of grown peoples way so she continued to stand hesitatingly

 didnt your mother say that you were to wait

growled the preacher and his face was darker by the anger that was in it this frightened jean he could and no answer in the moment to such words his little eyes had then sought those of the teacher who in reply drew him closely to her  why reverend she cried amazed  hes a little boy a nice child and hungry whereupon she caressed him again he was pacified then and his eyes held some fire when he found the preachers again the others too had grown more evil the preachers lips parted he leaned slightly forward as he said lowly angrily  youre an impudent ill mannered little boy and you need a spanking

then suddenly the child grew strangely angry he couldnt understand perhaps it was because he had helped secure the quail all of which the preachers were eating and felt that in view of this he was entitled to a piece of one

he could not understand afterward how he had said it but he extended his little face forward close to the preachers as he poured  i aint no impudent ittle boy either i went to hunt with my brothers yistidy and i carried all the game and now you goin eat it all and leave me none when im hungry

youre mean man and make me mad

as he spoke everything seemed to grow dark around him

he recalled that he was suddenly snatched from the teachers lap and carried to the summer kitchen which was all closed and dark inside he recalled that switches were there and that soon he felt them as a rule he cried and begged before he was ever touched but strangely then he never cried and he never begged

he just kept his mouth shut tightly and had borne all the pain inflicted by his mother and she had punished him longer than she had ever done before perhaps it was because she felt she had to make him cry felt that he must cry else he had not repented

after a time he felt terribly dazed became sleepy and gradually fell into a slumber while the blows continued to fall

how long he slept he could not remember but gradually he came out of it there were no more blows then yet his little body felt sore all over when he looked up for he was lying on his back in the summer kitchen his mother sat near and was crying and wiping the tears with her apron while over him bent the teacher and she was crying also and as the tears had fallen unchecked upon his face he had heard the teacher saying  its a shame an awful shame the poor poor little fellow he was hungry and had helped to get the game

and to be punished so severely because he wanted to eat is a shame oh mrs baptiste you must pray to your god for forgiveness and his mother had cried more than ever then

presently he heard a heavy footfall and peeped upward to see his father standing over him his father was fair of complexion and unlike his mother never said much and was not commonly emotional but when he was angry he was terrible and he was angry now his blue eyes shone like fire

 what is this belle he cried in a terrible voice  youve killed my boy about that dân preacher  his father stooped and looked closely into his face in fear he had opened his eyes jean he heard his father breathe  god but its a blessing you are alive or there would be a dead preacher in that house

oh fawn his mother cried and fell on him weeping

the teacher joined in to pacify him and in that moment jean was forgotten stiffly he had slipped from the room and had gone around near the kitchen step of the big house to a place where the dogs had their bed here he kept a heavy green stick a short club he passed before the door and observed the preacher still sitting at the table talking with mrs winston he glared at him a moment and his little eyes narrowed to mere slits then he thought of something else  it was mose allen mose allen a hermit who lived in the woods it was miles â in his mind â to where mose lived through heavy forests and timber but he was going there he was going there to stay with old mose and live in the woods he had done nothing wrong yet had been severely punished before this he had thought several times that when he became a man he would like to be a preacher a big preacher and be admired but now â never he would go to old mose allens live in the woods â and hate preachers forever

later deep into the forest he plodded deep deeper until all about him he was surrounded with overgrowth but resolutely he struggled onward he crossed a branch presently and knew where he was the branch divided their land with eppencamps the german from there the forest grew deeper the trees larger and the underbrush more tangled but he was going to mose allen and remembered that that was the way he grasped his green club tighter and felt like a hunter in the bear stories his big brothers had read to him he crossed a raise between the branch and the creek where the water flowed deeply and where they always went fishing he paused upon reaching the creek for there a footlog lay for the first time he experienced a slight fear he didnt like foot logs and had never crossed one alone he had always been carried across by his brothers but his brothers were not near and he was running away so he took courage and approached the treacherous bridge he looked down at the whirling waters below with some awe but finally with a grimace he set his foot on the slick trunk of the fallen tree and started across he recalled then that if one looked straight ahead and not down at the water it was easy but his mind was so much on the waters below he kept his eyes elsewhere with great effort and finally reached the middle now it seemed that he could not go one step further unless he saw what was below him he hesitated dosed his eyes and though of the whipping he had received and the preacher he hated opened them and with calm determination bom of anger crossed safely to the other side

he sighed long and deeply when he reached the other side he looked back at the muddy waters whirling below and with another sigh plunged into the forest again and on toward mose allens

he gained the other side of the forest in due time and came into the clearing a cornfield was between him and another forest and almost to the other side of this mose allen lived the sun was getting low and the large oaks behind him cast great shadows that stretched before him and far out into the cornfield he thought of ghosts and hurried on he must reach mose allens before night that was sure

it was a long way he thought when he reached the other side and the forest before him appeared ominous he was inclined to be frightened but when he looked toward the west and home he saw that the sun had sunk and he plunged grimly again into the deep woodland before him

now the people of the neighborhood had made complaints and it was common talk about the country that chickens and young pigs and calves had been attacked and destroyed by something evil in the forests at night this evil spirit had stolen out and ravaged the stock and the chickens

accordingly those interested had planned a hunt for what was thought to be a catamount it was not until he had gone deeply into the woods and the darkness was everywhere about him that he remembered the catamount he stopped and tried to pick the briers out of his bleeding hands and as he did so he heard a terrible cry he went cold with fear he hardly dared breathe and crouched in a hole he had found where only his shoulders and head were exposed he awaited with abated breath for some minutes and was about to venture out when again the night air and darkness was rent by the terrible cry he crouched deeper into the hole and trembled for the noise was drawing nearer on and on it came he thought of a thousand things in one minute and again he heard the cry it was very near now and he could hear the crunch of the animals feet upon the dry leaves and still on and on it came presently it was so close that he could see it the body of the beast became dimly outlined before him and he could see the eyes plainly as it swung its head back and forth and its red eyes shone like coals of fire

again the varmint rent the night air with its yell as it espied its prey crouching in the hole

by watching the eyes he observed the head sink lower and lower until it almost touched the earth and thereupon he became suddenly calm and apprehensive he held his breath and met it calmly face to face his club was drawn his eyes were keen and intense he waited suddenly the air was rent with another death rendering cry and the beast sprung

it had reckoned well but so had he he had moreover struck direct the blow caught the beast on the point of its nose and muffled and spoiled its directed spring

he quickly came out of the hole and then before the animal could get out of his reach he struck it again with such force at the back of the head that the beast was stunned

again and again he struck until the head was like a bag of bones when his strength was gone and all was quiet he became conscious of a drowsiness he sank down and laid his head upon the body of the dead animal and fell into a deep sleep

and there they found him during the early hours of the morning and took him and the dead catamount home

another beer capn he heard from the bartender

he quickly stood erect and gazed about in some confusion

yes he replied throwing a coin upon the bar he drank the beer quickly went out bought miss rankin the cream and after delivering it to her went outside again and up state street

he was overcome with memories was jean baptiste he had a task to accomplish he was going to vernon avenue where miss mc carthy lived to ask her to become his wife

and the preacher who had been the cause of his severe punishment twenty years before was her father the rev

n j mc carthy

orlean oh mama cried orlean e mc carthy coming hastily from the hallway into the room where  her mother sat sewing and handing her a note  mr baptiste is in the city and wishes to call at the earliest possible convenience

 indeed replied her mother affecting a serious expression  this is rather sudden have you sent him word when he could 

yes mama i wrote him a note and returned it by the boy that brought this one that he could call at two oclock

her mothers gaze sought the clock automatically

and it is now past one she replied  you will have to get ready to receive him she advised ceremoniously

 all right mama said orlean cheerfully and suddenly bending forward kissed her mother impulsively upon the cheek and a moment later hurried upstairs

 what is this i hear about somebody coming to call

inquired another coming into the room at that moment

mrs mc carthy looked up on recognizing the voice of her younger daughter ethel who now stood before her she gave a perceptible start as she did so and swallowed before she replied in the meantime the other stood regarding her rather severely as was her nature

she was very tall was ethel and because she was so very thin she appeared really taller than she was she did not resemble her mother who was a dumpy light brown skinned woman she was part indian and possessed a heavy head of hair which when let down fell over her shoulders

ethel on the other hand was somewhat darker had a thin face with hair that was thick but rather short and bushy her eyes were small and dark out of which she never seemed to look straight at one they appeared always to be lurking and without any expression unless it was an expression of dislike forsooth she was a known disagreeable person ostentatious pompous and hard to get along with

she was a bride of a few weeks and was then resting after a short honeymoon spent in racine wisconsin sixty miles north of chicago

 why mr baptiste is coming coming to call on your sister he has been corresponding with her for some time you understand her mother returned in her mild trained manner

 oh i  echoed ethel apparently at a loss whether to be pleased or displeased she was as often one way as the other so her mother was apprehensive of something more

 i think you have met him have you not her mother inquired

 yes ive met him admitted ethel  last winter while teaching

 and what do you think of him my dear 

 well he has some ways i dont like

 what ways please  she had started to say  naturally but thought better of it

 oh he does not possess the dignity i like in a man

struck me as much too commonplace

 oh her mother grunted she was acquainted with ethels disposition which was extremely vain she loved pomp and ceremony and admired very few people

 whats he calling to see orlean for  

her mother looked up in some surprise she regarded her daughter keenly  why my dear why do you ask such a question why do young men call to see any young ladies   both turned at this moment to see orlean coming down the stairway and attention was fastened upon her following

 all dolled up to meet your farmer commented ethel with a touch of envy in her voice in truth she was envious her husband was just an ordinary fellow â that is he was largely what she was making of him it was said that she had found no other man who was willing to tolerate her evil temper and that perhaps was why she had married him while with him he had been anxious to marry her to satisfy his social ambition although an honest hardworking fellow he had come of very common stock from the backwoods of tennessee where his father had been a crude untrained preacher he had come to chicago and had met and married her after a courtship of six years

 you look very nice my dear said her mother addressing orlean between the two children there was a great difference although older orlean was by far the more timid by disposition an obedient girl in every way she had never been known to cross her parents and had the happy faculty of making herself generally liked while ethel invited disfavor

she was not so tall as ethel and while not as short as her mother she was heavier than either she was the image of her father who was dark although not black after her mother she had taken her hair which while not as fine was nevertheless heavy black and attractive her eyes were dark like her mothers which were coal black they were small and tender her expression was very frank but she had inherited her mothers timidness and was subservient unto her father and in a measure unto her younger sister ethel

she was a year older than the man who was coming to see her and had never had a beau

 do i look all right mama she asked turning so that she might be seen all around

 yes my dear the other replied she always used the term  my dear she had been trained to say that when she was a young wife and had never gotten out of the habit

 now sit down my daughter she said judiciously  and before the young man comes to call on you tell me all about him

 yes and leave out nothing interposed ethel

 she is talking to your mother ethel you will do her a favor by going to your room until it is over advised their mother

 oh well if im not wanted then ill go spit out ethel wickedly whereupon she turned and hastened up the stairs to her room and slammed the door behind her

 ethel has such a temper her mother sighed deploringly  she is so different from you dear you are like your mother while she â well she has her fathers ways

 papa is not as mean as ethel defended orlean ever obedient to her mother yet always upholding her father it mattered not what the issue

her mother sighed again shifted in her chair and said no more on that subject she knew the father better than orlean and would not argue she had been trained not to   

 now where did you meet mr baptiste my dear she began

 where i taught last winter mother she replied obediently

 and how did you come to meet him daughter 

 why he was calling on a girl friend of mine and i happened along while he was there and the girl introduced us

 mm was that the first time you had seen him

 no i had met him on the street when he was on the way down there

 i see did he speak to you on the street  

 oh no mother he did not know me

 but he might have spoken anyhow   

 but he was a gentleman and he never spoke she paused briefly and then her voice a trifle lower said of course he looked at me butâ

 well any man would do that we must grant that men are men how were you impressed with him when you met him later at this friends house

well i dont know returned orlean hesitatingly

 he seemed to be a great talker was very commonplace dressed nicely but not showily he knew quite a few people in chicago that we know and was born near the town in which i met him he was just returning from new york and â well i rather admired him he is far above the average colored man i can say

 mm her mother mused thoughtfully and with an air of satisfaction she couldnt think of anything more to say just then and upon looking at the clock which showed ten minutes of two she said  well you had better go in the parlor and after he has called when convenient call me and permit me to meet him you will be careful my dear and understand that we have raised you to be a lady and exercise your usual dignity

 yes mama

on the hour the street door bell was pulled with a jerk and arising orlean went toward the door expectantly

 oh how do you do she cried a moment later her face lighted with a radiant smile as she extended her hand and allowed it to rest in that of jean baptistes

 miss mc carthy he cried with her hand in one of his and his hat in the other he entered the door

may i take your hat asked orlean and taking it placed it on the hall tree in the meantime his habitually observing eyes were upon her and when she turned she found him regarding her closely

 come right into the parlor please mr baptiste and be seated she hesitated between the davenport and the chairs while he without ado chose the davenport and became seated and the look he turned upon her commanded more than words that she too be seated with a little hesitation she finally sank on the davenport at a conventional distance beside him

 i was not certain judging by your last letter just when you would get here she began timidly he regarded her out of his searching eyes attentively he was weighing her in the balance he saw in those close glances what kind of a girl she was apparently for after a respite he relaxed audibly but kept his eyes on her nevertheless

 i was not certain myself he said  i am so rushed these days that i do not know always just what comes next but i am glad that i am here at last â and to see you looking so well

they exchanged the usual words about the weather and other conventional notes and then she called her mother

 mama i wish you to meet mr baptiste mr baptiste this is my mother

 mr baptiste said her mother giving him her hand  i am glad to know you

 the same here madam he returned cheerfully

 guess your health is good

 very good im glad to say

they talked for a time and all were cheered to find themselves so agreeable

 i think i can slightly recall your people mr baptiste

her mother remarked thoughtfully  my husband dr

mc carthy she said giving him an honorary term pastored the church in the town near where you were born many years ago

 i do say he echoed noncommitally

 do you recall it  she asked

he appeared to be thinking  he hardly knew what to say then after some deliberation he brightened and said  i think i do i was very young then but i think i do recall your husband   

your name â the name of your family has always remained in my mind said she then reflectively

 indeed it is a rather peculiar name

 it is so i should say she cried if it is quite fair may i ask where or how your father came by such a name  

 oh it is very simple my father of course was bom a slave like most â almost all negroes previous to the war â and took the name from his master who i suppose was of french descent

 oh that explains it of course that is natural mm but its a beautiful name i must say

he smiled

it is an illustrious name also she commented further

 but the man who carries it in this instance is much to the contrary notwithstanding he laughed depreciatingly

it is a very beautiful day without my dear she said addressing her daughter  and perhaps mr baptiste might like to walk out and see some of the town

 i most assuredly would he cried glad of something for a change he was restless and estimated that if he felt the air with her at his side it might help him

orlean arose went upstairs and returned shortly wearing a large hat that set off her features he rather liked her under it and when they walked down the street together he was conscious of an air of satisfaction

 where would you like to go   she asked as they neared the intersection

 for a car ride on the elevated he replied promptly

 then we will go right down this street this is thirtythird and theres an elevated station a few blocks from here

they walked along leisurely she listening attentively while he talked freely of the west his life there and what he was doing when they reached the l he assisted her upstairs to the station and in so doing touched her arm for the first time the contact gave him a slight sensation but he felt more easy when they had entered the car and taken a seat together a moment later they were gazing out over the great city below as the cars sped through the air

it was growing dark when they returned and she invited him to dinner he accepted and thereupon met ethel and her husband

ethel was all pomp and ceremony while her husband with his cue from her acted in the same manner and they rather bored jean baptiste with their airs he was glad when the meal was over he followed odean back to the parlor where they took a seat on the davenport again and drew closer to her this time soon she said  do you play

 lord no  he exclaimed  but i shall be glad to listen to you

 i cant play much she said modestly  but i will play what little i know thereupon she became seated and played and sang he thought very well after she had played a few pieces she turned and looked up at him and he caught the full expression of her eyes he could see that they were tender eyes eyes behind which there was not apparently the force of will that he desired but orlean mc carthy was a fine girl she was fine because she was not wicked because she was intelligent and had been carefully reared she was fine because she had never cultivated the society of undesirable or common people but she was not a fine girl because she had a great mind or great ability or because she had done anything illustrious and this jean baptiste a judge of human nature could readily see but he would marry her he would be good to her and she would he hoped never have cause to regret having married him and thereupon he bent close to her took her chin in his hand and kissed her upon the lips she turned away when he had done this in truth she was not expecting such from him and knew not just how to accept it her lips burned with a new sensation she had a peculiar feeling about the heart she arose and went to the piano and her fingers wandered idly over the keys as she endeavored to still her beating heart

shortly she felt his hand upon her shoulder and she turned to hear him say wont you come back into the parlor i â would like to speak to you  

she consented without hesitation and arising followed him timidly back to the seat they had occupied a few minutes before again seated he drew closely but did not deign to place his arm about her looked toward the rear of the house where the others were and seeing that the doors were closed between them sighed lightly and turned to her

 now miss mc carthy he began evenly  i am going to say something to you that i have never said to a woman before he paused while she waited with abated breath

i havent known you long but that is not the point

what i should say is that in view of our brief correspondence it will perhaps appear rather bold of me to say what i wish to yet there comes a time in life when circumstances alter cases

 now to be frank i have always regarded matrimony as a business proposition and while sentiment is a very great deal in a way business considerations should be the first expedient she was all attention she was peculiarly thrilled it was wonderful to listen to him she thought and not for anything would she interrupt him but what did he mean what was he going to say

well i miss mc carthy need a wife i want a wife but my life has not been lived where social intercourse with girls of my race has been afforded as you might understand she nodded understandingly sympathetically

her womans nature was to sympathize and what she did was only natural with all women

 it has not been my privilege to know any girl of my race intimately i am not as i sit here beside you able to conscientiously or truly go to one and say love you dear and want you to be my wife in the conventional sense therefore can i be forgiven if i say to you if i ask you miss mc carthy and so saying he turned to her his face serious  to become my wife 

he had paused and her soul was afire was this a proposal or was it a play for a time she was afraid to say anything she wouldnt say no and she was afraid to say yes until â well until she was positive that he had actually asked her to marry him as it was she hesitated

but it was so wonderful she thought it was so beautiful to be so near such a wonderful young man such a strong young man the young men she had known had not been like this one and really she wanted to marry she was twentysix and since her sister had married she had found life lonely to be a mans wife and go and live alone with him must be wonderful she was a reader and he had sent her books in all books and life and everything there was love

and love always had its climax in a place where one lived alone with a man oh glorious she was ready to listen to anything he had to say

 now i do not profess love to you miss mc carthy in trying to make this clear i could not and be truthful

and i have always tried to be truthful indeed i could not feel very happy i am sure unless i was truthful to pretend that which i am not is hypocrisy and i despise a hypocrite i am an owner of land in the west and i believe you will agree with me that it behooves any negro to acquire all he can we are such a race of paupers

we own so little and have such little prestige thankfully i am at present on the high road to success and because of that i want a wife a dear kind girl as a mate the most natural thing in the world she nodded unaware what he was saying had not been said to her in that way but the way he said it was so much to the point she had not been trained to observe that which was practical indeed her father was regarded as a most impractical man but she liked this man beside her now and was anxious for him to go on he did

 i own  acres of very valuable land and have consummated a deal for  more acres this land is divided into tracts of  acres each and must be homesteaded before the same is patented

 now my grandmother and also a sister are already in the west and will homestead on two places the other i have arranged for you the proceeding is simple it will be necessary only for you to journey out west file on this land as per my directions after which we can be married any time after and we can then live together on your claim do you understand 

 i think so she said a bit falteringly

 now my dear do not feel that i am a charter barterer we can simply acquire a valuable tract of land by this process and be as we would under any other circumstances once you were out there all would be very plain to you but at this distance it is perhaps foreign to you that i understand

she looked up into his face trustingly right then she wanted him to kiss her it was all so irregular but he was a man and she a maid and she had never had a love

   he seemed to understand and passionately he caught her to him and kissed her many many times

it was all over then as far as she was concerned she had not said yes or no with words but her lips had been her consent and she knew she would love him it was the happiest hour in the simple life she had lived and she was ready to become his forever

a proposal a proposition a certain mrs pruittâand a letter oh mama mr baptiste has asked me to marry him cried orlean rushing into the room and to the bed where her mother lay reading after jean baptiste had left

 why my child this â this is rather sudden is it not 

mr baptiste has known you only a few months and has been corresponding with you just a little while her mother said with some excitement suddenly sitting erect in the bed

 yes mama what you say is true but he explained he said â well i cant quite explain but he â he wants to marry me mama and you know â well mama you understand dont you 

 yes i understand all girls want husbands but it must be regular so take off your clothes dear get into bed and tell me just what mr baptiste did say

the other did as instructed and as best she could tried to make plain what jean had said to her regarding the land and all she didnt make it very plain and the matter rather worried her but the fact that he had asked her to marry him was uppermost in her mind and she finally went to sleep happier than she had ever been in her life before

 now when the young man calls today you will have him take his business up with me her mother instructed judiciously the following morning

 he will explain it all mama he can do so very easily she said glad to be relieved of the difficult task

yet she had her worries withal her mother was a very difficult person to explain anything to besides orlean knew her mother was in constant fear of her father who was a presiding elder traveling over the southern part of the state and who came into the city only every few months

and if her mother was hard to make understand anything her father was worse â and business he knew next to nothing about although he was then five and fifty

jean baptiste had accomplished a great many more difficult tasks than explaining to his prospective motherinlaw in regard to the land when she seemed to have sensed what it all meant he observed that she would give a peculiar little start and he would have to try it all over again in truth she understood better than she appeared to but it was the girls father whom she feared to angerâfor in all her life she had never been able to please him

but she found a way out along late that afternoon when a caller was announced

the visitor was a woman possessed of rare wits and of all the people that mrs mc carthy disliked and of all who disliked mrs mc carthy mrs pruitt was the most pronounced yet it was mrs pruitt who settled the difficulty and saved the day for orlean and jean baptiste but as to why mrs pruitt should dislike mrs mc carthy and mrs

mc carthy should dislike mrs pruitt there is a story that was known among all their friends and acquaintances

when miss rankin had said what she did about rev

n j mc carthy she had not told all nor had she referred to any woman in particular she was not a scandal monger

but she knew as all chicago knew that in so far as the parties in question were concerned there was a friendship between mrs pruitt and the reverend that was rather subtle and had been for years and it was this which caused the two mentioned to dislike each other with an unspoken hatred

but mrs mc carthy trusted orleans going eight hundred miles west to file on a homestead and what might come of it to mrs pruitt rather than to herself while she could â was aware of it â she did not dare venture anything to the contrary where it might come back to her husbands ears she knew mrs pruitt had more influence with her husband than had she    therefore when she invited jean baptiste to meet mrs pruitt who had met him years before she breathed a sigh of relief

it was over in a few hours mrs pruitt would accompany orlean to the west and back with jean baptiste paying expenses and preparations were made thereto

in two days they had reached gregory where the great land excitement was on from over all the country people had gathered and the demand for the land had reached its greatest boom since jean baptiste had come to the country

his sister and grandmother had arrived during his absence and after greeting them he was handed a letter which read my dear mr baptiste your most delightful letter was received by me today and that you may see just how much i appreciate it i am answering at otta and hope you will receive the same real soon

to begin with the reason i have not answered sooner is quite obvious i was away on a short visit and only returned home today to find that your most interesting letter had been here several days think of it and i would have given most anything to have had it sooner

well in reference to what you intimated in your letter regarding the land up there i am deeply interested nothing strikes my fancy so much as homesteading â which i think you meant i would the best in the world like to hold down a claim and am sure i would make a great homesteader but why write more an hour with you will explain matters more fully than a hundred letters so i will close with this you hinted about coming down and my invitation is to do so and do so at your earliest possible convenience i am waiting with great anxiety your honored appearance

in the meantime trusting that you are healthy hopeful and happy please believe me to be cordially sincerely â and anxiously yours irene grey

he regarded the letter a little wistfully and the next moment tore it to bits flung it to the winds and went about his business

the prairie fire my mother grabbed me kissed and hugged me time and again when i returned jean baptiste read in the letter he received from his wifetobe a few days after she had returned to the windy city and he was satisfied  she had been so worried you see because she had written father nothing about it and this was the first time in her married life that she has dared do anything without a long consultation with him but she is glad i went now and thinks you are a very sensible fellow therefor papa sent a telegram advising that he had been reappointed presiding elder over the same district and would come into chicago for a few days before entering into another year of the work

 i am deluged with questions regarding the west and it gives me a great deal of pleasure to explain everything and of the wonderful work you are doing now papa will be home in a few days and knowing how hard he is to explain anything to i am preparing myself for quite a task i will close now with love and kisses to you believe me to be  your own  orlean

jean now went about his duties his sister and grandmother were with him and he had planned to put them on their claims at once so as to enable them to prove up as soon as possible therefore to their places he hauled lumber coal and provisions their claims lay some fortyfive miles to the northwest beyond the railroad which now had its terminus at dallas and referring to that we have not found occasion to mention what had taken place in the country in the two years passed

when the railroad had missed dallas and struck gregory and the other two government townsites dallas was apparently doomed and in a few months most of the business men had gone and the business buildings etc had been moved to gregory this town because of the fact that it was only five miles from the next county line âthe county that had been opened and which contained the land that jean baptiste had secured for his relatives and bride â was for a time expected to become the terminus and to this end considerable activity had transpired with a view to getting the heavy trade that would naturally come with the opening and settlement of the county west which had twice the area of the county in which gregory lay

now it was shortly after the railroad was under course of construction that one the chief promoter of the townsite called on the town dads of gregory with a proposition the proposition was in short to move dallas to gregory and thereupon combine in making gregory a real city

unfortunately for gregory her leaders were men who had grown up in a part of the country where the people did not know all they might have known they consisted in a large measure of rustic mountebanks who because and only because gregory happened to have been in the direct line of the railroad survey and had thereby secured the road took unto themselves the credit of it all so instead of entertaining the offer in a logical business and appreciative manner gave the promoter the big haw haw and turned their backs to him

there was a spell of inactivity for a time on the part of the said promoter but in the fall when the ground had frozen hard and the corn was being gathered all that was left in the little town of dallas laying beside the claim of jean baptiste was suddenly hauled five miles west of the town of gregory and still before the gregory illogics had time even to think clearly business was going on in what they then chose to call new dallas â and the same lay directly on the line of the two counties and where the railroad survey ended

it is needless to detail the excitement which had followed this  lies lies liars were the epithets hurled from gregory  the railroad is in gregory to stay to stay forâoh they couldnt say how many years perhaps a hundred but all that noise to the west was a bluff a simon pure bluff and that ended it that is until they started the same noise over again but it had not been a bluff the tracks had been laid from gregory to dallas early in the spring that followed and now dallas was the town instead of gregory and the boom that had followed the building of the town is a matter never to be forgotten in the history of the country

gregorys one good fortune was that she had secured the land office which necessitated that all filings should be entered there and in this way got more of the boom that was occasioned by the land opening at the west than it had expected to when the railroad company had pushed its way west out of the town

it was about this time while great excitement was on and thousands of people were in the town of dallas that something occurred that came near literally wiping that town off the map jean baptiste had loaded his wagons and was on the way from his land to the claims of his sister when the same came to pass

the greatest danger in a new country comes after the grass has died in the fall and before the new grass starts in the spring but in the fall when the grass is dry and crisp and the surface below is warm and dry is the time of prairie fires no time could have been more opportune for such an episode than the time now was the wind had been blowing for days and days and had made the short grass very brittle and the surface below as hot as in july jean baptiste was within about a mile of where new dallas now reposed vaingloriously on a hillside her many new buildings rising proudly defiantly as if to taunt and annoy gregory against the skyline when with the wind greeting him he caught the smell of burning grass he reached a hillside presently and from there he could see for miles to the west beyond and the sight that met his gaze staggered him

 a prairie fire he cried apprehensively and urged his teams forward toward dallas one glance had been sufficient to convince him what it might possibly mean a prairie fire with the wind behind it as this was would bid no good for dallas and once there he could be of a little service since he knew how to fight it

when he arrived at the outskirts of the embryo city he was met by a frightened herd of humanity with bags and trunks and all they could carry with eyes wide and mouths gaped in terror they were hurrying madly from the town to an apparent place of safety â a plowed field nearby

miles to the west the fire and smoke rose in great dark reddened clouds and cast â even at that distance dark shadows over the little city as he drew into the town he could see a line of figures working at fire breaks before the gloom they were the promoters and the townspeople and he imagined how they must feel with death possible â and destruction positive coming like an angry beast directly upon them

soon jean baptiste with wet horse blankets was with them on the firing line the speed at which the wind was driving the fire was ominous soon all the west was as if lost in the conflagration for the sun shining out of a clear sky an hour before was now shut out as if clouds were over all the dull roar and crackle of the burning grass brought a feeling of awe over all before it the heat became after a time intense the air was surcharged with soot and the little army worked madly at the firebreaks

rolling tumbling twisting turning but always coming onward the hurricane presently struck the fire guards in that moment it was seen that a mass of thistles dried manure and all refuse from the prairie was sweeping before it as if to draw the fire onward the fire plunged over the guards as though they had not been made pushed back the little army and rushed madly into the town

it was impossible now to do more the conflagration was beyond control now in the town an effort was therefore made to get the people out of their houses where some had even hidden when it appeared that all would be swept away in the terrible deluge of fire one two three four five six â ten houses went up like chaff and the populace groaned when of a sudden something happened like napoleons army at waterloo there was a quick change

one of those rare freaks â but what some chose to claim in after years as the will of the creator in sympathy with the hopeful builders the wind gradually died down whipped around and in less than five minutes was blowing from the east almost directly against its route of a few minutes before the fire halted seemed to hesitate and then like some cowardly thing turned around and started back of the same ground it had raged over where it lingered briefly sputtered flickered and then quickly died

and the town badly frightened hard worked but thankful withal was saved

vanity my father is home and oh  but he did carry on h when he was informed regarding my trip west to take the homestead orlean wrote her betrothed in her next letter  he was so much upset over it that he went out of the house and walked in the street for a time to still his intense excitement when he returned however he listened to my explanation and after a time i was pleased to note that he was pacified and still later he was pleased and when a half day had passed he was tickled to death

 of course i was relieved then also and now i am fully satisfied i have not written you as soon as i should have on this account i thought it would be best to wait until papa had heard the news and was settled on the matter which he now is he has written you and i think you should receive the letter about the same time you will this

he has never been anxious in his simple old heart for me to marry but of course he understands that i must some day and now that i am engaged to you he appears to be greatly pleased

 by the way i have not received the ring yet and am rather anxious of course i wish to be quite reasonable but on the whole a girl hardly feels shes engaged until she is wearing the ring you know write me a real sweet letter and make it long in the meantime remember me as one who thinks a great deal of you from your fond orlean

baptiste heard from his fatherinlawtobe in due time and read the letter carefully replying to the same forthwith

we should record before going further that the incident which had happened between them in his youth had been almost as completely buried as it had been before the day of its recent resurrection in his reply he stated that he would come into the city xmas which meant of course that they would meet and come to understand each other better he was glad that the formalities were in part through with and would be glad when it was over he did not appreciate so much ado where so little was represented as it were he had it from good authority without inquiry that the reverend mc carthy had never possessed two hundred dollars at one time in his life and the formalities he felt compelled to go through with far exceeded that amount already and with this in mind he began gathering his corn crop which he had been delayed in doing on account of the stress of other more urgent duties

he had been at work but a few days when snow began to fall for days it fell from a northwesterly direction and then turning for a week came from an easterly direction

this kept up until the holidays arrived therefore most of the corn crop over all the country was caught and remained in the field all the winter through by the hardest work his sister and grandmother succeeded in reaching his place from their homesteads and stayed there while he went into chicago

 mr baptiste please meet my father said orlean when he called following his arrival in the city again he looked up to find a tall dark but handsome old man extending his hand he regarded him studied him carefully in a flash and in doing so his mind went back twenty years to a memorable day when he had been punished and had followed it by running away he extended his hand and grasped the others and wondered if he also remembered    they exchanged greetings and if the other recalled him he gave no evidence of the fact in his expression

when he had sat beside the teacher such a long time before baptiste recalled now that at the back of the others head there had been a white spot where the hair was changing color but now this spot spread over all the head and the hair was almost as white as snow with his dark skin this formed a contrast that gave the other a distinguished appearance which was noticeably striking but his eyes did not meet with baptistes favor though he was not inclined to take this seriously but as he continued to glance at him at times during the evening he did not fail to see that the other seemed never to look straight and frankly into his eyes and there was in his gaze and expression when he met baptisteâ so baptiste thought â a peculiar lurking as if some hidden evil were looking out of the infinite depths of the others soul it annoyed baptiste because every time he caught the others gaze he recalled the incident of twenty years before and wanted to forget it declared he would forget it and to that task he set himself and apparently succeeded while in the city

with ethel and her husband whose name was glavis he never got along at all ethel was pompous and known to be disagreeable while glavis was narrow and a victim of his wifes temper and disposition so unless the talk was on society and  big negroes which positively did not interest jean baptiste who was practical to the superlative there was no agreement

so when jean baptiste returned west he was conscious of a great relief

the severe winter passed at last and with early spring everybody completed the gathering of the corn and immediately turned to seeding their crops work was plentiful everywhere and to secure men to complete gathering his crop of corn baptiste had the greatest difficulty stewarts had failed to secure any land at all â either of the four in the drawing and being unable to purchase relinquishments on even one quarter at the large sum demanded therefor had gone toward the western part of the state and taken free homesteads as for agnes she had apparently passed out of his life

he labored so hard in the cold wet muddy fields in trying to get his corn out that he was taken ill and was not able to work at all for days and while so he wrote his fiancee his troubles and that since he was so indisposed with a world of work and expense upon him she would do him a great favor if she would consent to come to him and be married

now the mc carthys had given ethel a big wedding although her husband received only thirteen dollars a week for his work two hundred dollars so it was reported had been expended on the occasion such display did not appeal to the practical mind of jean he had lived his life too closely in accomplishing his purpose to become at this late day a victim of such simple vanity the ultra simple vanity of aping the rich upon this point his mind was duly set

the mc carthys had started to buy a home the summer before which was quite expensive and had entered into the contract with a payment of three hundred dollars the reverend had borrowed a hundred dollars on his life insurance and paid this in while glavis had paid another ethel had used what money she had saved teaching to expend in the big wedding so orlean had paid the other hundred out of the money she had saved teaching school

now if there was any big wedding for orlean then he jean baptiste knew that he would be expected to stand the expense therefore baptiste tried to make plain to orlean in his letters the gravity of his position she would be compelled to establish residence on her homestead early in may and this was april or forfeit her right and sacrifice all he had put into it

but orlean became unreasonable â jean baptiste reasoned she set forth that she did not think it right for her to go away out there and marry him that he should come to her she seemed to have lost sense of all he had written her regarding the crops responsibilities and other considerations he wrote her to place it up to her mother and father which she did to reply in the same tenor they had not agreed to it either he replied then heatedly and hinted that her father was not a business man else he would have realized his circumstances and as man to man appreciated the same

the next letter he received had enclosed the receipt for the first payment of the purchase price of six dollars an acre a charge the government had made on the land amounting to some  in the first payment she released him from his promise â but kept the ring

 now dont that beat the devil he exclaimed angrily when he read the letter  as though this receipt is worth anything to me or that it would suffice to get back the  i paid the man for the relinquishment the only thing that will suffice is for her to go on the land so i guess ill have to settle this nuisance at once by going to chicago and marrying her

so he started for the windy city

at omaha he sent a telegram to her to the effect that he was on the way and would arrive in the city on the morrow

he arrived he called her up from the northwestern station and she called back that it was settled she had given him her word the engagement was off

 oh foolish he called jovially  it isnt she called back angrily  well said he  ill call and see you     no need she said  but youll see me he called  yes ill see you ill do you that honor   

now when jean baptiste had called over the phone glavis had answered the call and thereupon had started an argument that orlean had concluded by taking the receiver from his hand of course she had jilted jean baptiste and had sent back the papers moreover she had declared she would not marry him â under any circumstances but she would attend to that herself and did not need the assistance of her brotherinlaw   

glavis was quite officious that morningâ acting under his wifes orders when the bell rang although he should have been at his work an hour before he opened the door baptiste was there and glavis started to say something he felt his wife would be pleased to know he said but being affected with a slight impediment of speech his tongue became twisted and when he could straighten it out baptiste had passed him and was on his way to the rear of the house where orlean stood pouting ethel stood near with her lips protruding and mrs mc carthy whom he had termed  little mother mary stood nearby at a loss as to what to say

 indeed but it looks more like you were waiting for a funeral than for me as he burst in upon them pausing briefly he observed the one who had declared everything against him turned her face away and refused to greet him

whats the matter hon he said gaily and laughed at the same time gathering her into his arms

 will you look at that  exclaimed ethel ready to start something but glavis countered twice the morning so soon concluded at last that it was his time to keep his place

so deciding he cut his eyes toward ethel and said  now ethel this is no affair of yours and cautioned her still more with his eyes

 no ethel commanded orlean  this is my affair

iâ she did not finish because at that moment jean baptiste had kissed her

it beats anything i ever witnessed  cried ethel almost bursting to get started

 then dont witness it said glavis whereupon he caught her about the waist and urged her up the stairs and locked her in their room

youve been acting something awful like chided baptiste with orlean still in his arms she did not answer just then she could not she decided at that moment however to take him into the parlor and there tell him all she said she would yes she would do that at once so deciding she caught him firmly by the arm and commanded  come and i will get you told

he followed meekly when they reached the parlor she was confronted with another proposition where would they sit  she glanced from the chairs to the davenport but he settled it forthwith by settling upon the davenport she hesitated but before she had reached a decision she found herself pulled down by his side â and dreadfully close

well she decided then that this was better after all because if she was close to him he could hear her better she would not have to talk so loud she did not like loud talking it was too  niggerish and she did not like that

but behold he as soon as she was seated encircled her waist with his arm dreadful then before she could tell him what she had made up all the night before to say to him she felt his lips upon hers â and my they were so warm and tender and soft she was confused ethel and her father had said that the country where jean lived was wild that all the people in it were hard and coarse and rough â but jeans kisses were warm and soft and tender she almost forgot what she had intended telling him and just then he caught her to him and that felt so â well she did not know â could not say how it felt but she was forgetting all she had planned to tell him she heard his voice presently and for a moment she caught sight of his eyes

they were real close to hers and oh such eyes l she had not known he possessed such striking ones how they moved her  she was as if hypnotized she could not seem to break the spell and in the meantime she was forgetting more of what she had made up her mind to say he spoke then and such a wonderful voice he seemed to have

how musical how soft how tender â but withal how strong how firm how resolute and determined it was she was held in a thraldom of strange delight

what has been the matter with my little girl and thereupon as if they were not close enough he gathered her into his arms oh what a thrill it gave her she had forgotten now all she had had in mind to say and it would take an hour or so perhaps a day to think and remember it all over again  hasnt she wanted to see me  such beautiful days are these lovely grand glorious she looked out through the window it was a beautiful day indeed and she had not observed it before

 and hear the birds singing in the trees she heard

and thereupon she listened a moment and heard the birds singing she started now she had felt she was thoughtful she really loved to listen to the twitter of birds â and it was springtime it was life and sunshine and happiness she had not heard the birds before that morning therefore it must have been because she had let anger rule instead of sunshine and as if he had read her thoughts she heard his voice again  and because you were angry â gave in to evil angriness and pouted instead of being cheerful happy and gay you have failed to observe how beautiful the sun shone and that the birds were singing in the trees

she felt â was sensitive of a feeling of genuine guilt

 and away out west where the sunshine kisses the earth and the wheat the corn the flax and the oats grow green in great fields everybody there is about his duty for when the winter has been long cold and dreary the settlers must stay indoors lest they freeze so with such days as these after the long cold and dreary winters everybody must be up and doing for if the crops are to mature in the autumn time they must be placed in the earth through seed in the springtime but there is unfortunately one settler called st jean baptiste by those who know him out there who is not in his fields his crops are not being sown his fields â wide wide fields which represent many thousands of dollars and long years of hard hard work are lying idle growing to wild weeds

 but jean she cried of a sudden  it is not so

 unfortunately it is so my love 

then â jean â you must go â hurry and sow your crops also she echoed

for years and years has jean baptiste labored to get his fields as they are for in the beginning they were wild raw and unproductive whereupon naught but coyotes prairie dogs and wild indians lived where only a wild grass grew weakly and sickly from the surface and yielded only a prairie fire that in the autumn time burned all in its path a land wherein no civilized one had resided since the beginning of time

oh jean

and he has longed for womans love for according to the laws of the christ man should take unto himself a wife else the world and all its people its activity its future will stop forthwith 

 you are so wonderful 

 not wonderful am i quoth baptiste  just a mite practical

 but it is wonderful anyhow all you say    and yet my orlean does not love me yet

 i didnt say that she argued thinking of what she had written him

 since therefore she has not said it then methinks that she does not

i â i â oh you â are awful

 and she will not go to live alone with me and share my life â and my love

i â oh i didnt say i wouldnt do all that she was done for then she had shot her last defense

 then you will he asked anxiously  you will go back with me and be mine all mine and love me forever 

she sought his lips and kissed him then and he arose and caught her close to him and kissed her again and looked into her eyes and she was then all his own

married why â why âwhy what does this mean exclaimed  little mother mary  coming upon them at this minute notwithstanding the fact that she was surprised it was obviously a glad surprise she admired jean baptiste and had been much upset over their little controversy she understood the root of the trouble and knew that it had been on account of what baptiste had written and intimated in the letter regarding the elder her husband did not admire real men although of course he was not aware of it in truth he admired no man other than himself and when others did not do likewise he usually found excuses to disagree with them in some manner

jean baptiste was not the type of man to make friends with her husband he was too frank too forward too progressive in every way ever to become very intimate with n

justine mc carthy to begin with jean had never flattered his vanity as it was not his wont to give undue praise and as yet he had no reason especially to admire the reverend

that it had not been orlean who had objected to coming west to marry him he was aware nor had it been her mother it had been n justine who had a way of making his faults and shortcomings appear to be those of others â especially within his family and in this instance his elder daughter bore the blame

what would you expect us to do little mother he said turning a beaming face upon her

 but â orlean i thought â i thought â

 oh mother cried jean baptiste  dont think it will hurt you besides it will not be necessary for you to think any more with regards to us now we are as we were and that is all there is nothing wrong between us â never has been nor between you and i now either is there   whereupon he drew her down and upon the davenport and placed himself between her and her daughter

 now lets reason this thing out together he began

 there is no need for quarreling well leave that to idle disagreeable people the first thing in life is to know what you want â and then go get it thats the way i do

when i proposed to orlean i did so after due consideration there has been some little disagreement with regards to my coming to get her which was due to the fact that i have been so overrun with work until i really felt i had not the time to spare however here i am and ready to marry her so lets get those who are concerned together and have it over with what do you say to it  he said looking from one to the other in the meantime ethel had crept down from upstairs to see what was going on and saw the three on the davenport together with jean baptiste in the middle whereupon she turned and hurried back upstairs to where her husband was with these words  glavis glavâis she cried all out of breath with exasperation i just wish youd look just step down there and look

 why why â what is the matter ethel he cried rising from his chair in some excitement

 why that jean baptiste is sitting down there on the davenport with mama on one side of him and my sister on the other

 oh is that all he breathed with relief

 is that all  she echoed in derision her narrow little face screwed up

 well 

 will you  well  me when that man just comes in here and takes the house and all thats in it

 oh ethel he argued  will you use some sense   will i use some sense after what orlean said you remember well enough what she said no longer than last night when she received that telegram that she was through with that man that she was not going to marry him and had sent his old papers back to him to prove it 

 well now get all excited over the most natural thing in the world have you never seen a woman who never changed her mind â especially when there was a man in the case 

 of course i have she shouted  i am one who has never changed their mind 

 i agree and that is whats the matter with you so saying lie made his getaway to avoid what would have followed

 now you will have to deal with my husband in regard to this matter mr baptiste admonished mother mary

she had given into him along with orlean it was useless to try to pit their weak wits against the commanding and domineering reason the quick logic and searching intuition of jean baptiste so they had quickly resigned to the inevitable and left him to the rock of unreason the reverend n

j mc carthy

 all settled ill bounce right out and get him on the wire best words to send are please come to chicago today important will that be alright  

 jean baptiste you are a wonder  cried orlean and encircling his neck with her arms kissed him impulsively

in answer they received by special delivery a letter that night stating that his honor n j was on the way and would arrive the following morning preparations were entered into at once therefore for a simple wedding only ethel holding aloft from the proceedings it was while at the supper table that evening that orlean took upon herself to try to set baptiste right with what was before him in dealing with regards to her father  now my dear she said lovingly  if you would get along with papa then praise him â you understand flatter him a little make him think hes a king

 ohho he laughed whereat she was embarrassed

 thats the bug eh

 well she hesitated awkwardly  he is rather vain

baptiste was thoughtful rev mc carthy was vain    he must be praised if one was to get along with him   

make him think he was a king his majesty newton justine sounded very well as a title all he needed now then was a crown if necessary for peace in the family he would praise him although it was not to his liking

jean baptiste had little patience with people who must be praised in his association he had chosen men men who were too busy to look for or care for praise but he failed to reckon then that he was facing another kind of person one whom he was soon to learn

his majesty newton justine arrived on schedule the next morning very serious of expression and apparently tired into the bargain baptiste recalled when he saw him what he had been advised with regards to making him think he was a king well sighed baptiste providing his majesty is not a despot we may be able to get along for a day or two

later when convenient baptiste attempted and was apparently successful in making the matter so plain that despite his reputed dislike for fair reasoning the elder was compelled to call his daughter and say  now orlean you have heard are you in love with this man the melting smile she bestowed him with was quite sufficient so seeing he continued and do you wish to become his wife she looked down into her lap then turned her hands in childish fashion and replied in a very small voice  yes 

then that settles it said the elder and thereafter made himself very amiable by the morrow arrangements had been completed for a simple little home wedding and at two oclock the ceremony was performed

and when the bride and groom had been kissed according to custom a storm without broke of a sudden and the wind blew and the rain fell in torrents so terrible became the storm that the piano which some one played loudly as if to shut out the roar of the storm outside could hardly be heard and in the meantime so dark did it become that at two thirty the lights had to be turned on the people could hardly distinguish each other in the rooms

nor did the storm abate as the afternoon wore on but continued in mad fury far into the night and the guests were compelled to leave in the downpour and wind

and there were among those who departed many who thought and did not speak they were for the most part the new negro hence loathe to admit of superstitions â besides they had great respect for the two who were about to start upon matrimonys uncertain journey but regardless of what they might have said openly it was a long time before they forgot

orlean receives a letter and advice jean called orlean three months later as she came out of the house the house where stewarts had lived and which jean baptiste had rented for the season so as to be near all his land in the older opened county  i have something to tell you

 what is it dear   he replied drawing his horses to a stop while she climbed on the step of the spring wagon he was riding in he could see she was excited and he was apprehensive

she got up on the seat beside him and placing her arms around him began to cry he petted her a moment and then placing his hand under her chin raised her head and said  well now my dear what is the matter whereupon he kissed her drawing his head down then she whispered something in his ear

 oh  he cried his face suddenly aglow with an expression she had never seen in it before the next instant he caught and drew her closely to him and kissed her fondly i am so happy dear the happiest i have been since we married 

but jean she started and then hesitated he appeared to understand

 now my wife you must not feel that way he admonished that is the ultimate of young married life â children of course he added slowly  couples are not always ready they feel but such does not wait we are not always ready to die but old death comes when he gets ready and theres no use trying to argue a delay so now instead of looking distressed just fancy what a great thing a beautiful and heavenly thing after all it is and be real nice he kissed her again and assisted her from the buggy and while he drove to his work she went into the house and picked up a letter

it was from ethel and ran my dear sister i am writing you to say that i am very unhappy you cannot imagine how disagreeable how very inconvenient it is to be as i am never did i want a child â or children but that silly man im married to is so crazy for a family that he has given me no peace

 as a result i must sit around the house during these beautiful summer days and be satisfied to look out of the window and go nowhere oh it is distressing and i am so mad at times i can seem not to see can you sense it him so anxious for a family when what he earns is hardly sufficient to keep us in comfort and maintain the payments on the home i have tried to reason with him on the score but it is no use at all so while i sit around so angry i cannot see straight he dances around gleefully wondering whether it will be a girl or a boy

 now i thought i would write you in time so that you could protect yourself i am therefore sending you certain receipts which have been given me â but too late

they will not be again though â trust me to attend to that

dont wait too long and use them as per direction do it and run no chance of getting to be as i am

 i hope you are well and write me any time anything happens and if these dont work then tell me right quick and i will send you something that is sure i depend on you taking care of yourself now and dont let anybody put foolishness in your head

 hoping to hear from you soon and that you are safe as yet believe me to be as ever your sister  ethel

when she had completed the letter she was thoughtful as her eyes wandered out to where her husband worked away in the field beyond she tried to see a few months ahead

it was then midsummer and ethel and her father and all the girls were writing her already that they supposed they might as well not expect her until xmas but jean had intimated already that he did not expect to go to chicago xmas still that was several months away and the dry weather of which he was complaining at the present might be offset by rain soon so she might get to see old chicago xmas after all but she would be unable to go out if she did go to the city xmas with what she knew now she pondered and while she did so she read through certain receipts her sister had sent her one was very simple and she was tempted it stated that the blossom of a certain weed was positive when made into a tea

she was thoughtful a moment and her eyes wandered again toward where her husband worked in the field

finally they fell upon the creek that ran near the house and she gave a start as she saw growing upon its banks a peculiar weed with purple blossom she wondered what kind of weeds they were she made a mental note of the same and decided that when her husband came to luncheon she would ask him she sighed then as she thought of the months to come and what was to come with it presently having nothing else urgent to do she picked up paper pen and ink and replied to ethels letter  my dear sister  receipt of your recent letter is here acknowledged and in reply will say that i have read the same carefully and made a note of what you said

 i hardly know how to reply to what you set forth in your letter and i am not fully decided but i might as well admit that i have just discovered that i also am to become a mother and jean like glavis is tickled to death

i just told him this morning and he said it was the happiest moment he had experienced since we have been married

 i am entirely at a loss what to do but i will consult him regarding it i dont think i ought to do as you adviseâ not let him know anythingâbecause that would hardly be fair he is just as good to me as he can be and considers my every need sometimes i do not think he loves me as much as i would wish but what can i do he is my husband and gives me all his attention i am therefore afraid that he will object to the measures you suggest i am very much afraid he will but i will ask him

 hes a perfect dear so jolly so popular everywhere about and i repeat so good to me that i hardly think my conscience would be clear if i did something in secret and something that he would not like

 in the meantime thanking you for your suggestions and begging you not to act foolish i am  your affectionate sister  orlean

jean baptiste drove into the yard at noon singing cheerfully he was met by his wife at the gate which she opened the wind was blowing from the south and the air was very hot it had been blowing from that direction for days he stopped singing while he unhitched the horses and gazed anxiously toward the northwest

 what is it dear  she inquired observing the old frown upon his face he shook his head before replying and tried to smile

 this wind

 the wind

 yes its terribly hot its awfully drying the oats are suffering the wheat is hurt i wish it would rain and rain soon whereat he shook his head again and his frown grew deeper

he led the horses to the well to drink and while they were drinking she stood near holding her hands and looking at the patch of strange weeds that were in blossom near presently she observed him and seeing that his mind was concerned with problems she would satisfy her mind

 jean   she called

 yes he replied abstractedly

what kind of weeds are those and she pointed to the wild blossoms

 those  he said his mind struggling between what he was thinking about and the question  oh those are evil weeds he concluded and turning led his horses into the barn

 evil weeds she echoed slowly she turned and looked again she was strangely frightened then taking courage she went playfully to where they grew and gathering a bunch in a sort of bouquet carried them into the house laid them down and began to place the meal upon the table

 why orlean she heard and turned to meet her husband  what are you doing with these old things in here my dear you could find something better for the table than these things just outside the fence in the road roses are blooming everywhere and the air is charged with their sweet fragrance he paused briefly and held them to his nose  and besides they stink booh  he cried holding them away  they make me sick now if youll agree ill throw these things away and run out into the road and get you a big bunch of roses will that be all right dear 

 yes she answered and he did not understand why her eyes were downcast

 good he exclaimed and she was glad to see that the frown upon his face was gone if only for a while  ill bring you some nice flowers you know he paused in the doorway and turned to her  i never liked this weed anyhow i have always connected them with all thats vile and evil so saying he turned and a few minutes later she heard his voice coming cheerfully from the road where he picked the various shades of roses

 now my dear said he pleasantly  i have brought you a real bouquet and he placed the vase containing the same in the center of the table stood hack and regarded the flowers admiringly

 why he suddenly exclaimed his eyes widening what is the matter

 oh nothing she stammered more than spoke

 now there must be something   while standing where he was he caught sight of ethels letter immediately she reached forth to snatch it from beneath his gaze he made no effort to take it but regarded her in the meantime wonderingly the receipt concerning the weed lay in plain sight and he could hardly help reading it she caught it up then while he still looked after her wonderingly he raised his hand to his head and was thoughtful before saying  why were you so disturbed over me seeing the letter orlean you have never been so before of course he said and hesitated and then went on patiently  i have no wish to pry into womens affairs or secrets but i am curious to know why you acted as you did  

she was an emotional girl never in her life had she violated the rules of her parents and she had never thought of disobeying or keeping secrets from her husband when she was confronted with the situation she broke down thereupon and crying on his breast told him all the letter contained and what the receipt meant

he listened patiently and when she was through he hesitated before speaking after a moment he led her to the table sat down and fell to eating the luncheon

 when we have dined he paused after a few minutes to remark  and you have washed the dishes we will spare a few minutes for a talk orlean

 now he resumed at the appointed time  when we married orlean it was my hope â and i feel sure twas yours that we would live happily

 of course jean she agreed tremulously

 then dear there are certain things we should come to an understanding thereto lest we find our lives at variance

to begin with i wish your sister would not write you such letters as the one you received today but if she must and offer â yes criminal advice i trust you will not incline toward such seriously you and i as well as those who have gone before us and as those who must perforce come after us did not come into this world altogether by ours or others providence and if the world and the people in the world are growing wicked as yet thank god race suicide has not come to rule he was meditatively silent then for a time gazing as if into space off across the sunkist fields

 first he resumed  selfishness is a bad patient to nurse secondly we must appreciate that ours â our lives have a duty to fulfill bringing children into the world and rearing them to clean and healthy man and womanhood is that duty â our greatest duty and now with regards to that receipt or receipts

 i will not seek to deny that such practices are not in some measure a custom such very often are given thoughtlessly as to the infinite harm ill health and unhappiness they might later bring but the fact that others cultivate and heed such is no reason dear do you feel that we should  

 no jean she admitted without hesitation and very humbly

 i feel more inspired to say this at this point in our new union orlean because i cannot believe that it is your nature to be wicked to wilfully practice and condone the wrong

oh jean she cried moving toward him laying her hands upon him and seeking his eyes with her soul standing out in hers  you are so noble and so good

and in the next minute she was weeping silently upon his shoulder

the dry weather continued over all the west and for two weeks the wind remained in the south and blew almost day and night heretofore it had been known to blow not more than a week at the most before the heat would be broken by a rain and coincident with the heat and drought the crops began to fire plants of all kinds to wither and every one in the country of our story became ominous

but the creator seemed to be with the struggling people of the new country the drought was broken by rain before the crops were destroyed the harvest was very good and with the completion of the same orlean met her husband one evening with a letter announcing that her father was coming to visit soon and the next day they got another letter â no a paper it was a summons and concerned orlean

eugene crook tripp county laying just to the west of the town of dallas and where jean baptiste had purchased the relinquishments for his people was a large county and rich in soil there had been little delay on the part of the railroad company in extending their line into it but before this occurred â before even the county had been thrown open to the settlers new promoters conscious of the great success which had been achieved by the men who had promoted dallas purchased an allotment from an indian or a breed and started a town thereon almost directly in the center of the county in a valley of a creek known as the dog ear

and it was about this time that a political ring was formed in the newer county for the avowed and subtle purpose of securing the county seat settlement on the whole had not as yet been possible so the politics included the rabble the cowboy and the excowboy saloon men bartenders â some freighters squaw men and cattle thieves represented the voters so it happened that before the bonafide settlers had a chance in the way of political expression they found the county organized controlled and exploited by this ilk but as we have already stated a town in the west â nor the east for that matter â is ever a town until a railway has found its way thither

the difficulty began when the survey was run notwithstanding the fact that the county seat had been secured by the promoters of the town in the valley of the dog ear the surveyors from the route they took did not seem to have had any orders to go via of lamro the county seat in question on the contrary they went smack through a section of land that had been secured in due time by the promoters who had made dallas possible as a town

where the line of the survey stretched less than two miles northwest of the county seat they started a town and were now bidding the townspeople and business men of the county seat to move their building over a bitter fight was the answer â at the start a railroad is everything almost to an aspiring town and these people were capable of appreciating the fact as a result the little town in the valley a few months later was no more another election was held and through the same the bona fide settlers asserted their rights and administered a severe rebuke by defeating the town in the valley and electing the new town which had been entitled winner as the county seat

nevertheless a few people remained in what was left of the valley town some were unable to move their buildings others were indifferent while others still remained there for purposes of their own

among those who remained there was a banker whose little bank reposed all alone with caves and broken sidewalks and all the leavings of the moved away town about

his name was crook eugene crook and it was common knowledge that he was fond of his name and conducted his affairs so as to justify it gene crook would rather it was said acquire something by beating some one in a deal than to secure it honestly he possessed an auto and had business to the northwest of the town some fifteen or eighteen miles and had been seen in the neighborhood quite often

perhaps it was due in some measure to an unscrupulous character who had drawn a claim in those parts and pretended to be homesteading there but who in truth homesteaded more around the saloons of winner and crooks town than he did on the claim his name was james j

spaight

james j spaight and eugene crook were very close

gene crook had advanced spaight considerable money towards his claim and had him tied up in many ways therefore they were understood cohorts

 they are never here said spaight jumping from the auto and sweeping his hand about over a beautiful quarter section of land one of the finest in the county

 but i see a sod shack over in the draw returned crook

 they have apparently called themselves establishing a residence on the land

yes but let me tell you said spaight  i can get you this piece of land â i can win it for you through contest

i know a thing or two and i believe when we let the fellow know that weve got him dead to right hell weaken and sell it to you for a song

 well said crook thoughtfully  well drive back to town and consult duval about it

on the way they drove by the homesteaders near and held subtle conversations with many always in the end ascertaining how many times the people had been seen on the claim they had just left

when they returned to the town in the valley and retired into the private office of the little bank spaight went for duval a lawyer who came forthwith he was a tall lean creature who attracted attention by his unusual height and leanness he also was one of the  left overs he was told of the beautiful homestead and that the claimant had been seen only a few times there and of the proposition to contest it

 who holds the place did you say  inquired duval in his deep droll voice crossing his legs judiciously

 why a nigger woman said spaight

 a negro woman 

 yes what do you think of that  pursued spaight his eyes widening  i told crook that if he worked a bluff good and right he could more than likely scare them out

a nigger in a white mans country

crook smiled duval was thoughtful

whats her name â this negress is she a single woman or married  why she was single when she took it of course but shes got married since i think the guy she married put up the money and thats where we have them again  and the name  inquired duval again

 oh yes baptiste thats it jean baptiste is her husbands name  oh hell  cried duval and spat upon the floor

whyâwhats the matter cried crook and spaight in chorus

 i was struck with the joke

the joke

 yes the bluffing

but we dont understand

then you ought to jean baptiste huh youll bluff jean baptiste say thats funny suddenly his face took on a cold hard expression  why thats one of the shrewdest one of the wisest one of the most forcible men in this country have you never heard of jean baptiste

oh you fools i hes worth forty thousand dollars â made it himself and is not over twentyfive

 is that so they echoed taken aback

 well i should say so and everybody in the county knows it

 but they havent lived on the place as they should

protested spaight weakly

 something like yourself laughed duval spaight colored guiltily

 but i can prove it insisted spaight

 well in so far as that goes i wouldnt doubt but they have not lived on the land baptiste owns a lot of land in the county east and the chances are that hes been so busy that his wife has neglected to stay on the claim as she should have yes that is quite likely

 then we can contest it   cried spaight

 of course you can contest any place so far as that goes

 well thats what we intend to do and i have the goods on him and am sure we can win

 theyre all sure of that when they start said duval sarcastically  but i want to disillusion you if you contest the place then do so with a realization of what we are up against dont go down there with any  rough stuff  or with a delusion that you are going to meet a weakling

go down there with the calm considerate understanding that you are going to vie with a man all through and that man is jean baptiste and while ill take the case and do what i can before we start id advise that you keep away from that fellow as much as possible

 well now to be frank duval said crook  what do you think of it anyhow  

duval regarded him closely a moment out of his small eyes and then spoke slowly easily carefully  well crook being frank with you i dont think you can beat that fellow fairly no one will beat jean baptiste in a fair fight but of course he added  there are other ways

yes and when the time is right â if ever you may try the other way

reverend mc carthy pays a visit well said baptiste to his wife following the service of the summons were up against   a long irksome and expensive contest case

under his observation had come many of such only those who have homesteaded or have been closely related to such can in full appreciate the annoyance the years of annoyance and uncertainty with which a contest case is fraught

great fiction has been created from such greater could be

oh the nerve racking the bitterness and very often the sinister results that have grown out of one person trying to secure the place of another without the others consent

murder has been committed times untold as a sequel â but getting back to jean baptiste and his wife

he was inclined to be more provoked than ordinarily for the reason that by sending his wife â at least taking her to the homestead he knew he could have avoided the contest as a rule places are not contested altogether without a cause he felt that it was â and it no doubt was â due to his effort to farm his own land and assist his folks in holding their claims as well he had discovered before he married orlean that she was likely to prove much unlike his sister who possessed the strength of her convictions for she was on the clinging vine order being extremely childish this was further augmented by a stream of letters from chicago giving volumes of advice in regards to something the advisors had not a very keen idea of themselves he also was cautioned not to expose her so she had in truth only gone to her homestead when taken by him returning when he did as well the fact that he had arranged in regards to the renting of his land the next season would be no evidence to assist him before the bar that would hear his case

the contest against his wifes homestead did not of course alter his plans in any way he would continue along the lines he had started but there were other things that came to annoy him at the same time chiefly among these was his wifes father always there had to be some ado when it came to him he had reared his daughter as before intimated to consider him of the worlds greatest men â especially the negro races and to avoid friction baptiste came gradually to see that he would almost have to be beholden unto this creature in whom he was positively not very deeply interested

n justine mc carthys accomplishments were of a nature which baptiste would rather have avoided the fact that he had been a presiding elder in one of the leading denominations of negro churches out of which he managed to filch about a thousand a year was in a measure foreign to his soninlaw and the reverend was not an informed or practical man

the truth was that all the pretensions made to the elder flattering him into feeling he was a great man jean baptiste came to regard as a deliberate fawning to flatter an extreme vanity far from being even practical n j mc carthy was by disposition environment and cultivation narrow impractical hypocritical envious and spiteful as to how much he was so not even did jean baptiste fully realize at the time but came to learn later from experience

he was expected in early october the hearing of the contest was to convene a few days later so as a greeting to his majesty he was to be given an opportunity to see orlean on the stand and mercilessly grilled by nonsentimental lawyers baptiste was appreciative of what might result and wished the visit could have been deferred for a while

another source of irritation continually was ethels letters and his wifes nervousness over the child that was to come for the first time in her life she had been disobedient secretly she had after many misgivings fears and indecisions brewed a tea from the weed as per ethels prescription â but in vain later the guilt the nevertobeforgotten guilt the unborn child that refused the poison seemed to haunt her and she could not tell her husband

but this was not all ethels letters continued to come filled with the same advice the same suggestions the same condemnation of motherhood â and she was compelled to keep it all a hopeless secret from the man she had sworn to love and obey

one thing was agreed upon they decided not to inform the elder â at least in so far as orlean was concerned she left it to jean and jean with as many troubles as he cared for and more to deal with was becoming perceptibly irritant so with this state of affairs prevailing the reverend finally arrived for his long anticipated visit

the letter advising the day he would arrive did not happen to reach them in time to meet him accordingly neither was at the station to greet him but recalling that baptiste had spoken of the freedom and no narrow prejudices and customs to irk one the elder went forthwith to the leading hotel in gregory where he was accorded considerable attention as a guest this indeed satisfied his vanity and he was taken much notice of by those about because of his distinguished appearance a fact that he seldom ever lost sight of

but baptiste happened to be in town that night on horseback and when the train had come and gone he inquired carelessly of a fellow he met and who had come in on the train if he had seen a colored man aboard

yes said the other an elderly man very distinguished looking

 my fatherinlaw  ejaculated baptiste and went forthwith to the hotel to find his erstwhile compatriot very much at ease among those filling the place

and its a great way to greet me exclaimed the reverend cheerfully upon seeing him baptiste made haste to explain that he had not been aware of the day when he would arrive

oh thats all right my son said the other heartily

and how is orlean 

fine shell be tickled to death to see you

and i her the old gent was very cheerful such a trip was much to him a life spent among the simple black people to whom he preached afforded little contrast compared with what was about him now and pompous by disposition he was thrilled by the diversity baptiste decided thereupon to try to make his sojourn an agreeable one

now there is an old neighbor of mine in town with a buggy and ill see him and figure to have him take you out with him as i am in on horseback

very well returned the elder and baptiste went for the neighbor who happened to be a german with a very conspicuous voice he found him at a saloon where the old scout was pretty well  pickled  from imbibing too freely in red liquor  sure thing he roared in his big voice when baptiste stated his errand  bring him down here and ill buy him a drink

 but hes a preacher cautioned baptiste with a laugh

 a preacher well ill be damned exclaimed the german humorously whereupon he ordered drinks for the house and two for himself baptiste grinned

 i shall now depart essayed the german swaying not too steadily before the bar and raising his glass to become sanctimonious and good and drained his glass the crowd roared

 where is he  called the german loudly as he drew his team to a stop before the hotel baptiste got out went in and called to the reverend the other came forward quickly carrying his bags and other accessories

 ahha  roared the german from the buggy sociably  so there you are

why â jean â the man is â drunk is he not whispered the elder

 but hes alright â gets that way when he comes to town but is perfectly safe withal the reverend stood for a moment regarding the other dubiously

 come on brother and meet me called the german again in a voice sufficiently loud almost to awaken the dead

 but jean said the reverend lowly but apprehensively  i dont know whether i want to ride with a drunken man or not

now it happened that the germans ears were very keen and he overheard the elders remark so without ceremony and while the reverend hesitated on the pavement the german who did not like to be referred to as drunk roared ahha naw naw naw you dont have to ride with me naw naw naw and turning his horses about he went back to the saloon where his voice rang forth a minute later in a raucous tune as he unloaded another schooner

the reverend beat a hasty retreat back into the hotel while baptiste called after him  ill send orlean for you in the morning and went to look up his neighbor who had made himself so conspicuous

 well now if this doesnt beat all cried the reverend when he had kissed his daughter the following morning and they were spinning along the road on the way to the farm

 i would never have believed three months ago had some one said you could and would be driving these mules 

oh i have driven them fifty miles in a day â john

she called suddenly to the off mule who was given to mischievous tricks

 well well commented the reverend  but it certainly beats all

she was cheered and pleased to demonstrate what she had learned they sailed along the country side in the autumn air and talked of home ethel her mother glavis and jean they came presently to baptistes homestead and viewed with great delight the admirable tract of land that stretched before them she talked on cheerfully and told her father all that had passed of how happy they were but said nothing about her prospects of becoming a mother when they had passed her husbands homestead and were nearing a comer where they must turn to reach the house in which they were living they passed an automobile carrying two men they bowed lightly and the men returned it when they had gotten out of hearing distance one of the men whispered to the other thats her

gene crook thereupon turned and looked after the retreating figure of the girl in the buggy whose place he had determined to secure through subtle methods but not even gene crook himself conceived of the unusual circumstances that came to pass and brought him on a visit to these selfsame people later

reverend mc carthy decides to set baptiste right but â now the first thing daughter said the reverend when jean comes and you have the time  is to go up and see your claim orlean swallowed and started to tell him that it was contested but on second thought decided to leave the task to her husband and said instead  i have a fine claim papa jean says it is the best piece of land we have

 now isnt that fine

 it is orlean said thinking of her husband

 your husband has a plenty my dear and we have been surprised that you have not been sending money to chicago to have us buy something for you

orlean swallowed again and started to speak to say that while her husband was a heavy land holder the crops had not been the best the year before and were not as good this year as he had hoped for then she thought jean could explain this better also instead she said i â i havent wanted for anything papa

 no perhaps not but you know papa always thinks of his baby always buys her litle things and so on you know

he paused regarded her and the dress she wore he recognized it as one that she had bought just before she had gotten married â forgetting that jean baptiste had paid for it â and said  and you have on the same dress you wore away from chicago indeed and that is a spring dress why do you not wear some of your summer dresses some you have bought since you have been married 

i havent bought â my husband hasnt â i havent needed any more clothes really she argued falteringly

he saw that she was keeping something back and pursued  why dear what do you mean you dont mean to say that jean hasnt bought you any dresses since he married you and him owning so much land 

 but i havent needed any papa â i have not asked him for any he looked at her keenly he saw that she was shielding the man she married but with this he had no patience

 now now my dear jean ought not to treat my girl like that he ought to buy you lots of things and pretty things im rather inclined to think he is miserly â have rather felt he was all the time he paused briefly posed in the way he did when preaching and then went on  yes you are sacrificing a great deal by coming away out here in a new country and living with him yes yes my dear

you see you are deprived of many conveniences conveniences that you have been accustomed to he looked around the little house at its floor with only rugs and its simple furniture  just compare this to the home you came out of the good home yes yes im afraid that â that the rough life your husband has been living rather makes him forget the conventions my daughter has been accustomed to yes i think so im afraid ill have to kind of â a â bring such to his attention that he might see his duty yes my dearâ

 but papa i â i â think you had â better not you seeâ and she caught his arm and was thoughtful looking downward in the meantime she loved jean baptiste but she was not a strong willed person by nature training or disposition she had inherited her mothers timidness at heart she meant well to the man she married but she had always been obedient to her father had never sauced him and had never crossed him which was his boast

perhaps it was because of these things and that he knew it that his nature asserted itself

 im afraid you like any newly married wife are inclined to forget these things rather accept your husbands excuse now your husband has a plenty and can well afford to give to you and besides you â he should not forget the sacrifices you are making for him that is what he should see yes yes now take ethel he suddenly turned to her  why glavis only makes thirteen dollars a week and â why ethel makes him do just what she wants him to buys her a dress any time she wants it a hat a pair of shoes â and whatever she wishes thats ethel he ended forgetting to add that glavis also bought and paid for the food mrs mc carthy ate or that he himself only brought â and never bought things to eat only when he came into chicago three or five times a year â and sent a few things infrequently but orlean had taken a little courage it was rather unusual and she was surprised at herself she was surprised that she dared even argue â just a little â with her father he had always been accepted as infallible without question to get along with him â have peace her mother and she had always followed the rule of letting everything be his way and be content with their own private opinion without expression as to conclusions moreover whether he was right or wrong abused or accused the rule was to praise and flatter him notwithstanding and at such times they could depend on him to do much for them but she found her voice

jean baptiste was her husband and she was not ungrateful he gave her real love and husbandry and it was perhaps her womans nature to speak in defense of her mate

so she said  but jean is not like glavis papa they are two different men entirely

 well yes my dear he said slowly his dark face taking on a peculiar â and not very pleasant expression  im afraid i will have to agree with you yes they are different glavis is a fine boy though dont own a thousand acres of land but certainly takes care of home like a man

no no i never have to worry about anything just come home every few months to see that everything is all right â and find it so yes that is glavis while jean and his mind went quickly back to an incident that had happened twentyone years before  is rather set in his ways

yes very much so i fear that is one of his failings

some people would call it hard headed but i should not quite call it that no then again he paused a moment looked at the floor and looked up  hes crazy to get rich

you see dear â of course you dont know that not old enough thats where your father has the advantage over you â and jean also hes older its bad when a man is ambitious to get rich for he is liable to work himself and his wife to death jeans liable to do that with you

not like your old father you know

 here he comes now she cried excitedly going quickly to the kitchen and making a fire and starting the meal

her father looked after her he looked out the window to where his soninlaw was unhitching his horses he looked back to where his daughter was working nervously over the stove and muttered to himself  has her trained to run like something frightened at his approach thats the same spirit i tried to conquer twentyone years ago and it is still in him mm ill have to look after that disposition

and with that he went outside to where his daughters husband worked

 hello reverend called jean cheerfully the  reverend  darkened and glowered unseen he did not like that term of address glavis called him  father that was better but he returned apparently as cheerful  hello my boy so you are home to dinner 

 yes guess its ready she is very prompt about having my meals on time yes orlean is a good girl and appreciates that i believe in always being on time he rattled off

and how are the crops

 not so good not so good i regret to say said jean moodily  no to be truthful it is the poorest crop i have ever raised yes he mused as if to himself  and i need a good crop this year worse than i have ever needed one yes i sure do

 indeed so got lots of expense borrowed ten thousand dollars to buy that land out there in tripp county and have none of it producing anything and on top of that a guy comes along and slaps a contest on orleans place and so i have that on my hands in addition to all the other burdens so believe me it keeps me hopping

 a contest on orleans place  what does that mean  

 does that mean but of course you couldnt understand whereat baptiste tried to explain to him what it meant

 so you see you find us with our troubles the reverend made no reply to this indeed he had never been able to reply to jean baptiste in the first place the man was ever too hurried moreover he understood so little regarding practical business matters until their relations had never been congenial when jean had watered and fed his teams he came back to where the elder stood and said  well judge well go in to dinner now the reverend was almost upset such flat expressions i such a little regard for his caste horrid he started to speak to him regarding his lack of manners but that one had his face in the tub where the horses had drank washing himself eagerly when he was through he drew water from the well and pouring it into a wash basin rinsed himself and called for the towel no sooner had he done so than out of the house came orlean with the goods

 wash up cried baptiste pointing to the horse tub

jean called his wife remonstratingly you forget yourself asking papa to wash where the horses have drank you must be more thoughtful 

baptiste laughed  beg pardon colonel you see this open life has made me â er â rather informal but youll get used to and like it with time wash up and lets eat 

hes wild just wild muttered the reverend as he followed them into the house

the wolf now elder said baptiste getting up from the table without going through the usual formalities of resting a few minutes after the meal  ive bought a building in town that im going to move onto orleans place im preparing to jack it up and load it so if you would like to come along very well well be glad to have you but its rather a rough hard task ill admit

 now now son started the reverend holding back his exasperation with difficulty his soninlaw had never addressed him more than once by the same name it was either colonel judge reverend elder or some other burlesque title in the sense used he wanted to tell him that he should call him father but before he had a chance to do so that worthy had bounced out of the room and was heard from the barn the reverend looked after him with a glare

 dreadful he exclaimed when the other was out of hearing distance

 what papa  inquired his daughter regarding him questioningly she had become accustomed to jeans ways and did not understand her fathers exclamation

 why the man your husband

jean

 oh she exclaimed  thats his way he has always lived alone you know and is so ambitious is really compelled to hurry a little because he has so much to do

 well i never saw the like im afraid he and ethel would never get along very well no he â is rather unusua

 oh father you must pay no attention to that jean is a fine fellow a likeable man and is loved by every one who knows him she argued trying to discourage her fathers mood to complain she had never been able to bring her father and husband very close perhaps it was because of their being so far apart in all that made them but she was aware that jean had never flattered her father and that was very grave no relation had ever risked that her father was accustomed to being flattered by everybody who was an intimate of the family and jean baptiste had come into the family married her and apparently forgot to tell the reverend that he was a great man moreover from what she knew of her husband he was not likely to do so her mother had tried to have baptiste see it she recalled her little mother of whom baptiste was very fond of as has been stated it was generally known that her father was not very kind and patient with her mother and never had been

it was moreover no secret that her father was unusually friendly with mrs pruitt but she was not supposed to let on that she was aware of such if she was â and she certainly was â she did not mention the fact jean baptiste knew of the reverends subtle practices and in his mind condemned rather than admired him therefor he knew that the elder expected to be praised in spite of all these things now what would it all come to

this thought was passing through orleans mind when she heard her father again  now he said something about a contest she caught her breath quickly swallowed changed color and then managed hardly above a whisper to say  oh

 i dont understand and he never takes the time to explain anything seems to take for granted that everybody should know and tries to know it all himself and it makes it very awkward he said complainingly

 its all my fault papa orlean admitted falteringly

your fault  the other exclaimed not understanding

 yes she breathed with eyes downcast

 and what do you mean  how can it be your fault when you have sacrificed the nice home in chicago for this wilderness 

 but papa she faltered  you have never been west before you â you dont understand

 dont understand  cried the reverend anger and impatience evident  what is there to understand about this wilderness 

 oh papa she cried now beseechingly  you â

she halted and swallowed what she had started to say

and what she had started to say was that if he kept on like he had started he would make it very difficult for her to be loyal to her husband and obedient to him as she had always been as she was trying to be perhaps it was becoming  difficult for her already subservience to her father who insisted upon it and obedience and loyalty to her husband who had a right and naturally expected it

it was difficult and she was a weak willed person already her courage was failing her and she was beginning to sigh

 it is very hard on my daughter i fear said the elder his face now full of emotion and self pity  i worked all my life to raise my two darlings and it grieves me to see one of them being ground down by a man

 oh father my husband is not cruel to me he has never said an unkind word he is just as good to me as a man can be â and i love him this would have been sufficient to have satisfied and pacified any man even one so unscrupulous but it happens that in our story we have met one who is considerably different from the ordinary man the substance of n justine mc carthys vanity had never been fully estimated â not even by himself orlean did not recall then that since she had been married she had not written her father and repeated what a great man he was she had on the other hand written and told him what a great man her husband was in her simplicity she felt it was expected of her to tell that one or the other was great but here she had encountered discouragement

her husband apparently was considerably opposed to flattery and she had difficulty to have him see that it was an evidence of faith on her part but her husband had not seen it that way he had disimissed it as a waste of time and had gradually used his influence with her to other ends to the road they were following the road to ultimate success which could only be achieved by grim practical methods and that was one of his words practical but her father was speaking again

 now i wish you would explain how you could be at fault for this contest upon your place and why your husband accuses you of such  

 but jean does not accuse me of being at fault father

she defended weakly  i accuse myself and if you will be just a little patient she begged almost in tears  ill explain he frowned in his usual way while she sighed unheard and then fell to the task before her

 it is like this she began with an effort at self control

jean has not wished to ask me to stay on my claim alone as his sister and grandmother have done you see

 oh so he has them living out there alone like cattle helping him to get rich

 they do not live like cattle father she defended in the patient manner she had been trained to  they have a horse and buggy that he has furnished them and get all their needs at the stores which is charged to him they have good neighbors awfully nice white people â women too who live alone on their claims as his sister and grandmother are doing

 but they are not like you daughter those are all rough people you cannot live like them you have been accustomed to something

she sighed unheard again and did not try to explain to his majesty that most of the people â women included â were in a majority from the best homes in the east as well as families that many had wealth where she had none and that jeans sister had been graduated from high school and was very intelligent it was difficult and she knew it to explain anything to her father but she would endeavor to tell him of the contest

 well father since i was not on my place as i should have been a man contested it and now we must fight it out jean says so that is it

 mmm sighed that one  hes going to kill you out here to make him rich and then when you are dead andâ

 please dont father she almost screamed she knew he was going to say and in your grave he will marry another woman and bring her in to enjoy what you have died for but she could not quite listen to that it was not fair it was not fair to her and it was not fair to jean she was surprised at the way she felt she forgot also and for his benefit that they had never been very happy at home when he was in chicago they had only pretended to be it had been because of him being away all the time and their relation having been confined to letters that they had been contented but orlean had made herself believe for this occasion that when he came to visit they were going to have a really pleasant time

and now so soon she was simply worn out she had become more sensitive of her tasks in life than it had occurred to her she could ever be for the first time she was getting the idea that after all they were burdensome

wouldnt you like to go to town papa she cried trying to be jolly  jean is ready now and please come along and see the nice little house he has bought and is going to move on my claim she was so cheerful so anxious to have him enjoy his visit that his vanity for once took a back seat and a few minutes later they were driving into gregory

as they drove along baptiste told of what he was doing discussing at length the west and what was being done toward its development when they arrived in the town they approached the small but well made little building that he had purchased for  and went inside

 awfully small my boy said the reverend as they looked around

 of course admitted baptiste  but it is not practical to invest in big houses in the beginning you know we must first build a good big barn and that i cannot even as yet afford

 places his horses before his wife of course muttered the reverend but obligingly unheard

and you say you intend to move it where not away down on that farm southeast   he said standing outside and looking up at the building

oh no baptiste returned shortly onto orleans place west of here

 oh how far is that 

 not so far about fifty miles  good lord and the reverend could say no more

the contest moving a building fifty miles across even a prairie is not an easy task and before jean baptiste reached his wifes homestead with the building he had purchased he had suffered much grief and with the reverend along ever ready to keep their minds alive to the fact it was made no easier but because he was so chronic he was left to grumble while his soninlaw labored almost to distraction into getting the building to the place before he would be compelled to turn back and face the contest which was scheduled for an early hearing

they succeeded in getting it within twenty miles of the claim when they were compelled to abandon the task for the time and return to gregory to fight the contest

this developed at times into a rather heated argument and a prolonged one that tried the patience of all dragging over a period of three days it became obvious during the proceedings that the contestant and his cohorts desired as much as possible to keep away from baptiste and on the other hand to concentrate their crossfire upon his wife but expecting this they found him on his guard countering them at every angle and assisted by an able land attorney he was successful in upsetting in a large way their many subtle and well laid plans causing them to fail in making the showing they had expected to

to begin with their corroborating witness james j

spaight developed before the chase to more definitely corroborate for the defense he had come to the trial with false testimony prepared and had under a fusillade of crossexaminations broken down and impaired and weakened the prosectuion in all such cases the one contesting is placed at a moral disadvantage and the fact that crook was a banker fully able to have purchased relinquishment as others over all the county had done was ever in the witness mind and did not help his case baptistes wife proved much stronger after the first day this was due largely to the fact that her father had been present on the first day and had kept her so much alive to what she was sacrificing in struggling to assist her husband in his ambition to be rich until she was perceptibly weak the time limit on his ticket having about expired he had been compelled to return to chicago the morning of the second day of the trial

it was the consensus of opinion that she would retain her claim though with so many cases to consider it was obvious that it would take many months and possibly a year to get a hearing â that is before the officers of the local land offices could settle the case

this done jean baptiste returned and completed moving the house on the claim fixed it up dug a well fenced in a small pasture and returned to gather his corn which amounted to about half a crop

so time passed and the holidays approached and another phase in their relations took shape when the reverend insisted that they come to chicago to spend the holidays it was very annoying orlean was expecting to become a mother in the early spring and because they had never informed him of the fact it brought considerable embarrassment to all

it was difficult to explain to his majesty that they would not come into the city for the holidays the elder had insisted that he would send them tickets and because jean baptiste had scoffed at the idea trouble was brewing as a result it was then he lost his patience

 can your father not understand orlean he complained with a deep frown  that i cannot accept his charity  because i have made up my mind not to go to chicago does not mean that i am not able to purchase our transportations there and back its the expense of the trip and what goes with it that has caused me to decide to dispense with it but its almost useless to try to reason anything with him and ill not waste the effort whereupon he would say no more

he was having troubles of his own he owed ten thousand dollars and upon this interest accrued every few months and the rate was high besides he had other pressing bills and the grain he had raised was bringing very low prices therefore he was in no mood to dally with a poverty poor preacher whose offer was more to show himself off and place baptiste in a compromising position than his desire for them to be home he made no effort to appreciate the sentiments or to understand jean baptiste

and the fact that his daughter loved her husband and was willing to help him seemed to be lost sight of by n justine mc carthy being accustomed to having people flatter him as a rule was so engraved in his shallow nature that he was unable to see matters from a liberal point of view

their relations reached a climax when orlean was with his sister on the claim a few days before the yuletide

baptiste received a letter addressed to her from the elder

thinking that since she was on the claim it might be something urgent he opened it it was urgent it contained a money order covering the price of a ticket to chicago with a trite note that he expected her soon and that he her husband could come on later

we shall not attempt to describe the anger that came over jean baptiste then and as is most likely the case when a man is angry he does the thing he most likely would not do when his feelings are under control with hands that trembled with anger he turned the note over wrote in a few words that he had defined his position with regards to coming to chicago that he would be obliged if the other would mind his own business that he had married his wife and was trying to be a husband in every way to her  but that he was running his house and was therefore returning the money therewith

it served as a declaration of the war between the two that had been impending for months we are too well acquainted with their regard for each other so upon this we will not dwell but upon receipt of baptistes letter the reverend sang his anger in a letter that fairly scorched the envelope in which it was enclosed he threatened to turn the world over and set it right again if the other did not do thus and so to the threats baptiste made no reply in a measure he was relieved he had at last made his position clear to the other and his wife of course was with him in the controversy in view therefore of the manner in which she had been trained this made matters rather awkward the yield of crops had not been one half the average and it took almost all he had made to pay the interest taxes and expenses baptiste was not cheerful but orlean was to become a mother and he was a practical man so together they passed a happy xmas after all

in fact the only cloud upon their horizon of happiness was her father

evidently he voiced what he had done to near friends and they had not endorsed his action orlean was the wife of jean baptiste and if he expected her to stay with him it was their affair even if the reverend had only intended to help attempting to force charity on others is not always sensible so the elder wrote later that it was  up to them and if they had agreed to stay in the west xmas it was alright with him

this was very considerate of him â apparently after all the noise he had made and orlean was much relieved and loved her father still her husband was also relieved and forgot the matter for the time but did the reverend

well that was not his nature he never forgot things he should forget oh no he had not been a hypocrite forty years for nothing in the meantime the xmas passed as it has for more than nineteen hundred years winter set in and the spring was approaching when the catastrophe occurred

compromised please dont go jean she begged i dont want you to go stay with me

now orlean he said gently i have such a lot of work to do i will go tear down some of the old buildings on the homestead and be back before many days

she cried for a time while he held her in his arms crying was nothing new with her as the time for her delivery drew near she was given to such spells he was patient after a few moments she dried her eys and said  well dear you can go but hurry back i want you to be home then you understand

 of course i want to be home then wifey and sure want it to be a boy

 it will be a boy jean she said with a strange confidence  i believe it i am sure it will

 i shall love you always then my wife all our cares and burdens will vanish into the air and we shall be as happy as the angels

 oh jean you can make life seem so light

life should be made to appear light sweetheart he said caressing her  grandmother will be here with you and if you need for anything draw a check and have the neighbors below bring it out it is only three miles over the hill to carter you understand

 by the way dear she said suddenly going into the bedroom and returning presently with a letter  this is from mama she writes that they have never told papa yet and hopes that nothing serious will happen for then she would never â we would never be forgiven by him

 dear little mother mary he said fondly  i hope nothing will happen orlean for our sakes and then he paused he had started to say that he was not worried about her fathers forgiveness he had lost what little patience he had ever had with that one and did not propose to be annoyed with his love the love that he had to be continually making excuses and apologies to entertain but before he had spoken he thought better of it and decided to say nothing about it his wife had been trained to regard her father as a king and because he had succeeded in letting her see that after all he was just a negro preacher with the most that went with negro preachers in him she had at last ceased to bore him with telling him how great her father was

they were at her claim and he was about to depart for his original homestead to clean up work preparatory to moving onto her claim permanently as he had intended to do

already his wagons with horses hitched thereto stood near and he was only lingering for a few parting words with her

 i am kind of sorry we placed mother in this position he heard her say as if talking more to herself than he

 in what position orlean  

 in keeping this a secret

 from your father you mean said he frowning

 yes

 well orlean i have tried to be a husband to you

and you have been jean

then it is our business if i chose to keep such a secret

 yes jean she said lowering her eyes and thinking

but the one burden of our married life has been your father i never anticipated that his love would be such a burden ever since we have been married we have had to waste our substance on fear over what he will think

he seems to lose sight of a husbands sentiment or right

i can fancy him in my position with regard to your mother before they had been married long my god if any father or mother would have ventured any suggestion as to how they should live or what they should do i can see him

his wife laughed

 have i spoken rightly  

 yes she agreed and was momentarily amused

yes but he just makes our life a burden with his kind of love now take this matter for instance why should we be keeping this a secret from him â rather why should i its just simply because i have too much other cares to be annoyed with a whole lot of todo on his part

if he knew you were going to become a mother he would just make our life unbearable with his insistences and love

your mother knows it and ethel ethel who would have had you dispose of that innocent knows it and keeps it from him with fear all the while of what will come of it should anything happen

 now ill say this much i dont propose to make any excuses to him about anything i do or have you do hereafter im going to be husband and master and have nothing to do with what he does with regard to your mother

as long as i am good and kind to you and dont neglect you then i have a right and positively will not be annoyed even by your father

 please hush jean she begged her arms about him

but he was aroused he had made himself forget as he should have forgotten the punishment he had been given twentytwo years before but he did not like the mans conduct everywhere and with everybody back in illinois who knew n justine mc carthy he was regarded as an acknowledged rascal

just look how he treats your mother she pulled at him and tried to still his voice but speak he would if i was ever guilty of treating you as your father has treated your mother ever since he married her i hope the christ will sink my soul into the bottommost pit of hell

 jean my god please hush 

 but i speak the truth and you know it would you like to look forward and feel that you had to go through all your life what your mother has endured

 oh no no no but you must hush jean in heavens name hush he did then the storm that had come over him had spent its force and he kissed her turned then went to where his teams stood got into the front wagon and looking back drove upon his way

 poor jean murmured orlean  father and he will never be friends and it makes it so hard for me she continued to stand where he left her looking after him until he had disappeared over the hills to the east

arriving at gregory late that afternoon jean found a lyceum concert the number consisting of negroes one of whom a girl he had known some years before for she had lived next door to where he then roomed

he attended and afterward renewed their acquaintance

it so happened that a lumber company was going out of business in the next town east from gregory and some coal sheds there were for sale desiring something of the kind to use as a granary on his wifes claim baptiste journeyed hither the following day to look the same over

now it also happened that the same concerters were billed for the same town for an evening performance of that day

the day after being sunday and the company laying over until monday the days were passed together with baptiste scheduled to go out to his old place sunday night

it was a cheer to revive old acquaintances to talk of chicago and olden days with those who still lived there

it was a cheer to all but jean baptiste had cause to regret it as we shall later see in the meantime he went to his old place as per schedule returning to the little town the following morning where he purchased a hundred foot shed and prepared to move it to his wifes claim forthwith

a few miles only had been traversed before an intermittent thaw set in the soft uncertain surface of the earth making it hazardous to pull a heavy load over so when he reached his old place he decided to leave it there tear down his old granary and haul the lumber instead

while in this act his sister who had been on a visit to kansas returned and worried with regards to his wife alone with his grandma out on the homestead he hurried her therewith at once the next day he was relieved to receive a letter from orlean advising that she was well but to come home as soon as possible

a week had passed and saturday was upon him again before he was ready to make a start now there often comes in the springtime in the west severe winds that may blow unchecked for days and one came up just as jean baptiste had set out and blew a terrific gale it almost upset his wagons and made driving very difficult this was augmented further because the wind was right in his face and there was no way to avoid it however he finally reached a town about eleven miles west of dallas by the name of colome that day the next morning the wind had gone down and the day was beautiful and he was cheered to think he could reach home that day by getting started early but bad luck was with jean baptiste that day which was sunday and when he was going down a hill the wagon struck a rocky place bounced and the right front wheel rolled out ahead of him the axle had broken and his load went down with a crash

he went to a house he saw near secured a wagon and there met a man who had known his father and had lived and run a newspaper in the same town near where he was born twentysix years before he wasted hours getting his load transferred to another wagon and finally got started again but not two miles had been covered before the coupling pole snapped and his loads almost went down again what trick of fate was playing him he wondered and swore viciously hours it took before the break was repaired and he pulled into winner eighteen miles from home late that night

early morning found him however resolutely on the way he had covered about half the distance when he met a man who lived neighbor to him on his wifes claim who told him he had tried to get him on the phone saturday at gregory and again at dallas that his wife had given birth to a baby which had come into the world dead on a saturday

he almost tumbled from the wagon when he heard this dead he repeated finally he heard himself speaking and in a voice that seemed to come from far away ah â well â did my wife have â attention

 oh yes said the other  your sister and two doctors yes she had all the attention necessary but im sorry for you old man it was sure a big fine kid she couldnt give it birth so they had to kill it in order to save her life

he started to resume his journey east while baptiste now with unstrung nerves started to resume his way west but before his horses had gone many steps he suddenly drew them down to a halt and turning heard the other call out  i went to carter and sent her father a telegram as per a request of hers i suppose it was all right and continued on his way

to him  cried baptiste inaudibly to him he repeated to him no doubt that the baby â which he had not known was to be had come and â dead 

mechanically he drove upon his way he did not think he did not speak he said nothing for a long long time but down in his heart jean baptiste knew that he was coming nearer to the parting of the ways

back in old illinois n justine mc carthy upon receiving the telegram he realized would in all probability depart at the earliest convenience for the west and when he arrived would learn still more than the message had told would learn that he had been absent when his wife had given birth to the dead baby oh his child why could it not have lived    yes she had had all the attention that was possible but such would not be credited by n justine mc carthy the fact that not every man had found it possible to be present at the bedside of their wives when children came would not be considered by n justine mc carthy the fact that he himself had been absent when his own orlean came into the world would be no counter here

jean baptistes absence at the critical time would serve as an excuse for the reverend to vent his spite and he would demand a toll jean baptiste was compromised and would have to make a sacrifice   

the evil genius oh jean breathed orlean from the bed  where have you been  

he had come unto the house then and the man in him was much downcast he was and had cause to feel discouraged sorrowful and sad so he explained to the one who lay upon the bed where he had been and what had happened to him and why he had been delayed

she sighed when he was through and was sorry for a long time he was on his knees at the bedside and when an hour had passed she reached and placed her arm about his neck and was thankful that he was spared to her and they would live on hopeful but both felt their loss deeply

 i sent papa a telegram she said presently because he knew he made no answer he knew the other would come and he was resigned as to what would follow she sighed again perhaps it was because she knew and also feared what was to follow    she had not known her father her lifetime without knowing what must happen but she loved her husband and now in the weak state the delivery had left her she was struggling to withstand the subtle attack her father was sure to make

two days passed and she was progressing toward health as well as could be expected since her marriage her health on the whole had improved wonderfully the petty aches and pains of which she complained formerly had gradually disappeared and the western air had brought health and vigor to her

and then on the third day he arrived moreover he brought ethel with him they rode over the hill that led to the claim in a hired rig and baptiste espied them as soon as they were in sight

our pen cannot describe what jean baptiste read in the eyes of n j mc carthy when he alighted from the buggy and went into the house but suffice to say that what had passed twentytwo years before had come back there was to be war between them and as it had been then baptiste was at a disadvantage and must necessarily accept the inevitable

ethel was crying and her tears meant more than words

she had never cried for love it had always been something to the contrary but we must turn to the one in bed â and helpless

she saw her father when he stepped from the buggy and understood what he carried behind his masklike face

he did not allow his eyes to rest on jean baptiste and she noted this she settled back upon the pillow and tried to compose herself for the event that was to be her husband was compromised and could not defend himself   

therefore it fell upon her and from the sick bed to defend him

he was inside the house now and came toward her and she was frightened when he was near and saw his face and what it held hatred within was there and she shuddered audibly she closed her eyes to shut it out oh the agony that came over her she opened her eyes when his lips touched hers and then began the struggle that was to be hers

papa she whispered and in her voice there was a great appeal  dont blame jean jean has burdens he has responsibilities â hes all tied up hes good to me he loves me he gives me all he has but before she had finished she knew that her appeal had fallen upon deaf ears her father had come â and he had brought a purpose to be fulfilled

he caressed her he said many foolish things and she pretended to believe him she made as if his coming had meant the saving of her life but she knew behind all he pretended was the evil the evil that was his nature and the fear that filled her breast made her weaker made her sick

the doctor had said that she would be able to leave the bed in ten days probably a week  but now with grim realization of what was before her she became weak weaker weakest and all the time she saw that it was being charged to jean baptiste and to his neglect

we should perhaps try to make clear at this point in this story that jean baptiste could have settled matters in a very simple manner    true the manner in which he could have settled it would be the manner in which wars could be avoided â by sacrificing principle he could have gone to his majesty and played a traitor to his nature by pretending to believe the elder had been right and justified in everything whereas he jean baptiste had been as duly wrong he could have acted in such a manner as to have his majesty feel that he was a great man that he had been honored by even knowing him much less in being privileged to marry his daughter this in view of the fact that having been absent from her bedside at that crucial time he was compromised would have satisfied the elder and baptiste would not have been compelled to forego all that later came to pass in their relations but jean baptiste had a principle and was not a liar nor a coward nor a thief and although he had been so unfortunte as not to have been by the bedside of his wife during that hour he could have sentimentally appeased his fatherinlaw but jean baptiste had not nor will he ever in the development of this story sink so low of what was to come â and the most isâ in this story jean baptiste at no time sacrificed his manhood for any cause

n justine mc carthy and this is true of too many of his race and to this cause may be attributed many of their failures was not a reader he never read anything but the newspapers briefly and the bible a little he was therefore not an informed man as a result he took little interest in and appreciated less what the world is thinking and doing he had never understood because he had not tried what the people around where jean baptiste had come were doing for posterity yet he claimed very loudly to be an apostle of the race â to be willing â and was â sacrificing his very soul for the cause of ethiopia he took great pride in telling and retelling how he had sacrificed for his family â wife included as he was heard by others he had no faults could do no wrong and would surely reach heaven in the end

so while they lingered at the bedside of orlean he and ethel as a pastime argued with each other and involved everybody but themselves with wrongs for instance the reverend affecting much piety would in discussing his wife whom he ever did in terms regarding her faults find occasion to remark in a burst of self pity â and of self pity he had an abundant supply after all i have done for that woman after all i have sacrificed for her after all the patience i have endured while she has held me down â kept me from being what i would have been and should she is ever bursting out with youre the meanest man in the world youre the meanest man in the world  whereupon he would affect a look of deep self pity and eternal mortification

unless we lengthen the story unnecessarily we would not have the space to relate all he said in reference to his soninlaw in subtle ways during these days but jean baptiste was too busy building a barn and other buildings to listen to these compliments the elder was bestowing upon his wife with regard to him  yes my dear he said time and again  if jean was like your father you would not be here now with your child lying dead in the grave no no you would be in the best hospital in chicago with nurses and attendants all about you and your darling baby at your side and so saying he would affect another sigh of self pity

at first she had struggled to protest but after a few days she gave up entirely and became resigned to the inevitable

she received an occasional diversion however when the elder and ethel entered into a controversy unlike orlean ethel was not afraid of her father especially when he had something to say about glavis the truth was that while he so pretended n j mc carthy had no more love for glavis than he had for baptiste but he could tolerate glavis because glavis endeavored to satisfy his vanity baptiste on the other hand while he now accepted all his fatherinlaw chose to pour upon him in the way of rebuke for what he had done and should not have and what he had not done and should have he never told the elder that he was a great man

the first few days the elder had held the usual prayer but after some days he dispensed with this and turned all his energy to rebuking jean baptiste when he was out of sight

 now dont you talk about glavis cried ethel one day when his majesty had tired of abusing baptiste and sought a diversion by remarking that glavis had come from a stumpy farm in the woodlands of tennessee  no you dont glavis is my husband and you cant abuse him to his back like you are doing baptiste

just listen how she treats her father orlean cried the elder overcome with self pity orlean then rebuked ethel and chided her father but the part which escaped her was that ethel defended her mate while orlean suffered to have hers rebuked at will the greatest reason why ethel and her father could not agree as was well known was that they were too much alike

when jean baptiste had completed his barn and his wife was out of danger according to the doctor â but would never be according to the elder â who insisted that the only cure would be for her to return to chicago with themâ he was ready to go to work his wife wanted to go to chicago for what the reverend had done to her in the days he had sat by her and professed his great love would have made her wish to go anywhere to appease him for even a day

 now after the expense we have been to said baptiste  i hardly know whether i can let you go to chicago or not

the elder sighed and said to her low enough for her husbands ears not to hear just listen to that after all i have done then i will have to pay your way to chicago where i shall endeavor to save your life your dear life which this man is trying to grind out of you to get rich

 but ill think it over said baptiste  we have lots of work this summer and will try to get caught up and the next moment he was gone

 did you hear that daughter   said the reverend now aloud when the others back was turned  oh its awful the man you have married just crazy crazy to get rich

and puts you after his work after his horses after his everything and after all your poor old father has done for you whereupon he let escape another sigh and fell into tears of self pity

orlean stroked his head and swallowed what she would have offered in defense of the man she had married it was useless to offer defense he had broken this down long since

 yes he is wanting to kill to kill my poor daughter after all she has sacrificed he sobbed  and when you are dead and iii your grave like your baby is out in this wild country his voice was breaking now with sobs  he will up and marry another woman to enjoy the fruits of your sacrifice he was lost in his own tears then and could say no more

 now dear she suddenly heard her husband and looked up to find that he had returned he stooped and kissed her fondly and then went on i am going up to my sisters homestead to start the men to work with the engine breaking the land and i must haul them the coal which i will get at colome now i will not be back for several days but will make up my mind in the meantime as to whether i can let you go to chicago or not

 all right dear she said raising from the bed and caressing him long and lingeringly she could not understand how much she wanted him then it seemed that she could hold him so forever she kissed him again and again and as he passed out of the room she looked after him long and lingeringly and upon her face was a heavenly smile as he passed out of sight and disappeared over the hill as he did so the elder got from his position at the other side of the bed went to the door and also watched him out sight as he turned away baptistes grandmother who had fed many a preacher back there in old illinois the reverend included started she had seen his face and what she had seen therein had frightened her when he went back into the room and to the bed where orlean lay she dropped by the table and buried her face in her old arms and sobbed long and silently and a close observer could have heard these shaken words poor jean poor jean poor orlean oh poor orlean you made all the fight you could but you were weak you were doomed before you started for he knew you and knew you were weak but would to god that the world could end today for it will end tomorrow for you two poor orlean poor jean

the coward hello jean cried a friend of his at colome some days later as he was leading his horses into the livery barn after loading the coal he was hauling to the men who were breaking prairie on his sisters claim with a steam tractor  were those your folks i seen driving into town a while ago  

 my folks

 yeh three of them a man and two women one of the ladies appears to be sick

 oh he echoed and before he could or would have answered in his sudden surprise the other passed on it was some moments before he recovered from the shock the others words had given him he knew without stopping to think that the ones referred to were the reverend ethel and his wife he had written his wife a few days before that he would be home the following sunday and when he would be caught up in his hauling sufficiently and could spend a few days there

 so he moves without my consent or bid he breathed and for a time he was listless from the feeling that overcame him he attended to his horses mechanically had supper and went to verify what he had heard

he had little difficulty in doing so for the town was small but that night happened to be full of people and the reverend had found some difficulty in securing lodging the day had not been a beautiful one by any means it was in early april and the month had borrowed one of the dreary days of the previous month light snow had fallen which along toward evening had turned into a dismal sleet a bad day to say the least to be out and a sick person of all things

he went directly to the preacher when he saw him he was aroused and the insults he had suffered did not make him pleasant

 now look here reverend mc carthy he said and his tone revealed his feelings  what kind of a  stunt are you pulling off with my wife   and he blocked his way where they stood upon the sidewalk

 now now my son â

 oh dont  son  me said the other impatiently  you and i might as well come to an understanding right here tonight as any other time we are not friends and you know it we have never since we have known each other been in accord â not since we met â yes twentytwo years ago

oh you remember it the other started guiltily when jean referred to his youth

 you remember how my mother licked me for letting miss self help me upon her lap and fed me thereby disturbing your illegitimate flirtation   the others pious face darkened but it was not his nature to meet and argue openly as men should and do always his counter was subtle so while jean baptiste was in the mood to come to an understanding to admit frankly to the other that enemies they were the elder permitted a womanish smile to spread over his face and patted the other on the back saying  now now jean you are my daughters husband and it is no time or place to carry on like this the girl lays sick over here and if you would be a husband you would go to her now lets dispense with such things as you refer to and go forth to the indisposed he appeared more godly now than he had ever distrust was in the face of baptiste he knew the preacher was not sincere but his wife the girl he had married lay ill he suspicioned that the elder had intended stealing her away without his knowledge  he knew moreover that all his affected tenderness was subtle but he hushed the harsh words that were on his tongue to say and followed the other

 yes my children his pious face almost unable to veil the evil behind the mask  here we are together he said when he entered the room followed by baptiste orlean was in bed and made no effort to greet her husband while ethel sat sulkily in a chair nearby and kept her mouth closed

jean went to the bed and sat by his wife and regarded her meditatively she did not seem to recognize him and he made no effort to arouse her to express her thoughts which seemed to come and go he was lost in thoughts strange and sinister verily his life was in a turmoil the life he had come into through his marriage had revived so many old and unpleasant memories that he had forgotten until he was in a sort of daze he had virtually run away from those parts wherein he had first seen the light of day to escape the effect of dull indolence the penurious evil that seemed to have gripped the populace especially a great portion of his race in the years jean baptiste had spent in the west he had been able to follow unhampered his convictions but now the reverends presence seemed to have brought all this back

in a conversation one day with that other he had occasion to mention the late james j hill in his eulogy of the northwest and was surprised to find â and have the reverend admit â that he had never even heard of him indeed what the elder knew about the big things in life would have filled a very small book but when it came to the virtues of the women in the churches over which he presided he knew everything and whenever they had become agreeable in any way it was sure to end with the reverend relating incidents regarding the social and moral conduct of the women in the churches over which he presided

moreover the elder sought in his subtle manner to dig into the past life of members of baptistes family of what any had committed that could be used as a measure for gossip

and this night as they sat over jeans wife whose sentiment and convictions had been crushed the elder attempted to dwell on the subject again

 yes when your older sister taught in murphysboro and got herself talked about because she drew a revolver on professor alexander that was certainly too bad

 looks as if she was able to take care of herself suggested baptiste deciding to counter the old rascal at his own game

 but thats what im trying to show you and you could see it if you wasnt inclined to be so hard headed argued the elder

 well leave personalities out of it if you please said baptiste coloring

oh but if your sister had had protection such a deplorable incident would not have happened now for instance argued the elder  my girls have never had their good names embarrassed with such incidents

 oh they havent cried baptiste all patience gone

 then what about their half brother in east st louis eh

and the other one who died â was stabbed to death those were yours and you were never married to their mother

the others face became terrible the expression upon his face was dreadful to behold he started to rise but baptiste was not through he was thoroughly aroused now and all he had stood from this arch sinner had come back to him therefore before the other could deny or do anything said he oh you neednt try to become so upset over it your morals are common knowledge to all the people of illinois and elsewhere and let me tell you you can â as you have â in your family force those who know it and condemn it to keep quiet by making yourself so disagreeable that they will honey you up to get along with you but it is not because they or all those who know you are not aware of it

thats your reputation and some day you are going to suffer for it you deliberately make people miserable to satisfy your infernal vanity your desire to be looked upon and called great now right here you are bent upon crucifying your own daughters happiness just because i havent tickled your rotten vanity and lied he arose now and pointed a threatening finger at the other

you are out to injure me and you are taking advantage of your own childs position as my wife to do so im going to let you go ahead orleans a good girl but shes weak like the mother that you have abused for thirty years

but remember this n j mc carthy and ive called you reverend for the last time the evil that you do unto others will some day be done unto you and will drag your ornery heart in its own blood mark my words and the next instant he was gone

the other looked after him uneasily the truth had come so forcibly so impulsively so abruptly that it had for the time overcome his cunningness but only for a moment after the other had disappeared was he so he regained his usual composure soon enough and he turned to the sick woman for succor â to her whom he was dragging down to the gutter of misery for his own self aggrandizement

did you hear how he abused your father he cried the tears from his piggish eyes falling on her cheeks she reached and stroked his white hair and mumbled weak words

 oh i never thought i would come to this â be brought to this through the daughter that i have loved so much oh poor me your poor old father whereupon he wept bitterly

 you see you see cried ethel who had risen and stood over her pointing her finger to orlean as she lay upon the bed  this is what comes of marrying that man i tried oh i tried so hard to have you see that no good could come of it no good at all the other sighed she was too weak from mortification to reply in the affirmative or the negative

 i tried and i tried to have you desist but you would i when i had at last gotten you to quit him and you swore you had no sooner did he come and place his arm about you and whisper fool things in your ear than did you but up and consent to this this this do you hear this that has brought your poor father to that and she stopped to point to where that one lay stretched across the bed sobbing

the night was one long miserable quarrelsome night

ethel and the elder wore themselves out abusing baptiste and along toward morning all fell into a troubled sleep

baptiste met them the next morning as they came from the rooms and helped his wife across the street to a restaurant when they had finished the meal he said to her as they came from the restaurant  now dear ill step into the bank here and get you some money â

 no no no jean she said quickly cutting him off before he completed what he had started to say  well and he started toward the bank again as if he had not understood her  no no no jean she repeated and caught his arm nervously  no dont l 

but you are going away dear and will surely need money he insisted

 yes but âjean â jean â i have money

you have money repeated the other uncomprehendingly but how came you with money that much money

i â i had â a â check cashed that is â papa had one cashed for me

 oh so that was it mm your father had it cashed for you he understood then and his suspicion that the elder had intended taking her to chicago without letting him know it was confirmed they walked down the street toward the depot and while she held nervously to his arm his mind was concerned with his thoughts it occurred to him that he should take his wife back to the claim right then

he felt that if she went to chicago there would be trouble

he began slowly to appreciate that in dealing with reverend mc carthy he was not dealing with a man nor a near man

he was not dealing with a mere liar or a thief even â he was dealing with the lowest of all reptiles a snake then why did not he jean baptiste act

perhaps if he had we should never have had this story to tell jean baptiste did not act he decided to let her go beyond that he had no decision it seemed that his mind would not work beyond the immediate present soon she heard him as she clung to his arm allowing her body to rest against his shoulder  how much for orlean  

 two â two â hundred dollars

 why â two hundred dollars  he cried  why orlean what has come over you  she burst into tears then and clung appealingly to him and in that moment she was again his godgiven mate

 besides he went on  i havent such an amount in the bank even he looked up a half a block in their lead walked reverend mc carthy carrying the luggage

 papa papa called orlean at the top of her voice

papa she called again and again until she fell into a fit of coughing he halted and was uneasy baptiste could see

they came up to him orlean was running despite her husbands effort to hold her back

papa papal my god give jean back that money

give it back i say oh i didnt want to do this oh i didnt want tol it was you who had me sign that check you you you  she was overcome then and fell into a swoon in her husbands arms he stood firmly bravely then like the rock of gibraltar his face was very hard it was very firm his eyes spoke it told the one before him the truth the truth that was

and as the other ran his hand to his inside vest pocket and drew forth the money he kept saying in a low cowardly voice  it was her it was her she did it she did it

baptiste took the money he looked at it he took fifty dollars from it and handed the amount to the other he spoke then in a voice that was singularly dry  i will not keep her from going she can go but you know i ought not let her

they carried her to where the cars stood and made her comfortable when once inside she opened her eyes when he was about to leave upon hearing the conductors call

she looked up into his eyes he bent and kissed her she looked after him as he turned and called  jean 

 yes orlean

 goodby

he stood on the platform of the small western station as the train pulled down the track a few moments later it disappeared from view and she was gone

epoch the third chicago â the boomerang the reverend mccarthy had scored he had succeeded in separating his daughter from the man she married the fact that there was positively no misunderstanding between the two was not seen or considered by him jean baptiste had opposed him and that was enough he hated any member of his household or any one related to the one of his household who dared disagree with him of course his majesty did not see it that way he saw himself as the most saintly man in the world and sympathized with himself accordingly no man thought himself more unjustly abused than did n justine mc carthy

but there were other things to complete he had not wilfully participated in what had just passed â in fact he had not meant to part the couple at all he prided himself with having some judgment he was merely undertaking that which in a way had grown common to him â the task of getting even

now he had estimated that he knew jean baptiste although studying characters and their natural tendencies had not been a part of his theme in life he felt albeit that he had this ones tender spot clearly before him to begin with he put himself right with his own conscience by believing that baptiste was a vain selfish character bent on one purpose â getting rich he concluded â because he wished to â that baptiste did not and had never loved orlean the fact that orlean had not said anything to the contrary did not matter he was her father and therefore predicated and privileged to think and act for her that was why he had always been of so much service such fatherly help he was protecting his daughter from the cruelty of men but how he had planned it all

 now that hardheaded rascal meaning of course his soninlaw  is not going to lay down oh no my poor girl has that claim he does not want her but he does want the claim to hold the claim he must have her and have her back on the claim hes all war now but when he realizes that to lose her is to lose the claim into the bargain â oh well ill just set right down at home here and wait

yes ill wait hell be coming along and when he appears here then ill bend his ornery will into the right way of seeing things so thereupon he took up his vigil waiting for jean baptiste to put in his appearance

but for some reason the other had not hastened to chicago as soon as the elder had anticipated he would three weeks had been consumed in the trip west so he was somewhat behind in his church work while it was true that ministers in some of the towns in his itinerary collected from the members at the quarterly conference and sent the money to him on the other hand if he expected to get what was due him in any great measure it was highly necessary that he be there in person accordingly the time he spent in chicago waiting for the coming of his soninlaw that he might have the satisfaction of bending the other to his will began to grow long and irksome

moreover if he sat at home he was obliged to meet and greet the many visitors who called to see his sick daughter

more largely of course for the purpose of securing information for gossip but compelling him therefore to make or offer some explanation and here arose another phase of the case that was not pleasant following jean baptistes marriage to orlean and after the reverend had paid them his first visit he had said a great deal in praise of his rich

soninlaw that he was so extremely vain was why he had done this it had tickled his vanity to have the people see his daughter marry so well since it was well known about chicago that jean baptiste was very successful

when the elder had boasted to the people he met of the rich man his daughter had married he wrote telling the young couple of it to be referred to as rich he conjectured should have flattered any mans vanity â it would have his â and he estimated that he was doing baptiste a great favor when he let him know that he the elder was advertising him as rich

but the same had brought no response from that one he had been too busy to take any interest in being praised and even after the elder had made his first visit and returned and told of the wonders his daughter had married into he still hoped this would soften baptistes disposition into praising and fawning upon him it was not until baptiste had returned the money he had sent his daughter for railway fare the xmas before that the reverend had thrown down the gauntlet and declared war so the very thing he had played up a few months before came back now to annoy him

because he had never lived as he should have it was proving a boomerang he had made a practice of pretending not to hear what was being said about him by others but he could not seal his ears to the fact that the people were asking themselves and everybody else what had happened to his daughter or between his daughter and the rich soninlaw this was very uncomfortable it was very annoying

it was reported that he was compelled to go out west and get her and it was exasperating to explain all without making it seem that what he had said a few months before was boast pure and simple

 yeh all you could hear a few months ago was the rich man orlean had married yeh mr mc would make it his business to get around so you had to ask im about them then hed swell up lak a big frog and tell all about it then of a sudden he jumps up and goes out there and brings her back ump now i wonder what is the mattah

during these times those of the household had little peace with impatience over baptistes not showing up so he could read him the riot act and his work being neglected with having to listen to no end of gossip that his meddling had brought about he became the most obstinate problem imaginable about the house all the love he had pretended for orlean while on the claim was now changed to severe chastisement he no longer fondled and wasted hours over her she had no longer the convenient check book

the fact that she had to have a little medicine and that she also had to have other necessities that she had to eat â and the most of this he was forced to provide made him so irritable that those near prayed for the day when he would leave but if jean baptiste would only come so that he could say to him what he had planned to say just to have the opportunity to bend that stubborn will â that would be sufficient to repay him for all he was now actually sacrificing

as for  little mother mary  these were the darkest days of her never happy married life of all the men she had met or known she had truly admired and loved jean baptiste more than any other in truth it was her disposition to be frank kind and truthful she dearly loved her soninlaw for his manly frank and kind disposition she trusted him and knowing that orlean was of her disposition weak and subservient to the will of those near she had been relieved to feel that she had married the kind of man that would be patient and love a person with such a disposition

she had been sincere in her praise of him to her many friends she had told of him to everybody she knew or met so much so indeed that the reverend on his last trip west in his daily rebuke then had said  and mary has just sickened me with telling everybody she meets about jean ethel had joined with him in this the truth was that when her mother had sung her praise to the people regarding jean baptiste there was nothing left to say about glavis but more especially about the elder

what the reverend was forced to endure at this time he promptly of course charged to the indiscretions of jean baptiste if he had not done this or if he had done that the elder would not have been forced to endure such annoyance if he would only show up with his practical ideas in chicago every morning when the door bell rang he listened eagerly for the voice of his soninlaw he watched the mail and in assorting the letters looked anxiously for the western postmark but a week passed and no letter and no jean baptiste then at the end of two weeks the same prevailed and at the end of three weeks he knew he would have to go to work or reckon with the bishop

so on tuesday of the following week the elder left for his work and that same afternoon jean baptiste arrived in chicago

the great question the days that followed after the elder had taken his wife away were unhappy days for jean baptiste

in his life there were certain things he had held sacred chief among these was the marriage vow while a strong willed obviously firm sort of person he was by nature sentimental he had among his sentiments been an enemy of divorces nothing to him was so distasteful as the theory of divorce he had always conjectured that if a man did not drink or gamble or beat his wife there could be no great cause for divorce whereas with the woman if she was not guilty of infidelity a man could find no just cause on the whole to ask for a divorce but whatever the cause be â even a just cause â he disliked the divorcing habit

he persisted in believing that if two people whose lives were linked together would get right down to a careful understanding and an appreciation of each others sentiments or points of view they could find it possible to live together and be happy

fancy therefore how this man must have felt when he arrived at the little house upon the wifes claim and found his grandmother alone they had taken his wife and all her belongings he lived in a sort of quandary in the days that followed his very existence became mechanical and one day while in this unhappy state he chanced to find a little sun bonnet that they had evidently overlooked she had bought it the summer before and it was too small but he recalled now that he had thought that it made her look very sweet how much the bonnet meant to him now he placed it carefully away and when he was alone in the house in after days with only her memory as a companion he would get and bring it forth gaze at it long and tenderly

it seemed to bring back the summer before when he had been hopeful and happy and gay it brought him more clearly to realize and appreciate what marriage really meant and the sacred vow and during these hours he would imagine he could see her again that she was near and from under the little bonnet that was too small he communed with her and he would thereupon hold a mythical conversation with her as the listener

was it all because jean baptiste loved his wife what is there between love and duty it had never been as much a question with jean baptiste as to how much he loved her as it was a question of duty she was his wife by the decree of god and the law of the land whatever he had been or might have been to others therefore had gone completely out of his mind when he had taken her to him as wife and now that she was away to his mind first came the question why was she away 

yes that was the great question why was she away

oh the agony this question gave the man of our story

not one serious quarrel had they ever had not once had he spoken harshly to her nor had she been cross with him

not once had the thought entered his mind that they would part they they could part that they would ever wish to part

in the beginning true there had been some little difficulties before they had become adjusted to each others ways but that had taken only a few months after which they had gradually become devoted to each other and so their lives had become out there in the  hollow of gods hand

their lives had become assimilated they had looked forward to the future when there would be the little ones enlarging their lives and duties

and yet why was his wife in chicago without even a letter from her to him or one from him to her why why why

n justine mc carthy

oh the hatred that began to grow â spread and take roots in the breast of this man of the prairie toward the man who had wilfully and deliberately wronged him wrecked that which was most sacred to him the days came and went but that evil twisting warping hatred remained it grew it continued to grow until his very existence became a burden and a misery no days were happy days to him from the moment he awakened in the morning until he was lost in slumbers in the evening jean baptiste knew no peace

while that perpetrator of his unhappiness waited impatiently in chicago with plans to grind and humiliate him further this man began to formulate plans also with all the bitter hatred in his soul against the cause of his unhappiness his plans were not the plans of getting even but merely to see his wife where no subtle influences could hamper her or warp her convictions and reason he knew that to write to her would be but to prove useless the letters would be examined and criticized by those around her he knew that sending her money would be only regarded as an evidence of weakening on his part and if he was to deal weakness must have no place so as to how he might see his wife and give her an opportunity to appreciate duty became his daily determination

the great steam tractor breaking prairie on his sisters homestead was diligently at its task and while it turned over from twenty to thirty acres of wild sod each day it also ate coal like a locomotive so to it he was kept busy hauling coal over the thirtyfive miles from colome on the land he was having broken for he had teams breaking prairie in addition to the tractor he had arranged to sow flaxseed

for two years preceding this date crops had been perceptibly shorter due to drought therefore seeds of all kind had attained a much higher price than previously

flaxseed that he had raised and sold thousands of bushels of in years gone by for one dollar a bushel he was now compelled to pay the sum of  a bushel therefor

so with a steam tractor hired at an average cost of  a day with extra men in addition to be boarded and with hauling the coal for the tractor himself such a distance and other expenses jean baptiste unlike his augustfatherinlaw had little time or patience to sit around consuming his time and substance perpetrating a game of spite

but he was positive that he would needs lose his mental balance unless he journey to chicago and see his wife

alone she would have time he conjectured to think to see and to realize just what she was doing why should they be separated positively there was nothing and never had been anything amiss between them was what passed daily through his mind well he decided that he would go to her as soon as he had arranged matters so he could he was peeved when he recalled that the spring before he had been forced to make a trip to that same city that could as well have been avoided but when anything had to be done jean baptiste usually went after it and was through in business where he was pitted against men this was not difficult and instead of disliking to face such music he rather relished the zest it gave him but when a man is dealing with a snake â for nothing else can a man who would sacrifice his own blood to vanity be likened to it must be admitted that the task ethel do his bidding because she was possessed of his evil disposition he could trust her to carry out anything on this order â that is providing she disliked the person in question and that was usually the case for like him there were few people whom she really liked

 what have you been doing to my child  he heard from mother mary presently he studied her face again and saw that she was trying to reckon with him herself although he knew that it mattered little what she thought or did on the whole

 has she told you what i have been doing to her   he said she shifted uncomfortably looked around a little listened for a sound that she expected to hear sooner or later and then replied and in doing so he saw that she wasagain subservient to the old training

 my husband told me she countered

 oh he echoed

 you have not acted with discretion she said again and he understood her acting with  discretion  would been never to have given the reverend an excuse for making that trip   

 i have been good to your daughter a husband to the best of my ability

but you â you â should not have blundered again he was reminded of what it meant to displease or give her husband any excuse

 i did not agree in this room a year ago to be regardful of the opinion of others he defended  i agreed to the word of the law and of god i have tried to fulfill that word i did not intend to be absent when the child came

she shifted again uneasily and her mind went back to the day orlean was bom and that her husband too had been away   

 if i can see orlean that will be sufficient he said

 she went to walk

 mother 

she regarded him again and then turned her eyes away for she could not stand to look long into his the truth there would upset her and she knew it

why must this be so she shifted uneasily again

oh if she could only be brave if she could only dare â but she was not brave orlean was not brave they had lived their lives too long subservient to the will of others to attempt bravery now she rested her eyes on some sewing she pretended to do and waited it could only be for a little while ethel must learn sooner or later of his presence and thenâ there would be a scene or he must go

 its a shame said the other

you should have been careful she returned meaningly

but in her mind was still the dream if she could be brave     mother  called some one sharply jean recognized the voice the command the others face went pale for a moment while her eyes closed he understood the worst had come in the minutes they had been sitting there she had almost dared hope that orlean would return and that in some way â perhaps it would have to come from heaven âthey could fly but chances now were gone his cohort had appeared  who is it out there   she asked and came toward where they sat she saw him then and regarded him coldly through her mind shot the fact that her father had waited three weeks for him and had just left that morning her disappointment was keen for a moment she was frightened in truth she held a fearsome admiration for the man and then she stiffened she had come back to herself to the fact that she had a reputation for being disagreeable

she turned to him and said  what are you doing here 

he answered her not her mother was trembling

 get out of this house she commanded getting control of herself

baptiste was in a quandary he recalled how he had seen her make her husband jump as if trying to get out of his skin when she was in her evil spasms

 did you hear  she almost screamed  i am waiting for my wife he replied then calmly  she is my sister she screamed again

 i suppose i am aware of that

 then you cannot have her 

 she is mine already

youre a liar she yelled crying now and her evil little face screwed up horribly in her anger mrs mc carthy was trembling as if a chill had come over her

ethel suddenly flew to the phone she got a number and he heard her scream glavis glavâis   that man is here     glavâis   that man is here   he could understand no more then but saw that she was frantic he finally heard mother mary

 youre wanted at the phone she said tremblingly

he got up and went to it ethel was dancing about the room like a demon

hello he called

 hello  came back  ah â ha â who â who â who is this   the other sputtered all excitement

 baptiste replied the other wondering at his excitement

 whâat aâre yoâu doing aât my house  

oh say called back baptiste  theres nobody dead out here now calm yourself and say what you want to

im listening

 weâll said the other a little better controlled  i ask what you are doing at my house 

your house echoed baptiste uncomprehendingly

 why i do not understand you

 i want to know what you are doing at my house after what you said about me

 at your house after what i said about you  baptiste repeated

 yes you said i was  nothing but a thirteen dollars a week jockey and all that baptiste was thoughtful he had never said anything about glavis â and then he understood some more of the elders work

 now glavis i do not understand what you mean when you say what i said about you but as for my being here that is distinctly no wish of mine but you know my wife is here and it is her i am here to see no other

 but i want to see you downtown â you come down here

baptiste was thoughtful he knew that he could exert no influence over orlean when she did return with ethel acting as she was so he might as well be downtown for the present as elsewhere so he answered  well alright

ethel slammed and locked the door behind him and he walked over to cottage grove avenue and boarded a car

glavis makes a promise glavis tried to appear very serious when baptiste called at where he worked an hour later but it was beyond him to be so it was said that he was in the habit of trying to appear like the reverend but since the pretended seriousness of that one had never affected jean baptiste glavis affectation had still less effect  well glavis he began pointedly  im here as per your suggestion and since it is quite plain what the matter is we may as well come directly to the point

 well yes baptiste i guess i may as well agree with you replied glavis

 then to begin with that remark you made over the phone regarding what i had said about you let me say is a falsehood pure and simple what i said or would say to your back i will say to your face

 well baptiste he replied quickly and his expression confirmed the words that followed  i believe you

 i have no occasion to lie it is very plain that our fatherinlaw and i are not in accord and while it may be nothing to you perhaps i do not hesitate to say that there is nothing wrong between orlean and me â and never has been it is all between her father and me and he is using her as the means

 well that is rather direct suggested glavis

 evidently so but its the truth and you know it it is simply a case which you are supposed not to see all sides of

 now baptiste defended glavis i am no party to your wifes being here in chicago

 and i agree with you returned baptiste  it is not your nature to make trouble between people glavis ill do you that honor people are inclined to follow their natural bent and yours i repeat is not to cause others misery

therefore you can rest assured that i do not mean to involve you in any of my troubles

 that is sure manly in you baptiste glavis said heartily

 but it is a fact i venture that you have been advised that i spoke ill of you â at least i spoke disparagingly of you while your folks were in the west am i speaking correctly  

 ill have to admit that you are and he scowled a little

 do you believe these statements  

the other scowled again but didnt have the courage to say that he did â or perhaps to lie he knew why he had been told what he had to unite with the reverend in his getting even with baptiste glavis had been told that baptiste had  run him down

well glavis the fact that my wife is at your home â under your roof â i her husband am therefore placed at a disadvantage thereby you cannot help being indirectly implicated in whatever may happen

 now now baptiste the other cried quickly  i do not want to have anything to do with you and orleans troubles i â

 it is not orlean and my troubles glavis it is her fathers and my troubles

glavis shifted uncomfortably presently he said hesitatingly   the old man just left town this morning wished you and he could have had your outs together

 yes it is too bad we did not as i see it i have no business with him in him i am not interested and never have been because i have held aloof from becoming so is the cause of the trouble i was told before i married orlean and by her herself that i should praise her father that i should make him think that he was a king if i would get along with him indeed i did not i confess at the time consider it to be as grave as that that i had this to do in order to live with orlean

it was positively uncomfortable to glavis he could find no words to disagree with the other because he knew that he spoke the truth he knew that he had catered to the reverends vanity to be allowed to pay court to ethel before he was married to her he knew that he had done so since and he knew â and did not always like it â that he was still doing so and boarding the reverends wife into the bargain and orlean now was added thereto he did not relish the task he earned only a small salary that was insufficient for his own and his wifes needs up to a certain point his wife defied her father but since she was so like him in disposition and had been instrumental in assisting to separate orlean and her husband she had not the courage to rebel and compel â at least insist â that the reverend take care of his wife and the daughter he had parted from her husband

so it was all thrown onto glavis he made a few dollars extra each week by various means and this helped him a little in truth he wished that orlean was with her husband and knowing very well that there was where she wanted to be he was inclined for the moment to try to help baptiste besides he rather admired the man few people could be oblivious to the personality of baptiste and be honest with themselves even the elder had always found it expedient to be disagreeable in order to dispel the effect of his soninlaws frank personality

 the way we are lined up glavis you must appreciate that you cannot keep out of it you are aware that i have no wish to hang around your abode but i didnt come all the way from the west to fail to see orlean you know full well that ethel would never let her meet me elsewhere that her father has left orders to that effect now what am i to do if i call your wife will make it so disagreeable that nothing can be accomplished

 dammit exclaimed glavis suddenly  it isnt all my fault or the old mans or my wifes its orleans

 well agreed baptiste thoughtfully  on the whole that is so

 of course it is if orlean was a woman she would be right out there with you now where she belongs

 and i agree with you again glavis but orlean isnt a woman and that is what i have been trying to make her

she has never been a woman â wasnt reared so to be by nature she is like her mother and she has grown up according to her training

 she cannot be two things at the same time glavis argued  and that is a daughter to her father and a wife to you 

 no that is where the difficulty lay said baptiste

 but her fathers influence over her is great you will admit she has been taught to agree with him and that â i can never nor will i try to do

 it certainly beats hell

 its the most awkward situation i have ever been placed in but heres the idea i took that girl for better or for worse now what am i to do throw up my hands and quit or try to see orlean and get her around to reason

it isnt orlean its her father so i have concluded to make some sort of a fight life and marriage are too serious just to let matters go like this

 yes it is agreed glavis  it certainly worries me

and it annoys me because it is so unnecessary he was thoughtful and then suddenly he said  im sorry you let the old man â er â ah â get you mixed up like this he appeared as if he wished to say more to say that  for when you let him get into it the devil would be to pay keep him out of your affairs if you would live in peace

 well said baptiste rising  your time here belongs to the company you are working for and not to me or my troubles so im going to  beat  it now out to thirtyfirst street

 well returned glavis  believe me baptiste im sorry for you and for orlean its rotten it was remarkable how he saw what was causing it but how he cleverly kept from directly accusing his fatherinlaw and ill meet you at thirtyfirst street after supper at the keystone remember with that he grasped the others hand warmly and as jean baptiste went down the stairway from where glavis worked he knew that he had a friend who at least wanted to help right a most flagrant wrong the only question was would e m glavis have the courage to go through with it

well glavis might have the courage â but ethel was his wife and jean baptiste realised that of all things in the world a womans influence is the most subtle the gamblers story the keystone was the oldest and most elite hostelry for negroes in chicago and the west for many years it is located near thirtyfirst and state street in the heart of the black belt of the southside of the city it was built previous to the worlds fair and still maintains its prestige as the most popoular hangout for negroes of the more ostentatious set and it was here that jean baptiste went following his departure with glavis

when chicago was a  wide open  town gambling had been carried on upstairs as a business porters waiters barbers and politicians who held the best jobs had always found their way eventually to the keystone likewise did the negroes in business and the professions and workers in all the trades as well as mail carriers mail clerks and the men of the army and actors in short the keystone was the meeting place for men in nearly all the walks of life

always the freest city in the world for the black man chicago has the most negroes in the mail service and the civil service more negroes carry clubs as policemen more can be found in all the departments of the municipal courts county commissioners aldermen corporation counsels game warden assistants and so on down indeed a negro feels freer and more hopeful in chicago than anywhere else in the united states

so it was such a crowd that jean baptiste encountered at the keystone that day there were two real estate men who had once run on the road with him and who had since succeeded in business also there was another who was a county commissioner and still another one an army officer

so upon seeing him they did all cry  baptiste i well well of all things and how do you happen to be down here in the spring 

 oh a little business he returned and joined with the crowd bought a drink for them all and was apparently jolly

among the number was a gambler by the name of speed

he shook the visitors hand heartily and when the visit with the others was over he went to a table and sitting down beckoned for baptiste when the other responded he begged him to be seated and then said now i know what you are down here about â heard about it the day he brought her home baptiste regarded him wonderingly  yes i understand he said making himself comfortable as if to tell a long story you are wondering how i come to understand about your fatherinlaw and if you are not in a hurry ill tell you a little story

 well said the other  lets have a drink before you start

 i dont care and he beckoned to the bartender

 small bottle a schlitz he said and turned to baptiste

 make it two said the other and turned to hear the story the other had to tell

 it happened fifteen years ago began speed when their beer had been served  i was a preacher thenâ hold on

he broke off at the expression on baptistes face

 yes of course you can hardly believe it but i was then a preacher i was the pastor of the church in a little town and i wont tell the name of the town but its all the same i was a preacher and pastor of this church i had not been long ordained and was ambitious to succeed as a minister

the charge had not been long created and was of course not much of a place for money but it so happened that a quarry was opened about the time i was sent there and it brought some hundred and fifty negro families to live in the town and in almost a twinkling my charge became from among the poorest to one of the best from a financial point of view the men worked steadily and were paid well and their families found quite a bit of work to do among the wealthy whites of the town

 there were two young ladies living a few doors from where i preached girls who made their own living honestly nice clean girls and i was much impressed with them i sought and finally succeeded in getting them interested in the church and later began keeping company with one

now here is where your folks come in the reverend mc carthyâ old mac i called him was filling the same line he now is presiding elder and this church was in his itinerary i was therefore under his recommendation he had been visiting the church regularly holding his quarterly conference every three months and getting his little bit

it was shortly after i had started going with this young lady that mc carthy got awful nice and treated me so good until i became suspicious then one day it came out

  by the way speed he said whore those girls living near the church i knew who he was referring to because i had seen him trying to smile on them the day before which had been a sunday but i pretends i dont know what or who hes talking about

  who  i inquired as innocent as a lamb

  oh those two girls living near the church and he called their names

 why they are two young ladies who came here not long ago i said and waited

  is that all  he asked then and i looked at him he grinned and said   aw come on speed be a good fellow now are those girls straight and he specified the one i had begun going with

  why said i  reverend mc carthy i am surprised at you to ask such a question or to offer such an insinuation

besides i went on why   aw now speed he laughed easily his big fat round face shaking  be a good sport and put me onto these girls now ill tell you what i want you to do he said drawing his chair close to mine  ill make it my business to get back over here next sunday night and i want you to  fix  it for me with that one and â he winked in a way i did not at the time understand â but i did laterâill make it right with you you understand he said rising ill make it right zvith you  i was never so put out in my life here was this man a minister of the gospel and a presiding elder who had just deliberately delegated me to make a previous engagement for him without regard to morals â and with the girl i loved i dont think he knew i was paying her court but the moral was the same

 i was outdone but true to his words the next sunday night he was back

  well speed he said when the services were over

whats the rip everything o k he was very anxious and ill never forget his face but i was afraid of the old rascal still i hadnt lost my manhood at that so i says   now reverend you place me in a very awkward predicament to begin with i have the highest respect for those young ladies and again even if i did not i could not be expected to cohort as you suggested  aw speed he cut in  youre no good pshaw i just know the older of those two girls is not straight â am positive of it and you could  fix things if you would and i detected a touch of angry disappointment in his tone

 well to get out of it i told the old rascal what i thought of his suggestion and left him i never saw him again until near conference and then not to speak with him i was confident that i had satisfied the people and that i would be sent back without any argument

 so imagine when i went to conference and when the charges were being read off and i heard the secretary call reverend speed to mitchfield   instead of the town from which x had gone

i was just sick man so sick until i almost dropped dead on the floor oh the agony it gave me i finally got outside some way and stood leaning against the church

how long i stood thus i never knew but the church let out by and by while i still stood there â and let me explain mitchfield was a charge that contained exactly a dozen membersâthe reverend mc carthy came out and i looked up straight into his eyes  i knew then why i had been sent to mitchfield instead of back to the charge i had been at

 well i went to mitchfield and by working around town by the day in connection with the charge i managed to make it some months later i married the girl i have spoken of and we began to keep house in mitchfield

 it was pretty hard and sometimes i dont wonder at what later happened but to make a long story short i was compelled to get work in a nearby town to make a living for me and my wife and was gone all the week until saturday night at the end of six months reverend mc carthy had taken my wife and she had left me and was living in st louis

baptiste was regarding him strangely

 have you heard the the rest of it   the other paused to ask  well reverend mc carthy became the father of her two sons one was killed some years ago the other lives in st louis

but what â what became of their mother baptiste inquired curiously

 her what becomes of women who are deceived if you visited st louis and the district you might find her

she was there the last i heard of her

 and you  

 me   the other repeated in a strangely hollow voice

 you know what i am a gambler and with an old score to settle with that man if i ever get the chance

the preachers evil influence with all ethels excited ways she was not to be reckoned a fool when she had in mind to accomplish some purpose she understood full well that it would be up to her at this time to keep orlean from returning west with her husband unless she recalled her father this she did not wish to resort to until she had exhausted all her force without avail she appreciated the fact that jean baptiste could and would influence her husband as well as her mother while as to orlean she would only need a half a chance to fall away from her influence and go back to her husband

so with this in mind ethel who had inherited from her father much evil and the faculty of making people miserable began as soon as baptiste had left the house to formulate plans to counter any effort on his part to see orlean

her first move therefore was to recall orlean who was visiting near a fact which her mother had feared to tell baptiste she convinced her forthwith that she was sick in danger and sent her to bed not telling her that baptiste was even in town she followed this by sending her mother to the kitchen and keeping her there

 now what i must do â succeed in doing she muttered to herself  is to keep orlean from seeing or meeting him in private and even in public for as much as an hour she realized that keeping a man and wife apart was a grave task and that she could not trust to the sympathy of any friends

but one person could she trust to be an ally in the task she was trying to accomplish and that was her father she rather feared her husband at this time for while she held him under her control at most all times he was by disposition inclined to be kind and good and although he was jealous of baptiste in a measure this did not reach proportions where he was likely to be a very ready accomplice with the plan in hand indeed if it was left to him orlean would sleep in her husbands arms that very night

 i wish papa had stayed just another day she grumbled as she walked the floor and tried to formulate some effective plan of action  to think that he left only this morning and that man came this afternoon  she was provoked at such a coincidence she did not like to think too deeply or to scheme too long for it hurt her so she was compelled to take a chair for a time and rest her mind

she was not positive how long baptiste would stay and she would have difficulty in keeping her sister in bed for any length of time but she decided to keep her in the house if she had to sit on guard at the front door

and it was while she was yet undecided upon her plan of action that glavis came home once in a great while when she wanted a change a diversion she would have his supper waiting other times it was left to her mother

he loved her in spite of all her evil and was always pleased when she had his supper ready so when she heard his footsteps outside she was suddenly struck with an inspiration she rushed toward the rear and began hurriedly to set the table her mother had the meal ready so she affected to be very cheerful when glavis came into the room and even kissed him fondly he was so surprised that the instance made him temporarily forget what was on his mind which was just what she wished him to do

 where is orlean   he inquired after a time whereupon his wifes face darkened

 oh shes sick and in bed replied ethel guardedly

glavis grunted he was thinking for a time he forgot all that was around him his wife the supper his work all but jean baptiste and the wife that was being harbored under the roof that he kept up he suddenly got up he walked quickly out of the room and hurried upstairs while his wifes back was turned and knocked at the door of the room wherein orlean was supposed to lay sick

 come in called the other

 oh its you glavis she cried dropping back into bed when he entered the door

 aâah â orlean he said in his stammering sort of way a â ah â how are you  

 why i feel well glavis she replied wonderingly she had never felt just right mentally since before she left the west and when she allowed herself to think she found that it hurt her she had always been obedient â her father had told her that time and again and gave her great credit for being so  think of it my dear he had so often said  in all your life you have never sassed your father or contraried him whereupon he would look greatly relieved so her father had laid down the rule she was following â trying to follow her husband must certainly have been in grave error â not that she had observed it or that she had been badly treated by him for she had not however whenever she tried to see and understand what it all meant it hurt her she was again the victim of those nervous little spells that had harassed her before she married but which had strangely left her during that time

but to do her fathers will â for he never bid â always his was an influence that seemed to need no words â she was trying so she looked up at glavis and observed something unusual in his face

 what is the matter glavis   she inquired sitting up in bed again glavis shifted about uneasily before replying

ah â why â orlean its baptiste your husband

jean she cried forgetting everything but her husbandâ forgetting that she had allowed herself to be parted from him  what â what is the matter with him glavis

with jean has something happened oh im always so afraid something will happen to jean i

 no no exclaimed glavis pushing her gently back upon the pillow nothing has happened ah â er â ahâ

 oh im so relieved she sighed as she fell over in the bed

 hes here â in the city she heard then from glavis

 he is  she cried sitting suddenly erect again for a moment she hesitated and then raising her hand to her forehead as if in great pain she groaned perceptibly the next moment she had again sunk back upon the pillow and her breath came hard perspiration stood upon her brow and he saw it

 orlean oh orlean he cried then upon impulse

great god this is a shame a shame before god he lamented with great emotion

suddenly he rushed to the door and then halted as he heard his wife calling him from below he turned to where orlean lay in the bed sick now for true

 arent you coming down to supper orlean   he called

 no glavis i am not hungry

 but you should eat something orlean

 no glavis she repeated in a tired voice a voice in which he detected a sigh  i couldnt eat anything â now

he looked at her a moment with great tenderness let escape a sigh and then as if resigned to the inevitable he turned and passed down the stairway to where his wife waited below

she regarded him keenly and during the meal she kept casting furtive glances in his direction  i wonder what hes been saying to orlean   she kept muttering to herself she concluded then that she would have to watch him closely he had never been in accord with her and her fathers plan and they had borne false witness to influence him against baptiste but he had seen baptiste she knew and was also aware of the fact that glavis liked both her sister and brotherinlaw and it was going to be a task to keep him from following his natural inclination

she thought about her father again and wished that he was in chicago

she had never been delegated to handle such a task alone and she disliked the immense responsibility that was now upon her and no one to stand with her in the conflict

 well ethel glavis said arising from the table when the meal was over  im going to walk out for a while

she started up quickly her lips parted to say that he was going to meet baptiste and conspire with him against her father but she realized that this would not be expedient

he might revolt she rather feared this at times notwithstanding her influence over him therefore she decided to exercise a little diplomacy accordingly she sank back into the chair and replied  very well dear 

he regarded her keenly but she appeared to be innocently completing her meal he sighed to think that she did not make herself disagreeable the anticipation of which had made him fear and dread the task that was before him

but now he was compelled to feel a little grateful because she was apparently very prudent in the matter

he hurried quickly to the hall tree slipped into a light overcoat and left the house as he walked down the street he was in deep thought

more of the preachers work jean baptiste was thoughtful for a long time after the other had left him he had heard before he married orlean that the reverend was the father of two illegitimate children but from speeds story he had met the whole of it not only was he the father of two illegitimate children but he had taken another mans wife to become so â and all this while he was one of the most influential men in the church

this fact however did not cause baptiste any wonderment it was something he had become accustomed to it seemed that the church contained so many of the same kind â from reportsâ until it was a common expectation that a preacher was permitted to do the very worst things â things that nobody else would have the conscience to do he arose presently and going to the bar ordered another bottle of beer he looked around the large room while he drank at the usual class who frequented the place he knew that here and there among them were crooks thieves  con 

men gunmen and gamblers many of these men had perhaps even committed murder â and that for money yet there was not one he was positive that would deliberately separate a man and his wife for spite and that was the crime this preacher fatherinlaw of his had committed

always in the mind of this man of the prairie this played

it followed him everywhere it slept with him arose with him and retired with him and all through long sleepless nights it flitted about in his dreams like an eternal spectre it gave him no peace gradually it had brought him to a feeling that the only justifiable action would be to follow the beast to his lair and kill him upon sight

often this occurred to him and at such times he allowed his mind to recall murder cases of various phases and wondered if such a feeling as he was experiencing was the kind men had before committing murder then if so what a relief it must be to the mind to kill he had a vision of this arch hypocrite writhing at his feet with death in his sinful eyes and his tongue protruding from his mouth

he drank the beer and then ordered liquor somehow he wanted to still that mania that was growing within him

he had struggled for happiness in the world for success and contentment and he did not wish his mind to dwell on the subject of murder but he was glad that this man had left the city a man might be able to accept a great deal of rebuke and endure much but sometimes the sight of one who has wronged him might cause him for a moment to forget alt his good intentions and manly resolutions

yes he was glad that reverend mc carthy had left the city and he shuddered a little when he recalled with a grimace that he had traveled these many miles to see and reckon with his wife

 well you are here he heard then and turned to greet glavis

 oh hello glavis he returned with a tired expression about his eyes from the effect of the strain under which he had been laboring  have a drink

 an oldtime cocktail glavis said to the bartender he then turned to baptiste

 well hows everything over home   said baptiste coming directly to the point  your wifes sick said glavis a little awkwardly

 and i her husband cannot call and see her im compelled to hear it from others and say nothing he paused and the expression on his face was unpleasant to behold

glavis saw it and looked away he could not make any answer and then he heard the other again

 this is certainly the limit i married that girl in good faith and ill bet that she has not told you or anybody else that i mistreated her but here we are compelled to be apart and by whom   his face was still unpleasant and glavis only mumbled

 that damn preacher

 oh baptiste cried glavis frowningly

yes i know â i understand your situation glavis

but you must appreciate what it is to be thrown into a mess like this to have your home and happiness sacrificed to somebodys vanity im compelled to stand for all this for the simple crime of not lauding the old man all because i didnt tickle his vanity and become the hypocrite he is for should i have said what he wanted me to say then i would have surely lied and i hate a liar 

 but come baptiste argued glavis  we want to figure out some way that you and your wife can get together without all this now lets have another drink and sit down

 well alright said the other disconsolately  i feel as if it would do me good to get drunk tonight and kill somebody âno no glavis he added quickly  im not going to kill anybody so you neednt think i am planning anything like that im too busy to go to jail

 now im willing to help you in any way i can baptiste began glavis  as long as i can keep my wife out of it

ive got the darndest woman you ever saw but shes my wife and you know a man must try to live with the one hes married to and thats why i am willing to help you

they discussed plans at some length and finally decided to settle matters on the morrow

but when the morrow came ethel blocked all the plans

she refused to be sent away across town and let baptiste come into the house and see his wife she knew what that would mean so she stood intrenched like the rock of gibraltar other plans were resorted to but with the same result the days passed and baptiste became obsessed with worry he knew he should be back in the west and to his work he began to lose patience with his wife for being so weak if he could only see her he was certain that they would come to some agreement sunday came and went and still he saw her not ethel took confidence she smiled at the success with which she had blocked all efforts of communication baptiste wrote his wife notes but these she intercepted and learned his plans she convinced her sister that she was sick and should be under the care of a physician this reached baptiste and he secured one a brilliant young man who was making a reputation he had known him while the other was attending the northwestern medical college and admired him but this too was blocked

for when he knocked at the door with the doctor at his side they were forbade admittance thereupon baptiste was embarrassed and greatly humiliated at the same time

ethel had a good laugh over it when they had left and cried  he had his nerve anyhow walking up here with a nigger doctor the ideal i wish papa had been home hed have fixed him properl papa has never had one of those in his house indeed not no nigger doctor has ever attended any of us and never will as long as papa has anything to do with it

glavis finally succeeded in getting a hearing by pleading and begging he finally secured ethels consent to allow him to bring baptiste to the house and sit near his wife for just thirty minutes â but no more he did not apprise baptiste of this fact nor of the time limit but caught him by the arm and led him to the house as though he were a privileged character he took notice of the clock when he entered because he knew that ethel who was upstairs had done so and he was very careful during the time to keep his eyes upon the clock he knew that ethel would appear at the expiration of thirty minutes and start her disagreeableness so at the end of that time he quietly led baptiste away after he had been allowed only to look at his wife who was like a sphinx from the careful dressing down she had had before and preparatory to his coming

so having carried out what he considered a bit of diplomacy glavis was relieved baptiste could expect no more of him and so it ended

ethel wrote her father a cheerful letter and stated that that hardheaded rasca had been there from the west but that orlean had declined to see him but once and had refused to go back at all whereupon her father smiled satisfactorily

jean baptiste returned to the west defeated and downcast he had for the first time in his life failed in an undertaking pie had never known such before he could not understand but he was defeated that was sure perhaps it was because he was not trained to engage in that particular kind of combat he had been accustomed to dealing with men in the open and was not prepared to counter the cunning and finesse of his newly acquired adversaries

over him it cast a gloom it cast great dark shadows and in the days that followed the real jean baptiste died and another came to live in his place and that one was a hollowcheeked unhappy nervous apprehensive creature

he regarded life and all that went with it dubiously he looked into the elements above him and said that the world had reached a time whence it would change the air would change the earth would become hot and rain would not fall and that drought would cover all the land and the settlers would suffer and so feeling it did so become and in the following chapter our story will deal with the elements and with how the world did change and how drought came and what followed

a great astronomer not long ago a man died who had made astronomy a specific study for sixty years he knew the planets mars and jupiter and saturn and all the others he knew the constellations and the zodiac â in fact he was familiar with the solar system and all the workings of the universe this man had predicted with considerable accuracy what seasons would be wet and what seasons would be dry he also foretold the seasons of warmth and those of cold and he had said that about every twenty years the world over would be gripped with drought this drought would begin in the far north and would cover the extreme northern portion of the country the first year the second year it would reach further south and extend over the great central valleys and be most severe near the northern tier of states following it would go a bit further south the next year and so on until it would finally disappear altogether

so according to this mans prediction the country of our story would experience a severe drought soon preceded by a slight one as a forerunner for two years the crops would be inferior but the following year would see it normal again

so be it

it had been dry the year before and had been just a little bit so the year before that we know by the shortage of crops jean baptiste had raised that such had been so so with hundreds of acres and the sun shining hot and the wind blowing from the south it was no surprise when he became now an altogether different person for you see the lifeâthat life that makes men strong and fearless and cheerful had gone from the body of jean baptiste then he began to grow uneasy it is perhaps somewhat difficult to portray a drought and its subsequent disasters we beg of you however that you go back to the early years in the peaceful hopeful vigorous country of our story in the years that had been before when everything had pointed to success rainfall had been abundant frost had waited until october before it showed his white coat upon the window sill land values had climbed and climbed and had gone so high until only the moneyed could even reckon to own land and jean baptiste controlled a thousand acres

over all the country the pounding of steam and gasoline tractors filled the air with an incessant drumming the black streaks everywhere told the story of conquest the prairie was giving place to the inevitable settler and hope was high in the hearts of all so the wind had blown hot many days before the settlers became apprehensive of anything really serious

never since they had come to this country had they experienced such intense heat such regular heat such continued heat a week passed and the heat continued it blew a gale and then a blast but always it was hot hot hot

two weeks passed and still it blew before this it had at least subsided at night although it did begin afresh in the morning but now it blew all night and all day and each day it became hotter the soil became dryer and presently the crops began to fire

oh for a rain every settler cried for a rain a rain a rain  but no rain came

so every day there was the continual firing of the crops

the corn had been too small in the beginning to require much moisture and the dry weather had enabled the farmer to kill the weeds so it stood the gaft quite well for a time and grew like gourd vines in the meantime it was the wheat the oats the rye and the barley that were first to suffer these were at their most critical stage the time when tiny little heads must dare seek the light and as they did so the cruel heat met and burned them until thereupon they cried and died from grief and still the drought continued

no showers fell the crops needed water after the third week of such intense heat the people groaned and said    had returned with all its attendant disaster

and still the wind kept blowing the air grew hot hotter almost to stifling with the odor of the burning plants the aroma mixed with the intense heat was suffocating the grass upon the prairie gave up turned its tiny blades to the sun and died to the roots while all the grain of the land slowly became shorter it struggled it bent and at last turned what had pointed upward downward and also died of thirst

and then the people awakened to the emergency they began to take note of the fact that many had gone into debt so deeply until there were many who could never get out unless they sold their land this had been so with poor managers speculators and others before when they found that they were unable to make it there had always remained the alternative of selling out and this had been so easy because the people at large wanted the land so instead heretofore of retiring in defeat the weakest had retired in apparent victory  for my homestead i received 

or maybe it had been  so it had been great prices to all who wanted to sell only a small portion of them however had wanted to sell up to date

but when the crops were surely a failure for the most part hundreds and thousands and even more quarters were offered for sale then came the shock â the jolt that brought the people to a stern realization of what was before them the buyers there were no buyers no the buyers now when many wished to sell stayed in iowa and illinois and wherever they lived and refused to come hither

so for the first time the people in the new country were face to face with a real problem and this continued to be augmented by the intense heat hotter it had grown and at last came a day when all the small grain was beyond redemption only the corn and the flaxseed were yet a possibility so to jean baptiste we now return

he had written to his wife and she had replied to his letter he read them where he lived on the homestead she had left and longed simply for her to return he lived with his mind in a dull quandary it was useless to try to find consolation hating the cause of his troubles so him he tried much to forget it would all come right some day he still hoped and worried between times over his debts he had borrowed more money to develop his land was behind in the interest now and also the taxes and his wife wrote for money

this was what glavis had advised him to doâsend her money and all would be right yes that was what ethel and her mother and her father had all thought right send her money but the day of plenty of money for jean baptiste was slipping the burning dried crop that lay in the field would bring no money but this he dared not write if he wrote and told the woman he had married â for a wife she surely was no more â that would be to tell the family and that prince of evil the reverend would say with his wonted braggadocio umm didnt i tell you right that is a wild country out there for wild people only so baptiste kept what was ruining the crops to himself

he sent her five dollars and this brought the most pleasant letter he had yet received it also brought one from glavis who followed the same with another which was more to the point it was this he wrote  chicago iii june th â  dear friend baptiste  i have your recent letter and it gives me a great pleasure to reply to it you would have had my last letter sooner but i left it to ethel to mail and this she did not do so that explains the delay

 now we are getting along very well in chicago and hope the same prevails in the west by the papers i read where considerable dry weather is prevailing over a part of the west but hope it hasnt truck your part of the country

appreciating however your disposition to come directly to a point i will now turn to a subject that i am sure will be of greater interest to you than anything else and which is orlean your wife

 it gives me a pleasure to state that she appears more relieved of recent than she has since returning home but i will not hesitate to tell you why it is because of you and you only always she talks of you â to me â and it pleases me to talk with her concerning you for it is with you her mind is at all times i fear that you cannot appreciate her now as you were once inclined to do but really think you would be justified fully so if you did

 now for instance when you sent the money not long ago it gave her great delight that you havent forgotten that she is your wife and have some regards in spite of all meant to her very much she took it and bought her a pair of shoes with a part the other she spent to have pictures made so that she might send you one and i speak truly that to send you one was the sole object in her having them made

 the poor girl has suffered much â agonies it is not her disposition to be as she has somehow been compelled to be i cant quite explain it but if it was left to orleans dictates things would not be as they are yet you might not appreciate this either but to make it plainer orlean has her mothers disposition and that is not to assert her rights too bad

 well there was a little incident that touched me the other day and which i will tell you of a certain lady was over and seeing her with the new shoes she asked who had bought them poor orlean  it is certainly to be regretted that a girl of her temperament and kind disposition must be placed forever in a false light frankly it worries me i trust you will understand that the true state of affairs has not been given to the public and here i will draw a long line instead of saying what will be best left unsaidbut orlean replied to the lady in these words my husband bought them for me  i wish you could understand that it is all one great mistake i wish you knew the truth and the suffering this poor girl has been put to for if you did you would know that she is a good girl and loves the man she has married with all her soul â but orlean is not like other women shes weak and â oh well i must close here because it hurts me to tell more

i will however in conclusion say do not despair or grow bitter toward her this is a strange world and strange things happen in it of but one thing i can assure you and that is the right must come and rule in the end yes nothing but right can stand all else passes

therefore hoping that you will be patient and trust to that i speak of believe me to be  always your friend  e m glavis

now it so happened that when glavis had completed this letter he was called to the phone and later into the street

he was gone a half hour or more and in the meantime ethel came upon it and read it her evil little eyes narrowd to mere slits when she had finished she had noted what had been going on â orlean and her husband always finding each others company so congenial

 well she muttered after a time  the time to strike iron is while its hot ill have to get that man of mine straightened out whereupon she went to her room and here is the letter she wrote chicago iii june th â  the reverend n j mc carthy cairo ill

 dear father we received your letter and were glad to hear you say that you expected to come to chicago soon

i was just thinking awhile ago that if you could come soon real soon it might be best certain matters need your attention i will not state which but i you know am aware of how you have been slandered and vilified by a certain person that you know well that person is again finding a way to influence those who are near to us so knowing how equal you are to the most arduous task i take this means of communicating that which is most expedient

 hoping that your health is the best and that we may see you real soon believe me to be as ever  your loving daughter ethel

so it happened that out in the west where the most terrific and protracted drought the country had ever experienced was burning crops and hopes of the people included jean baptiste was made joyful

he understood glavis letter he understood what he had said and what he had not said he had suffered he saw disaster creeping upon him from the drought rent fields

is it therefore but natural that in his moments of agony and unhappiness shattered hopes and mortal anguish that he should turn to the woman who had been his mate to have her to talk to her to tell the truth to and share what little happiness there was to be had in life he became overly anxious thereupon he wrote her sending another check for five dollars

july th â  my dear wife  i am writing and sending you a little more money and since you must be well by now and realize how much i need you i am enclosing a signed but not filledinamount check with the request that vou come home right away

you will start say the th that will place you in winner on the night of the eleventh on saturday where i will meet you

 i will expect you dear and please dont disappoint me

i have not seen you for three months now and that has not been my preference the amount will be sufficient for your fare and expenses please and i will write no more but should anything happen that you can not start on that date then write or wire me that i may know

 with love to you i am as ever you husband jean n justine mccarthy preaches a sermon the text of reverend n j mc carthys sermon to be delivered on mothers day was one of the most inexhaustible most of his sermons he did not prepare but because this was one of the greatest days in the annual of the church he spent a half a day in the preparation thereof the title he selected for it suited him fully and he called it the claim of the wicked

into it he put all the emotion that was in him he drew a picture in illustrious words of the wicked the vicious man and the weak the undefended woman and made many in his dark congregation burst into emotional discordance thereby he ridiculed the vain he denounced scathingly the hypocrite he made scores in his audience turn with perspiration at the end of their noses with conscious guilt

oh never before in the years since he had mounted to the pulpit and begun what he chose to call  an effort for the salvation of souls had he preached such a soul stirring sermon

 live right live right i say  he screamed at the top of his voice  how many of you are there as you sit here before me that have done evil unto thy neighbor have made some one unhappy have cast a soul into grief and eternal anguish think of it think of what it means before god to do evil spite vent your rotten deceit upon others

i stand before you in gods glory to beseech you to desist to pray with you to live according to your consciences to dispense with that evil spirit that in the end you may face your god in peace go forth hereafter in this world of sin go to those whom you have wronged and made thereby to suffer and ask forgiveness ask there and repent forthwith oh ill tell you it is a glorious feeling to know you have lived right and he turned his eyes dramatically heavenward and affected his audience by the aspect to feel that unto others you have been just that you have been kind that you have not caused them to suffer but to feel happy think of the thrill the sensation such must give you and then let your conscience be henceforth your guide in all things 

when the services were over and he had shaken hands with all the sisters and bowed to the brothers a boy the son of the lady where he stayed approached and handed him a letter he looked at it with his spectacles pinched upon his nose and then read it it was from ethel and we know the contents

 so he said easily as he read it  the evil seeks to influence my household in subtle matters eh oh that man has the brain of a caesar but the purpose of satan

drat him and his infernal scheming ever since the day i first knew him in the country four miles from this town he has been wont to annoy to aggravate me â and after all my daughter my poor daughter and myself have done for him

he began preparation to go to chicago at the earliest convenience as his work was so urgent he wrote ethel in reply that same day my dear daughter i am in receipt of your letter and make haste to reply

to begin with i am not surprised to hear what you wrote in your letter i am not surprised to hear anything these days ever since your mother committed the unpardonable blunder of letting my poor child go straggling off into the west that wild west where only the rough and the uncivilized live i have not been surprised with what each day might bring it is certainly to be regretted that when one has sacrificed as much as i have to raise two of the nicest girls that ever saw the light of day a fortune hunter should come along and bring misery into a peaceful home as that man has done god be merciful but it is to be hoped that we will see fit to adjust rightly the evil that we arc threatened with

 i cannot come to chicago until a week from next thursday or friday i am so behind with gods work caused by the trip we made to that land of wilderness last spring that i am almost compelled to be at cairo next sunday

but should anything transpire that will necessitate my presence before that time wire or write me right quick and i will be there

from yours in christ  n justine mc carthy

in the west jean baptiste got ready for the homecoming of his wife the small grain crop was gone while the drought was now burning the corn to bits his large crop of flax which had been the most hopeful possible a few days before was showing the effect of the drought now as well

but with jean baptiste he could almost forego anything and be happy with the prospects in his mind this became so much so until he looked forward to the day he had set for her coming as if all the world must become righted when she was once again near him

now during these months he had only his grandmother for company and her he wanted to send home but she would not leave him always willing to wait until orlean came back during these long lonesome days he found a strange solace in talking to his horses there for instance was john and humpy the mules that orlean had driven her father out to their home with when he had come on his first visit he told them that she was coming back now and to him they appeared to answer they had become round and plump since work had closed and haying fully shed their winters hair and not yet become sunburned their dapple gray coating made them very attractive

he rearranged the house bought a few pieces of much needed furniture and made elaborate preparations for the homecoming at last the day arrived

it was saturday morning the wind had died down and gave threats of rain for the first time in six long hot dry weeks he hitched john and humpy to the spring wagon and with a touch of his old enthusiasm left his grandmother cheerfully â but for reasons of his own did not tell her that he was going for orlean perhaps he wished to surprise her at least he did not tell her

he drove to winner more filled with hope than he had been for months

the town was filled that day and because there was an appearance of rain in the air which could yet save much of the corn there was an air of hope and cheer abroad

jean thought to board a train and ride a few miles and return on the evening train on which she would be then he decided he would wait for her and be ready to drive directly home as the train was due shortly after nine p m he estimated that he could drive the distance in two hours thereby getting to her claim before midnight and they could spend sunday together celebrating their happy reunion

he had longed to talk with her â and grieve with her over their loss in the fine little boy who never knew his parents he thought of all this and of the happy days they had spent together the summer before he felt the love and the devotion she had given him then he wondered sometimes whether he had ever loved her as he had dreamed he would love his wife but this thought had over been replaced by his sense of duty marriage was sacred it was the institution of good he always disliked to see people part he felt then as he had ever felt before that nothing but infidelity could ever make him leave a woman that he had married he was still an enemy of divorce

he recalled how they had gone to the catholic church once in gregory and had heard a learned priest discourse on divorce and its attendant evils never before had anything so impressed him how plain the priest had made his audience understand why the church did not tolerate divorce how decidedly he had shown that divorce could and would be avoided if the people could be raised to feel that until death do us part and baptiste and the woman he had married had discussed it afterward they had found books and stories in the magazines to which they subscribed and had read deeper into it and had been united in their opinion on the subject divorce was bad it was evil it was avoidable in almost every case then why should it be

they had agreed that duty toward each other was the first essential toward combating it that selfishness was a thing that so often precipitated it in all its phases he had discussed it with her and in the end she had agreed with him and down in their hearts they had felt that such would never be necessitated in the union they had formed

so he lived again through the life that had been his he did not allow his mind to dwell on the evil that had come into and made his life unhappy made his days and nights and very existence a misery he did not as he lingered on the platform of that little western station think or dwell on the things that were best forgotten for a time he became jean baptiste of old return to him then did all that old buoyancy all that vigor and great hope all that was his when he had longed for the love that should be every mans

and she had been away on a visit to recover from the illness that the delivery had given her he was sorry for their loss and he would talk with her this night as they drove along the trail they would talk of that and all they had lost and they would talk of that which was to come

oh it would be beautiful just to have a wife the wife that gives all her love and thought to making her husband happy and he would try to give her all that was in him

and his wife would soon be with him â in his arms and they would be happy as they had once been

there it was from down the track the train whistled

it was coming and his wait was to an end near he saw john and humpy whom she had been delighted to drive

they were groomed for the occasion and were anxious to go home tonight they would haul her and hear her voice

he rose suddenly to his feet when at last the light fell upon the rails and he could see the engine the roar of the small locomotive was approaching around him were others whose wives had been away they too were come to meet their loved ones some were alone while around the others were children â all waiting to meet those dear to their hearts

the train came to a stop at last and the people emerged from the coaches there was the usual caressing as loved ones greeted loved ones little cries of mama and papa were heard and for a moment there was quite a hubbub of exclamations oh john and jim with the attendant kiss in the meantime he looked expectantly down the line to where the car doors opened and not seeing the one for whom he was looking he presently jumped aboard the first car and passed through it it was empty and he estimated that she would be in the rear car it was the chair car and the one in which he naturally would expect her to ride he passed into it bravely with his lips ready to greet her the last of the passengers were filing out the car was empty and his wife had not come

slowly he passed out of the car as the brakeman rushed in to change his apparel for the street across the street was the team waiting they seemed to know him before he came in sight and they greeted him as though they thought that she had come too

he got slowly into the wagon and soon they were hurrying homeward

what the people were saying nj mccarthy arrived in the city late on friday afternoon and was met by both his daughters

ethel had of course read the letters jean baptiste had written his wife requesting her to return home and so she took orlean with her to meet her father instead of permitting her to go to the station to return to the husband who had asked for her the elder was due in about the same time the train that would have taken orlean west was due out

ahha he cried as he stepped from the car and both my babies have come to meet their father that is the way my children act always obedient to their father

yes yes never have contraried or disobeyed him a compliment he meant for orlean but ethel could share it this once although the times she had contraried or sauced him would have been hard to recount

upon arriving home they met glavis just returning from work and he was also greeted in the same effusive manner by the reverend

and how is everything about the home my son

asked the elder in a big voice at the same time he eyed glavis critically he had come to the city with and for a purpose and that purpose was to put down early the intimacy that had been reported as growing up between glavis and baptiste so he had planned to attend to it diplomatically

why everything is alright father glabbed glavis grinning broadly and showing his teeth he was ever affected by the others lordlyism and he had never tried matching his wits with those of the others in an extraordinary manner the elder was aware of this and it made him rather grateful however he regarded the other closely as glavis stepped about in quick attention to his possible needs or desires that was as he had hoped to have both his sonsinlaw wherefore his team would have been complete it made him sigh now regretfully when he recalled how he had failed in the one case he gave up momentarily to a siege of self pity how different it would have been had jean baptiste chosen to admire him as glavis apparently did but â and he straightened up perceptibly when it occurred to him instead of being as glavis was the other had chosen to be independent to call him judge colonel reverend and elder

and any other vulgar title he happened to think of on the moment moreover he had also chosen to ask him a thousand questions about things he did not understand â that was the trouble though the elder had not seen it that wayâ asking him questions about things he did not understand

the elder saw it as  impudent he saw and regarded that persistency which had been the making of the man in jean baptiste as  hardheadedness he regarded that tenacity to stick to anything in the other sufficient to characterize  a bulldog

 mm my boy he said now to glavis  you are certainly a fine young man just fine fine fine he paused briefly while glavis could swallow the flattery and then went on never in the thirty years i have been a minister of the gospel and been compelled to be away from home in gods work has it ever been like it has since you married ethel i simply do not have to worry at all now whereas i used to have to worry all the time whereupon he paused again affected a lordly sigh and permitted glavis to become inflated with vanity before going on

 now before you married ethel i was a little dubious

he always said this for a purpose  i am so well informed and understand men so well and the ways of men until i was hesitant to risk trusting you with my daughters love you will understand how it is when you have raised children with the care i have exercised in the training of my precious darlings a man cannot be too careful and for that reason i was dubious regarding her marrying you

besides we i think you understand are among the best colored people of the city of chicago and the state of illinois so it behooved me to exercise discretion

 yes father glavis swallowed he felt then the dignity of his position as a member of such a distinguished family

 well went on the other you know how much grief i must be enduring when i sec this poor baby pointing to orlean  as she is the finest girl that ever trod the earth and my heart always and then to see her dragged down to this and all this attendant gossip grieves my old heart whereupon big tears rolled down his dark face all those about sighed in sympathy and were silent

 oh its a shame a shame my father it is a shame

he cried between sobs  oh his immortal soul come in here like a thief in the night and with his dirty tongue just deliberately stole her from her good home â her an innocent child to go out into that wilderness and sacrifice her poor soul to make him rich he ended with the eloquence that his years of preaching had given him he shed more tears of mortification and resumed  and my wife her own mother was a party to it  he was killing two birds with one stone now nothing was more gratifying to him than to seize every possible opportunity to place all his failures all his shortcomings all his blunders and last but not least all the results of his evil nature on the shoulders of his little helpless wife for years â aye since he had taken her as wife had it been so never had she shared even in reflected light the honors that had come to him she did as he requested and endeavored to please him in every way the love he had given her was an affected love it was not from his heart he had given her little that was due her as his wife

 i went out there he went on  to find this child lying there in the bed with only his sister and grandmother to look after her the doctor was coining twice a day but that man asked him when she could but open her eyes whether such was necessary and that when it wasnt then to come but once i sat there by her bed i her poor old father and nursed her back to life from the brink of death the death that surely would have come had it not been for me and when she was well enough i went to all the expense of bringing her out of that wilderness back to her home and health

 and for that for all that i have sacrificed what am i given  credit  well i guess not i am being slandered im being vilified by evil people â and right in my own church think of it for thirty years i have preached the law of the gospel and saved so many souls from hell and now now when my poor old head its white and my soul is grieved with the evil that has come into my home i am vilified

no longer than last week i was approached by a woman a woman purporting to be a child of god but who ups to me and said  reverend mac what is the matter with your daughter and the man she married  i hear they are parted i was so put out that i did not attempt to answer but just regarded her coldly but did that stop her mouth  well i guess not she went right on as flip as she could be well you know reverend there is all kinds of reports about to various effects one is that you didnt like him because of his independent ways and because he was successful and he didnt take much stock in you because he didnt like the way you had lived and then theres other reports that he made an enemy of you because he didnt praise and flatter you and that you did it to  get even they say that you had your daughter to sign her husbands name to a check for a large sum of money and used it to slip away from him and so on but the one thing that everybody seems to be agreed upon is that there was nothing whatever wrong between the couple and that they had never quarreled and never had thought of parting that all the trouble is between you and your soninlaw  i had stood her gab about as long as i could i was so angry so all i could say was woman in the name of heaven get you away from me before i forget i am a minister of the gospel and you a woman but before she had even observed how angry i was she ups and says  why now elder as much as you love the ladies and then youd abuse a poor woman like me and right there after such a tonguing as she had let out fell to crying

 those are some of the things i must endure my son in this work i must endure slander vilification misunderstanding and all that its terrible

 people are certainly ungrateful cried ethel at this point and they dont try to learn the truth about anything before they start their rotten gossip more they have nerve with it a certain woman stopped me on the street downtown the other day a woman who claims to have been my friend and a friend of our family for years

and what do you think she had the nerve to say to me

well heres what it was and i hope she said it why ethel how is orlean i replied that she was getting better she says   is she sick physically or mentally   i said i dont understand you she looked at me kind of funny as she replied  why dont you know ethel glavis that its the talk around chicago â everybody is saying it that you and your father went out west there and made her forge his name to a check for a large sum of money and for spite and spite only took poor orlean away from her husband and came back here and spread all this gossip about her being sick and neglected when the doctor had come to see her every day i know jean baptiste and i have not lived in this world for thirtyfive years and not able yet to understand people and jesus christ couldnt make me believe that jean baptiste would mistreat orlean

besides all this talk comes from you and your father

orlean has said nothing about it she is just simple and easy like her mother and will take anything off you and your father now its none of my business but i am a friend of humanity and i want to say this that anybody that is doing what you and your father are doing will suffer and burn in hell some day for it i  and she flies away from me and about her business

 its outrageous the reverend cried  we hardly dare show our heads on the street to greet old friends for fear we are going to be ridiculed and abused for what we have done

 its certainly an ungrateful world thats all agreed ethel

 until then it did not rain the night jean baptiste went to winner to meet the wife who failed to come but the protracted drought continued on into july for three weeks into this month it burned everything in its path

from canada to kansas the crops were almost burned to a crisp while in the country of our story proper only the winter wheat and rye and some of the oats matured

and this was confined principally to the county where jean baptiste had homesteaded here a part of a crop of small grain was raised but everything else was a failure

his flaxseed crop in tripp county which had given some promise if rain should come in time had now fallen along with all else and when he saw it next after his trip to winner it was a scattered mass of sickly stems with army worms everywhere cutting the stems off at the ground

the whole country as a result was facing a financial panic

interest would be hard to raise â and this in view of the fact that the year before had seen less than half a crop produced was not a cheerful prospect with baptiste and others who had gone in heavily disaster became a possibility and unless a radical change intervened disaster appeared as an immediate probability

during these days there was little to do he had harvested what little crop he had raised and having no hauling or anything to engage him he found going fishing his only diversion and it was at about this time that he received a letter it bore the postmark of the town where he had met his wife in the beginning and read  my dear jean  i thought i would be bold this once and write you since it is a fact that you are on my mind a great deal you will of course remember me when i mention that it was in my home that you met your wife rather the woman you married whom i suppose from what i hear has not proven very faithful i daresay that your trip to my home that day was the beginning of this episode but it is of him the reverend her father of whom i wish to speak

 he used to speak of you you see this town is in his itinerary and i therefore see him quite often in fact he is quite well known to me and visits my home and has been here recently he was here just a week ago yesterday before going into chicago and i asked about you he ups with his head when i did so and i estimated that the trouble that is supposed to be between you and orlean is possibly between him and yourself

 well you see it is like this after you married orlean we could hear nothing from hint but you you were the most wonderful the most vigorous the wealthiest â in fact you were everything according to his point of view he preached of you in the pulpit he set you up as the standard and model for other young men to follow therefore you must imagine our surprise when almost over night you had changed so perceptibly from everything a man should be â or try to be as a young man you became the embodiment of all a man should not be now it is rather singular apparently the elder must have been possessed with very poor judgment to begin with or you must have become in a few weeks an awfully bad man

well i dont know what to say but in as much as i have known you some little time â before you met orlean in the house where i write this i cannot conceive or realize how you could change so quickly but what is more to the point â i have known the august elder even longer than have you â know him since i have been large enough to know anybody and i have known him always to be as he is yet one wonders how such men can have the conscience to preach and tell people to live right to do right so they may be prepared to die right but somehow we take the elders subtle conduct down this way as a matter of course we think no more â i daresay not as much â of what he does in that way than we would the most common man in town but it is too bad that his daughter must suffer for his evil orlean is a good girl but she has been raised to regard that old father as a criterion of righteousness regardless of the life he does and always has lived

but withal honestly i do feel so sorry for you i am aware that this letter and the nature of its contents is unsolicited but it is and has been in my heart to say it i really feel that it is no more than honest to protest against in some manner the wrong that man is practicing but to the point

 the last time he was here and mama asked him about you and he was made angry because of it he remarked among the discredits he endeavored to pay the country and you that there was no church for her to attend i remarked that you had said you attended the white churches

thereupon he became very demonstrative he said you did attend the white churches and had taken her but that you went to the catholic church where there was of course no religion in the sense to which she had been raised i hardly knew how to reply to or counter this but i thought that if you had and she had belonged to the catholic church how easy it would be now for you to lay your cause before the priest and have it considered but if you did such before the ministers of his church â oh well i am saying too much

 and only now have i arrived at the event i choose to relate it is always so when one chooses to gossip to forget the things that may be of real interest well word has come that the elder was taken violently ill in chicago the other day and grave fears are held of his recovery i hear that he is very low and perhaps the lord might see fit to remove a stumbling block   

 i must close i am sure i have bored you with such a long letter and so much gossip but i have at least satisfied my own conscience so hoping that all comes out well with you in the end believe me to be  your dear friend jessie mansfield

it so happened that the exhausted jean baptiste turned to the hope that illness might claim his enemy and he exchanged letters with jessie mansfield regularly and after a time found her correspondence a great diversion

and so the summer passed near the last days of july the severe drought was broken but too late to benefit the crops which had been so badly burned by the drought he managed to get considerable land into winter wheat and the fall came on with only a crop of debts and overdue bills that made him regard the mail box dubiously

winter followed one of the coldest ever known and spring was approaching when jean baptiste decided to make his last attempt for a reunion with his wife

in all the months that had followed his previous trip he had planned that if he could only see her could only see her and be alone with her for a day they would abridge the chasm that had been forced because of the reverend that one had not obliged him by dying by any means but had regained his health in a measure so baptiste read in the letters he received from jessie however she wrote it seemed that something had come over him for he was not the same he had lost much of his great flesh wore a haggard expression and seemed to be weighted down with some strange burden

it was april again when at last he took the train for chicago for the last time he decided on the same mission that had taken him there twice before he planned now to exercise more discretion inasmuch as the reverend was as a rule always out of the city he trusted to fate that he would be cut this time the bitterness that had grown up in his heart toward the elder he feared might make him forget to observe the law of the land if he chanced to encounter that adversary so when he arrived in the great city he went about the task of seeing his wife under cover

he first visited a barber shop he happened into one near van buren on state street where lady barbers did the trimming he did not find them efficient and was glad when he left the chair he decided that he would act through mrs pruitt who he had heard from the fall before and who was being charged along with mrs mc carthy as being the cause of all the trouble

he had not written her that he was coming calculating that it would be best for her not to have too long to think it over upon leaving the barber shop he ventured up state street through the notorious section of the  old tenderloin  to taylor street and presently turned and discovered himself in the polk and dearborn street station

he found that slipping about the street under cover like a sneak thief was much against his grain and he was nervous

in all the months he had contemplated the trip he had taken great care not to let ethel or any of the family know in advance of his coming he wanted his wife the agony of living alone the dreaded suspense the long journey and the gradual breaking down of what he had built up played havoc with his nerves and he was trembling perceptibly when he took a seat in the station he encountered a man upon arrival there whom he had known years before and because he had been so intent on keeping out of sight the recognition by the other frightened him he managed to control himself with an effort and greeted the other casually however he was relieved when he recalled that the other knew nothing of his relations â not even that he had ever married

after he felt his nerves sufficiently calm he ventured to the telephone booth and secured mrs pruitts number he paused briefly before calling her to steady his nerves and then got her in due time

 hello mrs pruitt he called

hello came back and he caught the surprise in her voice  is it you she asked and he noted that her voice was trembling

yes he called back nervously do you recognize my voice  

 yes he heard and the uneasiness with which she answered discouraged him pie had great faith in mrs

pruitt notwithstanding the gossip that connected her name with the elders she was regarded as a woman of unusual ability and mental force she was speaking again in a very low tone of voice almost in a whisper

 listen said she  call this same number in about ten minutes understand yes do that ill explain later

he sat before the clock now in the station and watched the minutes pass they seemed like hours he was now aware that the strain of these months of grief and eternal mortification had completely unnerved him his composure was like that of an escaped convict with the guards near his heart beat so loud until he looked around in cold fear wondering whether those near heard it and all the while he sat in this nervous quandary he kept repeating over and over again  mrs pruitt mrs pruitt â surely even you have not gone back on me too oh mrs pruitt you cant understand what it means to me what i have sufferedâ the agony the disgrace â the hell he regarded the telephone booth before him and his eyes were like glass all the busy station was a hubbub after what seemed to him an eternal waiting he was slightly relieved to see that fifteen minutes had passed and he got up and slipped back into the booth and called mrs pruitt

yes im here jean she called and the reason i told you to call later was that your people â your fatherinlaw is right here in the house at this moment he was sitting right here by the phone when you called awhile ago so now you understand

 oh he cried his head swimming and everything grew dark around him after one long year of agony of eternal damnation one long year of waiting and suspense he had banked his chances and encountered his enemy the first thing right under the telephone he had been jean baptiste who had once been a strong brave and fearless man was now trembling from head to foot

 now jean he heard mrs pruitt  i understand everything you are here to see and get orlean if you can but you want to do so without them knowing anything about it and i agree with you you wish me to help you and i will ill do anything to right this terrible wrong but give me time to plan to think i in the meantime he is so near that it is not safe for me to talk with you any longer so you go somewhere and come back say in about an hour if he is still here i will say this is the wrong number get it  

yes mrs pruitt he replied controlling the storm of weakness that was passing over him  i get you

 very well until then

 until then he called and hung up the receiver

its the wrong number

jean baptiste had come eight hundred miles after one terrible year to the feet of his fatherinlaw and when he realized that such was the case upon hanging up the receiver his composure was gone bitter agony beyond description overwhelmed him when he came from the booth at the end of his brief conversation with mrs pruitt

never in his life had he been as miserable as he now was

it seemed to him that in the next hour he must surely die of agony he found a place in the station where he was very much alone and for a time gave up to the grief and misery that had come over him

 unless i find some diversion i will be unfit for anything but suicide he declared trying to see before him

out in the west all was wrong he was now loaded down with debt his interest was unpaid also his taxes his creditors for smaller amounts he had not even called upon to say that he was unable to meet his financial obligations he had tried being blind to everything but the instance of his wife he had just deliberately cast everything aside until he could have her that was it he had made himself believe that only was it necessary to see her alone and together they would fly back to the west he had not reckoned that his arch enemy would be lying like a great dog right at the door he was to enter

and now before he was hardly in the city he was all but confronted with his hypocritical bulk

 oh i can stand it no longer no no no he cried in agonizing tones the world to him was lost the strong shall be the weakest when it becomes so it is said and surely jean baptiste had come to it in this hour he had no courage he had no hope he had no plans

after minutes in which he reached nowhere minutes when all the manhood in him crept out and went away to hide he staggered to his feet he straightened his body and also his face he became an automaton he had decided to seek artificial stimulation thereupon he made his way into the main waiting room he looked about him as one in a daze and finally turned his face toward the entrance of the station when there he had arrived he hesitated and looked from right to left as he did so his mind went back to some years before when he first saw the city and had gone about its streets in search of work a block or two away he recalled clark street that part of it which had been notorious he recalled where one could go and see almost anything he wished

now he was a man was jean baptiste a man who had loved a wife as men should a man who had found a wife and a wifes comfort all he had longed for in life but that one he had taken as wife had fled she had left him to the world and all that was worldly he was breaking down under the strain and his manhood was for the time gone

he became as men are as men have been and he was at a place where he did not care he was alone in the world the prairies had not been good to him and he felt he must have rest oh rest

he stepped from the station and held himself erect with an effort he turned to his left and walked or rather ambledalong he did not know in particular where he was going but going somewhere he was he kept his face turned to the west and after many steps he came to a side street it was a narrow street and he recalled it vaguely it was called custom house place and its reputation for the worst was equalled by none even from where he stood the sound of ragtime music came to his ears from a gorgeous saloon across its narrow way

he listened to it without feeling no thrill or inspiration did it give him he turned into this street after some minutes and ambled along its narrow walkway as he went along from force of habit he studied the various forms of vice about in and out of its many ways he saw the familiar women the painted faces and the gorgeous eyes

he came presently to where negroes stood before a saloon

they too were of the type he understood characters with soft hands and soft skin and he knew they never worked

he turned into it a bar was before him and although for liquor he had never cared especially he could drink he went forward to the bar and ordered a cocktail he drank it slowly as he observed himself all haggard and worn in the bar mirror and as he did so he could see what was passing behind him a man sat in a small ante room near a door and he observed that men would pass by this man to a door opening obviously to a stairway beyond he wondered what was beyond he ordered another cocktail and drank it slowly studying those who passed back and forth through the door that the man opened with a spring he decided to venture thereforth

when he had drank his cocktail he wandered toward the door also as if he had been accustomed to entering it the door opened before him and he entered he found himself in a hallway with a flight of stairs before him and a closed and locked door on the stairway he stood regarding it and espied a bell presently this he approached and touched

the door was opened straightway and the flight of stairs continued to the landing above he looked up and beheld a woman standing at the top of the stairs who had seemingly opened the door by pressing a button he entered and approached her as he did so she turned and led him into a small room then into a larger room where sat many other women he was directed to a chair and became seated

he regarded all the women about wonderingly for to him none had said a word he might as well have been in a house of tombstones for they said naught to him and did not even look at him

he sat where he was for perhaps two minutes then he arose and walked to the door which he had entered and turned to look back into the room it was empty every woman had disappeared without a sound in a twinkling all except the woman who had admitted him she stood behind regarding him noncommittally

what is this place he inquired of her she looked up at him and he thought he caught something queer in her eyes but she replied in a pleasant tone why it is anything

 oh he echoed she continued to stand not urging him to go nor to stay he looked at her closely and saw that she was a white woman perhaps under thirty

 a sort of cabaret   he suggested

 yes she replied in the same pleasant tone of voice

 a sort of cabaret

 so you serve drinks here then  

 yes we serve drinks here

where

 well and she turned and he followed her to another room apparently the abode of some one included in the furniture there was a table and two chairs and while he became seated in one she took the other and her eyes asked what he wished

 a cocktail he said

she went to a tube and called the order

 and something for yourself he said

she did as he directed and duplicated his order she came back to where he sat by the table and sat before him without words but a pleasant demeanor

 heres luck he said when the drinks had been brought up

 same to you she responded and both drank

he told her then to bring some beer and when the order had been given he bethought himself of his errand instantly he became oblivious of all about him and the old agony again returned he stretched across the table and was not aware that he groaned he did not hear the woman who stood over him when she returned with the beer he was living the life of a few minutes beforeâ misery

 here is your beer she said but he made no move

presently she touched him lightly upon the shoulder whereupon he sat erect and looked around him bewilderingly  your beer she said and he regarded her oddly

 what is the matter   she said now and regarded him inquiringly

 i was thinking he replied

of something unusual she ventured

yes he answered wearily of something unusual

she observed him more closely she saw his haggard face his tired worn expression and beneath it all she caught that sad distraction that had robbed him of his composure in some way she really wished to help him here was an unusual case sheâ this woman who was for sale became seated again and regarding him kindly she said  you are in trouble

he sighed but said no word

 in great trouble

he sighed again and handed her the money for the beer

 i wish i could help you she said thoughtfully and her eyes fell upon the table his hat lay there and she saw therein the name of the town where it had been purchased

you dont live here she suggested then

 no he mumbled trying to dispel the heaviness that was over him if he could just forget that was it if he could forget and be normal be as he had been until that evil genius had come back again into his life  no he repeated  i dont live here

and â you â you â have just come she said her voice was kind is it â it â a woman

he nodded slowly

 oh she echoed  your wife perhaps 

he nodded again

 oh

they were both silent then for some moments he struggling to forget she wondering at the strange circumstances

has some one come between you she inquired after a time

 yes he whispered

 on thats bad she uttered sympathetically  it is bad to come between a man and his wife and youâ she paused briefly then bit her lip in slight vexation then observed him with head bent before her it was rather unusual and that was what had vexed her could it mean anything what a woman like her thought of or sympathized

yet she was moved by the condition of the stranger before her she felt she had to say something and you â you dont look like a bad fellow at all he looked up at her with expressionless eyes she returned the look and then went on  you have such honest frank and truthful eyes honestly i feel sorry for you

 oh thank you he said gratefully then to have some one â even such a woman look at him so kindly to say words of condolence was like water to the thirsty he thought then again of that other and the father that was hers who at that moment sat in the company of another mans wife he recalled that mrs pruitt said that he had been in town for several days and every day since he had been there naturally this man courted another mans wife openly yet was ready with all the force in him the moment jean baptiste sought his godgiven mate to rise up in pious dignity to oppose him wrath became his now and his eyes narrowed in the moment he wanted to go forth and slay the beast who was making this he rose slightly she saw it and her eyes widened she reached out and touched his hand where it gripped the table

 please dont do that she said and in her voice there was a slight appeal

he regarded her oddly and then understood he sank back listlessly in the seat and sighed

 poor boy she said  some one has done you a terrible wrong it is strange how the world is formed and the ill fortune it brings to some i can just see that some one has done you a terrible wrong and that when you rose now you would have gone forth and killed him

he regarded her with gratitude in his eyes and the expression upon his face told her that she had spoken truly

 but try to refrain from that desire oh its justifiable it seems but then when we stop to think that we will never feel the same afterward about it its best to try to forget our grief you are young and there are worlds of nice girls who would love and make for you happiness

some day that will be yours in spite of all so please just think and â dont kill the one who has done this

you are awfully kind he whispered he felt rather odd of all places this was not where men came to be consoled indeed but herein he had gotten what he could not get on vernon avenue where church members were supposed to dwell he arose now  he reached out his hand and she took it  i dont quite understand what has happened but you have helped me he reached into his pocket and withdrew some coins and this he handed her

she drew back her hand but he insisted

yes take it i understand your life here but you have helped me more than you can think i was awfully discouraged when i came almost was i to something rash take it and try to remember that you have helped some one he squeezed her hand and she cast her eyes down and as she did so he saw a tear fall to the floor

he turned quickly then and left

he retraced his steps toward the polk street station and to the booth he had been inside of an hour before he called mrs pruitt and after a time came back over the wire in a low meaning voice its the wrong number

hrs pruitt effects a plan he had some friends who lived on federal street and to their home he decided to go he thought of the day when he had married the man ran on the road his wife he had known long her name being mifdred mildred merrill she had been invited to his wedding but had not attended when he had seen her a year later and had asked her why she had not attended she replied that she had been unable to purchase a suitable wedding gift

her parents had been lifelong friends of his parents and he had been provoked because she stayed away she and her husband had been quietly married in the court house and had since lived happily together

 oh jean mildred cried when the door opened and she saw his face  we have just been talking of you as she swung the door wide for him to enter  mama she calledhere is jean baptiste her mother came hurriedly forward grasped his hand and exchanged a meaning look with mildred

and you are back again she said as all three became seated

 yes he said and sighed

 its awful commented her mother isnt it the truth oh my god how can those people be so mean  cried mildred

 hes in chicago said her mother

yes said mildred and ill bet right over at mrs pruitts every day

he wouldnt be likely to be home commented her mother  he returns as a rule along about midnight the two laughed then and regarded the man

 you ought to give her up jean said mildred  a woman that has no more will power than she has isnt fit â isnt worth the grief you are spending

 yes mildred it does seem so but she is my wife and somehow i feel that i should give her every chance

the case is unusual commented her mother again

the man has a reputation for such actions â rather he has been known to persecute and does persecute the preachers that are under his dictation in the church but that such would extend to the possible happiness of his own children indeed it hardly seems credible

 vanity mama reverend mc carthy is regarded as the most vain man in the church jean here has never flattered himâtickled his vanity and this is the price hes paying

 well said her mother  such as this cant keep up

some day hes going to be called on to pay â and the debt will be large

 understand that he aspires for the bishopric in the convention next month said mildred shucks exclaimed her mother thats all bluff

he seeks to grab off a little cheap notoriety around chicago before he goes to conference there is as much chance of his being even entered as a candidate for the office as there is of me

thats what i think from mildred

rascal stiff and let orlean go and i dont wonder that if i was a man that i wouldnt have done so myself

 if i were that weak and could see things as i do now i would want my husband to shoot me im getting out of patience with orleans weakness mildred added

 well said baptiste at this point  it is now eleven and i will call up mrs pruitt to go ahead with certain plans that i have in view have you a phone 

just outside said mildred and opened the door

he got mrs pruitt directly and again came back over the wire  its the wrong number  but during the recent conversation he had forgotten for the moment the  counter sign and continued calling back frantically he heard again and again  the wrong number you have the wrong number suddenly he caught on and as suddenly hung up the receiver with a jerk

he didnt go to the keystone that night he felt as though he wanted to be near some friends accordingly he went to miss rankins she was glad to see him and like all his friends knew his troubles and welcomed him

you will awaken me early tomorrow â say six oclock he asked and upon being assured she would he went to bed

all the night through his sleep was fitful he saw gorgeous processions that frightened him and then again he was thrilled but never did he seem to feel just right

then he saw his enemy he dreamed that he came to him and kissed him he heard him saying kind words and saw his wife by his side they were back in the west and his wife was returning from a visit he was aroused and jumped to his feet he looked at the clock and the time was half past five all the agony of the day before came  what are your plans jean  her mother now inquired of baptiste who sat in a sort of stupor listening to their talk

 i am trying to get to see her without the old mans knowledge and he told them of his conversation with mrs pruitt

 isnt that a wife now exclaimed mildred  afraid to meet the man she has married

 orlean and old lady mc carthy have no voice in that house said her mother first its the reverend and then follows ethel

and it hardly seems credible when one knows how he has always flirted with other women said mildred

 i asked orlean the last time i saw her said mildred again what was the matter was jean mean to her or had he neglected her she said no that he was just as good to her as he could be but that she could not stay out in that wild country that it would impair her health and she just couldnt stay out there and that was all

 reverend mc carthy said her mother

of course but that is one thing i have observed

they have never got her to lie as they have done and say that he mistreated her from mildred

 its to be regretted that she has not more will to stand up for what she knows to be right said her mother you have taken it up with the right person jean

said mildred  if any one can help you in such a delicate undertaking it is mrs pruitt she has more influence with that old rascal than his wife in fact his wife from what i hear has no influence at all

 well jean said mildreds mother  you are to be admired for the patience you have exercised with orlean

the average man would have knocked that old white headed back with a rush and he was overwhelmed thereupon he got him up and dressing quickly hurried out of the house and caught a car to where mrs pruitt lived on the west side in the basement of an apartment building of which her husband was janitor

he estimated that the other would go home during the night and early morning would be the time to form some plan of action it seemed a long way to the west side and it was after seven when he arrived there

he was greeted by mrs pruitt and the expression upon her face did not disappoint him

 now jean she said  i have prepared you some breakfast and you must eat first for ill wager that not a bite have you eaten since you talked with me yesterday

 it is so mrs pruitt said he recalling then that eating had not occurred to him for the last eighteen hours or more

well said she becoming seated he left here at almost midnight and i have been planning just what to do that you may see orlean i certainly should have little patience with a girl that has no more gumption than orlean but since i know that she gets it from her mother who has not as much as a chicken i have accepted the inevitable

 now to begin with if i called up and had her come over here he would come with her of course and also maybe ethel and you know what that would mean it is so unusual that such a thing could be but that is reverend mc carthy he has always been this way and i could not change him you erred when you didnt flatter him but that you did not have to do and i dont blame you he has done you dirty and some day hes going to pay for it i wouldnt be surprised if he did not soon either he is a disturbed man he is never has he been happy as he was before he brought that girl home the crime he has committed is weighing on him and i wouldnt wonder if he wouldnt be glad to have orlean go back with you the only thing is that he has been associated with a hard headed lot of negro preachers so long until his disposition is ingrained he actually couldnt be as he should he would let orlean go back to you but he would determine on a lot of ceremony and something else that you are ill fitted to forego so the best way as i can see is for you to meet orlean somewhere and there reason it out with her

she paused briefly then and was thoughtful

 she loves you as her mother loves in a simple weak way but what is a love like that worth  in truth while i admire your courage and desire to uphold the sacredness of the marriage vow you ought to get a divorce and marry a girl with some will and force

 i realize so mrs pruitt but i am determined to live with orlean and protect her if it is within my power

 i understand your convictions and sentiments jean and admire you for it if the world contained more men like you the evil of divorce would lessen but on the other hand as long as it contains men like the reverend and women like orlean there will always be ground for divorce

 but every man should exhaust all that is in him for what he feels is right shouldnt he mrs pruitt spoke baptiste

 of course she said somewhat absently she looked quickly at him then and her eyes brightened with an inspiration

 by the way jean she said  you remember mrs

merley  

 who blanches mother 

 the same

 most sure why 

 well said mrs pruitt  i have been thinking shes a friend of yours a good friend although you might not have known it

 it is news to me â that is directly

 well she is and has been very much wrought up over the reverends treatment of you

 indeed

yes it is so you see moreover she is a distant relation of mrs mc carthys and is fairly welltodo

 so i have understood

 yes they are and mc carthys sort of look up to them

yes

 mrs merley is independent and hasnt much patience with the elder

 so

 no and for that reason he admires her

 indeed

yes and she was over there and sort a bawled them out over what they were doing understand that she just spat it in the elders face and he had to take it

well

 yes you see blanche got married this last summer and didnt quite please her mother

 oh is that so  

 yes mary merley is a friend of mine and frankly she almost told me that she wished blanche had married some one on your order

oh   

 yes she did and meant it she admired your type and i know she would have been more fully pleased in such an event

he was silent

 anyhow i have planned that it will be through her that you and orlean may be brought together

he was attentive

 but before you go into it my request is that my name shall be left out

his eyes asked a question that she answered

 it is so while mary is a friend of mine she has certain habits that i dont like

he regarded her more questioningly

 i will say no more

his face blanched and then his mind went back two years orlean had made just such a remark he was sorry

 so i dont want you to mention me since it would do no good

 i understand

i want her to have the credit for whatever success might come of th  yes

and my plans are that you go over there and see her

 yes

jolly her a little and dont let on that you are aware that she admires you

 very well

 get her to call orlean up and suggest a show

 i get you

 and there you are

 your plan is simple but practical and he smiled upon her thankfully

he was standing now he held out his hand she grasped it and bending forward kissed him

 be careful jean she said  and dont do anything rash

when he went his way he understood

mrs merley the april morn shone beautifully over chicago when jean baptiste came from the basement of the apartment where mrs pruitt lived and had bade godspeed to him it was election day over all the state a preferential primary for the purpose of choosing delegates to the g o p convention to be held two months later and when jean baptiste thought of it he understood what had brought the reverend to the city

baptiste arrived at mrs merleys an hour after he left mrs pruitt went directly to the number and pulled the bell it was responded to by a young woman he did not know but she assured him that the one he sought was in and after seating him in the parlor hurried to tell mrs

merley

she came at once all joy and gladness and greeted him with a shake of both hands and kissed him into the bargain

 sit right down sit right down she said profusely

 and oh my how glad i am to see you  she smiled upon him happily proving how glad she really was and he was moved

 and you came to see me she continued  you could have called on no one who would have been more delighted to see you

you do me too much honor mrs merley said he gratefully

 indeed she returned  i could not do you enough

 i hadnt hoped for so much kindness i am sure

 but jean you dont know how much i have thought about you in the last two years and i have longed to talk with you

 oh really but i thought i was forgotten by every body in chicago

 you have never been forgotten by us and especially have we talked of you in this last year 

he was silent though he felt he understood her reference

 some dirty sinner ought to be in torment

and still he did not speak

 oh i know all that has been done to you jean she went on tenderly

 your words give me much relief mrs merley

 i wish they could give you more it is my wish that an opportunity could be given me to help you

he straightened now was the time to state his mission

but she was speaking again  i spoke my sentiments to his face the rascal all his dirty life has been given to making people miserable wherever he could

jean said nothing but was listening nevertheless

 he has been a rascal for thirtyfive years and has made that simple cousin of mine he married the goat she paused to get her breath  i saw orlean not long ago and asked her where her will was or if she had any

he was attentive always he liked to hear her

 she of course tried to stand up for that arch hypocrite but i waived that aside said i to her orlean i could never believe you if you said jean baptiste abused mistreated or neglected you she looked down when i had spoken and then said evenly  no jean did not do any of those things then said i why do you live apart from him the man you married where is your sense of duty  but mrs merley she tried to protest

 i just couldnt live out there in that wilderness it was too lonesome oh orlean i said disgustingly do you expect me to believe that and if even i believed you how could i respect you   but that is it jean here is this family posing as among the best negro families in chicago but with no more regard for what is morally right than the worst thief indeed no thief would do what that man is doing

he mumbled something inaudible she was out to talk so he heard her on  i understand the whole line up and their vain shielding of that old rascal just because you didnt lie to him and become a hypocrite like he himself is everybody near him must bow to him and tell him he is great else he will use what influence is his to  get even so thats the whole output he took her away from you because he raised her as he has willed my cousin his wife to subserve to him

and now he goes around here with all that dirty affected piety and wants people to sympathize with him in his evil

she paused again for breath and then he spoke  i am glad to know you have taken the view of this you have mrs merley he said slowly  and i am wondering therefore whether you would be willing to help me in a certain christian cause

why jean why ask me  you must know that i would help you in any way i could

he then told her just what he had planned she interrupted him at times with little bursts of enthusiasm and there was no hesitancy on her part

anything jean anything you dont know how anxious i am and how glad i am to have the opportunity

the only thing i regret is that you ever married such a weakling you might have heard that blanche is married 

 i have he replied  i trust she is happy

 well said the other slowly  she appears to be withal

and for that reason i suppose i should be thankful but she did not quite please me in her selection

 oh he echoed

 no she said slowly and as if she felt the disappointment keenly  she did not her husband it is true is good to her but he did not come up to my hope yet and it is singular she said thoughtfully  to think that a man with all you possess financially and mentally should get  in  as you have she paused again a little embarrassed and then pursued  i wish blanche had a husband of your disposition and attainments

 blanche i thought was a sweet girl he said reflectively

 and a good girl said mrs merley  i would have given anything to have had her marry a promising young farmer of your order and be now living in the west

 i love the west and had hoped others would be loving it too he said ruefully

 he came back here after his first visit and sitting right where you are now said that you was one of the races most progressive young men he added to this everywhere he had half a chance and eulogized you to the highest it happened that the minister who married you was here and he too very much admired you and voiced the same to the reverend that old devil just swelled up like a big frog with vanity three months later he comes back here and to seek to justify his action he spreads the town with lies that nobody believes

the other shifted his position

 well jean she said now more soberly  just what shall i do

if you would not mindâ

 oh dont say that

 very well mrs merley i would like you to call her up and suggest a matinee

 why not just go to one 

 that would please me if you would condescend 

 id be glad to go and in view of the circumstances i think it would be a suggestive idea let her get used to your presence again without coming directly to the point at once

 a capital idea i agree 

 call her up and ask her to come over and go with you to the matinee

 that is the plan and i understand

 i will appreciate your kindness said he heartily she arose then and advancing toward him embraced him impulsively

thereupon she went to the telephone and succeeded in getting his wife on the wire he heard her answer the call and laugh over something humorous mrs merley said

his heart beat faster and he was conscious that he was more hopeful than he had been for a long time

 yes   mrs merley was saying  i want you to go with me to a mating  be here at one fortyfive  yes i have the tickets    and youll not be late

she was standing before him again and her face was lighted up with the joy of what she had accomplished he was grateful and rose to thank her whereupon she embraced him again the next moment she went quickly up the stairs to prepare for the occasion

 you may come upstairs too jean she invited  and from the front room there you can watch for yours

 oh mrs merley you make me happier than i have been for a long time he said and almost was he emotional

 and i have a nice spare bedroom for you and her tonight and tomorrow she is yours jean baptiste waited and watched and then suddenly he heard a voice it was that of the girl who had admitted him who was also watching

here she comes she cried excitedly jean baptiste looked quickly out of the window and up the street and saw his wife coming leisurely toward the house wherein he was sitting

oh merciful god close thou mine eyes

reverend newton justine mc carthy had once lived in peoria illinois and was well acquainted with the late robert ingersoll moreover he had admired the noted orator and although he had not the courage in truth he believed as ingersoll believed and because he did and was forced to keep his true convictions a secret while he preached the gospel he did not believe he had grown to hate almost all people but n j mc carthy was not aware of this fact himself

ever since he brought his daughter home and had thereby parted her from the man she married he had never been the same always he was troubled with something he could not understand his dreams were bad

the awful sensations he very often experienced while in slumber grew so annoying that at times he found that he was almost afraid to sleep then a persistent illness continually knocked at his door the truth of it was that he was battling with a conscience he had for years crucified

but it would persist so deep had he sowed the habits he followed and so intrenched were the roots of these habits until it was no easy task to uproot them

he had left mrs pruitt near midnight of the day when jean baptiste had arrived on his trip in a last effort to secure his wife the family had retired before he arrived home and having some business in the rear of the house he passed through the room which contained the bed wherein his daughter orlean lay in peaceful slumber when he was returning he paused briefly to observe the face of the sleeping girl in the moonlight peacefully she slept and for the first time in his life he saw therein something he had never seen before he felt his flesh and wondered at the feeling that was come over him

it seemed that he was asleep but positively he was awake

he was awake and looking into the sleeping face of his daughter but if he was awake what was it he saw

surely not but as he stood over her he thought he could see her eyes open and look at him strangely regard him in a way she had never done before and as she looked at him he thought she raised her hand that lay under the cover and with her forefinger leveled she pointed at him

in the trance he imagined he could hear her voice she called him  father  and betimes he answered  yes daughter

 where is my husband  he gave a start he thought he caught at something and then he heard her again  you have sent him away out of my life and the day is coming when you will be called upon to answer for your sins

he thought he was trembling all about him was turmoil he saw the people the friends of the family and all the people he had preached to in thirty years and all were pointing an accusing finger at him and cut of the chaos he heard them crying shame oh shame that you should he so evil so vile such a hypocrite and let your evil fall upon your own daughter he saw then the wife he had taken from speed he saw that one in his misery he saw him sink and renounce from weakness the sentiments he had started in the world to teach he saw him struggle vainly and then saw him fall low lower until at last the flames of hell had swallowed him up  merciful god he cried and he was sure he staggered was it i who brought all this but before he could recover the procession kept passing

behind speed came the wife he had robbed him of she carried in her arms a baby that he had given her by the hand she led the other illegitimate offspring there they were the innocents that had no name he saw the bent head of the woman and saw the grief and anguish in her face he saw her suddenly stop and fall and while she lay upon the earth her children were taken and grew up surrounded with all that was bad and evil he saw one suddenly dead while still a boy murdered by the companions he kept he saw his young body in the morgue and before all this had passed he saw this ones mother again the woman he had fooled in the depth of the  tenderloin

he saw her a solicitor and he could hear himself groan in agony

the years passed and while he grew older other things came and went a train of evil deeds he had committed and at last came his own daughter he saw her passing and when he saw her face the agony therein frightened him

was it so had he done that too was he the cause of what he saw in this girls face suddeny he saw her change and in the distance he saw jean baptiste and all he had suffered  oh merciful god close thou mine eyes

he thought he could hear himself call but his eyes would not close and the one to whom he appealed appeared to be deaf and the procession continued

he saw orlean stretch her hands out to baptiste and he came toward her with arms outstretched and he thought he heard a voice the voice of the man jean baptiste and the words he cried rang in his ears  my wife oh orlean my wife come unto meâ but lo when the two had came close and the man would have held her to him a shadow suddenly rose between them and shut them out from each others sight he thought he raised his voice to call out to the one of the shadow and when he called to him and the one of the shadow turned and behold it was himself  he suddenly came out of the trance to see orlean sitting up in bed he caught his breath and held his hand over his heart as he heard her voice  papa is that you  my how you frightened me i â

and then she quickly stopped she had started to say  i thought it was jean for in truth she had dreamed of him and that he had come for her and she was glad and when she arose to go she had awakened to find her father standing over her  yes yes my dear he said rather awkwardly  it is i i stopped to look at you and seemed to forget myself

he hurried away then and up the stairs to his room and went to bed but it was near morning when he fell asleep

it so happened when jean baptiste had gone upstairs to call on mildred and her mother he had knocked at the door below a man lived there whom he had known in the years gone by and who had educated himself to be a lawyer his name was towles joseph towles always before when he was in the city he had called on towles and his family and when their door rose before him on the impulse he had forgotten all else but to greet them he pushed the bell and no sooner had he done so than he recalled his mission and that he was avoiding his acquaintances he quickly passed upstairs but not before mrs towles had opened the door and caught a glimpse of him passing

she was aware of his difficulty and had pretended to sympathize with him but mrs towles was a gossipy penurious woman and did not get along with her neighbors overhead so when she saw jean baptiste passing up the stairs and hurrying from her without speaking she at once became angry and with it apprehensive she went back to where she had been working over some sewing she was thoughtful and then regarded the clock

 i wonder what he is doing here   she mused to herself and then she suddenly brightened with an inspiration his wife of course she cried and fell to thinking further

she happened to be a close friend of a certain lady who lived next door to the mc carthys on vernon avenue and it was to her that she decided to pay a visit on the morrow and of course she would discuss the fact that she had gotten a glimpse of jean baptiste and would try to find out what she could

it was the following afternoon that she found the time to visit her friend in vernon avenue she passed by the house wherein lived the mc carthys and made up her mind to call there later in company with her friend to hear the news

 why mrs towles  cried her friend when she saw her face upon opening the door  how nice it was of you to call when i was not expecting you such a pleasant surprise whereupon they kissed in womanly fashion she took a seat by the window for she wished to look into the street the other took a chair just facing her and together they fell to talking as they sat there orlean suddenly came out of the house next door down the steps and passed before mrs towles gaze as she went up the street to wabash avenue to fill the engagement with mrs merley

 oh look cried mrs towles pointing to the figure of the other  there goes orlean 

the other strained her neck and said  mm

 and i saw her husband last night

 you did  exclaimed the other in great surprise she had a grown daughter who was very much accomplished but unmarried so she took a delight in such cases as jean baptistes   

 i did replied the other making herself comfortable and getting ready to relate his strange actions  well well now  echoed the other all attention

 yes said mrs towles and then related all that had passed which was not anything but catching a glimpse of baptiste as he had disappeared up the steps

 i dont think they know next door that he is in town

suggested the other dont they

 why not likely you know the last time he was here they wouldnt admit him  they eyed each other jubilantly and then went on

 then we ought to go right over and inform them at once said mrs towles

 just what we should do agreed the other

and so it happened that the reverend learned that jean baptiste was in the city but for once he was not excited

somehow he hoped that jean would meet orlean and he knew then that she had gone out for that purpose he knew that she was supposed to go to a matinee and he realized from previous statements that mrs merley was the go between

so he took no part in the gossip that followed nor did he for once sigh in self pity

perhaps after all he had decided not to interfere

 love you â god i hate you

the play they witnessed that afternoon was an emotional play and in a degree it sufficed to arouse the emotion in all three the meeting between orlean and her husband had been without excitement as if she had been expecting him she welcomed him and they had proceeded directly to a play at the studebaker theater downtown

when they were again in the street they went to another theater where they purchased tickets to witness robert mantell in richelieu and later taking a surface car on state street proceeded to a restaurant near thirtyfirst street where they had supper after which they retired to the home of mrs merley of course that one left them to themselves in due time and in a few minutes they were engaged in congenial conversation after a time jean caught her hand and despite the slight protest she made he succeeded in drawing her up on his knee

 i ought not to sit here she said

why not orlean he said kindly placing his arm about her waist fondly  because

 because what dear 

she looked at him quickly he met her eyes appealingly she looked away and then down at her toes  how you have freshened he commented

 do you think so  she returned inclined to be sociable

 it is quite noticeable and you are better looking when you are so

 oh you flatter me she chimed

 i would like to flatter my wife

she did not reply to this she appeared to be comfortable and he went on

 dont you know that i have longed to see you and that it has not been just right that i could not

and still she made no answer

 i never want to live so again i want you always orlean

 when did you leave home   she asked now

 a couple of days ago

 and how long have you been here 

 i came yesterday afternoon

 and when to mrs merleys  

 this morning

she was thoughtful then indeed they were getting along better than he had hoped there remained but one thing more if he could persuade her to stay the night at mrs merleys and not insist on going home if he could keep her out of her fathers sight until morning he would have no more worry that indeed was his one point of uneasiness keeping her out of her fathers sight he recalled how he had refrained from buying a revolver when he left home it would not have been safe after all that had passed between himself and her father for him to have anything of the kind about and he was glad now that he had been sensible

he drew his wifes head down turned her face to his and kissed her lips he caught the sigh that passed her lips he saw her eyebrows begin to contract what was passing in her mind duty then to whom

he kissed her again and caressed her fondly this meant much to him he told her so then too

 it has been very hard on me wife for you to have stayed away a whole year awfully hard it was never my plans or intention for such to be he was full up now

he wanted to talk a long time with her if they could just retire and talk far into the night as they had done in the eleven months that had been theirs

his confidence was growing all that was expedient now he feft sure was to keep the reverend out of it until morning by that time no further effort on his part would be necessary

 do you love me orlean   he said now drawing her face close to his again

she made no reply audibly but she seemed to be struggling with something within herself in truth she did not want to say that she did and she would not tell him she did not she let her arm unconsciously encircle his neck her hand found his head and stroked his hair while she was mentally meditative

in the meantime his head rested against her breast and he could hear the beating of her heart

 oh my wife he cried intended for himself but she heard it it aroused her her emotion began to assert itself

how long would it take for her to be his mate again at this rate

 how is everything back home  she asked as if seeking a change he hesitated she looked down into his face to see why he did not answer directly he caught her eyes and she could see that he was not wishing to tell her something

what is the matter jean she asked now slightly excited and anxious

 oh nothing he replied he wanted to tell her the truth all the truth but it was not yet time he feared until she had given up to him he decided to withhold anything serious

 there is something jean of that i am sure she insisted shifting where she could see his face more clearly

 if there is anything wife i would discuss it later

nowâ i can think of but one thing and that is you

whereupon he caressed her again fondly she sighed then and her emotion was becoming more perceptible

you are going back home with me tomorrow dear

he dared to say presently

for answer she shifted uneasily and then her eyes espied the clock on the wall it was fivethirty

 i think i should call up home she said thoughtfully

he caught his breath and trembled perceptibly she regarded him inquiringly

and here again we must remark about jean baptiste in the year of misery of agony and suffering in general he had endured he had settled upon one theory and that was that if he and his wife were to ever live together again and be happy the family were to be kept out of it perhaps if this could have been forgotten by him in this moment we would not have had this story to tell but when she mentioned her folks all that he had wished to avoid â all that he felt he must avoid came before him as he saw it now if she called her father they would never live together again he was nervous when he anticipated the fact

he started and took on unconsciously a fearsome expression

 please dont orlean he said beseechingly

 dont what  she asked apprehensive of something she did not like

 call your father he said he wanted to tell her that if she called her father it would mean the end of everything for them but he withheld this

 now i wish him to know where i am she said protestingly and arose from his knee she stood away from where he sat hesitatingly in that moment she was not aware that she stood between duty and subservience as she saw it she forgot from her training that there was a duty she only remembered that she was obedient obedient to the father who had reared her so to be

it was the psychological moment in their union near her the husband that she had taken regarded her uneasily

he had come to her to do the duty that was his to do

they were estranged because of one thing and one thing only and that was her father the man her husband would never yield to and as she hesitated betwen obedience to one and duty toward the other her life her love and future was in the balance

which

 orlean she heard now from the lips of her husband

 listen before you go to the  phone he became suddenly calm as he said this  i married you two years gone now for better or for worse and  until death do us part that was the vow that i took and also you ive done my best by you under the circumstances i gave you a home and bed that you left i gave you my love and am willing to give you my life if that be necessary but orlean i didnt contract to observe the ideas and be subservient to the opinion of others to force me to regard this is to do me a grave injustice you cannot imagine appreciate maybe how humiliating it is to be placed in such a position i cannot explain it with you standing impatiently before me as you are i have come here to try and have you discuss this matter with me from a practical point of view surely having taken me as your godgiven mate you owe me that

you force me to honor and respect certain personsâ

 dont you she cried  dont you insinuate my father she advanced toward him threateningly in her excitement and all sense of duty was gone only obedience to the one who had made it so remained that she should rally to the support of his adversary displaced his composure he had hoped to have her reason it out with him and he had prayed that he be given a little time and then all would be well he was aware that she was unequal to a womans task not one woman in a thousand he knew would place a father before a husband but his wife was different she had been trained to be devoutly subservient to her father for that reason he was willing to be patient â he had been patient but at the same time he had suffered much and her love and obedience to his worst enemy â even if it was her father unfitted him for that with which he was now confronted he was fast losing his composure likewise his patience nothing in the world should stand between him and his wife he became excited now but calmed long enough to say  go ahead or come to me there are two things a woman cannot be at the same time and he waved his hand toward her resolutely  a wife to the man she has married and a daughter to her father with this statement he sank back into the chair from which he had partly risen he had said the last statement with such forceful logic that it made her stop pause uneasily and then suddenly she straightened and turning went to the telephone

but when she called over the wire to her father all the continued to lay as he was and then somebody pulled the bell vigorously mrs merley went to it opened it and let some one in he looked up through half closed eyes to see the reverend standing over him in that instant he saw his wife dash past him and fall into the others arms

he heard her saying words of love while he was aware that the other pacified her with soft words they took no notice of the man at their feet

and then he saw them open the door while the others stood about in awe while the door was open he caught a glimpse of the street outside â and of glavis on the sidewalk below

the next instant the door closed softly behind them and she went out of his life as a wife forever

a strange dream when the others had gone jean baptiste rolled over again upon the floor and was conscious that one eye was closed and swollen filled with blood from a wound inflicted by his wife just below it he rose to a sitting posture presently and looked around him he was in the hall and when he looked through the open door into the parlor he saw mrs merley stretched on the settee before him weeping he staggered to his feet and went toward her

she looked up when he approached and dried her eyes

 you spoiled things jean she accused and he voted the disappointment in her voice and also detected a note of impatience

 yes i admit i did mrs merley and im sorry â for you

 for me she repeated not understanding his import

 yes he replied wearily for you

 but â but â why â for me 

 well he said with a sigh  it had to be as it was i wanted her but it would have been disaster in the end on his account because i could never have brought myself to honor him and to have lived with her i should have been forced to â at least pretended to do so and that would have been worse still

she was thoughtfully silent then for some time then she regarded him closely and said as if to herself  well i fear you are right yes i know you are when i recall how she abused you a while ago gracious i did not know that it was in orlean

 nor did i he said his face covered with his hands

 he made her that way through the influence he has exerted over her evil influence i have a feeling that there will come a day when that influence will work the other way she said musingly he will be the victim and the punishment will be severe

both were silent for a time and nothing but the ticking of the clock on the mantel disturbed the quiet he presently raised his head and in so doing uncovered his face

it was dark and distorted swollen a great deal and one of his eyes was closed she saw it then for the first time

 my god jean she exclaimed arising and hurrying to him your face is swollen almost beyond recognition

why my dear you are in a dreadful fix  she stood over him scarcely knowing just what to do then she regained her composure she caught at his arm as she cried  come with me quick he arose and followed her upstairs and into the bedroom she had prepared for him and orlean in a corner there was a little basin and to this she led him she then had him hold his face over the basin while she carefully bathed it this done she asked him to go to bed while she went downstairs returning presently with liniments and towels and bathed his wounds again and bandaged his face carefully

 now jean she said kindly  i will leave you but you will do this favor which i ask of you 

he turned his face toward her

 dont advise mr merley about what has occurred here tonight she said

 i understand he replied quietly thereupon she left him to himself

at the vernon avenue home of the mc carthys the house was in an orgy of excitement when the reverend had been advised regarding his soninlaws presence in the city he recalled the seance he had experienced the night before when the women came he was preparing to go to the west side for his daily visit with mrs pruitt but upon this advice he desisted and decided to remain home

when the mongers had taken their gossip from his presence he fell into deep thought for the first time since he had precipitated the trouble he saw the situation clearly

he was aware that his act by this time had helped nobody had made no one happy or satisfiedânot even himself

almost he agreed with himself then that he had miscalculated jean baptiste was willing apparently to forego his wifes loss and the loss of her homestead before he would do as the elder had planned and estimated he would his conscience was disturbed he recalled the unpleasant nights he had endured in the last few months he recalled that while orlean always pretended to him that she was satisfied for the first time in his life he saw that it was due to the training the subservience to his will and not to her own convictions

he arose from his seat and walked the floor in meditation habit however had become such a force with him that he could hardly resist the impulse to commit some action to rush to mrs merleys and make himself conspicuous he struggled between impulse and conscience and neither won fully after an hour however he reached this decision he would not go to or call up mrs merley

he would just leave it to them to solve and if they should finally reach some agreement between themselves he would not stand in the way when he had reached this conclusion he went into the street and was surprised at the relief he felt not for months had he enjoyed a walk as much as he did that one

but while newton justine mc carthy had struggled with his conscience and at last found solace in admitting at this late hour to what he should have done two years before he had failed to reckon with other features that asserted themselves later he had not estimated that if jean baptiste sought his wife secretly it must have been because he wished to avoid him he failed to see that this man had suffered bitterly through his evil machinations he failed moreover to appreciate that his training of orlean to the subservient attitude would prevent her from returning to her husband or reaching any agreement with him until she had first ascertained that such would be agreeable to her father

had he so reckoned the scene just related might not have occurred

it was while they were sitting at supper that the telephone rang when the conversation ensued the reverend sought not only to promulgate good will by leaving it to jean baptiste but he thought also to encourage him by inviting him to the house and in this he meant well

but behind him stood ethel she caught the gist of excitement and instantly began to scream

 get orlean go get my sister dont let that man have her owee at the top of her voice she yelled and glavis and her mother had to hold her some friends were having dinner with them and they now stood toward the rear uncertain whether to leave or remain and heard all that passed

the reverend was laboring frantically to get an answer over the phone and it was at this moment that orlean had gone frantic and was abusing her husband

in the excitement ethel kept up her tirade at the top of her voice and in the end the reverend followed by glavis had gone to mrs merleys

they had now returned and ethel was pacified the visitors had departed to spread the gossip and all but ethel was downcast orlean in unspoken remorse had retired while the reverend fully conscious at last of what his interposition had brought was regretful but not openly and the others not knowing that he had that day repented sat at their distance and tried to form no conclusion

it is overâ all over cried orlean now in the bed

and as i have done all my life i have failed at the most crucial moment oh merciful god what can you do with a weak woman like i it has been i all along who has made misery for myself for him and for all those near me i i i that i could have cultivated the strength of my conviction that i could have been the woman he wanted me to be out there he tried to make me one he sought in every way he knew how but a weakling i would remain

and because i have sought to please others and abuse him in doing so i have brought everybody to the ditch of misery and despair she cried for a long time but her mind was afire all that her weakness and subservience had caused continued and at last the event of the night

and what did i do to him she said now rising in the bed  i recall that he came to the telephone he stood listening to what i was saying and i recall that when i turned slightly and saw his face it was terrible  then i saw him suddenly snatch the receiver from my hand and i heard him talking to papa he was terribly excited and i shall never forget the expression on his face i cannot clearly remember what followed i recall however that i struggled with him that i struck him everywhere i could that i scratched his face    and oh my god i recall what passed then she suddenly sank back upon the pillow and gave up to bitter anguish when she recalled what had followed but the excitement was too great for her to lay inert she rose again upon her elbow and looked before her into the darkness of the room as she slowly repeated half aloud what had followed

 yes i recall he made no resistance he did not defend himself but allowed me to strike him at zvill and under the fusillade of blows i recall that he sank slowly to his knees â sank there with his arms about me and i striking him with all the strength in my body upon his knees then he lingered while i rained blow after blow upon his upturned face and now i can recall that his eyes closed and from his lips i caught a sigh and then he rolled to the door and here oh lord i added what will follow me throughout my life and never again give me peace

 while he lay there upon the door with his eyes closed before me i kicked him viciously full in the face but even then he did not resist but only groaned wearily merciful jesus nor did i stop there i jumped on his face with my feet and then i recall that some one caught me and saved me from further madness she was exhausted then and lay without words for a long time almost in a state of coma she bordered and while so she fell into a strange sleep the night wore on and the clock downstairs was striking the hour of two when she suddenly awakened she sat straight up in bed and jerked her hands to her head and screamed long and terribly the household was awakened and came hurrying to where she lay but in the meantime she continued to scream loudly at the top of her voice and all the while perspiration flowed from her body it was nigh onto four oclock before they succeeded in quieting her and when they had done so she lay back again upon the pillow with a groan and the family went back to their beds to wonder what had come over her

all felt strangely as if something evil had crept into their lives and their excitement was great all but ethel who in her evil way was delighted and laughed gleefully when she had returned to bed

 laugh on ethel you evil woman said glavis at her side  evil has this night come into our lives it wasnt right in the beginning it isnt right now nor was last night

oh i have never wanted to see this go along as it has because your father has trained orlean to obey and subserve to his will he has done something to her and she has become a demon instead of a weakling last night i saw jean baptiste lying prone upon the floor and knew that she had beaten him down to it and he had not resisted she told me as we came home what she had done but was not aware that she was telling me nothing good can come of evil and it is evil that we have practiced toward that man

he is through now and never again will he make effort to get her to live with him but just so sure as she has abused him just so sure will she do injury to those who have brought this about and with this he turned on his side and feigned sleep

alone orlean lay trying vainly to forget something â something that stood like a spectre before her eyes but she could not forget it nor did she ever forget it it had come and it was inevitable she had seen it in her sleep

it had all been so clear and when she had awakened and screamed so long she knew then that it must in time be so

she would never forget it but realizing its gravity she decided thereupon never to tell itâthe dream â to anybody

the sun shone and the birds sang and the day was beautiful without when she at last fell asleep again

epoch the fourth the drought jean baptiste jumped from the bed and went quickly to where his trousers hung on a chair and went through the pockets hurriedly he laid them clown when through and got his breath slowly when he had done so and the perspiration stood out on his forehead as he concluded that he had been robbed

after a time he raised his hand to his forehead and appeared puzzled he was positive he had seen some one enter the room go to the chair and take the money from his pockets it was rather singular however he now thought for if such had happened and he had seen it then why had he not stopped the robber he was deeply puzzled he had seen the act committed he felt sure but had made no effort whatever to stop the thief he scratched his head in vexation sat down and as he did so saw that his coat hung also upon the chair absently his hands wandered through the pockets and found his purse and the money in an outside pocket

he was awake then and went to the basin removed the bandages and bathed his face the swelling had gone down considerably but the injured eye was dark he realized then that nobody had entered the room for the door was locked with the key inside but he couldnt recall having his money in his coat pocket he was awake at last to the fact that it had been a dream

when he had bathed and dressed he slipped quietly down the stairs and into the street and found his way to the thirtyfifth street l station he had no plans he considered that his relations with his wife were at an end and from his mind he dismissed this in so far as it was possible â and as far as future plans were concerned but since he had made no plans whatever in the event of failure and since failure had come he was undecided where he was going or what hewould dp at once

he decided not to return home directly he wanted to go somewhere but did not care to stay in chicago he took the train that was going downtown and when he reached the twelfth street station suddenly decided to go to southern illinois and visit the girl jessie with whom he had been corresponding

while walking toward the illinois central station he purchased a paper and was cheered to see that his candidate had carried the state in the preferential primary by an overwhelming majority the train he was to take left at nineforty and he was able to forget his grief in the hour and a half he waited by reading all the details of the election

the journey three hundred miles south was uneventful but when he arrived at carbondale the train that would have taken him to where he was going had left and he was compelled to spend the night there the next morning he caught an early train and reached the town in which she lived his first visit there since he met the one he had married

he found jessie and her kind sympathy served to revive in a measure his usual composure and when he left a few days later he was much stronger emotionally than he had been for a year and on his return west determined to try to regain his fortunes that had been gradually slipping from him in the past two years

when he had digested the state of his affairs at home he had a new problem to face decidedly he was almost  in bad for a time his interest had been paid by his bankers but they had left him to the mercy of the insurance companies who held the first mortgages and these had been protesting and had lately threatened foreclosure even so and if the crops be good he was confident he could make it

but before he could even sow that years crop he would have to see a certain banker who lived in nebraska this man was represented by a son who conducted the bank he controlled at gregory and the son had issued an ultimatum and if baptiste would keep his stock that was mortgaged to the bank as security he realized that it was best to see the boys father since the son had made plain his stand

the banker was out of town when he arrived and to save time baptiste judged that it would be best to go to sioux city where he could meet the banker on his way home and on the way from sioux city to the little town where the banker made his home he could consult with him and get an extension in this he was successful and returned home with an assurance that he would be given until fall to make good â but in truth until fall to get ready to work he went with a sort of fleeting hope the spring had been good but he was apprehensive that the summer would be dry as the last and it was with misgivings that he lived through the days and weeks that followed seed wheat and oats had been furnished to the settlers in tripp county that spring by the county commissioners and he had sowed a portion of his land with it

conditions in the new country had gone from bad to worse and if the season should experience another drought the worst was come already there were a few foreclosures in process and excitement ran high the country was financially embarrassed to secure money now was almost impossible any number of farms were for sale but buyers there were none

a local shower fell over part of the country in the last days of may wetting the ground perhaps an inch deep and then hot winds began with the first day of june for thirty days following not a drop of rain fell on the earth

the heat became so intense that breathing was made difficult and when the fourth of july arrived not a kernel of corn that had been planted that spring had sprouted the small grain crops had been burned to a crisp and disaster hung over the land everywhere there was a panic from the west people who had gone there three and four years before were returning panic stricken the stock they were driving â when they drove â were hollow and gaunt and thin going hither the years before they had presented the type of aggressive pioneers but now they were returning a tired gaunt defeated army all hopes all courage all manhood gone they presented a discouraging aspect

from canada on the north to texas on the south the hot winds had laid the land seemingly bare everywhere cattle were being sold for a trifle as there was no grass upon which they could feed

to the north and the south the east and the west in the country of our story ruin was in the wake foreclosures became the order and suits were minute affairs from early mom to early morn again the hot winds continued and the air was surcharged with the smell of burning plants

and with the hero of our story he saw his hopes sink with the disaster that was around him he saw his holdings gradually slipping from him and after some time became resigned to the inevitable

so it came to pass that another change came into his life hence another epoch in the unusual life was his the foreclosure early in july when the drought had burned the crops to a crisp and plant life was beyond redemption the banks trust and insurance companies holding notes secured by mortgages against the land and stock of jean baptiste began proceedings for a foreclosure he read with the cold perspiration upon his forehead the notices that appeared in the papers attachments were filed against all he personally possessed in gregory county as well as in tripp county the fact that he had not had his sisters homestead transferred to him and that she had just made proof that summer was a relief to him now and with a sigh he laid down the newspapers containing the notices

it was no surprise since he had been threatened with such for many months he regarded it therefore as unavoidable

but when the grim reality of the situation dawned upon him it weakened him never had he dreamed that it would come to this he took mental inventory of his possessions and what he could lay claim to and he happened to think about his wifes homestead on this he had made his home since her departure and no trouble had been given him while the local land office had rendered a decision in her favor the contestee had taken an appeal to the general land office and the commissioner and upon being represented by an attorney the local land offices decision had been reversed

it had been up to him then to go further which he had done by appealing the case to the highest office in the land department the secretary of the interior and here it rested

to do this he had agreed to pay the attorney  to win and one hundred dollars in the event he should not the latter amount he had paid and so the case stood he had formulated no plans regarding it beyond this as to how he would continue to hold it since now it was a settled fact in his mind that he and the woman he had married were parted forever

but poverty accompanied by crop failures for three years was a general and accepted thing now and the fact that he was being foreclosed occasioned no comment and at least he could continue on without intensely feeling the attendant disgrace

it was at this juncture in life that a new thought came to jean baptiste in all his life he had been a thinker a practical thinker â a prolific thinker moreover a great reader into the bargain so the thought that struck him now was writing perhaps he could write if so then what would he write so in the days that followed gradually a plot formed in his mind and when he had decided he chose that he could write his own story â his life of hell the work of an evil power

of writing he knew little and the art of composition appeared very difficult but of thought this he had a plenty well after all that was the most essential if one has thoughts to express it is possible to learn very soon some method of construction so after some weeks of speculation he bought himself a tablet some pencils and took up the art of writing

he found no difficulty in saying something the first day he wrote ten thousand words the next day he reversed the tablet and wrote ten thousand more in the next two days he rewrote the twenty thousand and on the fifth day he tore it into shreds and threw it to the winds

he had raised a little wheat and when the foreclosures had been completed and the wheat had been threshed he sowed a large portion of the seed back into the ground on three hundred acres of ground upon which the crop that year had failed according to the law of the state when a foreclosure is completed the party of the first part may redeem the land within one year from the date of the foreclosure or better still he may pay the interest and taxes at the end of one year from the date of the foreclosure and have still another year in which to redeem the land so it is to be seen that if jean baptiste could pay his interest and taxes one year from this time he would have two years in all to redeem his lost fortunes hence in seeding a large acreage of wheat he hoped for the best the years however had been too adverse to now expect any returns when a crop was sown and it had been merely good fortune that he happened to secure the means with which to sow another for credit there was for few any more

when this was done there was nothing to do but listen to the wind that blew dry still although the protracted drought had been broken by light autumn rains so took he up his pencil and fell to the task of writing again

through the beautiful windy autumn days he labored at his difficult task the task of telling a story the greatest difficulty he encountered was that he thought faster than he could write therefore he often broke off right in the middle of a sentence to relate an incident that would occur to him to tell of something else but at last he had written something that could be termed a story he took what appeared to him to be quite sufficient for a book to a friend who had voiced an interest in his undertaking in fact although he had said nothing about it the news had spread that he was writing a story of the country and everybody became curious

of course they were not aware of his limited knowledge of the art of composition to them a patriotic boosting people â despite the ravages of drought which had swept the country this was a new kind of boostâ a subtle method of advertising the country so everybody began looking for the appearance of his story in all the leading magazines

the fact helped the newsdealers considerably but to return to jean baptiste and the story he was writing

the friend was baffled when he saw so many tablets and such writing he pretended to be too busy at the time to consider it and sent him to another but it was a long time before he found any one who was willing to attempt to rearrange his scribbled thoughts but a lawyer who needed the wherewithal finally condescended to risk the task and into it he plunged he staggered along with much difficulty and managed to complete half of it by christmas

the remainder was corrected by a woman who proved even more efficient than the lawyer notwithstanding the fact that she was not as well trained besides jean baptiste was of quick wit and he soon saw where he was most largely in error so he was very helpful in reconstructing the plot and early in the next year he had some sort of story to send the rounds of the publishers

and here was the next great problem he had while writing and before read of the difficulties in getting a manuscript accepted for publication but like most writers in putting forth their first literary efforts he was of the opinion that what he had written was so different from the usual line of literature offered the publishers that it must therefore receive preference over all

so with its completion he wrapped it carefully and sent it to a chicago publisher while he sighed with relief

it seemed a long time before he heard from it but in a few days he received a letter stating that his manuscript had been received and would be carefully examined and also thanking him for sending it to them

well that sounded very encouraging he thought so he took hope anew that it would be accepted

in the meantime he was questioned daily as to when and where it would appear he was mentioned in the local newspapers and much speculation was the issue many inquired if he had featured them in the story and were cheered if he said that he had while others showed their disappointment when advised that they had not been mentioned but with one and all there was shown him deep appreciation of his literary effort

so anxious did he become to receive their decision 

that as the days passed and he waited patiently he finally went to town to board until he could receive a reply and as time passed he became more and more nervous at last his anxiety reached a point where he was positive that if he received an adverse decision it would surely kill him

therefore he would entertain no possibility of a rejection

it must be accepted and that was final added to this he took note of all the publicity he had been accorded with regard to the same how would he be able to face these friends if they failed to accept the book tell them that it had been rejected as unavailable this fact worried him considerably and made him persist in his own mind that the company would accept it

some of his less practical creditors extended his obligation anticipating that his work would net him the necessary funds for settlement â the question of acceptance they did not know enough about to consider so it went the time passed and he could scarcely wait until the stage reached the little town where he now received his mail he was never later than the second at the postoffice window he had read in jack londons martin eden that an acceptance meant a long thin envelope well that was the kind he watched for â but of course he estimated it was possible for it to come in another form of envelope so he wouldnt take that too seriously still if such an envelope should be handed him he would breathe easier until it was opened

and then one day the letter came the postmaster who knew everybodys business regarded the publishers name in the upper left hand corner and said  there she is now read it aloud

baptiste muttered something about that not being the one and got out of the office his heart was pounding like a trip hammer for while he had concluded that a long thin envelope would not necessarily mean an acceptance his was a short one and he was greatly excited

he went blindly down the street turned at the corner and sought a quiet place a livery barn herein he found an empty stall that was dark enough not to be seen and still afforded sufficient light to read in he nervously held the letter for some minutes afraid to open and read the contents and tried to stop the violent beating of his heart

at last with forced courage he broke the seal drew the letter forth and read  mr jean baptiste  dear sir as per our statement of some time ago regarding the manuscript you were so kind as to send us beg to advise that the same has been carefully examined and we regret to state has been found unavailable for our needs we are therefore returning the same to you today by express

 regretting that we cannot write you more favorably but thanking you for bringing this to our attention believe us to be  cordially and sincerely yours  a c mc graw  co

he gazed before him at nothing for some minutes he was trying to believe he had read awrong so he read it again no it read just the same as it had before it was done his last opportunity for redemption seemed to be gone he turned and staggered from the bam and went blindly up the street at the comer he met the deputy sheriff who approached him jovially and then gave him another shock when he said  ive got a writ here baptiste and will be glad to have you tell me where this stuff of yours is so i can go and get it

he raised his hand to his forehead then and began thinking he had to do something for although all his land had been foreclosed on he had two years to redeem the same

but this writ â well the man was there to take the stock then

irene grey men of the type of jean baptiste dont waver and despair regardless as to how discouraged they may at times under adverse circumstances become when he was confronted with the law with the papers to take from him the stock with which to seed his crop his mental faculties became busy and in the course of two hours he had been granted an extension on the note and the deputy sheriff had returned to winner as he had come empty handed

but what was he to do he had no money and no credit

he had the land in tripp county that was broken into winter wheat while that in the next county east was rented

he could of course rent some more land and put it to crop but he was for the present through with any more large crops until the seasons became more normal so he was at a loss how to engage himself for the months that were coming he still lived on his wifes homestead and had no plans and nowhere else to live in these days he found reading a great diversion he simply devoured books studying every detail of construction and learning a great deal as to style and effect

then he tried writing short stories but like the book manuscript they always came back he concluded after a time that it was a waste of postage to send them around that in truth they were not read â and again that there was no fortune in writers royalties always anyhow

he was possessed with a business turn of mind and one day he met a man who told him that it was possible for him to have his book printed and be his own publisher

that sounded very good â anything sounded good in these dark days in the life of jean baptiste this was a splendid idea but it was some time before he was able to find the proper persons with whom to take this up but he finally secured the address of a company who would manufacture a book to exceed  pages for fifty cents per book although this was the most encouraging thing he had encountered in his literary effort the price seemed very high in view of what he had been told he had planned that it could be made for much less however he decided to consider it

now jean baptiste had less means at hand than he had ever had in his life not a dollar did he possess â not even did he have a suit of clothes any more and wore every day his corduroys he owed the promoters of the old townsite of dallas more than he was likely to pay very soon but they still were his friends but to get to dallas fifty miles away was still another problem he went to a bank in the little town where he had other friends from whom he had never asked credit they loaned him what he asked for  with this he went to dallas the senior member of the firm was in town â that is senior in age but not in position jean baptiste possessed great personality and to be near one was to effect that one with it

 i believe you could do alright with that book baptiste

this one said when baptiste had told him regarding the company who would put it out for him

 yes i am confident i can too graydon replied baptiste  but i am clean dead broke i cant go down there

the other was silent for a moment as he stood wrapped in thought presently he said  how much do you have to have to go down there  

 oh thirtyfive or forty dollars

 ill let you have fifty

 im ready at any minute so saying he went to a store across the street where he had friends and there was dressed from head to foot charging the clothes to his account two days later he walked into the office of the printing firm with which he had been in correspondence they were rather surprised when they saw that he was an ethiopian but he soon put them at ease

after several days of negotiating they finally reached an agreement whereby they would manufacture one thousand copies at seventyfive cents per copy he was to pay one third of the amount before the book went to press the balance he was to pay within a reasonable time an outrageous price he knew â at least felt but he was to have all subsequent editions for one half the amount of the original edition which was some consolation to look forward to

another fence who would furnish that two hundred and fifty dollars and secure him for the remainder besides what would he do with the books when he had them publishing meant distribution but what did he know of such

he thought these things over carefully and finally decided that he would sell them himself he communicated this fact to the firm it was rather unusual for an author perhaps to sell his own works jean baptiste had never sold anything by solicitation since he had grown up but when he was young he had been a great peddler of garden vegetables

he would sell his book and he seemed to convince them that he could

they prepared some prospectuses for him and back home he returned he told in answer to the volumes of inquiries that everything was all right and that the book would appear soon he said nothing however to the friends he had in view to put up the money and that necessary security

he believed in proving a thing and all else would necessarily follow he would go out and secure orders there at home among his friends and acquaintances but the day he planned to start was very cold â the mercury stood twentyseven below zero

starting in dallas he received orders for one hundred fortytwo copies the first day very good for a starter

he went to winner the next day despite the fact that the drought had done no good to the people of that community and town they all were acquainted with and admired jean baptiste besides they would not see dallas beat them

and one hundred fiftythree copies were ordered by them

jean baptiste could prove anything in a fair fight if given a chance he secured orders for fifteen hundred copies of his book in two weeks the promoters went his security and put up the cash into the bargain and he went back to the publishing house victorious

the printers had evidenced their confidence in him for they had been so impressed with his personality that they had begun work upon the copy when he returned in thirty days it was ready and in sixty days from the time he was penniless he had deposited twentyfive hundred dollars to the credit of the book in the banks

as he was winding up his business preparatory to interviewing his printers establishing an office and going into the book business for a livelihood he was the recipient of a telegram from washington advising that the honorable secretary of the interior had reversed the commissioners decision which had been adverse to his wife with regard to the claim he had won but as to how he would ever prove up he didnt know nor did he let it worry him he was too flushed with success in his new field he could still hold the claim but it would be his wife who must offer proof on the same and his wife he had not heard from for over a year

he did not find his new field of endeavor so profitable when he began to work among strangers indeed while he did business the money didnt seem to come in as it should

he conceived an idea of securing agents among the colored people and in that way effect a good sale to begin with this was difficult for the reason the black mans environment has not been conducive to the art of selling anything except those things that require little or no wide knowledge they deal largely in hair goods to make their curls grow or hang straighterâ or in complexion creams to clarify and whiten the skin yet he succeeded in getting many to take the agency and these received orders and sent for the books he had learned that it was a custom with subscription book companies to allow agents to have the books and give them thirty days in which to remit the money

this proved agreeable to his agents however the greater number of them took not only thirty days â but life and did not send in the money when they died

he was confronted then with the task of learning how he could get the books to them and be assured of his money to learn this he went on the road himself appointing agents and selling to bookstores and it was upon this journey that he met one who had played a little part in his life some years before at a time when conditions had been entirely different with him

in kansas city she occurred to him he recalled that it was only twelve miles from the city where her father owned and lived upon one of the greatest farms in the country

he thought of the last letter he had received from her the letter that had come too late and then he thought of what had passed since girls in her circumstances would not be likely to waste their sympathies with grasswidowers but he wished that he might see her and look just once into the eyes that might have been his but his courage failed him

he still had spirit and pride so he gave it up for the time

late in the afternoon of that day he was engaged with some acquaintances in the barroom of a club they became quite jolly as cocktails and red liquor flowed and tingled their veins he thought again of irene grey and the memory was exhilarating and the cocktails gave him the necessary courage he was bold at last and to the telephone he went and called her over long distance

 is this the greys home he called

 yes came back the answer and he was thrilled at the mellowness of the voice at the other end

 is miss irene at home   he called now

 yes it said  this is she

he was sobered all the effect of the cocktails went out of him on the instant he choked blindly groped for words and finally said  why â er â ah â this is a friend of yours an old friend mayhap you have forgotten me

 i dont know she called back  who are you  

he still didnt have the courage to tell her but sought to make himself known by explaining he then mentioned the state from whence he came but no further did he get

it so happened that she had heard all about his troubles following his marriage and womanlike feeling that she had been in a way displaced by the other she had always been anxious to meet and know him

 oh she cried and the echo of her voice rang in his ears over the wire for some moments  is this you   she cried now her voice evidencing the excitement she was laboring under

 yes he admitted somewhat awkwardly not knowing whether the fact had thrilled and joyed her or whether he was in for a rebuke for calling her up but he was speedily reassured

 then why dont you come on out here   she cried

o â i didnt know whether i would be welcome he replied happy in a new way

 oh pshaw  why wouldnt you be welcome  but now her tone changed  where are you  

 in kansas ctiy

let me see she said and he knew she was thinking

 it is now four thirty and a train leaves there that passes through here in forty minutes it doesnt stop here but you catch it and go to the station above here do you understand

 yes yes he replied eagerly

 well now listen i the station i refer to is only four miles above this and when you get off there catch another train that comes in a few minutes back this way see  

 yes yes

 well that train stops at this station and there i will meet you

 oh fine he cried  ill be there

 now you will be sure to catch it she cautioned

 most assuredly

 i will depend on it

 count me there

 i want to talk to you im going to talk all night

 goodby

what might have been jean baptiste was so elated over being invited to call early to see miss irene grey that he went back to the bar where his acquaintances lingered ordered drinks for all and imbibed so freely that when he reached the depot he found the train had left him his disappointment was keen and he was provoked with himself however since it was so he went to a booth called her up and advised her of the fact

 now wasnt that careless of you she complained  i am sure you are very careless

 i wouldnt have missed it for anything in the world he told her  indeed i was so delighted over the prospects of seeing you after these many years and i indulged so freely that i lost the sense of time

 how is that â did you say that you drank  

well yes i do he admitted frankly but not in a dangerous sense i do not recall having been drunk but once in my life and trust that i will never have occasion to recall a second occurrence

oh she echoed  i am relieved i dont trust a drinker and the fact that you were left made me suspect you

 at least i can reassure you on that score i am proud to say that i have the strength of my convictions

 i am pleased to hear that a man has a poor chance to succeed in the world otherwise

 i agree with you

 well now let me see when you can get out here she said meditatively after a time he heard her voice again

he had never seen her not even a photograph of her he could only estimate her appearance from recalling her brother and from what he had been told but however she may appear her voice to say the least was the most beautiful he thought that he had ever heard he listened to every word she said and thought the tone like sweet music

 you will have to stay in k c all night now she said regretfully and i must repeat that i am so disappointed it had been my dream that i would talk with you all the night through whereupon she laughed and this was even more beautiful than her voice when speaking  but now she began again admonishingly  you will arise at eight â no seven do you understand and catch a train that leaves the city at eight i will be at the station to meet you again

i cross my heart that i will catch it

 and if you do not â so help you god

 i hope to die if i miss it

well if you do dont die â but catch the train thats all now goodby and you are forgiven this once

 goodby

whatever happened it is irrelevant to relate but jean baptiste missed the morning train and so disgusted was he with himself that he boarded a train for topeka where he went and appointed some agents intending to get the train back that afternoon but his  jonah  still clung to him and when he had it estimated that the train went at fivethirty it had gone at four fiftytwo and he was left again

 ill catch the morning train if i must sit here all the night through he swore so put out with himself that he could say no more

he ascertained the exact minute the morning train left and this train found him on time it was sunday in early june and the day was beautiful the air was rich and the growing crops gave forth a sweet aroma he reached the little town near where she lived and even from the depot the splendid home in which they lived could be seen reposing vaingloriously upon a hillside in the community her father was the wealthiest man having made his fortune in the growing of potatoes and fruit

she was not at the depot to meet him and he had not expected her it was perhaps two miles to the big residence on the hill and to this he set out to walk when he arrived the house seemed to be deserted and as it was sunday he surmised that the family were at services he went up to the front door and knocked loudly he was conscious at once of whisperings from the inside presently the door was opened slowly an inch and he saw tin eye peeping out at him

 who are you   a voice whispered

he told the eye

 oh yes cried the voice and it happened to be a boy and the cause of the whispering and quietness from the inside was due to certain pranks going on inside and youre that fellow from up in the northwest said the youngster opening the door wide and stepping away to look at him curiously

 yes i guess thats whom you refer to

 we are certainly glad to see you around here said the other  irenes been down to the train to meet you three times and shes sure fighting mad by this time

 oh say i really dont blame her a bit â to be put to so much trouble and be disappointed in the end but on the square i had not anticipated being so highly honored

 aw weve been anxious to know you for years we boys had sort of planned when you was writing to irene two or three years ago to come up there and get in on some of that land

 that would have been a capital move

 yes but you quit writing and got married so we heard and had bad luck in the end whereupon he laughed baptiste looked embarrassed

 where is the family and how many are there of you 

 aw say  we are so many around here that youll have to get paper and pencil and mark us down to keep track of how many my father is in colorado on business while irene mama and another sister are at the next town up the line attending a funeral

 and the boys â

 just gettin ready to go swimmin wanta go long 

 say there hasnt enough water fallen where ive lived for the last three years at the right time to fill a pond deep enough to go swimming in so ill just take you up he cried full of the idea

it was in the early afternoon when they got back to find that the folks had returned from the funeral hollowing the boys baptiste entered by the kitchen door to encounter the mother and three daughters preparing the meal hereupon he was caused much embarrassment and discomfiture for of the three girls he knew not which one was irene

quickly seeing his confusion they laughed long and heartily among themselves finally his predicament became so awkward that an expression of distress crept into his face

at this point the most attractive one of the three girls walked forward extended her hand and he saw by the expression she now wore that she was sorry for him as she said  im irene and you are mr jean baptiste she paused then and looked away to hide the color that had rushed to her face while he clutched the outstretched hand just a bit dubiously she looked up then again and seeing that he was still confused and perhaps in doubt she reassured him  the joke is over now thanks im the one you called up and once wrote to im irene and with this she led him to the front and showed him her picture whereupon he was at last satisfied

 and you came at last she said later when the two were seated in the parlor

 at last he laughed and observed her keenly she noted it and conjectured that it was from a curiosity that was some years old it was true and he was seeing her and perhaps thinking of what might have been

she was beautiful he could see a mixed type of the present day negro she was slightly tall and somewhat slender with a figure straight and graceful her hair was of the silken wavy sort not uncommon among the negro of this type such hair seems to have had its beginning with the cross between the negro and the indian â a result that has always been striking when it comes to the hair

her face like her figure was straight and slender while her eyes were black quick and small her nose was high bridged and straight to a point while the mouth below was small and tempting but what he observed most of all now and admired forthwith was the chin a wonderful chin long and straight a strong firm chin and as ne regarded it he could seem to read the owner whatever she was or may be he was confident then that she was possessed of a strong will and in that moment orlean recurred to him

orlean was regarded as a fairly attractive woman but her chin unlike that of the one before him was inclined to retreat and of course he knew only too well that her will had been the weakest

you are very successful in missing trains she ventured

he laughed and she joined him he looked up then and caught her regarding him keenly out of her half closed eyes and as she did so she reminded him of an indian princess such as he had seen in pictures and read about

there was more about her than he had at first observed and which was made plain in the look she gave him for in it there was passion â love to her meant much i  oh i was so disappointed she said  it was not you

 but how could you have missed the train so often 

 i cannot account for it i am not in the habit of doing so indeed i think it was because i was overly anxious

she laughed then to herself elfin like

 i have been curious to see you for a long time

he was silent and his eyes did not return the look she had given him

 ever since i received that letter  

and still he did not reply the subject was too suggestive not to say embarrassing but she was bold he couldnt know now whether she was serious or merely joking but notwithstanding it sounded pleasant to his ears

he could hear her voice for a long time he was sure and not grow weary    we should pause at this point to make known â perhaps explain that the persons of our story are the unconventional and with the unconventional what was in their minds was most likely to be discussed the woman therefore was the most curious she was a woman and in truth she would have married the man beside her had he have come hither when he had gone to chicago

 what did you do with your little wife 

he raised his eyes then not to look at her but because of something he did not himself understand perhaps it just happened so she regarded him again looked him full in the eyes and his eyes spoke more than words

strangely she understood all almost in a flash and was sorry she regretted that she had spoken so directly she admired him now when he had looked up and like that she had seemed to st and understand at last the man he was

 pardon me please she said and rising quickly took a chair nearer his she reached and touched him on the arm  i didnt â i â well i didnt intend to be bold

she paused in confusion and then went on  i hope you will pardon me i am sure i didnt intend to embarrass you

 it is all right he said  and since you have asked me may i explain

it was she who was now embarrassed she looked away in great confusion she was bolder than the conventional girl as a rule but the subject was delicate yet she wanted to hear the story that she knew he would never tell if he did he was not the type of man she had estimated

 of course you would think me a cad a âwell i have my opinion of a man that would tell his side of such a story to a woman

she looked at him then without any embarrassment in her eyes she was able to read the man and all that was him clearly she smiled a smile after this that was one of satisfaction and at that moment her sisters called that the meal was ready

tell me why you didnt answer the last letter i wrote you

now i wish you would tell me all about yourself that is all you care to tell said irene grey to the  man who sat beside her on the veranda of their beautiful home some time after luncheon had been served

 i have always been peculiarly interested in you and your life alone off there in the northwest whereupon she made herself comfortable and prepared to listen

 oh he said hesitatingly thinking of the series of dry years and their attendant disaster and hoping that he could find some way of avoiding a conversation in which that was involved  i really dont consider there is much to relate

my life has been rather â well in a measure uneventful

 oh but it hasnt i know she protested  all alone you were for so many years and you have been so i have been told an untiring worker she was anxious he could see but withal sincere and in the course of the afternoon she told him of how her father had came to kansas a poor man bought the land now a part of what they owned on payments found that raising potatoes was profitable â especially when they were ready for the early market and later after his marriage to her mother and with her mothers assistance had succeeded from where they sat their property stretched before them in the valley of the kaw and comprised several hundred acres of the richest soil in the state indeed his success was widely known and jean baptiste had been rather curious to know the family intimately

after some time he walked with her through three hundred acres of potatoes that lay in the valley before the house and he had for the first time in his life the opportunity to study potato raising on a large scale

 from your conversation it seems that you raise potatoes on the same ground every year i am curious to know how this is done for even on the blackest soil in the country i live this is regarded as quite impossible with any success

 well it is generally so but we have found that to plow the land after the potatoes have been dug and then seed the same in turnips is practical when the turnips with their wealth of green leaves are at their best then we plow them under and the freezing does the rest

 a wonderful mulch

 it is very simple when one looks into it they were walking through the fields and without her knowing it he studied her the kind of girl and the kind of family his race needed he could see in his observation of the clan to which he had been born practicability was the greatest need indeed he was sometimes surprised that his race could be so impracticable further west in this state his uncles who like all negroes previous to the emancipation had been born slaves had gone west in the latter seventies and early eighties and settled on land with time this land had mounted to great values and the holders had been made welltodo thereby a case of evolution on all sides over all the central west this had been so at the price land now brought it would have been impossible for any to own land there happened then as had recently a series of dry years â seemingly about every twenty years to pull through such a siege the old settlers usually did much better than the new to begin with they were financially better able but on the other hand they did not as a rule take the chances new settlers were inclined to take because two or three years were seasonable and crops were good they did not become overly enthusiastic and plunge deeply into debt as he had done he could see his error now and the chances new settlers were inclined to take because moreover he had been so much alone â his wedded life had been so brief and even during it he was confused so much with disadvantages that he had never attempted to subsidize his farming with stock raising perhaps this had been his most serious mistake to have had a hundred head of cattle during such a period as had just passed would have been to have gone through it without disaster

he felt rather guilty as he strolled beside this girl whose father had succeeded but one thing he would not do and that was make excuses he had ever been opposed to excusing away his failures if he had failed he had failed no excuses should be resorted to but as they strolled through the fields of potatoes he could not help observe the contrast between the woman he had married and the one now beside him that he might have had for wife here was one and he did not know her so well as to conclude what kind of girl in all things she was but it was a self evident fact that she was practical whereas he had only to recall that not only had his wife been impractical but that her father before her had been so he recalled that awful night before he had taken her away at colome when that worthy when he chanced to use the word practical had exclaimed  im so tired of hearing that word i do not know what to do and it was seconded by his cohort in evil ethel

his race was filled with such as n j mc carthy he  well i dont know as i ought to have asked you it was perhaps unladylike in me so to do but honestly i would like to know the truth

he permitted his eyes to rest on the other bank and as a pastime he picked up small pebbles and cast them into the river and watched the ripples they made subside he thought long and deeply he had almost forgotten the circumstances that led up to the unfortunate climax she by his side he estimated was merely curious should he confess would it be worth while of course it would not but at this moment he felt her hand on his arm

 well go now

they arose then and went between the rows of potatoes back to the house when they arrived there was some excitement and she was greeted anxiously

 papa has returned said one of the boys coming to meet them

 oh he has whereupon she caught his hand and led him hurriedly into the presence of the man who was widely known as junius n grey the negro potato king

the story junius grey inquired at length concerning the land whence he had come of the prospects of the climate and at last relieved baptiste by inquiring as to whether the drought had swept over that section as well as other westerly parts

 i have had the same result with twentytwo hundred acres i own in the western part of the state but such will come â have come every once in a while since i have been here he assured him if you have been caught with considerable debt to annoy you and succeed in pulling through it will be a lesson to you as it has been to others

 it has been a lesson i admit said baptiste a little awkwardly irene who seemed to be her fathers favorite sat near and regarded him kindly while he related how the drought had swept over the land and the disaster that followed he did not tell them all that he had been foreclosed but that he felt was not necessary

withal he had met those in his race whom he had longed to meet of business they could discourse with intelligence and that was not common greys holdings were much and baptiste was cheered to see that he was possessed with the sagacity and understanding to manage the same with profit to himself besides the family about him while not as conventional as he had found among the more intelligent classes of his race had grown into the business ways and assisted him

would you like to attend services at the church this evening said irene after a time and when they were again alone

 why i suppose i might as well

 then ill get ready she disappeared then to return shortly dressed in a striking black dress covered with fine lace while on her head she wore a wide drooping hat that set off her appearance with much artistic effect

 what is your denomination she asked when they went down the walkway to the road the church was not far distant and in fact was at the corner of his property and was largely kept up by her father he had been told

 the big church i guess he said amusedly

 indeed  she exclaimed feigning surprise

and yours

 oh baptist of course she replied easily

when she held his arm like she now did it made him feel peculiar never three years before would he have thought that he would be company again for another woman â at least under such circumstances

 what do you think of protestantism  

 well he replied thoughtfully  it has not been until lately that i have considered it seriously

so

 and sometimes i am not inclined to think it has been for the best

 how so

 well it appears to me that organization is lacking in so many of the protestant churches

 but is that the fault of protestantism 

 i hardly know how to reply to you it seems however that inasmuch as catholicism requires more effort more concentration of will force on the part of their members to come up and live up to their standard of religion and that since it is obviously easier to be some kind of a protestant then protestantism has afforded a less organized appreciation of the christ

 you make it very plain and especially is it so in the church to which i belong but i am sure however if the standard of requirement was raised within the negro baptists it would be better for all

 you mean â

 if it was compulsory for the ministers to possess a college education and attendance for at least three years at a theological seminary the standard would be raised in the churches conducted by negroes

 i agree with you and do you know that since i have been in the book business only these few short months it has been my experience that ours is a race of notoriously poor readers

 isnt it so oh it is dreadful when we come to consider how much needy knowledge we lose thereby

 it is staggering

why is it so

 well to begin with there is little encouragement to become a reader among negroes themselves take for instance the preacher by all circumstances a minister â at least should be a reader is it not so 

 certainly

 well are they as a whole 

 lord no 

 then how can you expect their followers to be  

 we cannot

another disadvantage is separate schools

 i dont quite understand  

 well mix the negro children daily with the whites and they are sure to become enamored of their ways

 i gather your trend

 the most helpful thing on earth negro children thereby are able in a measure to eradicate the little evils that come from poor homes homes wherein the parents ignorant often are compelled to be away at work

 evil environment bad influence

 that is it there is no encouragement to read therefore no opportunity to develop thought and the habit of observation

 how plain you make everything

and now we have come unto the church and must end our conversation

 im sorry

he was too but they filed into the little church

in and around where they now sat there was quite a settlement of negroes mostly small farmers perhaps it was due to the inspiration of the successful grey she had earlier in the evening pointed out here and there where a negro family owned five acres where somewhere else they lived on and farmed ten acres and fifteen acres and so on

after slavery there had been a tendency on the part of the negro to continue in the industrious ways he had been left in by his former master the cultivation was strong but strangely there had come a desire to go into town to see and to loaf perhaps it was because he had not been given such a privilege during the days of bondage but here in this little valley of the kaw he was cheered to see his race on a practical and sensible basis only in the pursuit of agriculture can the black man not complain that he is discriminated against on account of his color

when the service was over they walked leisurely homeward and their conversation became more intimate the feeling of a woman by his side thrilled jean baptiste in his life on the prairies this had never been afforded so to him it was something new and something gloriously sweet

or was it her presence at least he was moved he decided that he would go his way soon because it was dangerous for him to linger in her radiating presence without regretting what fate had willed

 isnt it warm tonight   she said when they reached the porch

 dreadfully so down here in your valley

 perhaps you will not care to retire and would rather sit out where the air is best she suggested

 i would be glad to

 very well then and she found a seat where they were hidden by vines and the shade of the big house  ill return presently when i have put my hat away

when she returned her curiosity to know why he had not visited her was he could see again her chief anxiety

she tried to have him divulge why in subtle ways late into the night they lingered on the veranda and he found himself on the verge of confessing all to her

he succeeded in keeping it from her that night but she was resourceful moreover her curiosity had reached a point bordering on desperation accordingly she had the boys to hitch a team to a buggy and took him driving over the great estate for hours during the cool of the morning she drove him through orchards and over wheatfields where the wheat now reposed in shocks she chatted freely discoursed on almost every topic and during it all he saw what a wonderfully courageous woman she was

he loved the study of human nature and wit here he could see was a rare woman but withal there was about her something that disturbed him what was it he kept trying to understand he never quite succeeded until that night

a heavy rain had fallen in the afternoon and he lingered in her company at her invitation and encouragement that night the sky was overcast the air was sultry and the night was very dark she took him to their favorite seat within the vines and where nothing but the darkness was their company and there she resumed her artful efforts to have him tell her all

never in his life had jean baptiste the opportunity to be perfectly free he had once loved dearly and he had sought to forget the one he had so loved because of the custom of the country and its law out of his life she had apparently gone and we know the fate of the other there is nothing in the world so sweet as to love a woman but on the other hand mayhap all that is considered love is not so it may be merely passion and it was passion he discovered that was guiding irene grey he saw when this occurred to him that in such a respect she was unusual

well his life had been an unhappy life love free and openly he had never tasted but once but a law higher than the law of the land had willed against that love and he had subserved to custom so he decided to tell her all and leave on the morrow

 please jean she begged calling him by his first name

 wont you tell it to me

he regarded her in the darkness beside him she was very close and he could feel the warmth of her body against his he reached him out then and boldly placed his arm about her she yielded to the embrace without objection

he could feel the soft down of her hair against his face and it served to intoxicate him aroused the passion and desire in his hungry soul

 yes irene he said then  i will tell you the story and tomorrow i will go away

 no she said and drew closer to him on the impulse he embraced her and in the darkness found her lips and the kiss was like a soul touch he sighed when he turned away but she caught his face and drew his lips where she could hear him closely

 tell me she repeated  for so long i have wanted to hear

well it was like this you know â rather perhaps you recall the circumstances under which we met

 i remember everything jean

 i was in love with no one i can say but i had loved outside of our race

 our race  

 yes

 you mean she said straightening curiously  that you loved an indian up there that i recall is the home of the sioux  

no i have never loved an indian

then what

a white girl

 oh jean she said and drew slightly away he drew her back to him and she yielded and settled closely in the curve of his arm and he told her the story

 honestly that was too bad you sacrificed much

and to think that you loved a white girl

 it was so

 so it came that you sacrificed the real love to be loyal to the race we belong to  

 i guess you may call it that

 it was manly though i admire your strength

 it was then i wrote you

 yes andâ

 others

i understand you loved none of us perhaps and it was because you had not had the opportunity maybe  

 perhaps it was so

 and now i will hear how it happened

 i must first confess something that pains me

 oh that confession  but maybe i am entitled to hear it

 well yes i think so there were three

 oh   

 and you were the first choice

me

 but i waited for your letter there was a time limit

 and i was away

 therefore never received it in time

 and you

 at omaha i hesitated and then decided that you did not favor it

 ooh 

 so i went to chicago to meet the second choice

 such an unusual proceeding but interesting oh so much so please go on

 she lived in new york

in new york

 was a maid on the twentieth century limited

ooh

but sickness overtook her she didnt get into chicago when she was due

such fate

 i wonder at it

 and then you got the last choice

that is it

not knowing what else to do she was so carried away with the story she stared before her into the darkness

 and when did you receive my letter  i understand about the claim business

 when i returned with her to gregory

she was silent he was too both were in deep thought and what was in the mind of both was what might have been

her birthright  for a mess of pottage

the people of winner and vicinity had no opportunity to rush to the farmers state bank of which eugene crook mentioned earlier in our story was president and draw any portion of their money before the bank examiners notice greeted them one morning

the bank was closed by order of the public examiner so that was settled the causes became apparent the day before although those directly interested did not understand

it was in the shape of drafts they had bought and sent away which came back to them indirectly marked by the bank upon which they were drawn no funds

not much excitement followed the closing although in some manner crook had worked into the confidence of the people since moving the bank to winner and was leading the four banks in the town in point of deposits of course it hit many needy ones quite hard but the people of the country had become so accustomed to adversities that even bank failures included did not excite them

but there happened a few days after the failure an incident that has some connection with our story crook went upon a journey he was gone several days and when he returned the unexpected happened it caused about as much excitement as had the failure of the bank because of its cunningness

when jean baptiste had ended his visit with irene grey he returned to his office at the publishing house to find considerable mail awaiting him one letter was from his attorney in washington and since he had won the claim for baptistes wife in the contest baptiste naturally took it for granted that it was a request for the balance of his fee so he laid the letter aside until he had attended to all other business and later opened and read it

 washington d c july  â mr jean baptiste  my dear sir  i am informed through your attorney at gregory that your wife has sold her relinquishment on the homestead i was successful in getting the secretary of the interior to reverse the land commissioners decision on i am not informed further but inasmuch as you are living on the place my advice is that you stick right there and hold it you may write and advance me the details concerning the matter and i will assist you in a legal way in pressing your right to hold the same

 in the meantime kindly send me a remittance on the fee that is past due at your earliest convenience and oblige  very truly  patrick h loughran

he reread the letter to be positive that he had understood it correctly he was thoughtful as he allowed the substance to become clear his wife had sold her relinquishment on the claim that he had spent thirtyfive hundred dollars cash for and in so doing she had sacrificed his confidence had sold her birthright for a mess of pottage and she had not received he was sure perhaps one tenth part of the amount he had expended for it he thought a little longer and as he did so a vision of his arch enemy rose before him

his mind went back to a day when n j mc carthy in all his lordliness had with much vituperation denounced and condemned eugene crook for having contested his poor daughters place and all the white race with him

 and newton justine mc carthy muttered baptiste  this is more of your work

he was very calm over it was jean baptiste but the turning point in his life had come at last his manhood had returned and he was ready to fight

he wrote his attorney at once at gregory and the reply that came back in due time was gregory s d july â â mr jean baptiste  friend jean replying to yours regarding the claim it was eugene crook who got it he went to chicago and bought it from your wife through her father i understand that your wife refused to sell whereupon crook sent for the reverend who was at cairo sending him the railroad fare to chicago at the same time i do not of course know just what followed but it is the report here that the reverend had his daughter to execute the relinquishment and crook returned and filed on the claim

 i understand further that crook got the idea from reading your book wherein you told of the preacher and what he had done although anonymously it is also reported that crook paid the elder  for the claim

 very truly yours  wm mc connell

jean baptiste laughed when he had completed the letter picked up one of his books and looking through it found the place  well old boy i guess you lost me more than ill make out of you but youve given me what i ought to have had three years ago he was silent then but his face took on a cold hard expression whereupon he laughed again

 n j mc carthy we vied twentyfive years ago and we encountered three years since on both occasions you had me at a disadvantage   we are going to vie again now but it will be upon an equal basis so saying he looked before him at nothing his eyes narrowed to mere slits

an hour later his grip was packed he went that afternoon back to tripp county his three hundred acres of wheat had failed so he was unencumbered he returned to winner and the next morning he boarded a train for chicago

and of the battle that he fought with his august contemporary will be the continuance of our story

action jean baptiste went directly to an attorney a negro attorney with offices in the loop district upon his arrival in chicago and did not lurk around the depots to keep from being seen this time he was well acquainted with the one upon whom he called and they greeted each other cordially when he walked into the office

 well white he said  i think i have a little work for you

thats what im here to look after said the other aimiably

a suit â want to obtain a judgment

 we obtain judgments in this old town every day the question is â

are they worth anything laughed his prospective client

after indulging in a bit of humor the which he was at times given to his face cleared his eyebrows contracted and he related the business upon which he was bent and questioned the attorney concerning the law covering such cases or instances

 yes said the other after looking it up in the illinois statutes  it can be done

 then we will begin at once said baptiste decidedly

 ill have the pipers drawn up and have the same ready for service tomorrow afternoon

very well said the other handing him a check for twentyfive dollars as a retainer and straightway left the office

he caught the state street car and went to visit his friends on federal street they were delighted and surprised to see him looking so well and so carefree

 why â what has happened to you said mildreds mother looking him over carefully from head to foot

you infer that i have forgotten my troubles

of course and she laughed

 youll know in a few days he returned soon he bade them goodby and went over to the keystone where he encountered speed

 well i have everything ready now said the attorney when jean called at his office the following afternoon

 so the next is to get service on my friend said baptiste

thats it where shall we find him inquired the lawyer

 i dont know i suppose you might call up his wife on vernon avenue and find out of course she need not know what our business is with her old man   of course not

in a few minutes he was talking to her over the telephone  the elder is in the southern part of the state

baptiste could hear

 yes madam but what place    i see  he will be there over sunday you say    i understand   

what do i want with him why i have a little personal matter with him    yes    that is all

the attorney turned and advised him where the elder was and would be there until after sunday and as that day was wednesday baptiste breathed a sigh of relief

 thats the town near where i first knew him i was born within four miles of it

 indeed  something of a coincidence

 indeed so

 ill get these papers off to the sheriff down there on the evening train well get them tomorrow morning and should get service on him tomorrow afternoon

 then ill see you about saturday

 all right and jean was gone

the little town near where jean baptiste was born and where he had met the man who was now his acknowledged enemy had not changed much perched on the banks of the ohio it still lingered in a state of dull lethargy loafers held to the corners and arguments were the usual daily routine when he had left the town the odd fellows hall an old frame building three stories high had stood conspicuously on a corner and had been the rendezvous for loafers for years untold this had been torn down and replaced since by a more commanding brick structure at the front of which a shed spread over the walk and made welcome shade in the afternoon and under it on benches the usual crowd gathered reposing comfortably thereunder from day to day under it the preachers sometimes paused on their return from the postoffice where they received their mail every afternoon and it was the afternoon train that brought the papers for n justine mc carthy the sheriff who happened at the postoffice at the same time the elder did received them and upon his return to his office in the court house laid the mail on his desk and went at once to serve the papers

he knew that odd fellows hall was where negroes might be easily found at least the information as to the whereabouts of any particular one might be obtained so to that spot he went directly

it so happened that a large crowd of negroes were gathered there this particular afternoon and that the reverend had paused there on his way from the postoffice to listen to the heated argument that was a daily diversion at that moment the sheriff came up listened a moment to the usual harangue and then inquired aloud for rev n j mc carthy when the crowd saw who he was the argument desisted forthwith the crowd became quiet and respectful moreover expectant

you refer to me said the elder and wondered what the sheriff could possibly want with him

 n j mc carthy   the other repeated

thats me replied the elder the crowd looked on with curious interest

 some papers and handed him the same turned on his heel and went his way

the reverend went down the street later reading the papers he had never had any experience in legal proceedings and knew little of such but he understood the papers and was thoroughly angry

 well greeted the attorney  got service right off on your friend

 good

 yes got my return and now we may as well draw up the complaint

this they did but in the meantime while passing downtown glavis had espied baptiste thinking that he was on another mission of trying to persuade his wife to return and having been loyal to the reverend in his fight on baptiste he went at once to advise her of the fact

orlean had secured a position in a ladies tailoring establishment at five dollars and fifty cents a week and there he went she was out so he did not get to tell her that her husband was in town since the selling of her homestead the entire family had been apprehensive of him they appreciated by now that he was not the kind to give up without a fight therefore they were on the lookout

in some way the negro papers got hold of enough of it to give the elder a great deal of free advertising but since mc carthys did not get the papers they knew nothing of it until the next morning which was sunday that morning they espied a copy of the paper in their mail box they never knew how it got there but thinking it was by mistake glavis took it into the house and spread it out

pandemonium reigned when they had read the account and in the same hour they received a special from the elder announcing that he was leaving for chicago that night

that would place him in the city the following morning and they were anxious all that day

it was the talk of dark chicago that day and for days and weeks following moreover it circulated over all the state where the elder was well known and gave the gossips great food for delight

the elder arrived the next morning and after being greeted by the family with glavis went at once to a white attorney they laid the case before him

 and so you are sued for ten thousand dollars said the attorney  and by your soninlaw  

 it seems that way replied the elder  and to me it looks like a joke

 how so

 did you ever know a negro preacher that was worth such an amount

the attorney shared the obvious joke with his prospective client and glavis and then took on a rather serious expression

 and you are not worth ten thousand  

 lord no

the other bit the cigar he held between his teeth got up and brought a statute from among his many volumes glanced through it and stopped at a page and read it

he returned the book to its place and came back and sat down

what do you think of it inquired the elder still seeming to take it as a joke

 have you ever considered the outcome in case he should get a judgment against you he accuses you of having alienated the affections of his wife your daughter

 granting that he secured a judgment

 and you could not pay it  

 certainly i could not

then he could remand you to jail for six months by paying your keep

when the elder accompanied by glavis returned home both understood jean baptiste a little better than they had ever before   

gossip ive been over to the mc carthys today cried mildred merrill greeting her mother as she returned home the sunday following the filing of the suit  and oh mama they are certainly excited over there 

 mm guess theyll understand that jean baptiste better now because he had wished to settle their difficulties â if there were any â like a man they thought he was afraid of the reverend

 that was it â positively 

 what was the conversation 

 of course it was ethel who was making the most of the noise

 naturally

 and she made some noise

 id wager

to begin with they didnt know jean had sued the reverend until they read it in the paper

 is that so

 yes you see it was like this orlean sold her farm

 gave it away

 quite likely

 it was so why i understand that baptiste had paid over thirtyfive hundred dollars into it and that the place was supposed to be worth about forty dollars an acre with one hundred sixty acres bringing the sum of sixtyfour hundred dollars that insurance companies would lend two thousand five hundred dollars on the place if she had proved up on the same as other people were doing and had done and secured a patent

 isnt that a shame

 niggas

negroes proper

well what did they say

 oh yes orlean sold her farm some time ago

for three hundred dollars

 is that all she received 

 every cent

 well what do you think of that 

 it was the reverends work of course

 that dirty old rascal

 ignorant into the bargain

 if i were baptiste id kill him

 that would do no good

 no i guess not

 would make him appear a martyr also

well ever since orlean sold her place you see they have been uneasy

 i guess so

 so they had been sort of looking to hear from him

 and they have

mildred laughed

 and theyll hear from him some more

both laughed

 now orlean heard that jean was in town before the rest of the family did and told me so

 shes waited a long time to tell other people things she hasnt told the folks first   

yes thoughtfully anyhow glavis met baptiste on the streets downtown and of course glavis not knowing baptistes mission thought he was here after orlean again

just like him

 the truth

 he was by here awhile ago

 he was

yes but ill tell you about that later go on

 whenhe met jean on the streetâ rather after he goes around to where orlean worked to warn her

 sneak

 but orlean was out

 yes

 so when she returned and was told that a colored manhad called and inquired for her sheâ

 thought it had been baptiste

 yes

 ill try to quit interrupting you

well orlean told me that she was provoked she wished that jean would not be calling at where she worked to bother her

 she got fooled â excuse me 

 but she didnt say anything to the folks about it and they knew nothing of his presence in town â glavis didnt tell it seems either â until sunday morning

indeed

 no none of them had gone out saturday night so they hadnt heard any of the talk that was going the rounds

well glavis went outside sunday morning and found the defender in the mail box

 so

you see they do not subscribe for it but the people next door get it â

 and knowing they were not subscribers they take the paper and place it where they could get it

mildred laughed

 so resumed mildred  when they saw the paper all was excitement

 goody

 so glavis he is the reverends faithful lieutenant you know went out to look up baptiste and have a talk with him

 ump

 he didnt find him

 that was how he happened by here

 but the funny part about it is that they dont know what baptiste is up to they dont know that if he secures a judgment he can remand the elder to jail for six months

 now wont there be some excitement when they learn

mildred laughed again her mother joined her

 but getting back to ethel

 tell me about her

oh she was on the war path you see she cried standing over orlean  you see what youve done by your hardheadedness i told you all the time not to marry that man  

 wouldnt that disgust you 

  but you would go ahead and many him you would go ahead and marry him after all papa and i tried to persuade you not to and now i you are going to kill your father going to kill your poor old father orlean just hung her head like a silly and took it yes went on ethel turning her little slender body around and twisting her jaws as if to grind it out  you got him all mixed up with that nigga and here he comes in here and sues him

think of it sues him and now all the niggas in chicago have the laugh on us â we darent show our faces in the street

and what has he done it for but ethel orlean protested  papa isnt worth anything he cant do anything with papa if he gets a judgment  what do you know about judgments ethel flew up well said orlean i recall hearing jean say that if a man was worth nothing then a judgment was of little or no good  you heard jean say it screamed ethel looking at orlean severely and then she turned to me  do you know mildred she rang out  this fool woman loves that man yet

yes yes loves him yet and would go back to him tomorrow if it wasnt for us   doesnt it beat anything you ever saw 

mildred laughed again as she paused for breath

 well ethel went on and dont you think that nigga is a fool no no never thats a scheming nigga

hes the schemingest nigga in the world he knows what hes about believe me he knows papa isnt worth anything and besides he isnt after money hes after papa

he dont want no money a scheming nigga like him can make all the money he wants oh yes hes up to something else 

 seems they are willing to admit very readily now that which they were not as long as he tried to deal with them like a man

 i should think so returned mildred  well ethel was so excited that she walked up and down the floor in a rage every little while she would stop before me and glare into my face  but what can he do what can he do i have nothing to do with it ethel i replied  yes you have yes you have i you know  i know you and i know jean baptiste he never conies to chicago without coming to see you all hes told you what hes up to and i know it oh that niggal  i looked at orlean and she sat by looking like the man who has murdered his wife and regrets it when she met my eyes she sighed and then said  do you think he can hurt papa mildred im worried you see i know jean some hes shrewd jean is very shrewd i confess that i was rather uncomfortable knowing what i did so hoping to find some way to get out of it i suggested that they walk out no exclaimed ethel  im afraid ill run into that nigga 

when do they look for the reverend in

 in the morning they are afraid to go out until he comes

 id like to be around there when they found out what jean is up to

mildred laughed again and then cried  and oh yes i forgot to tell you that orlean asked me whether jean came direct from the farm here

 what did you tell her 

 why i said i thought he was visiting down in kansas before coming here

 hump

 she said  i guess he was calling on miss irene grey 

her mother giggled

 i said i thought he remarked something about having visited there whereupon orlean said  he ought to have married her 

 jealousy

yes that was it

 look i there is glavis cried mildreds mother pointing to his figure crossing the street

 now for some fun said mildred whereupon both feigned sleepiness and prepared for some good interesting gossip

 oh mr glavis exclaimed mildred answering the rap on the door and admitting him

 and how is everybody   asked glavis coming in with his head bared and smiling in his usual way

 fine mr glavis replied mildreds mother arising to greet him for the second time that day

 and where is my friend baptiste  said glavis  ive just come from the keystone and while he stops there i can never catch him in

 he has not been here today glavis replied mildred

 thats funny id certainly like to see him

 why would you want to see him   inquired mildreds mother

 oh i want to see him of course about all this scandal thats in the air

 hump this appears to be the first time that you have wanted to see him since your fatherinlaw brought orlean home

 well of course said glavis a little embarrassed

 it has always been a bad affair a bad affair and i certainly have wished orlean would have kept us out of all the mess

 why not say you wished the reverend had kept you out of all the mess ventured mildreds mother who was out of patience with their conduct

 well its rather awkward baptiste is a little in fault himself

 hows that

oh he sorter had it in for father before he even married orlean he didnt come into the family like i did

mildred and her mother regarded each other as glavis went on thoughtfully

 yes baptiste is a good fellow and i have always rather liked him but he has always had it in for father has never treated him as i have  if he would have im sure we would not be the bone of this scandal

 it seems that this enmity between your father and baptiste begun way back in the southern part of this state when baptiste was a small boy  

 ive heard something concerning that but of course he oughtnt hold such things against a man when he has grown up

 you seem to hold baptiste in fault for everything when its common knowledge from what i can hear glavis

argued mildreds mother  that the elder went up there and just broke orlean and baptiste up made her sign his name to a check for a big sum of money â and a whole lot of other things how do you account for or explain that 

 well baptiste could have settled this without all that

if hed come and seen me before starting this suit glavis was evasive  i would have had him and orlean meet and reason their differences out together

 why have you waited so long to take such action glavis you had years almost to have gotten them together â to have been at least fair to baptiste as it is you have treated â all of you â baptiste like a dog like a dog

and because he tried to settle an affair like it ought to have been settled you just ground him âpride and all right into the ditch

glavis winced under the fusillade with which the elder lady of the house bombarded him

 and now after you do him all the injury you can you cry about him making a scandal just because he didnt come around again a whining like the dog you have tried to make him you profess to be shocked at his conduct

moreover you had orlean to give away the farm he gave her and from what i can hear to the man that tried every way known to law to beat her out of it and failed and at baptistes expense

glavis was very uncomfortable he shifted uneasily while his handkerchief was kept busy mopping the perspiration from his brow

 i heard that the reverend just scored the man about trying to beat poor orlean out of her place preached a great sermon on the evil and intriguing of the white race and just gave that man a banker the devil then upon top of that he comes down here to chicago and sends your  father  the money to come here from cairo to sell him the place that baptiste was man enough to trust her with for nothing i cant figure out where any of you have any cry coming

 well said glavis rising  i want to see baptiste anyhow if you see him tell him to come over to the house

 no glavis i have nothing to do with it and i oughtnt to be gossiping as i have beenbut i have known baptiste since he was a little boy and i just cant help protesting â as i have always heretofore protested about the way you people have treated him

 well i guess baptiste hates all of us enough to make up

 baptiste has nothing against any one in that house over there but your father but there would be no use in my telling him to call over there no use at all for let me tell you she said following him to the door the day of baptiste beholding unto you for his wife is past i dont think he wants orlean any more and dont blame him after what she has allowed to happen to him through her lack of womanhood nawsiree baptiste didnt come into chicago this time crying he came here like a man and its the man in him with which youll have to fight now

oh well i dont know said glavis taking a little courage  i dont think he is so wise after all any man that will sue a man like father for ten thousand dollars wouldnt seem so wise

well returned the elder lady perhaps you had better wait until you see a lawyer

a discovery â and a surprise ean baptiste called by to see the merrills before leaving the city and took mildred and her mother one afternoon to a matinee at the colonial theatre it was a musical repertoire and a delightful entertainment before one of the numbers was to appear the director of the orchestra came upon the stage and announced ladies and gentlemen if i may have your kind attention i wish to announce that the next number is an extraordinary specialty miss inez maryland the young prima donna who has made considerable of a reputation by her beautiful singing in the last year will this afternoon sing in an introduction a song that is destined by the critics to be one of the most popular of recent production

whereat he stepped to one side and led upon the stage a charming blonde who was greeted profusely

 i am glad to have you meet miss maryland who will now sing the discovery of the season o my homesteader by miss agnes stewart

in the moment jean baptiste did not quite recall the name or rather he did not connect it with an instance in his life but as the sweet mezzo soprano voice combined with the strains of the orchestra floated out over the audience the years gone by to him were recalled he listened to it with a peculiar and growing enchantment and the night he had lain upon the ground and would have frozen but for the now composer came fresh again into his mind

 beautiful

 wonderful

 grand  came to his ears from over all the theatre and then followed the storm of applause again and again did the singer have to return to satisfy the audience before her and when the crowds poured into the street at the close of the performance every one seemed to be humming the tune that had that afternoon began its initial success

as it would take nine months or a year for the suit to come to trial jean resumed his efforts in the book business and was able by borrowing a little to meet the interest and taxes on the foreclosed property and was given the customary years extension

he traveled now from town to town from city to city and found agents for his book and was able in a small way to recuperate his finances he hired an engine to plow all his land that was not prepared besides renting a little more and also took a flier in wheat the war abroad had been going on a year and he conceived that if it happened

to rain at the right time he might get a crop and redeem his land at least he could lose only what he put into it by risking the same so he took the chance so with all he could get hold of until the last days of october of that year he put it into winter wheat on his land and succeeded in getting over  acres seeded

and everywhere he went the people were playing and singing o my homesteader never whether it was fifty times a day or one could he seem to tire of hearing it

at the stores he saw hundreds of copies of it and in every home it was and always it took him back to his youthful days in the land where he had gone with the great hope

and then one day he saw a picture of her it was in a musical review it spoke at length of her and of the simple life she had lived that she was a product of the prairies and a wonderful future was in store for her because of the fact that her work was original

so the winter passed and springtime came again with all its beauty and he continued in his book business he made a trip to gregory and winner to see what the prospects were again in the northwest the winter for the wheat he was cheered to learn had been ideal but the spring was dry and that was not to the wheats advantage however he had the best prospects he had had for years and he returned to the book business with renewed hope

and now we are compelled by the course of events to return to certain characters who were conspicuous in the early part of our story

when jack stewart left the farm he had rented near the property of jean baptiste and went west and took a homestead and had george and bill and agnes to do likewise he was obsessed with a dream that riches had come to him at last agnes was delighted with the prospects also and so they looked forward to a great future in the new land

but there was something that troubled jack stewart and for days when alone he would shake his head and cry  dang it dang it i oughtnt to have let it go that far dang it but he had kept what was now the cause of his worry to himself so long that he would not bring himself to confess it even to agnes after what had occurred but never did he forget jean baptiste and to agnes he would mention him quite often

 by the way my girl he said one day when they were settled on their claims staying mostly on his of course for the prospects were hopeful do you know that i never did learn who saved me from that foreclosure no sir i never did i i paid the note and was so glad that it was paid that i tore it up and forgot the whole matter

 now who do you reckon it was that interceded for me

she paused and looked up from her sewing and then bent over it again as she said  jean baptiste

jean baptiste he exclaimed incredibly

 it was him

 why the stinkin rascal he never told me 

she was silent

 and it was him that came to my assistance the other mused reflectively  well now since i come to recall him it was just like him to do something like that and keep it to himself well well i do say he paused then and looked down at the toe of his boot suddenly he looked up and concentrated his gaze on agnes

 and you knew it all the time he told you

 he didnt tell me

didnt tell you

 i knew it when you returned home that morning

 well well  

 i was positive the administrator hadnt granted you an extension nor wouldnt have so it must have been some one near so who else could it have been but jean baptiste

 of course not now that i recall it but did you tell him about it  

her eyes had business in her lap at the moment very much business she saw the sewing and she didnt see it

what she was seeing again was what had happened one day when she had gone to carry his and her brothers luncheon

 it passed before her as it had done many times since

never she knew would she be able to forget that day that day when the harvest was on and he had said sweet words to her  it was all past now forever but it was as fresh as the day it was done

she understood why he had gone away and when he returned and she had seen his face she understood then his sacrifice she knew that the mans honor his respect for his race and their struggle had brought him to commit the sacrifice and strangely she loved him the more for it it had been an evidence of his great courage the great strength with which he was possessed it was strange that the only man she a white girl had ever loved was a negro and now when that was history it seemed to relieve her when she could recall that he had been a man

 did you hear me aggie   her father called now again

she started

 why â yes father â i heard you she said straightening up  and â of course â i told him about it   

 now im glad to hear that you did it seems that you ought to have told me at the time â at least before we left there so that i could have thanked him he was silent for a time then and reflective

 i wonder what sort of woman he married he mused after a time

 i dont know

 i am sometimes a little afraid that he didnt get the right kind of woman

 he was such a prince of a good fellow that it would most likely have been his luck to have gotten a woman who would betray him in some way it is all rather strange for i dont think he loved any woman but you aggie

he darted his eyes quickly in her direction recalling a time before when he had intimated something of the kind

this time however she did not cry out but continued at her sewing as though he had not spoken

as he slowly walked out what was in his mind was the thing that had worried him before

she looked after him and sighed it was her effort then to forget the past and in so doing the inspiration with regard to music came again and developed in her mind but her efforts had brought so little encouragement from those to whom she had submitted her compositions that she for a long time despaired of making another effort

so it was not until the great drought swept over the land and drove almost all the settlers from their claims in a search for food that made her again resort to the effort

the drought was even worse in the part of the country they now called home than it had been in tripp county and other parts farther east corn that was planted under the sod one spring had actually not sprouted for two years for the moisture that fell had never wet the earth that deep

so after two years in which they came nearer to starvation than they had ever before she secured a position in a hotel in a town farther west and the money earned thereby she gave to her father and brothers to live on

it was then she had returned to compositions in a desperate effort and hope to save them from disaster for a long time she met with the usual rejections and it was a year or more before anything she composed received any notice

but o my homesteader was an instantaneous success

while she still worked in the kitchen of the little hotel in the western village the royalties came pouring in upon her so fast until she could hardly believe it and coincident with the same she became the recipient of numerous offers from almost everywhere most were for compositions while many were offers to go on the stage at which she was compelled to laugh the very thought of her a dishwasher in a country hotel going on the stage but she resigned her position and went back to her father and brothers on the farm she used her money to pay off their debts and started them to farming and made herself contented with staying on as she had done before and keeping house for her father and the boys she refused to submit any more manuscripts until the success of her first song was growing old and then she released others which followed with a measure of success

the offers from the east persisted and with them drought in the west continued and they saw that trying to farm so far west was for the present time at least impractical so they returned to gregory where she purchased the place they had lived on owing to the fact that the drought had been severe there also she secured the place at a fair bargain and they returned to farming the summer following the publication of baptistes book

when she read it she hardly knew what to think but it was rather unusual she thought because he had told a true story in every detail but had chosen to leave his experiences with her out of it she heard of him and the disaster that had overcome him and was sorry she felt that if she could only help him in some way it would give her relief

and so the time passed and he came again into her life in a strange and mysterious manner

she was surprised one day to receive a visit in person from the publisher of her works she was to say the least also flattered he had come direct from chicago to persuade her to come to the city and while she was flattered and was really anxious to see the city she refrained from going but promised to write more music in the months that followed he wrote to her and the experience was new then his letters grew serious and later she received the surprise he came again to see her and proposed she hardly knew how to accept it but he was so persistent to be offered the love of a man of such a type carried her off her feet and she made him promise to wait

he was very patient about it and at last she concluded that while she did not feel that she really loved him yet she was a woman and growing no younger and besides he was a successful publisher and the match seemed logical

so after some months in which she tried to make herself appear like the woman she knew he wished her to be she accepted but left the date for their wedding indefinite

the bishops inquisition the reverend mc carthy was commonly regarded as a good politician in church affairs meaning that he was successful with the bishop in being able to hold the office of presiding elder over such a long period at every conference other aspirants attempted to oust him but he had always held with the bishop and had succeeded himself annually until the fiveyear limit had expired at the end of this time he had usually succeeded in manipulating matters in such a manner that he had invariably been successful in securing the same appointment over another district in the state over this he presided another five years and was then automatically transferred back to the district over which he had formerly presided

for twenty years he had been successful in keeping this up but in the conference that was to convene after he had been sued by his soninlaw it became known and talked about that he would not be reappointed to the presiding eldership and would necessarily be sent to a charge for a year or more

accordingly he began early to seek a charge which he was in position to know would be lucrative since there were few outside the large churches in chicago that would pay as well as the presiding eldership

the fact was however he regretted going back to a charge for his former experience in such work in gaining and retaining the confidence of the members of his church had not been ideal to say the least and again it was expedient that he should have his family especially his wife living in the town with him where he held the charge

perhaps that made it awkward for him as he was not accustomed to having his wife in such close proximity with him daily his regard for her was such that he could not bear the thought of that close association for his experience had been that it was impossible for him to be in the house with her a matter of two days without losing his patience and speaking harshly to her to avoid this unpleasant domestic state of affairs it had been agreed that orlean should be his housekeeper and this was settled on before conference â and before he had been sued

this pending suit however brought added complications

ever since he had brought orlean home he had been embarrassed by gossips nowhere had he been able to turn unless some busybody must stop him and inquire with regard to his daughter what was the matter etc and so on

it kept him explaining and reexplaining a subject that was to say the least delicate he had however succeeded in explaining and conveying the impression that the man she married had mistreated and neglected her and that he had been compelled to go and get her in order to save her life this was not satisfactory to him in view of the fact that he decided once to let her return but jean baptiste not knowing that he had reached such a decision had felt that his only chance to secure her again was to keep away from her father â well we know the result of that effort

but inasmuch as that jean baptiste had refused to argue with him over her he had used this as ah excuse to become his old self again which after all was so much easier so when gene crook had approached him with an offer and convinced him that baptiste was what the elder knew he was not because the elder was easily to be convinced of anything toward the detriment of his adversary he easily secured the place and the elder had felt himself ahead

three hundred dollars was a great deal of money to him and went a long way in taking up the payments in which they were in arrears on the home they were buying in chicago true it twitched his conscience but n j mc carthy had a practice â long in effect â of crucifying conscience

so when he had closed the deal â and had been reimbursed for his traveling expenses â he went directly back to his work and had not been in the city since until called in on the suit

when he left the lawyers office and returned home he discussed the matter with glavis who in turn discussed the matter with white friends who advised him how to answer to the charge returning to the lawyers office they engaged counsel it was very annoying â more than ever â to the elder when he was required to put up twentyfive dollars in cash as a retainer he had become so accustomed to posing his way through in so many matters â letting some one else put up the money that when he was forced to part with that amount of money he straightway appreciated the seriousness of the situation it was no pleasant anticipation in looking forward to the trial for there he would be compelled to counter the other on equal terms

he was very disagreeable about the house when he returned home and his wife adroitly kept out of his sight

he sought the street to walk off his anger and perturbation only to run into a mrs jones teacher in the sunday school of one of the large negro churches and with whom he had been long acquainted it was in a measure because his acquaintances were of long standing that gave them they felt the right to question him regarding such delicate affairs so when he met mrs jones he doffed his hat in his usual lordly manner and paused when she came to a stop

 good evening reverend mac she exclaimed and extended her long lean hand he grasped it and bowing with accustomed dignity replied  good evening sister jones i trust that your health is the best

 my health is good reverend mac but say reverend mac you dont look so well

 indeed so my dear madame i have not been in the best of health for some months

 well well that is too bad indeed i hear that you have not been reverend mac and say brother mc carthy what is this i read in the paper about your soninlaw coming in here and suing you for breaking up orlean and he 

his majestys head went up while he colored unseen and would have passed on but mrs jones was standing in such a manner that he was unable to do so without some difficulty

 the man is crazy he retorted shortly and stiffened but it took more than stiffness to satisfy this gossip

well i thought something was the matter reverend

for you see ive heard that you went out there and brought her home to save him from killing her so you see it is rather strange that fellow as a boy â and even yet when he is in chicago â attends sunday school and sits in my class and i was rather surprised that he should treat orlean as it is said you said he did

reverend mc carthy would liked very well to have moved on but mrs jones was very much interested

 theres all kind of talk around town about it they say that if he gets a judgment against you elder he will put you in jail and all that but of course that couldnt be

you stand too well in the church but you know reverend the only thing that looks kind a bad for you is they say that he wouldnt dare start such a suit unless he had good ground for action they say â

the elder had extricated himself at last and now sailed down the street with high head  may the god crush that hardheaded bulldog into the earth he muttered between compressed lips so angry that he could not see clearly

 how long am i to be aggravated with this rotten gossip 

he changed his mind about walking far and at a convenient corner he turned back toward home but when he arrived there he was confronted with another and more serious problem it had been his intention before arriving there to arraign his wife again for having let orlean go west in the beginning but now he was confronted with his august honorary the bishop

 and now reverend said the bishop after they had gone through the usual formalities  i am forced to come around to something that embarrasses me very much in view of our long and intimate relations and he paused to look grave the reverend tried to still his thumping heart

all his life he had been a coward he had bluffed himself into believing and having his family believe that he was a brave man but orlean had told baptiste on several occasions that her father might have risen higher in the church but for his lack of confidence

 it pertains to all this gossip and notoriety that is going the rounds i suppose you are aware of what i refer to

the other swallowed and nodded

 you can appreciate that it is very embarrassing to me and to the church more because i have struggled to raise the standard in this church we have in the years gone by been subjected to unfair gossip and some fair because of the subtle practices of some of our ministers and now with conference convening in two weeks it is very awkward that we should be confronted with such a predicament with regard to you one of our oldest ministers the subject is made more embarrassing because of its â er rather personal nature i would regard it as very enlightening if you would give me an explanation â but of course in the name of the church

the reverend swallowed again struggled to keep his eyes dry for the rush of self pity almost overcame him it was however no time or place for self pity the bishop was not an emotional man he was not given to patience with those who pitied themselves â in short the bishop was very much of a cold hearted business man notwithstanding his position he was waiting in calm austerity for the others reply

 ahm ahem began the reverend with a great effort at self composure it is to say the least my dear bishop with much regret that i am compelled to explain a matter that has caused me no end of grief to begin with it was not with my consent that my daughter was allowed to go off into the west and file on a homestead

the others face was like a tomb upon hearing this

indeed the elder would have to put forth a more logical excuse it has been said that the bishop was a practical man which in truth he was and the fact is he regarded it as far more timely if a larger number of the members of his race in the city would have taken up homesteads in the west than for them to have been frequenting state street and aping the rich also the bishop had read baptistes book â although the reverend was not aware of itâ and was constrained to feel that a man could not conscientiously write that which was absolutely false

 but i came into the city here after a conference to find that my daughter had been herded off out west in a wild country to take a homestead

 now just a minute reverend interposed the bishop astutely  regarding this claim your daughter filed on

what was the nature of the land you have been over it i dare say

 of course of course my dear bishop it was a piece of wild undeveloped land at the time she took it it was fifty miles or such a matter from the railroad she gave birth to a child â

 but interposed the bishop again  you say the land was a considerable distance from the railroad at the time your daughter filed on the place very well now reverend isnt it a fact that in the history of this country all new countries when opened to the settler may have been some distance from the railroad in the beginning for instance somebody started chicago which was certainly not the convenient place then that it is now in which to live

 of course my dear bishop of course

 so the fact that the railroad was as you say fifty miles away could not be held as an argument against it

besides is it not a fact that there were other people men and women who were as far from the railroad and therefore placed at an equal disadvantage  

 of course of course

 then my dear reverend it does not appear to me that that should be a fact to be condemned

 i have not condemned it my dear bishop no

very well then my dear reverend please proceed

now the interposition of the bishop had rather disconcerted the elder had he been allowed to proceed in the manner he had planned and started to he might have made the case from his standpoint and under the circumstances very clear to the bishop but the latters questions threw him off his line and he started again with some embarrassment and with the perspiration beginning to appear around the point of his nose appreciating however that he was expected to explain he went resolutely back to the task

 well my wife allowed my daughter to be taken out there and file on this land that this man had secured on his representation that he wished to marry her and when i came into the city it was all settled

 pardon me for interrupting you again my dear elder

but is it not a fact that mrs pruitt with whom you are well acquainted accompanied your daughter on this trip  

 it is so bishop

 and is it not a fact that mrs pruitt as well as your daughter explained it all at the time with satisfaction to you  

 well ah â yes she did

 you admit to this then my dear reverend

 under the circumstances at the time i was rather compelled to my dear bishop

 meaning that since she had gone and taken the land you were morally bound to look into and consider the matter favorably  

 yes i think that explains it

 now reverend is it not a fact that a considerable writeup appeared in the chicago defender shortly after this visit detailing considerable and with much illustration regarding the trip that in short your daughter had come into considerable land and was regarded as having been very fortunate 

 i think so my dear bishop

very well reverend now â a â who solicited that writeup  did the editor not have a conversation with you before the article appeared

 i believe he did yes sir i think he did

 well now reverend if i remember correctly this young man visited the city the christmas following and i was introduced to him by you in this same room  

 i think so yes bishop i remember having introduced him to you myself

 and do i quote correctly when i say that you called me up the following spring to perform the ceremony that made your daughter and this jean baptiste man and wife

 i think you quote correctly my dear bishop

 mm yes i recall that i was indisposed at the time and was very sorry i could not perform the ceremony said the bishop thoughtfully but more to himself than to the other

 well now after they had been married some months my wife visited your wife and the latter seemed to be greatly impressed with the union i think if i am correctly informed that you went on a visit to them yourself that fall

 i did my dear bishop yes i did

 and at the conference on your return you if i am not mistaken called on me at my home and discussed the young man at considerable length

 yes my dear bishop i did that

 yes mused the bishop again thoughtfully and as if to himself  and you appeared greatly delighted with their union you seemed to regard him as an extraordinary young man and from what i have heard i have been inclined to feel so myself now it seems that a few months after you were speaking in high praise of him you made a trip west and on your return brought your girl home with you and she has not since returned to her husband of course he added slowly  that is your personal affair but since it has reached the public the church is concerned so i am ready to listen to further explanation

 i went out there and found my girl in dire circumstances defended the elder i found her in neglect i found her without proper medical attention â no nurse was there to administer her needs in short i was prevailed upon by my love and regard for my daughters health to expedite the step i took

 nobly said reverend nobly said said the bishop and for the first time during his explanation the elder felt encouraged

 the man did not marry her for love the elder went on now somewhat more confident  he did not marry her to make her happy and comfortable he married her to secure more land it is true that i was impressed with him in a way because the man was rather â er inspiring and i entertained hopes our race does not possess successful men in such a number that we can be oblivious to apparent success as on a young mans part this man seemed to be such a man â in fact i grant him that the man was popular with those who knew him he was a pusher but he was so ambitious to get rich that he was in the act of killing my child to accomplish his ends the reverend finished this with a touch of emotion that made the other nod thoughtfully and while he paused to gather force and words for further justification of his interposition the bishop said  i note by the reports in the newspaper that you are accused of having coerced the girl that you had her write her husbands name on a check with which you secured the money to bring her from the west

 he gave my daughter the privilege of securing money by such a method for her needs and it was not i that had her do any such a thing

 but it was â er rather â a little irregular was it not 

it does not seem reasonable to suppose that he granted her the privilege to sign his name to checks to secure money with which to leave him the question was put rather testily and caused the other to shift uncomfortably before making answer

 well under the circumstances methods had to be resorted to â er rather to fit the occasion the elders defence was artful

the bishop not pretending to take his question seriously pursued  i note further that he accuses you of disposing of some property 

 my daughter sold her place it was hers in her name and the transaction did not require his consent

 mm â i see it seems that the property so he claims represented an outlay of some thirtyfive hundred dollars in cash and he purports the same as being worth something like sixtyfour hundred dollars what is your opinion having been on the property of its actual worth  

well i have some sense of values since i am buying this home and i do not regard the property as being worth such a sum

 i see said the other stroking his beard which was thick and flowing

 a piece of wild raw land such as that i could not estimate it as being so valuable

 mm have you any knowledge of what land has brought in that neighborhood reverend you see value is a very delicate thing to estimate we cannot always be the judge in such matters the usual estimate of what anything is worth is what some one is willing to pay do you recall of having ever heard your daughter or any one say what deeded land in that section sold for

 well i have heard my daughter say that a place near there had brought five thousand dollars

 which would not compare with the value you put on the place your daughter held

 it would not seem to

 mm you say this was your daughters place entirely  

 it was returned the reverend promptly

 and she paid for it out of her own money 

 well no she did not

 i see mm then who purchased it for her reverend  

i think he did that yes i think he did

 i see do you recall the consideration i understand that he purchased what is called a relinquishment i understand such transactions slightly i have read of such deals in oklahoma seems to be a sort of recognized custom in securing land in new countries notwithstanding the subtlety of the transaction

i think he claimed to have paid two thousand dollars for the relinquishment which i would consider too much considerably too much

 but inasmuch as your knowledge of new countries has been brief perhaps you would not set your judgment up as a standard for values there suggested the bishop pointedly you will grant that the individual in the contro no

 what was the consideration reverend for this piece of land that your daughters husband bought for which he paid  placing a house and barn thereon digging a well and making other improvements fighting off a three years contest â placed there by the man who tried to beat her out of it what did he pay for the place

 three hundred dollars such an awful moment  the elders head dropped as he said this but the bishops eyes were still upon the spot in the carpet

 and so this young man comes hither and accuses and sues you accusing you of breaking up he and his wife

he published all that you have told me and if he should secure a judgment it is known that he can remand you to jail for six months

he paused again regarded the spot in the carpet before him very keenly and then arose the elder arose also but he was unable to find his voice in the meantime the bishop was moving toward the door his hand was upon the knob and when the door was open he turned and looking at the one behind him said  well see you at the conference newt and was gone

the other stood regarding the closed door his brain was in a whirl and he could not quite understand what had happened but something in that hour had transpired and while he could not seem to realize what it was just then he knew he would learn it in due time

the bishop acts the conference that followed was one of grave apprehensions for the reverend mc carthy before he had always looked forward to this occasion with considerable anxiety he had usually prepared himself for the battle that was a rule on such occasions for thirtyfive years he had not missed a conference he had never come away in defeat true he had not risen very high but he had at least always been able to hold his own

but for the first time in his long experience he went to meet this conference with a feeling in his heart that he would come away defeated that he was not to be reappointed presiding elder was a foregone conclusion but he entertained doubts about getting the appointment he had hoped to secure ever since the bishop had paid him the visit he had been uncomfortable when the prelate bade him goodby that day he had never been able to get out of his mind the idea that the other had convicted him in his own heart and had purposely avoided his company it worried him and he had been losing flesh for two years therefore he did not present now the same robust striking figure as when he had met the conference heretofore year after year

and then moreover he had been hounded almost to insanity by gossips from over all his circuit it was the talk they brought it to conference and discussed it freely and did not take the trouble to get out of his hearing to do so nowhere was there as he well knew a body that would have delighted more in his downfall than those brother preachers who met the conference that year always had they been ready to oppose him but always before the bishop had been with him he had been able by subtle methods to place himself in the bishops favor but this time that august individual artfully kept from meeting him directly besides he had not the conscience to seek him and he had not been able to meet the bishop in the free atmosphere as before

the charge that he had picked out was very good and it was convenient for his needs for many reasons of course there were scores of others after the same charge but with his old influence he need not have worried however he had not and could not see the bishop privately long enough to secure from him a promise and so he met the conference for the first time unsettled as to where he was to preach the ensuing year

never had a conference seemed so long as that session

the week wore slowly away and he was forced to be aware of the fact that on all sides they were discussing him and the fact that he had been sued and was likely to be remanded to jail as a result since no one credited him with so large a sum as ten thousand dollars he could see the unconcealed delight and the malice that had always been but which before he had been able to ignore affairs reached such a point until it was almost a conclusion that it mattered little as to where he was sent for he would be unable to fill the pulpit because of the fact that he would have to go to jail shortly it nettled him it broke down his habitual composure and it was a relief to him when the conference came to a close

and not until the secretary arose to call the various charges and who had been sent thither did he know where he was to go so it was with a sinking of the heart when his name was reached  reverend mc carthy to mitchfield 

reverend mc carthy to mitchfield was the echo all through the audience impossible reverend mc carthy one of the oldest and regarded as one of the strongest one of the ablest ministers to such a forsaken charge indeed they could hardly have sent him to a poorer charge to a less dignified place it seemed incredible and the rest of the calls were almost drowned out in the consternation that followed

well it was done he had been all but silenced and lowered as much as the bishop dared to lower him that was settled and he returned to chicago without telegraphing the fact to his family

with resignation he made the necessary preparations for the trip and taking orlean with him went to the small town they rented a house for the place didnt afford a parsonage and began the long dreary year that was to follow it was his good fortune however when the school board met and decided to separate the negro children from the whites in the public schools that they employed his daughter to teach the colored pupils for the year in this way they were able to get along in very good comfort in the months that followed so the autumn passed and also the winter spring came and went and summer had set in when his attorney wrote him that the case had been called to come into chicago and prepare to stand trial in the case of jean baptiste plaintiff versus newton justine mc carthy defendant

where the weak must be strong the trial was called for early june and baptiste reached the city a week or ten days before the time set he had become very friendly with the negro lawyer who was conducting his case he also secured a gregory lawyer the one who had conducted the contest case when he arrived in the city the lawyer advised that inasmuch as they had a spare bedroom at his home and that it would be imperative for them to be close to discuss various phases of the prosecution he could have the room if he liked so he accepted it

it so happened that the lawyers home was located in the same block on vernon avenue as was the mc carthys and on the same side of the street moreover it had been built at the same time as had that of the mc carthys and was very much like in appearance the one in which they were living

one afternoon a few days before the trial while lingering at the bar of the keystone hotel baptiste was approached by glavis who invited him to a table nearby where they were very much alone he ordered the drinks and when they were served he began  now baptiste it seems we ought to be able to get together on this case without going into court

yes replied baptiste regarding the other noncommittally

yes i think we could and should i think you and orlean ought to be able to console your differences without such an extreme

you think so

why i do orlean has always â ah â rather loved you baptiste and i think you two could make up

 but this is not between orlean and me glavis you seem to misunderstand it is between n justine mc carthy and me

 of course but it is over orlean you have sued father for this sum a sum you know he cannot pay in the event you should secure judgment so there would be nothing left for you but to remand him to jail which seems to be your desire

 possibly so the other was still noncommittal

 then why not you and i get together on this proposition before the trial is called 

 i dont see as i can oblige you glavis there comes a time when compromise is impossible only vindication can suffice and its vindication that i want now and regret to advise am determined to have

 that seems rather severe baptiste

why so

 well you see i understand that the old man kinda â er gave you the worst of it but you ought to forget some things look at it from a broad viewpoint see how expensive it is going to be and all that

 i considered all that before i went into it glavis replied baptiste calmly

 well now baptiste i want to stop this thing before it goes to court if you had of kinda flattered the old man a little in the beginning as i did all would have been well

 why should i have done so when i didnt feel to  

 oh baptiste you are so severe 

 when a man has suffered as i have it is time to be severe my friend for your own benefit i will say that i do not trust your fatherinlaw i do not love him and never have if it wasnt because i wish to observe and subserve to the law of the land i would have killed him long ago even when i think of it now my bitterness is so great at times that i must repel the inclination to strike him down for the coward he is so if thats all we will call the meeting to an end so saying he arose strode toward the bar and ordered drinks for both he drank his with a gulp when served and turned and left the saloon

glavis proceeded to his lawyer and advised him of his inability to dissuade the plaintiff

 couldnt dissuade him eh 

 couldnt do a thing 

 thats too bad it might be to your advantage if you could settle this case out of court when will your fatherinlaw be in

 im looking for him here in a day or so now

 mm the attorney was thoughtful  this is rather an unusual case he resumed  and i have been studying the complaint of the plaintiff the old man it seems to me committed some very grave blunders

you think so

 quite obvious and while it will be difficult for the plaintiff to secure a judgment in such a case it is however apparent that the sympathy of the court will be against your fatherinlaw in the proceedings

glavis was uncomfortable

now i take notice here that the plaintiff states that his wife drew a check for two hundred dollars unknown to her husband and that the reverend had it cashed that may be regular but it will not help her fathers case again he complains that her father influenced the girl to sell a quarter section of land for less than onetenth what it cost the plaintiff of course these are technicalities that while they cannot justify a judgment will win the sympathy of the jury what the plaintiff must show however is that his fatherinlaw actually was the direct cause of and did alienate the affections of his wife such a case is not without parallel but it is uncommon a father alienating the affections of his daughter

 now where is your sisterinlaw

 at home

 wish youd bring her down this is a complicated case and weve got to conduct it with directness she can be of great assistance in extricating her father from this predicament

 all right sir when shall i bring her 

 oh any time that is convenient tomorrow morning at nine will perhaps be the best and now sayl have you any idea who the plaintiff is going to use as witnesses  

 why i think he plans to bring his grandmother from what i can hear for one

 his grandmother what does she know about it 

 well she was in the house when my fatherinlaw went on the visit and the girl came away with him

 i see id like to know just what passed and what she heard and will testify to i wonder whether she will testify that she overheard your fatherinlaw abusing this baptiste to his wife

 i really dont know

who else

 i heard something about him going to bring a doctor down and also a lawyer

the doctor eh he shook his head then a little dubiously  this physician attended the girl while she was confined  

 i think so

 mm i see here where we have recorded that your fatherinlaw claims that the girl was neglected didnt have proper medical attention what about this have you any knowledge as to how many visits this doctor made to the bedside of this girl when she was sick any knowledge of what kind of bill was rendered by him  

 i hear that his bill amounted to something like two hundred dollars

two hundred great scott and for a dead baby

gee well have to keep away from neglect as an excuse

thats a fact no jury will believe such a statement if that fellow shows where hes paid such a bill as that 

glavis shifted uneasily he was seeing another side of the controversy before he had only seen one side of it and that side was as the reverend had had him see it

 you send or bring the girl down here tomorrow it will be up to her to keep her father out of jail thats all

it will be up to her to convince the court that she never loved this man that all he did for her was by persuasion and that her father only followed her instructions in short its almost directly up to her for the plaintiff has certainly got the goods on her dad if he can prove that she ever loved him

glavis was much disturbed when he went home for the first time he was able to appreciate the full circumstances

it would be up to orlean to save her father and that he could see he would take her to the lawyer and have her carefully drilled the success for them depended on her on her falsifying to the court for it could not be otherwise

for her to testify that she did not love â and had never loved jean baptiste he knew would be a deliberate falsehood it worried him but he had to go through with it

he accompanied her to the lawyers office as agreed and there she was made to understand the gravity of the situation that everything depended on her statements and her statements only

her father arrived the following day and at the attorneys office in company with orlean and glavis he was impressed with the nature of the defense all were finally drilled in their course of action

that night orlean faced the most serious period in her life she was a weak woman and her weakness had been the cause of it all the trial was approaching â and the result was up to her her fathers freedom his continuance in the pulpit his vindication of the action he had taken depended upon her and her strength

and that strength â for on that day she would have to be strongâ depended upon a lie

 yes said baptiste a little wearily

somehow he felt relieved it seemed that a great burden had been lifted from his mind and he closed his eyes as if shutting out the past now forever he was free never would the instance that had brought turmoil and strife into his life trouble him again always before there had seemed to be a peculiar bond between him and the woman he had taken as wife always he seemed to have a claim upon her in spite of all and she upon him but by the decision of the court all this had been swept away and he sighed as if in peace

they found their way to the  l  station that was nearest and there took a train for the south side at thirtyfirst street baptiste left his lawyer and slowly betook himself toward the familiar scenes on state street

while he lost himself in the traffic of state street the reverend in company with glavis ethel and orlean boarded an indiana avenue surface car the reverend was cheery for a great fear had passed a coward by nature he had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown before the trial thinking of what might happen but now that was over he was free that meant everything

the fact that he was guilty in the minds of everybody who heard the trial did not worry him now he was free and could claim by the verdict that he was vindicated in the action he had taken that was the great question always before he had been sensitive of the fingers of accusation that were upon him and the worry had greatly impaired his usual appearance

and while he was relieved glavis sitting proudly by him was also he talked cheerfully of the trial of the decision and of the future that was before them he smiled at all times and the reverends large face was also lighted up with a peculiar delight but there was another who in spite of the fact that the testimony from her lips had saved the day for the reverend was not happy not cheerful not in a mood to discuss the case

this one was orlean few knew â in fact maybe only one other and that was her husband â or appreciated how much that false testimony had cost her she had lied lied freely lied stoutly lied at every point of the case â and this for the man who had brought her to it and now when it was over she felt not at ease while jean baptiste was conscious that a burden had been lifted from his mind and glavis and her father chatted freely she sat silently by without even a clear thought she was only conscious that she had lied that after a life of weakness a life that had made no one happy or cheerful or gay she had for the first time in her life deliberately lied and as she became more conscious of what had passed she felt a burden upon her

never since the day she had abused her husband never since the suffering her actions had brought him never since as a climax to all this when he lay upon the floor and she had kicked him viciously in the face had she experienced a happy or a cheerful day

but today â after that terrible ordeal she felt as if life held little for her that she was now unfit to perform any womanly duty she found no consolation in the fact that she had been encouraged to do as she had done by those who claimed to love her that seemed to annoy her if anything she could now for the first time in her life realize clearly what duty meant duty could not be sidetracked regardless of what might have passed her husband had been good to her he had given her the love that was his never had he abused her in any way never had he used a cross word in her presence but she had done everything to him and as a climax to it all she had lied

oh that lie would haunt her forever i they arrived at the street where they must leave the car for home she arose along with the rest when they stood upon the walkway and had started toward home her father paused

 by the way children he said cheerfully i think i should call at the lawyers office and thank him he turned his eyes to glavis his worthy counsellor at all times and read agreement in his face before the other opened his lips to give sanction

 i think that you should too father he said whereupon he turned to accompany him

 well ill drop by his office you may go on home with the girls glavis he said so saying he turned toward the attorneys office to settle his account and talk over the case

as he walked along his way he became reflective he allowed his mind to wander back into the past â back many years to the time when he had gone into the country to take a meal he recalled that day at the dinner table where he had sat near a certain school teacher she had been an attractive teacher a rare woman in those days and he admired her it was a privilege to sit so close to her at the table to wait on her and be the recipient of her charming smiles he saw himself now more clearly in retrospection

he saw a little boy standing hungrily at a distance he saw again now that same small boy approach the teacher saw the teachers motherly face and her arms reached out and caught that youth and then smother his face with kisses

he felt again the anger that little boys action had aroused in him he heard again the cries from the summer kitchen as the mother administered punishment for the same he recalled briefly the years that followed he recounted the testimony at the trial for many many months he had endeavored to make baptiste suffer and this day he had succeeded but still he was not satisfied the joy that had come of being freed of the accusation after his unhappy and nervous state of fear had shut all else out of his mind for a time after all freedom is so much but was freedom all he could not account for the feeling that was suddenly come over him he recalled then again the severe chastisement he had caused jean baptiste to receive when he was a mere child he recalled also how he had been instrumental in separating him from his daughter he recalled now the lies oh the lies she had resorted to that had kept him out of jail the tears he had shed from self pity while baptiste stood stoically by

and thinking thusly he reached his destination

he found the attorney alone busy over some papers he approached him courteously bowed and thrusting his hand in his pocket said  yes sir i thought i would drop in and pay you the balance of the fee that is now due and thank you for your services he smiled pleasantly as he spoke and never appeared more impressive the other regarded him a moment held out his hand accepted his fee and said  well its over and you are free

 yes said the elder but now found it rather hard to smile  i am glad it is over for it was a very awkward affair i must confess he paused then perforce the lawyer was regarding him and the elder wondered at his expression he had never seen that look in his face before

what did it mean he was not kept long in suspense for soon the other spoke

 yes you are free and fortunate

 fortunate the reverend repeated thoughtfully and looking up found the lawyers eyes upon him they were looking straight into his with the same expression of a moment before

 yes said the lawyer then coldly  you are free and fortunate because you were as guilty as hell

grim justice grim justice agnes decided to visit chicago and planned to be married there besides since she was now engaged the legacy in the bank at rensselaer must be secured and according to her mothers will consulted before she was married she was curious to know what it was all about

indeed she was almost as anxious if not more so to learn the contents of the legacy than she was to become the wife of the man she had consented to marry

accordingly before the train reached chicago she became very anxious it gave her a peculiar and new thrill to recline in the luxurious pullman to have her needs answered and attended to by servants and to be pointed out by curious people as the writer and composer of a song that had delighted the whole country she was experiencing how very convenient life is when one has sufficient means to satisfy ones needs this had been her privilege only a short time a newsboy boarded the train and passed hurriedly through the cars with the morning papers she purchased one and glanced through the headlines in the index she saw an account of the suit of jean baptiste versus his fatherinlaw curiously and anxiously she turned to the account and read the proceedings of the trial she laid the paper aside when through and reviewed her acquaintance with him in retrospection how strange it all seemed at this late date beside her a long narrow mirror fit between the double windows in this she studied her face a moment some years had passed since that day â and the other day too at the sod house she thought of the man that was to be her mate and of what he would think should he ever know that the only man who had ever touched her lips before him was a negro she found herself comparing the two men and she was rather surprised at the difference she could distinguish she tried to estimate what true love was the life she had so recently entered was the life she had aspired to she had hopes for it the life that could now be hers was the goal of her ambition â and she had attained it she should be satisfied but was she

as the train with its luxurious appointments sped along she felt after all that she was going out of the life that she really loved was it because she had always been so poor and unable to have the things she could now partake of at will that such had become a habit and indispensable to her happiness  for indeed she had a longing for the old life the dash and open it afforded she had a vision of jean baptiste and his honor he had sacrificed her to be loyal to the race in which he belonged had it not been for this she knew she would not be journeying to the great city to become the wife of another but amid all these thoughts and introspectives and otherwise there constantly recurred to her mind the man she was to marry and what he would think if he knew that she had once loved and would have married â and even kissed a negro

she was glad when at last the train drew into the outskirts of the city and the excitement about drove such reminiscences out of her mind she had wired him and of course she expected him to meet her

 oh here you are he cried as she stood upon the platform a half hour later on hearing him her eyes wandered toward where he stood and regarded him keenly for a moment a really handsome man immaculately attired in the finest tailored clothes and in the fashion of the day

he caught her in his arms and she did not resist the hot kisses he planted upon her cheeks still she was greatly confused and feared that she would create a scene before she had become accustomed to the ways and dash of the city

he had her arm â held it close as they passed through the station and crossed the walkway to where an inclosed auto stood into this he ushered her attended to her luggage and a moment later followed her inside through the city with all its bustle and excitement they sped

 im going to take you to my aunts he said when they had gotten started

 oh she chimed at that moment she could think of nothing to say it was all so confusing to her she was so unaccustomed to any kind of a city that she was actually in a fear she did not realize because of the distinction to which she had attained that any awkwardness on her part would be looked upon as the eccentricity of a genius she decided however to say as little as possible to speak only when spoken to in that way she would try not to cause him any embarrassment or mortification

 you have certainly been a hard one to pull off the farm dear she heard now

 oh do you think so  she said coyly

do i think so he laughed well say now there isnt one person in a thousand who after writing the hit you have composed wouldnt have been over all this old land by this time letting people see them

 oh i could never wish that she said quickly

 oh come now i get into the limelight he eyed her artfully winked playfully and continued youll like it when you get the modesty out of yourself

 i dont think so

he regarded her quickly out of the comer of his eye and then looked ahead

ever heard of state street he inquired

oh yes is this it

 this is state street he said and she looked out and started she didnt know just what she had expected to see but what met her gaze and made her start was the sight of so many negroes

 whats the matter dear   he said glancing at her quickly

 why â ah â oh nothing

 i wondered why you started and he again looked ahead they were across it now and approaching wabash avenue he turned into this to where his aunt lived some distance out in the most exclusive part of its residence section

agnes sitting by his side despite the excitement the great buildings and fine streets was thinking of the past and of what she had just seen negroes negroes and that would have been her life had she married jean baptiste

all such was foreign to her but she could estimate what it would have meant she was sure she could never have become accustomed to such an association it wouldnt have seemed natural and then she thought of jean baptiste the man oh of him it was always so different in her mind he was like no other person in the world how strange and singularly sweet had been her acquaintance with him never had she understood any one as she understood him she tried to shut him out of her life for the time had come and she must but could she when she dared close her eyes she seemed to see him more clearly

the car had stopped now and he was lifting her out before a large house that stood back from the street some distance in sumptuous splendor as they went up the walkway the large front doors parted and a handsome elderly woman came forth upon her face was written refinement and culture

 oh aunt here we are

 i saw you coming because i was watching said his aunt coming forward the personification of dignity she held out her arms and agnes felt herself being embraced and kissed her head was in a whirl how could she readily become accustomed to such without displaying awkwardness

arm in arm they mounted the steps were met by the butler who took her bags and a moment later she found herself in a large richly furnished room

 come now dear he said and led her to a couch she heard his aunt going upstairs to prepare her room and the next moment she felt him draw her to him and whatever difference there was in this convenient life all men loved alike

jean baptiste lingered late at the keystone bar he was alone in the world he felt so company of the kind about seemed the best and was at least diverting it was twelve oclock and after when he left he still retained his room at the attorneys residence and to this he strolled slowly

he attempted to formulate some plans in his mind and after a time it occurred to him that he should go back west to gregory he had hired more than seven hundred fifty acres put into wheat he hadnt heard how it was or whether there was any wheat there or not but he had seen in the papers that a drought had affected much of the crop in kansas and nebraska he half heartedly assumed that it would naturally hit his country also if so there was nothing left for him to do but leave that section but he would depart from the city on the morrow and see what there was up there and with this settled in his mind he quickened his step and hurried to his room

he turned into the right number as he thought but upon trying to insert the key in the lock he found that he had made a mistake he glanced up in confusion and almost uttered a cry it was not the attorneys home but that of the reverend mc carthy

chump he said to himself as he turned and started back down the steps  ill never sleep inside that house again and laughed

upon the walk he heard steps and when he had reached the street looked up to meet glavis and a strange negro just turning in glavis glared at him as if to say  well what business have you here now   but baptiste mumbled some word of apology about having turned in at the wrong number went directly to his room retired and forgot the incident

he had no idea how long he had been asleep or what time it was when he was awakened suddenly by a drumming on his door and the attorneys voice saying  heh  heh  baptiste wake up wake up youre wanted

he turned on his side and drew his hand to his forehead to assure himself that he was awake then realizing that he was he jumped from the bed and going forward opened the door

two officers the attorney in a bath robe and glavis stood at the door he regarded them curiously  what is this   he managed to say as they came into the room

 seems that they want you said the attorney

 me  he chimed

 yep said one of the officers  will you go along peacefully or shall we have to put the bracelets on youre arrested for murder

 for murder  me for murder  

just go with the officers baptiste if youd been a little earlier you might have gotten away but it so happened that i met you coming out just as i was going in

 but i dont understand what youre talking about â all of you persisted baptiste who has been murdered and why am i accused  

the lawyer had been observing him keenly and now he interposed

why your wife and her father have just been found murdered and glavis here and another assert they met you coming out of the house at midnight or a little after

the incident of the night came back to him then  well

he muttered and began to get into his clothes when he was fully dressed he turned to the attorney and said  glavis is right in part white he was very calm

 ill call you up when i need you and then he turned to the officers and said  im ready the cuffs will not be necessary

a friend because she feared that rising as early as she had been accustomed to might serve to embarrass her fiance and his aunt agnes took a magazine from her bag returned to bed and tried to interest herself in a story the morning following her arrival in the city about seven some one knocked lightly at her door and upon opening it she found the maid with the morning paper

would you care for it she asked courteously

 i would be glad to have it she said as she took it returned to the bed and once again therein turned to read the news it was but a moment before she started up quickly as she read strange murder case on vernon avenue negro minister and his daughter found murdered about midnight jean baptiste who had lost suit against preacher arrested and held without bail as suspect was met leaving the house just before discovery of the murder

jean baptiste negro author and rancher is under arrest at the county jail this morning accused of the murder of his wife and fatherinlaw the reverend n j mc carthy at vernon avenue the dead bodies of the preacher and his daughter were discovered shortly after midnight last night by his daughter ethel and her husband upon his return from state street where he had seen baptiste leave the keystone saloon a few minutes after twelve

the murder appears to be the sequence of a long enmity between the preacher and his soninlaw baptiste some years ago baptiste had the preachers daughter take a homestead in the west on which he had purchased a relinquishment for her some months later they were married and went to live on the claim he had secured it seems that bad blood existed between the preacher and baptiste and some time after the marriage the preacher went on a trip west and when he returned brought his daughter back with him it is said that the rancher visited chicago several times following in an effort to persuade her to return

about a year ago the daughter sold a relinquishment on the homestead and baptiste accused the preacher of having influenced her to do so he also accused him of other things that contributed to the separation and finally sued the minister in the circuit court of cook county for ten thousand dollars for alienating his wifes affections the case was brought up tried and yesterday the minister was adjudged not guilty by the jury the rancher and author made a strong case against the minister and it was the consensus of opinion in the court room that the minister was guilty but it was his daughters alibi that saved him she testified that she did not and never had loved her husband and because the plaintiff was unable to prove conclusively that she had the jurys verdict was  not guilty

e m glavis also a soninlaw of the dead man testified and was corroborated by another a minister that just as he turned into his yard last night he met jean baptiste coming out he moreover claims that a few days before the trial he tried to dissuade baptiste from going through with the case and to settle it out of court but that baptiste refused to consider it that he showed his bitterness toward the now dead man by declaring that if he hadnt wished to observe and subserve to the law he would have killed the preacher long ago

it is therefore the consensus of opinion that baptiste disappointed by losing the suit entered the house and murdered his wife and fatherinlaw while they slept the circumstantial evidence is strong and it looks rather bad for the author only one phase of the case seems to puzzle the police however and that is that the preacher and his daughter were found dead in the same room the room which the minister occupied both had been stabbed with a knife that had long been in that same room the ministers body lay in bed as if he had been murdered while he was sleeping while that of the daughter lay near the door it is the opinion also of those who feel baptiste guilty that he entered the house and went to the preachers room and there killed him while he lay sleeping and that the daughter who was sleeping downstairs near her mother was possibly aroused by the noise went up to the room and was murdered as the intruder was about to leave

baptiste refused to make any comment further than that he was innocent

 accused of murder agnes echoed staring before her in much excitement jean baptiste accused of murder

she read the account again she arose and stood on the floor  he is innocent he is innocent  she cried to herself jean baptiste would not commit murder no no no

no not even if he was justified in doing so suddenly she seized her clothes and in the next instant was getting hurriedly into them

she completed her toilet quickly opened the door and slipped down the stairs the maid was at work in the hall and she approached her and said  will you kindly advise the lady of the house that i have gone downtown on some very urgent business that i shall return later in the day  

she stepped outside crossed to state street inquired of an officer the way to the county jail and a few minutes later boarded a car for the north side

she had no plans as to what she would or could do but she was going to him all that he had been to her in the past had arisen the instant she saw that he was in trouble

especially did she recall his having saved them from foreclosure and disgrace years before she was determined

she was going to him he was innocent she was positive and she would do all in her power to save him

it was rather awkward going to a place she had never dreamed of going to the county jail but she shook this resolutely from her mind and a few minutes following her arrival there she stood before the bailiff

 i am a friend of a man who was arrested in connection with a murder last night she explained to the officer

 and â ah would it be possible for me to see and consult with him

 you refer to that case on vernon avenue madam 

 yes sir

 and you would like to see this jean baptiste 

 that is the one

they regarded her closely and was finally asked to follow the bailiff

they stopped presently before a cell and when the light had been turned on she saw baptiste sitting on a cot he looked up and upon recognizing her came forward

why agnes â miss stewart you he cried in great surprise he regarded her as if afraid to try to understand her presence there

 yes jean she answered quickly  it is i she hesitated in her excitement and as she did so he caught that same mystery in her eyes they were blue and again he could swear that they were brown despite his precarious position and predicament he could not help regarding her and marking the changes that had come in the years since he had seen her she seemed to have grown a trifle stouter while her hair appeared there in the light more beautiful

her face was stronger while her lips were as red as ever

withal she had grown more serious looking she reminded him as she stood there then of a serious young literary woman and he was made hopeful by her visit

now jean ive read all about it in the papers i happened to be in the city and so came right over i know nothing about anything like this and dont suppose you do either but jean she spoke excitedly anxiously and hurriedly  i am willing to do anything you ask me to just anything jean and she regarded him tenderly he was affected by it he choked confusedly it was all so sudden

she noted his confusion and cried in a strained little voice  you must just tell me jean

 why agnes â i well i dont know what to say i dont feel that i ought to involve you in such a mess as this

i â 

oh you must not speak that way jean no no no

im here to help you you didnt kill him you didnt kill her â you didnt kill anybody did you jean

of course i didnt kill anybody agnes

 of course you didnt jean  she cried with relief i knew you were innocent i said so and i got out of bed and came at once i did

how brave how noble how kind he murmured as if to himself but she reached and placed her hand over his where it rested upon the bar

 shall i hire a lawyer jean  a great lawyer â the best in the city that would be the first thing to do wouldnt it jean 

he looked at her and could not believe it was so but finally he murmured  i have a lawyer â a friend of mine you may call on him agnes his number is vernon avenue he will tell me what to do

 and me she said quickly

yes â you he repeated and lowered his eyes

 well im going now jean and she reached for his hand

he was almost overcome and could not look at her directly

be strong jean it will come out all right â it must come out all rightâ

 oh agnes this is too much forget it you should not â

 please hush jean she said imploringly and he glanced up to see tears in her eyes she looked away to hide them

as she did so she cried oh jean i know what they have been doing to you â how you have been made to suffer and â and â i â could never stand to see it after all â she broke away then and rushed from him and out of the building he watched her and when she was gone he went back to the cot and sat him down and murmured

agnes oh agnesâ and after all that has passed

the mystery after agnes had consulted with the lawyer who was glad to go into the case and agreed to engage a worthy assistant she returned to baptiste and said  now jean dont you think that if i secured a good detective to look into it â this case it would be the proper thing 

 why â yes agnes he said he could hardly accustom himself to her in such a situation

 i think that would be best she resumed  as i was coming downtown on the car i observed the pinkerton office on th avenue and now jean if you think that would be a practical move i will go there at once and have them send a man to you ill bring him

 that would be practical agnes yes he said thoughtfully  since you insistâ

 no more please and she affected a little smile  just let me work until we arrive somewhere and she was gone returning in due time with a man

 i represent the pinkerton agency mr baptiste he said after greeting the prisoner  and now if you will state just where you were what time as near as you can recall that you reached home also what time you turned into this place where the murder was committed i shall be glad to get down to work on the case

since baptiste had observed the time by the clock in the keystone before leaving there he was quite accurate in fixing the time he reached his room since we have followed him to his room we know this phase of the case

 well ill hike over there and squint around a little

hope ill get there before the inquest is held and so saying he was gone

 i will go back to where i am staying now jean said agnes after the detective had departed  and you may expect me at any time i want to see you out of here as soon as possible and i will do all in my power to get you out

and she dashed away

the detective went to the mc carthy home forthwith

the bodies had been removed and were then at the morgue

he looked into the room where the tragedy had been committed and then sought glavis

who discovered the murder mr glavis he inquired when they stood in the death room

 why myself and another fellow returned home just after it had been committed

 how did you know it had just been committed

 well â why my wife was in the hallway and when we entered she had just discovered the bodies

 but that doesnt prove that they had just been murdered

 but my wife says she was awakened by her sisters scream

 i see so it was your wife who first discovered the bodies or that they had just been murdered

 yes

where had you been and what time did you return home 

 i had been around town to the keystone where baptiste was until shortly after midnight

you saw this baptiste leave the hotel

 i did

 how long after baptiste left was it before you followed 

 perhaps fifteen minutes

perhaps fifteen minutes but you are not positive

 no but i am quite certain

 when you left the hotel where did you go

 i came here

 you came directly here didnt stop on the way anywhere 

 i did not

 and when you arrived what happened  did you meet anybody on the way  

 i passed people of whom i took no notice on the way here of course the only person i took notice of was jean baptiste

 where did you meet him

 coming out of the house upon my arrival

 you met him coming out of the house upon your arrival  

 well out of the yard i saw him come down the steps that leads up to the house

 but you didnt see him come out of the house  

 well no i didnt see that

 did you exchange any words with him when you met him  did you stop and talk  

 no but i heard him mutter something

 did you understand the words or any words he muttered

 i thought he said something about having turned in at the wrong place

 how do you account for him having done so â if so 

well the house where he stops is just a few doors â about a half dozen â up the streetâ

 on the same side or the opposite  

 the same side and he was stopping there

 did you have any conversation with baptiste after the trial in which he sued your fatherinlaw  

 no but i tried to have him settle the case before going to court

 what did he say to it  

 refused to consider it

 did he give reasons 

 yes he said he wanted vindication

 anything else  

 that he would have killed the elder if it had not been that he was an observer of the law

 where were they murdered  

 she lay near the door while he lay in bed

any evidence of a struggle

 no not as i could see

 with what were they murdered 

 with a knife that has been in the room here for two or three years

 was baptiste aware that such a knife was in the room 

 not that i know of

 when to your knowledge was baptiste last in the house  

 he has not been in the house for more than three years

 then he couldnt have known the knife was there

well unless he discovered it when he entered the room

 providing he entered the room was he aware also that the preacher occupied this particular room is it not reasonable to suppose that he would not know where the preacher slept if he had not been in the house for three years 

 but he could have looked around

 possibly but how do you account for the girls body being here in the room also where did she sleep

 downstairs near her mother it is my theory that she was disturbed by the sound of some one walking went upstairs and was in time to see the tragedy of her father and was in turn murdered by her husband

 that is your theory but why was there no evidence of a struggle it hardly seems reasonable that she would have allowed herself to be stabbed without some effort to save herself

 well that is beyond me jean baptiste acted suspicious in my opinion and it is certainly strange that he should have been in the position he was at such a crucial time

may i consult with your wife  

glavis looked around uneasily  she is very much torn up by the incident he suggested

 but this is a very grave matter

 well and he turned and entered the room wherein ethel had enclosed herself

 ethel an officer has called and wishes to consult with you

 no no no  she yelled  send him away didnt i tell you i didnt want to see no police and she fell to crying the detective had entered the room in the meantime and when she looked up she saw him

what are you doing in here she fairly screamed

he did not flinch under the glare she turned upon him indeed the day was at last come when she could frighten no one the one she had been able to drive to any lengths with such a propaganda lay stiff at the morgue the detective regarded her searchingly and upon realizing he was not going to jump and run she ceased that unseemly noise making and began crying woefully

you discovered this tragedy madam he inquired calmly but with a note of firmness in his tone

yes yes â oh my poor sister my poor father â and that low down man

 when did you discover this madam  

 just as soon as it was done oh me 

 how did you come to discover it lady

 by my sisters scream she screamed so loud it seemed everybody must have heard it screamed when he stuck that knife into her breast 

 how long after you heard her scream was it before you came out of the room â your room

 i came at once she said sulkily and tried to cry louder

the detective was thoughtful

 so you came at once and what did you see when you came out  

at this she seemed overcome and it was some moments before he could get her answer and that was after he had repeated

 my sister and father lying murdered in the room there

 is that all you saw 

she was sulky again after a time she muttered she wrinkled her face but the tears would not come presently she said and the detective caught an effort on her part to say it

 yes but i think i heard a door slam downstairs

you think you heard a door slam what happened next  

 my husband came

 how long after the door slammed was it before your husband came  

 not long

 is it not possible that when you heard the door slam that it was your husband coming in 

no i heard the door slam behind him too again he thought he detected something singular in her manner as if she were not telling all she knew   

the detective went downstairs and talked with mrs mc carthy a few minutes and then took his leave he called up agnes and made an appointment and met her some hours later

what have you discovered she inquired anxiously her eyes searching his face

 well said he slowly  a few things i think

 and jean â mr baptiste  he looked up sharply and searched her face

 he is innocent

 thank god i  and she clasped her hands and looked down in great relief quickly she looked up however and cried  but the proof will you â can you prove it 

he toyed idly with a pencil he held in his hands and after a time drawled  i think so when the proper time comes

the proper time and â when will that be her voice was controlled but the anxiety was apparent

well well say at the preliminary hearing tomorrow morning

 and â and â you have no more to report 

 not today i shall attend the inquest of course and where may i see you â say tomorrow  

â at the hearing

 very well then good day

 good day

vengeance is mine i will repay jean she cried joyfully the detective says that i you are innocent and that he feels he will be able to place the crime where it belongs

 im glad he said solemnly she bestowed upon him a kind smile as she said  so i thought i would just come over and cheer you up

there is something mysterious about it all and the newspapers are devoting much space to it oh im so glad to hope that it will be all over tomorrow and you will be let out of this place so you can go back home and cut your wheat

 my wheat  

yes of course jean you have a fine crop of wheat on all your land

i have

 yes it is so she reassured him

as something seemed to occur to her

that you have had several failures you cannot realize that you have actually raised a crop a big crop better than any crop since â since she stopped short and he understood and suppressed a sigh when he looked up she was moving down the hallway her mind filled with something she had almost forgotten during the past two days

he knew of it she had been given quite a writeup in the social columns of a chicago paper and many lovers of her musical hit were unknown to her curious with regard to her coming marriage

and then she paused  because of the fact the detective agnes had retained called on baptistes lawyers and held a lengthy consultation when he left them an understanding had been reached with regard to the hearing and silence was agreed upon at the magistrates office the following morning the court room was crowded scores were turned away and all the family had been subpoenaed

glavis was first called and related what he knew which has already been related next came mrs mc carthy who knew even less she was followed by ethel and the detective and two lawyers questioned her closely

 now you say you heard your sister scream said the lawyer after the usual formalities had passed  will you kindly state to the court just what you overheard and know regarding this affair 

she glared at him and then her eyes met those of baptiste and she glared again she told a varied story of the case and made it very brief

 you say madame that after you heard your sister scream you rushed from your room and to where she was 

 yes she answered and those near noticed the sulkiness and when you arrived you found her dead near the door while your father lay murdered in the bed  

 yes

 do you recall mrs glavis whether she screamed long or whether it was brief

she hesitated somewhat confused presently she stiffened and said  it was long

 did it last until after you had left your bed

 it did

 until you had left the room you were in  

yes

 in fact she was screaming still when you arrived at the door of the room no doubt the lawyers tone was very careless just as though he were not in the least serious

her reply was prompt

 yes

 now mrs glavis do you recall having ever heard your sister scream before in a like manner  

she started perceptibly her eyes widened as if she were recalling an incident suddenly she became oblivious of her present surroundings and conscious of a night two years before    when she resumed her testimony she was seen to be weaker

 no she said bravely

now it so happened that the attorneys for the defense had consulted with a chemist who was in the court room by request at this juncture he was called to the stand he was asked a number of questions and then ethel was again placed on the stand now madame the court has decided to investigate this matter thoroughly you are positive jean baptiste here killed your sister also your father you remember of course in giving your testimony that we are going to investigate the case and prosecute for perjury she had been seen to raise her handkerchief to her eyes with the first announcement regarding the investigation now she uttered a loud cry as the tears flowed unchecked suddenly she dropped her handkerchief and with hor arms stretched forward she screamed no no orlean orlean oh my god orlean

and in the next instant she would have fallen in a dead faint had those near not caught her for this is how it happened

when the family returned from the court house orlean had retired at once complaining of a headache since she had very often since her father brought her home complained of such no particular attention had been paid it

she stayed in bed until late in the afternoon in the meantime her father went over to the west side presumably to call on mrs pruitt it was late when he returned about eleven oclock that night

orlean retired again about ten and had fallen into a troubled sleep she felt the same as she did the night she had returned from mrs merleys and she could not account for the strange nausea that lingered over her

when n j mc carthy returned he went to the kitchen for a drink of water after which he must return through the room in which his daughter orlean lay sleeping

as he had done on that occasion two years before he had paused at the foot of the bed to observe his sleeping daughter how long he stood thus he never knew but after a time he became conscious of that strange sensation that had come over him on the memorable night before he tried to throw off the uncanny feeling but it seemed to hang on like grim death and as he stood enmeshed in its sinister thraldom he thought he again saw her rise and point an accusing finger at him out of it all he was sure he heard again her voice in all its agony as it had spoken that other night but tonight the accusation was more severe

 there you arc again my betrayer she said coldly

 today you completed your nefarious task you completed the evil that began more than thirty years ago oh debaser of women where is speed and the wife of his you ruined

where in hell and its tortures did you say yes and where are my brothers oh dont tremble for you should know no you made me pretend to feel that you had not committed that sin and other sins also but i knew â yes i knew you never told me i had brothers you said foolish things to deceive me and the mother of mine you called me by a boys name jim and pretended because you did not recognise your illegitimate offspring that there were none and then came jean oh you had him at a disadvantage always when he was a little boy you started your evil and twenty years later you renewed it why oh yon vain sinner you know he married me â perhaps he didnt love me then as he might have âas he would have had i tried to be the woman he wished me to be but you took advantage of the weakness that was in me by the heritage of my mother and you made me subservient unto your evil will

 well its all over now and from this day henceforth you will never see peace the evil and misery you have brought unto others shall now be cast upon you you are my father and the creator of my weakness but you have taken my husband and soul mate and made a new generation impossible for me to lead and now i say unto you go forth and repent begone from me for from this day evermore though in weak flesh i may pretend to love you know that i must hate you 

he shook himself and succeeded in casting off the depression when he looked again orlean was sitting up in bed regarding him sleepily he started and wondered whether what had passed was real but in the next moment he was relieved

 papa she said in her usual but sleepylike voice  is that you

 yes daughter he replied quickly and as if to still the excitement in his heart he passed quickly around to where she reposed and planted a kiss upon her lips and turning hurried upstairs

she sat upright for some minutes after he had gone and became conscious of that singular feeling that she had felt all the day still lingering over her as she sat there she heard the little clock on the table beside her mother strike  she lay down again and a few minutes later she was asleep

the reverend retired quickly and wished he could sleep and forget what he thought he had seen and heard he was successful and soon he was snoring he could not understand upon being awakened slowly how long he had slept but he became conscious that the light was burning brightly he turned on his back and when he could see clearly his eyes fell upon orlean

she stood between him and the door and he regarded her with a puzzled expression presently his eyes met hers and he started up what was the matter with her her eyes were like coals of burning fire her stiff bushy hair was unbraided and stood away from her head giving her the appearance of a savage but it was the expression of her eyes that disturbed him he was held in a thraldom of fear as she slowly advanced toward the bed

 orlean he at last managed to say  what is the â

i have come at last to right a wrong she began in an uncanny voice never had he seen her appear like that before nor heard her speak in such a voice she paused when she was beside the bed and stood looking down upon him in that demented fashion the cold perspiration broke out all over him and he trembled

 oh you told me my husband did not love me while he worked to make us comfortable and happy out there on the claim you sat beside my sick bed and told me lies

while he grieved over the loss of our little one you conceived a vile plot to get even oh you â liar you sunk his soul into hell for spite and then today â yesterday you reached your climax by having me go on the stand and testify to a greater lie to save your wretched soul from disgrace i swore to the most miserable lie a woman could tell and now that you have made him suffer unjustly and spoiled all life held for me the judgment of god is upon you the god that you have lied to and made a laughing idol of seeks restitution so you sinner of all the sins vengeance is mine i will repay

so saying she reached quickly and grasped the knife he had found years before a desperate looking instrument with a sixinch blade and bone handle she raised it high and for the first time he was fully awakened he attempted to struggle upward but with a strength borne of excitement she pushed him and he felled backward upon the bed

 orlean my child orlean my godâoh my heaven what do you â he got no further quickly her poised arm descended and the knife she held sank deeply into his heart

 oh god â my beloved god â ah â oh â christ

christo    he struggled upward while she stood over him with that same white expression upon her face as the blood clogged in the cut the knife had made and all the pulsations concentrated struggled before ceasing their functions for all time he turned his dying eyes toward her

regarded her blindly for a moment and then dropped limply back from where he had risen dead in that moment she regained her sanity

she regarded him a moment wildly and then she closed her eyes to try to shut out the awful thing she had done and screamed long and wildly â just as she had done that night when she returned from mrs merleys then as the echo died away the door was pushed open and before her stood ethel one terrible look and the mad girl went quickly forward halted swayed and then with a moan raised the knife and sank it into her own breast drawing it forth she regarded ethel wildly and then throwing the knife against the wall of the room dropped dead at ethels feet just as glavis steps were heard in the hall below

when he heard his wife scream and had rushed upstairs saw the dead fatherinlaw and her sister he cried jean baptiste did this i just met him coming out of the house as i entered and catching his wife he quickly took her back to the room and proceeded to spread the alarm

even with the grief she was cast into ethel had quickly seen a chance to spite the man she hated and instead of telling the truth she had chosen to keep silent and let jean baptiste be convicted if possible for the crime he knew nothing of

the people were filing out of the court room ethels confession born out of the excitement when the lawyer had mentioned investigating the crime deeply had cleared everything and jean baptiste was free

in the court room during the hearing he had observed agnes but when the trial was over she was nowhere to be seen he looked around but failed to find any trace of her

at last with a sigh he went with the lawyers and a few days later was home to harvest the wheat she had told him was the best and so he found it

he was saved thereby and went into the harvest with bill and george again shocking as they had done years before but there was no agnes to bring the luncheon now and jean baptiste lived in the memory of what had once been

when the truth became known i have hardly seen you for two days my dear he complained when agnes had returned from the hearing

 i have been consumed with some very delicate business

she said and notwithstanding the excitement she was laboring under allowed him to caress her at the same time he was regarding her strangely for the first time he seemed to be aware of the fact that she was a rather strange person he was trying to understand her eyes as everybody else had done even herself

 will agnes tell me what has kept her so busy and away i know not where he asked tenderly or would she rather not â now

 shed rather not â now and she tried to be jolly although she knew she must have failed miserably

 very well my dear but sweet one when are you going to become my own  

she started in the excitement she had so recently been through the fact that she was engaged and expected to marry soon had gone entirely out of her mind

why really â when she paused in her confusion and he said quickly  lets just get married â today

 oh no please dont ask me to so soon

he frowned then he was pleasant again then when agnes

she was still confused and in that moment thought of the legacy she was more confused he caught her hand then and touched her cheek with his lips

after an hour she had told him of the legacy

 that place is less than a hundred miles from chicago and we can just run down there today and back this evening he exclaimed shifting in anxious excitement we can go there and back today and be married tomorrow

 no she said slowly  ill suggest that we have the legacy brought here and attended to according to the will and all that has for a lifetime to me been a mystery be cleared here in your and your aunts presence and the day after â i will marry you she dropped her eyes then in peculiar solemnity he didnt understand her but the thrill of what was to come overwhelmed him and in the next instant he held her in his arms

they explained their plans to his aunt who because she disliked notoriety readily agreed and by special messenger the papers were brought to the city the following day and opened according to her mothers will

the night before as they were returning from the theatre he said to her  agnes do you know â and i trust you will pardon me if it seems singular but there is something about you i can never â somehow feel i never will understand he paused then and she could see he was embarrassed

 it is in your eyes i see them in this hour and they are blue but in the next they are brown has any one ever observed the fact before he ended

she nodded affirmatively

 why is it dear  

 i dont know

 and you â you have noticed it yourself  

 yes

andâ cant you understand it either

she acknowledged the fact with her eyes

 it is strange ill be glad when we understand this legacy

 i will too

 it makes me feel that somethings going to happen

perhaps we â you are going to prove to be an heiress

she laughed cheerfully

 and then you will not want to marry me maybe

she laughed again

 but nothing would keep me from loving you always agnes he said with deep feeling

 even if the papers would show me to be descended from some horrible pirate or worse

 nothing in the world could make a difference indeed should the papers connect you with something out of the ordinary i think i would like you better â that is it would add even more mystery to your already mysterious self

 wonderful

he kissed her impulsively and in the next hour she went off to bed

 what is this   said her fiances aunt as the lawyer lifted a small package from the box of documents and as he did so an old photograph slipped and fell to the floor

it was yellow with age but the reflection of the person was clearly discernible all three looked at it in wonderment

then her fiance and his aunt regarded her with apprehension the package was untied and all the papers gone through and much history was therein contained but one fact stood above all others

is this a fact said the aunt coldly never had she appeared more dignified her nephew stood away regarding agnes out of eyes in which she could see a growing fear

 well i hope everything is clear said the lawyer astutely  it seems that you have come into something madam and i trust it will prove of value she mumbled something in reply and stood gazing at the two pictures she now held all that had been so strange to her in life was at last clear she understood the changing color of her eyes and her fathers statements that he had never quite explained at last she knew who she was

she turned to find herself alone she opened her lips and started to call the others and then hesitated why had they left her she looked at the photographs she held â and understood

she gathered the documents and placed them in the box went upstairs slowly packed her belongings and called a cab

jean baptiste came into the granary on the old claim and looked out over the place and as he did so he regarded the spot where the sod house had once stood and wherein he had spent many happy days as he thought of it the past rose before him and he lived through the sweetness again that a harvest had once brought him that was years before and in that moment he wished he could bring it back again the custom of the country and its law had forbid and he had paid the penalty he wondered whether he would do the same again and sacrifice all that had been dear and risk the misery that had followed

he shifted and in so doing his back was toward the road

 withal it would have been awkward to have married a white woman he muttered and reached for the cold lunch he had brought for his meal bill and george were eating in the field where they worked

 batching is hell he muttered aloud and picked up a sandwich

 how very bad you are jean he heard and almost strained his neck in turning so quickly

agnesi

well why not

 but â but â oh tell me and then he became silent and looked away raising the sandwich to his mouth mechanically

 dont eat the cold lunch jean i have brought some that is warm so saying she uncovered the basket she carried and he regarded it eagerly

 but agnes how came you here  i â i â thought you â were getting married are you here on â on your wedding trip

 oh lord no i no jean i am not going to marry

not going to marry

she shook her head and affected to be sad but a little smile played around her lips that he saw but didnt understand

 but â agnes why 

 because the one to whom i was engaged â well he wouldnt marry me and she laughed

 i wish you would make it all clear at least tell me what it means â that it is so

 it is so i  she said stoutly and he believed her when he saw her eyes

 well i guess ill understand by and by

you will understand soon jean she said kindly

 papa will explain â everything she turned her eyes away then and in the moment he reached and grasped her hand in the next instant he had dropped it as a far away expression came into his eyes as if he had suddenly recalled something he would forget

jean she cried and came close to him she looked up into his eyes and saw what was troubling him she got beside him closely then she placed an arm around him and with her free hand she lifted his left hand over her shoulder and held his fingers as she looked away across the harvest fields and sighed lightly as she said  something happened and i was strangely glad and came here because â because i â just had to see you jean

please jean you â willâforget that now she paused and was not aware that her arm was around him and that his hand rested over her shoulder her eyes were as they had been that day near this selfsame spot years before kind and endearing she did not resist as she saw his manly love and felt his body quiver

and almost were his lips touching hers when suddenly she saw him hesitate and despite the darkness of his face she could see that in that moment the blood seemed to leave it he dropped the arms that had embraced her and almost groaned aloud as she stood regarding him he turned and walked away with his eyes upon the earth

she turned then and retraced her steps but as she went along the roadway she was thinking of him and herself and who she was at last she sighed strangely contented and was positive â knew that in due time he too must come to understand

as it was in the beginning it was in the autumn time after the wheat and the oats the rye the barley and the flaxseed had all been gathered and threshed and also after the corn had been husked wheat he had raised thousands and thousands of bushels and because there was war over all the old world and the great powers of the land were in the grim struggle of trying to crush each other from the face of the earth the power under which he lived was struggling with the task of feeding a portion of those engaged in the struggle and because black rust had impaired the spring wheat yield those thousands of bushels he raised he had sold at a price so high that he had sufficient to redeem at last the land he was about to lose and money left for future development into the bargain

he sat alone at this moment in a stateroom aboard a great continental limited just out of omaha and speeding westward to the pacific coast as was his customary wont his thoughts were prolific but for once â and maybe for the first time on the whole he was satisfiedâ he was contented â and last but not least he was happy

being happy however is not quite possible alone no and jean baptiste was not alone and here is what had happened

jack stewart had told him the story and in the story told one great mystery was solved he now understood why agnes eyes had been so baffling simple too in a measure to begin with her mother had possessed rare brown eyes he had seen by her picture because agnes mother had not been a white woman at all but in truth was of ethiopian extraction this was a part of the story jack stewart had told him he had met and married her mother on a trip from the west indies where she had lived to glasgow the marriage being decided upon quickly for in truth the woman was fleeing in london some years before she had been the pupil of a learned minister who had become an infidel and also unscrupulous but we know the story â at least a part of it â of augustus m

barr alias isaac m barr alias â but it does not matter

we are concerned with agnes mother her mother had inherited a small fortune from agnes grandma and this barr had sought to secure to do so he had followed jack stewart and his wife agnes mother to jerusalem

there he had met isaac syfe the jew whom he later brought to america he did not find the woman he had followed there but on his return to england he did find peter kaden who was married to christine kaden was involved in a murder case was accused and had been sentenced to australia for the rest of his natural life it was barr who saved him and the fee kaden paid was christine

barr accommodated him by bringing him to america where he placed all three including himself on homesteads syfe settled with him in cash by taking a large loan on his homestead and giving barr the proceeds

but kaden was in the way he had never been comfortable in the new country with christine the wife of another and living so near so barr sent christine away and drove kaden to suicide later at lincoln nebraska she left him and went out of his life forever barr had secured kadens homestead and all this jack stewart knew but had never disclosed barr lost track of agnes mother but knew that somewhere in the world there was a treasure but not as great as he had thought it was â about ten thousand dollars in all

while jean baptiste was absorbed in these thoughts the door was opened quietly and closed some one had entered the stateroom and his ears caught the light rustle of a skirt

his eyes were upon the landscape but suddenly they saw nothing for his eyes had been covered by a pair of soft hands

 i knew it was you he said happily as he drew her into the seat beside him between himself and the window  what are you thinking of my jean she said then

 of what i have been thinking ever since the day when we understood that you and i after all are of the same blood

 oh you have she chimed and drawing his face close with her hands she kissed him ardently

 isnt it beautiful agnes just grand i 

 oh jean you make me so happy

you are honestly happy dear he inquired for the hundredth time

 i couldnt be happier and she reposed in his arms

have truly forgotten that you are an ethiopian and must share what is ethiopias  

 will share what is yours my jean

 always so beautifully have you said that

 have i now really  

 do you recall the day when i forgot dear the custom of the country â and its law

how could i forget it

and what followed

 i cannot forget that either but jean do you want me to  

 agnes we must both forget what followed still when we think how kind fate has been to us after all we must feel grateful

oh how much i do but jean â it was such a sacrifice  

he was thoughtful for a time and from the expression on his face the present was far away

 please dear she said taking his hand and fondling it

 when you happen to think of it will you try never to allow yourself to resume that expression â that expression again  

he looked down at her

 expression  

 like you wore just then

 oh

 you see it seems to bring buck events in your life that we want to forget

 you mean i â

 yes she said slowly  you â we understand each other and everything that has concerned each other dont we jean 

of course we do agnes we have always â but there now  and he smothered the rest of it in a fond caress

 wasnt it strange she mused after a time  i could never understand it i saw it in my eyes before we left indiana and then i had that strange dream and saw you

she paused and played with his fingers  but i never felt the same afterwards somehow i felt that something strange something unusual was going to happen in my life and now when i look back upon it and am so happy whereupon she grasped tightly the fingers she held ââ  i feel it just had to be

do you reckon your father understood the love that was between us  

 i think he did and he started more than once about that time to tell me something he went so far once as to say that if you liked me and i cut him off afterwards i could see that it worried you and my heart went out to you more than ever and then you reached your decision

i saw it and it seems that i liked you more for the man you were

 did you love the man you were engaged to  

 jean

he laughed sheepishly and patted her shoulder he was sorry that he had asked her such a question and he resolved thereupon never to do so again something dark passed before him â terrible years when he had suffered much she was speaking again

 you know i never loved any one in the world but you
