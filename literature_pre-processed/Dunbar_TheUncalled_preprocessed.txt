uncalled the dunbar paul laurence  novel
it was about six oclock of a winters morning in the eastern sky faint streaks of grey had come and were succeeded by flashes of red crimsoncloaked heralds of the coming day it had snowed the day before but a warm wind had sprung up during the night and the snow had partially melted leaving the earth showing through in ugly patches of yellow clay and sooty mud half despoiled of their white mantle though with enough of it left to stand out in bold contrast to the bare places the houses loomed up black dripping and hideous every once in a while the wind caught the water as it trickled from the eaves and sent it flying abroad in a chill unsparkling spray the morning came in cold damp and dismal

at the end of a short dirty street in the meanest part of the small ohio town of dexter stood a house more sagging and dilapidated in appearance than its disreputable fellows from the foundation the walls converged to the roof which seemed to hold its place less by virtue of nails and rafters than by faith the whole aspect of the dwelling if dwelling it could be called was as if conscious of its own meanness it was shrinking away from its neighbours and into itself a sickly light gleamed from one of the windows as the dawn came into the sky a woman came to the door and looked out she was a slim woman and her straggling dustycoloured hair hung about an unpleasant sallow face she shaded her eyes with her hand as if the faint light could hurt those cold steelgrey orbs  its mornin she said to those within  i ll have to be goin along to git my mans breakfast he goes to work at six oclock and i aint got a thing cooked in the house fur him some o the rest o you ll have to stay an lay her out she went back in and closed the door behind her

 la mis warren you aint agoin aready  why theres everything to be done here yit margarts to be laid out an this house has to be put into some kind of order before the undertaker comes

 i should like to know what else im agoin to do mis austin charity begins at home my mans got to go to work an he s got to have his breakfast theres cares fur the livin as well as fur the dead i say an i dont believe in tryin to be so good to them thats gone that you furgit them thats with you

mrs austin pinched up her shrivelled face a bit more as she replied  well somebody ought to stay i know i cant fur ive got a terble big washin waitin fur me at home an its been two nights sence ive had any sleep to speak of watchin here im purty near broke down

thats jest what ive been asayin repeated mrs warren  theres cares fur the livin as well as fur the dead youd ought to take care o yoreself first thing you know youll be flat o yore own back

a few other women joined their voices in the general protest against staying it was for all the world as if they had been anxious to see the poor woman out of the world and now that they knew her to be gone had no further concern for her all had something to do either husbands to get off to work or labours of their own to perform

a little woman with a weak voice finally changed the current of talk by saying ct well i guess i kin stay theres some cold things at home that my man kin git an the childernll git off to school by themselves theyll all understand

 thats right melissy davis said a hardfaced woman who had gone on about some work she was doing without taking any notice of the clamorous deserters  an ill stay with you i guess ive got about as much work to do as any of you she added casting a cold glance at the women who were now wrapped up and ready to depart  an i was nt so much of a friend of margarts as some of you neither but on an occasion like this i know what dooty is and miss hester prime closed her lips in a very decided fashion

 oh well some folks is so well off in money an time that they kin afford to be liberal with a pore creature like margart even ef they did nt have nothin to do with her before she died

miss primes face grew sterner as she replied margart brent was nt my kind durin life an that i make no bones o sayin here an now but when she got down on the bed of affliction i done what i could fur her along with the best of you an you mandy warren thats seen me here day in an day out ought to be the last one to deny that furthermore i did nt advise her to leave her husband as some people did but i did put in a word an help her to work sos to try to keep her straight afterwards though it aint fur me to be abraggin about what i done even to offset them that did nt do nothin

this parting shot told and mrs warren flared up like a wax light  its a wonder yore old tracts an the help you give her didnt keep her sober sometimes

 ef i could nt keep her sober i was nt one o them that set an took part with her when she was gittin drunk

 sh  sh   broke in mrs davis  ef i was you two i would nt go on that way margarts dead an gone now an what s past is past pore soul she had a hard enough time almost to drive her to destruction  but its all over now an we ought to put her away as peaceful as possible

the women who had all been in such a hurry had waited at the prospect of an altercation but seeing it about to blow over they bethought themselves of their neglected homes and husbands and passed out behind the still irate mrs warren who paused long enough in earshot to say  i hope that spiteful old maidll have her hands full

the scene within the room which the women had just left was anything but an inviting one the place was miserably dirty margaret had never been a particularly neat housewife even in her well days the old rag carpet which disfigured the floor was worn into shreds and blotched with grease for the chamber was cooking and dining as well as sleepingroom a stove red with rust struggled to send forth some heat the oily black kerosene lamp showed a sickly yellow flame through the grimy chimney

on a pallet in one corner lay a child sleeping on the bed covered with a dingy sheet lay the stark form out of which the miserable life had so lately passed

the women opened the blinds blew out the light and began performing the necessary duties for the dead

 anyhow let her body go clean before her maker said miss hester prime severely

 dont be too hard on the pore soul miss hester returned mrs davis  she had a hard time of it i knowed margart when she was nt so low down as in her last days

 she ought nt never to a left her husband

oh ef youd a knowed him as i did miss hester you would nt never say that he was a brute sich beatins as he used to give her when he was in liquor you never heerd tell of

 that was hard but as long as he was a husband he was a protection to her name

true enough protection is a good dish but a beatins a purty bitter sauce to take with it

i wonder whats ever become of brent

 lord knows no one aint heerd hide ner hair o him sence he went away from town people thought that he was ahangin around tryin to git a chance to kill mag after she got her divorce from him but all at once he packed off without sayin a word to anybody i guess hes drunk himself to death by this time

when they had finished with margaret the women set to work to clean up the house

sharp it covered the weakness to which she had almost given way at sight of the childs grief she bustled on about her work when mrs davis was gone but her brow was knit into a wrinkle of deep thought  a mother is a mother after all she mused aloud  even sich a one

for haste for unadulterated despatch commend me to the county burying the body politic is busy and has no time to waste on an inert human body it does its duty to its own interest and to the pauper dead when the body is dropped with all celerity into the ground the county is philosophical it says  poor devil the world was unkind to him hell be glad to get out of it well be doing him a favour to put him at the earliest moment out of sight and sound and feeling of the things that wounded him then too the quicker the cheaper and that will make it easier on the taxpayers this latter is so comforting so the order is written the funeral is rushed through and the county goes home to its dinner feeling well satisfied with itself â so potent are the consolations of philosophy at so many hundreds per year

to this general order poor margarets funeral proved no exception the morning after her decease she was shrouded and laid in her cheap pine coffin to await those last services which in a provincial town are the meed of saint and sinner alike the room in which she lay was very clean â unnaturally so â from the attention of miss prime clean muslin curtains had been put up at the windows and the one cracked mirror which the house possessed had been covered with white cloth the lacelike carpet had been taken off the floor and the boards had been scrubbed white the little stove in the corner now cold was no longer red with rust in a tumbler on a little table at margarets head stood the only floral offering that gave a touch of tenderness to the grim scene â a bunch of homegrown scarlet and white geraniums some woman had robbed her wintered room of this bit of brightness for the memory of the dead the perfume of the flowers mingled heavily with the faint odour which pervades the chamber of death â an odour that is like the reminiscence of sorrow

like a spirit of order with solemn face and quiet tread miss hester moved about the room placing one thing here another there but ever doing or changing something all with maidenly neatness what a childish fancy this is of humanitys tiptoeing and whispering in the presence of death as if one by an incautious word or a hasty step might wake the sleeper from such deep repose

the service had been set for two oclock in the afternoon one or two women had already come in to  sit but by halfpast one the general congregation began to arrive and to take their places they were mostly women the hour of the day was partially responsible for this  but then men do not go to funerals anyway if they can help it they do not revel like their sisters in the exquisite pleasure of sorrow most of the women had known pain and loss themselves and came with ready sympathy willing nay anxious to be moved to tears some of them came dragging by one hand children dressed stiffly uncomfortably and ludicrously â a medley of soiled ribbons big collars wide bows and very short knickerbockers the youngsters were mostly curious and illmannered and ever and anon one had to be slapped by its mother into snivelling decorum mrs davis came in with one of her own children and leading the dead womans boy by the hand at this a buzz of whispered conversation began

 pore little dear said one as she settled the bow more securely under her own boys sailor collar â  pore little dear hes all alone in the world

 i never did see in all my life sich a young child look so sad said another

 hm   put in a third   in this world pore motherless childern has plenty o reason to look sad i tell you

she brushed the tears off the cheek of her little son whom she had slapped a moment before she was tender now

one woman bent down and whispered into her childs ear as she pointed with one cottongloved finger see johnny see little freddie there he aint got no mother no more pore little freddie  aint you sorry fur him   the child nodded and gazed with openeyed wonder at little freddie as if he were of a new species

the curtains stirred by the blast through the loose windows flapped dismally and the people drew their wraps about them for the fireless room was cold steadily insistently the hivelike drone of conversation murmured on

 i wonder whos agoin to preach the funeral asked one

 oh mr simpson of the methodist church of course she used to go to that church years ago you know before she backslid

thats jest what ive alius said about people that falls from grace you know the last state o that man is worse than the first ah thats true enough

its aputtin yore hand to the ploughshare an then turnin back

 i wonder what the preacherll have to say fur her its a mighty hard case to preach about

im wonderin too what hell say an where hell preach her

well its hard to tell you know the methodists believe that theres salvation to be found between the stirrup an the ground 

its a mighty comfortin doctern too

 an then they do say that she left some dyin testimony though i aint never heerd tell the straight of it

 he cant preach her into heaven o course after her life leastways it dont hardly seem like it would be right an proper

well i dont think he kin preach her into hell neither after a woman has gone through all that pore margart has it seems to me that the lord ought to give her some consideration even if men dont

i do declare seely matthews with yore free thinkin an free speakin  you re put nigh a infidel

 no i aint no infidel neither but i aint one o them that sings  when all thy mercies o my god and thinks o the lord as if he was a great big cruel man

 well i dont neither but â 

sh sh

the womans declaration of principle was cut short by the entrance of the minister the rev mr simpson he was a tall gaunt man in a coat of rusty black his hair of an indeterminate colour was slightly mixed with grey a pair of bright grey eyes looked out from underneath bushy eyebrows his lips were close set his bony hands were large and ungainly the rev mr simpson had been a carpenter before he was  called he went immediately to the stand where lay the bible and hymnbook he was followed by a man who had entered with him â a man with soft eyes and a kindly face he was as tall as the pastor and slender but without the others gauntness he was evidently a church official of some standing

with strange inappropriateness the preacher selected and gave out the hymn sister thou wast mild and lovely gentle as the summers breeze

with some misgivings it was carried through in the wavering treble of the women and the straggling bass of the few men  then the kindlyfaced man whom the preacher addressed as  brother hodges knelt and offered prayer the supplication was very tender and childlike even by the light of faith he did not seek to penetrate the veil of divine intention nor did he throw his javelin of prayer straight against the deitys armour of eternal reserve he left all to god as a child lays its burden at its fathers feet and many eyes were moist as the people rose from their knees

the sermon was a noisy and rather inconsequential effort the preacher had little to say but he roared that little out in a harsh unmusical voice accompanied by much slapping of his hands and pounding of the table towards the end he lowered his voice and began to play upon the feelings of his willing hearers and when he had won his meed of sobs and tears when he had sufficiently probed old wounds and made them bleed afresh when he had conjured up dead sorrows from the grave when he had obscured the sun of heavenly hope with the vapours of earthly grief he sat down satisfied

the people went forward some curiously some with sympathy to look their last on the miserable dead mrs davis led the weeping child forward and held him up for a last gaze on his mothers face the poor geraniums were wiped and laid by the dead hands and then the undertaker glided in like a stealthy blackgarmented ghost he screwed the pinetop down and the coffin was borne out to the hearse he clucked to his horses and with brother hodges and the preacher in front and mrs davis miss prime and the motherless boy behind the little funeral train moved down the street towards the graveyard a common but pathetic spectacle

mrs warren had remained behind to attend to the house she watched the short procession out of sight  i guess margart did nt have no linen worth havin she said to herself  but ill jest look and look she did but without success in disappointment and disgust she went out and took the streamer of dusty black and dingy white crape from the door where it had fluttered and bringing it in laid it on the empty trestles that the undertaker might find it when he came for them she took the cloth off the mirror and then with one searching look around to see that she had missed nothing worth taking she went out closing and locking the door behind her

 i guess im as much entitled to anything mag had as any one else said mrs warren

by common consent and without the formality of publication or proclamation the women had agreed to meet on the day after the funeral for the purpose of discussing what was best to be done with the boy fred from the moment that mrs davis had taken charge of him he had shown a love for her and confidence in her care that had thoroughly touched that good womans heart she would have liked nothing better than to keep him herself but there were already five hungry little davises and any avoidable addition to the family was out of the question to be sure in the course of time there were two more added to the number but that was unavoidable and is neither here nor there the good woman sat looking at the boy the night after his mother had been laid away he sat upon the floor among her own children playing in the happy forgetfulness of extreme youth but to the mothers keen eye there was still a vague sadness in his bearing involuntarily the scene and conditions were changed and instead of poor margaret she herself had passed away and was lying out there in a newmade grave in bleak and dreary woodland she thought how her own bairns would be as motherless and forlorn as the child before her and yet not quite either for they had a father who loved them in his own quiet undemonstrative way this should have consoled her in the sorrows she had conjured up but like a woman she thought of the father helpless and lonely when she had gone with the children huddled cheerlessly about him and a veil of tears came between her and the youngsters on the floor with a great rush of tenderness she went and picked the motherless boy up and laid his head on her breast

pore freddie she said i wish you could stay here all the time and play with the other little ones

the child looked up at her with wondering eyes  i kin stay till mamma comes back he answered

 but freddie dear mamma wont come back any more shes  â the woman hesitatedâ  shes in heaven

 i want my mamma to come back moaned the child  i dont want her to stay in heaven

 but you must nt cry freddie an some day you kin go an see mamma

the childs curiosity got the better of his grief he asked  is heaven far mis davis  

yes dear awful far she answered but she was wrong heaven is not far from the warm heart and tender hands of a good woman

the childs head drooped and he drowsed in her arms

put him to bed melissy â pore little fellow said her husband in husky tones he had been listening and watching them around the edge of his paper the child slept on while the woman undressed him and laid him in the bed

on the morrow the women dropped in one by one until a halfdozen or more were there to plan the boys future they were all poor and most of them had families of their own but all hoped that there might be some plan devised whereby margarets boy might find a refuge without going to the orphans asylum an institution which is the detestation of women mrs davis in expressing her feelings expressed those of all the others  i hate so to think of the pore little feller goin to one o them childerns homes the boys goin around in them there drab clothes o theirs alius look like prisners to me an they aint much better off

an then childern do learn so much weekedness in them places from the older ones put in another

 oh as fur that matter hell learn devilment soon enough anywhere snapped mrs warren  with that owdacious father o his before him i would nt take the child by no means though his mother an me was friends fur bloods bound to tell an with sich blood as hes got in him i dont know what hell come to an im shore i dont want to be araisin no gallusbirds

the women felt rather relieved that mrs warren so signally washed her hands of freddie that was one danger he had escaped the woman in question had as she said been a close friend of margarets and as such an aider in her habits of intemperance it had been apprehended that her association with the mother might lead her to take the child

 i d like to take freddie myself mrs davis began again  but with my five an john out o work half the time another mouth to feed an another pair o feet to cover would mean a whole lot though i do think that ef i was dead an my childern was sent to that miserable orphans home id turn over in my grave

its a pity we dont know some good family that aint got no childern that ud take him an bring him up as their own son said a little woman who took the hearthside

sich people aint growin on trees no place about dexter mrs warren sniffed

 well im sure i ve read of sich things ef the child was in a book it ud happen to him but he aint hes a flesh and blood youngster an alivin in dexter

you couldnt give us no idee what to do could you mis austin  

 lord love you mis davis ive jest been asettin here purty nigh athinkin my head off but i aint seen a gleam of light yit you know how i feel an jest how glad id be to do something but then my man growls about the three weve got

 thats jest the way with my man said the little woman who took her ideas of life from the literature in the hearthside he alius says that pore folks ought nt to have so many childern

 well its a blessin that margart did nt have no more fur goodness knows its hard enough disposin o this one

just then a tap came at mrs daviss door and she opened it to admit miss hester prime

 im ruther late gittin here said the newcomer  but ive been aneglectin my work so in the last couple o days that ive had a power of it to do today to ketch up

 oh we re so glad youve come   said one of the women  mebbe you kin help us out of our fix we re in sich a fix about little freddie

we dont want to send the pore little dear to the childerns home broke in another

its sich an awful place fur young childern â

 an they do look so pitiful â 

 an learn so much weekedness

and as is the manner of women in council they all began talking at once pouring into the newcomers ears all the suggestions and objections hopes and fears that had been made or urged during their conference

to it all miss hester listened and there was a soft glow on her face the while but then she had been walking which may account for the flush the child all unconscious that his destiny was being settled was playing with two of the little davises at the other end of the room the three days of good food good treatment and pleasant surroundings had told on him and he looked less forlorn and more like the child that he was he was clean his brown eyes were sparkling with amusement and his brown hair was brushed up into the damp  roach  so dear to a womans heart he was thus a far less forbidding sight than on the morning of his mothers death when dingy and haggard he rose from his dirty pallet as she listened to the varied remarks of her associates miss hester allowed her eyes to wander to the childs face and for a moment a tenderer expression grew about her lips but in an instant it was gone and as if she had been near committing herself to folly she made amends by drawing her countenance into more than its usually severe lines

mrs warren who was always ready with a stab and who had not forgotten her encounter of two days ago spoke up with a little malicious laugh  miss hester aint got no family mebbe she might take the child pears like she ought to be fond o childern

mrs davis immediately came to the rescue we dont expect no sich thing of miss hester shes never been around childern an dont know nothin about takin keer o them an boys air hard to manage anyhow

 oh i should think miss hester could manage most anything was the sneering rejoinder

the women were aghast at such insolence they did nt know what the effect might be on miss prime they looked at her in alarm her cold grey eye impaled mrs warren for an instant only and then paying no more attention to her she said quietly  i was thinkin this whole matter over while i was finishin up my work to come here an says i to myself  now theres melissy davis â shes the very one that ud be a mother to that child says i  an shed bring him up right as a child should be brought up i dont know no more mannerly niceappearin childern in this neighbourhood or the whole town fur that matter than melissysâ 

 oh miss hester   faltered mrs davis

but miss prime went on unheeding the interruption  thinks i  melissys got a houseful already an she cant take another then you comes into my mind mis austin an says i  la me shes got three herself an is young yit shell have her hands full to look after her own family well i thought of you all an some of you had families an some of you had to go out fur days work an then theres some peoples hands i would nt want to see the child fall into this with an annihilating glance in mrs warrens direction you know what the bible says about the sins of the father  well that child needs proper raisin so in this way the lord showed it to me that it was my dooty to take up the burden myself

first there was an absolute silence of utter astonishment and then  oh miss hester  broke from a full chorus of voices

you dont reelly mean it miss hester   said mrs davis

i do that but i want you all to understand that it aint a matter of pleasure or desire with me its dooty ef i see a chance to save a soul from perdition an dont take it i am responsible myself to the lord for that soul

the women were almost too astounded to speak mrs warren not less than the rest of them she had made her suggestion in derision and here it was being acted upon in sober earnest she was entirely routed

now melissy ef there aint no one that disagrees with me you might as well pack up what few things the child has an ill take him along

no one objected and the few things were packed up  come freddie said mrs davis tremulously get on yore hat the child obeyed  you re agoin to be miss hesters little boy now you must be good

miss prime held out her hand to him but the child drew back and held to his protectresss skirt a hurt expression came into the spinsters face it was as if the great sacrifice she was making was being belittled and rejected by a child mrs warren laughed openly

 come freddie be nice now dear go with miss hester

i want to stay with you cried the child

 pore little dear   chorussed the women

 but mis davis cant keep the little boy now he must go with miss prime an sometimes he kin come an see mis davis an play with john an harriet wont that be nice  

 i want to stay with you

 come frederick said miss prime

 go now like a good boy repeated mrs davis heres a copper fur you take it in yore little hand â thats a man now kiss me goodbye kiss john an harriet

the child seeing that he must go had given up resistance and doing as he was bidden took miss primes hand sobbingly some of us do not learn so soon to bow to the inevitable

 goodbye ladies i must git back to my work said miss hester

 goodbye goodbye miss hester came the echo

the moment the door closed behind her and her charge there was a volley of remarks  oh i do hope shell be good to him  i wonder how shell manage him

 pore child he did nt want to go at all  whod have thought it of miss hester   i wish i could have kept him myself said mrs davis tearfully  it hurt my heart to see him cling to me so

 never you mind melissy davis  youve done yore whole dooty as well as you could mrs warren rose and put her shawl over her head preparatory to going as fur my part she said  id a ruther seen that child in the childerns home devilment or no devilment than where he is he wont dare to breathe from this hour on the women were silent for a moment and then mrs davis said  well miss hesters wellmeanin

at the top of the mean street on which margarets house was situated and looking down upon its meaner neighbours in much the same way that its mistress looked upon the denizens of the street stood miss primes cottage it was not on the mean street â it would have disdained to be â but sat exactly facing it in prim watchfulness over the unsavoury thoroughfare which ran at right angles the cottage was one and a half stories in height and the upper halfstory had two windows in front that looked out like a pair of accusing eyes it was painted a dull lead colour in summer the front yard was filled with flowers hollyhocks bachelorsbuttons sweetwilliam and a dozen other varieties of blooms but they were planted with such exactness and straightness that the poor flowers looked cramped and artificial and stiff as a party of angular ladies dressed in bombazine here was no riot nor abandon in growth everything had its place and stayed therein or was plucked up

 i jest cant abide to see flowers growin every which way miss prime used to remark  fur all the world like a neighbourhood with different peoples children traipsin through everybody elses house everything in order is my motto

miss hester had nearly arrived at her fortieth milestone and she effected the paradox of looking both younger and older than her age younger because she had always taken excellent care of herself her form had still much of the roundness of youth and her step was sprightly and firm she looked older than her age because of the strong lines in her face the determined set of her lips and the general air of knowledge and selfsufficiency which pervaded her whole being throughout her life she had sacrificed everything to duty whether it was the yearning of her own heart or the feelings of those who loved her in the world about her she saw so much of froth and frivolity that she tried to balance matters by being especially staid and stern herself she did not consider that in the seesaw of life it takes more than one person to toss up the weight of the worlds wickedness her existence was governed by rigid rules from which she never departed

it is hard to explain just what miss hesters position was among the denizens of the poorer quarter she was liked and disliked admired and feared she would descend upon her victims with unasked counsel and undesired tracts her voice was a trumpet of scathing invective against their shiftlessness their untidiness and their immorality but her hand was as a horn of plenty in straitened times and her presence in sickness was a comfort she made no pretence to being goodhearted  in fact she resented the term as applied to herself it was all duty with her

up through the now dismantled garden to the prim cottage she led the boy fred the child had not spoken a word since he had left the house of his friend his little heart seemed to be suddenly chilled within him miss hester had been equally silent her manner was constrained and embarrassed she had indeed tried to find some words of soothing and encouragement to say to the child such as she had heard melissa davis use but she could not they were not a part of her lifes vocabulary several times she had essayed to speak but the sentences that formed in her mind seemed so absurd and awkward that she felt them better unsaid

it is true that every natural woman has the maternal instinct but unless she has felt the soft face of a babe at her breast and looked down into its eyes as it drew its life from her life she can know nothing of that freemasonry of womanhood which by some secret means too deep and subtle for the knowledge of outsiders wins the love of childhood it is not so with men because the childish mind does not demand so much of them even though they be fathers to be convinced look about you and see how many more bachelors than maids are favourites with children

once within the house miss hester was at an entire loss as to what to do with her charge she placed him in a chair where he sat disconsolately she went to the bookshelves and laid her hand upon  pilgrims progress then she reflected that freddie was just five years old and she allowed a smile to pass over her face but her perplexity instantly chased the expression away

 how on airth am i agoin to do any work   she asked herself  i m shore i cant set down an tell that child stories all the time as ive heerd tell o folks doin what shall i do with him  she had had a vague idea that the time of children was taken up in some way she knew of course that they had to be washed and dressed that they had to eat three times a day and after all to sleep but what was to be done with them in the mean time 

 oh sighed the poor woman  if he was only old enough to go to school  the wish was not entirely unmotherly as motherhood goes in these days for it is not an unusual thing for mothers to send their babes off to kindergarten as soon as they begin to babble in order to be relieved of the responsibility of their care but neither wishes nor hopes availed it was a living present situation with which miss hester had to grapple suddenly she bethought herself that children like pictures and she secured from the shelf a copy of the  bible lookingglass this she opened and spread out on the childs knees he glanced at it a moment or two and then began to turn the leaves his eyes riveted on the engravings

miss hester congratulated herself and slipped out to work the thought came to her of course that the novelty of  bible lookingglasses  could nt remain for ever but she put the idea by in scorn  sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof the book was good while it lasted it entertained the child and gave him valuable moral lessons this was the womans point of view to fred there was no suggestion of moral lessons it was merely a lot of very fine pictures and when miss prime had gone he relaxed some of his disconsolate stiffness and entered into the contemplation of them with childish zest his guardian however did not abandon her vigilance and in a few minutes she peeped through the door from the kitchen where she was working to see how her charge got on the sight which met her eyes made her nearly drop the cup which she held in her hand and with which she had been measuring out flour for a cupcake with the book spread out before him freddie was lying flat on his stomach on the floor with his little heels contentedly kicking the air his attitude was the expression of the acme of childish satisfaction

miss primes idea of floors was that they were to be walked on scrubbed measured and carpeted  she did not remember in all the extent of her experience to have seen one used as a readingdesk before but she withdrew without a word  the child was quiet and that was much

about this time any one observing the cottage would have seen an oldfashioned phaeton to which a plump old nag was hitched driven up to the door and halted and a man alight and enter at the gate if the observer had been at margarets funeral he would instantly have recognised the man as the rev mr simpsons assistant mr hodges the man walked deliberately around to the kitchen and tapping at the door opened it without ceremony and went in calling out  miss hester miss hester im arunnin right in on you

 i do declare liphalet hodges you do beat all fur droppin in on a body at unexpected times

well i guess you re right my cornin s a good deal like the second cornin o the son o manll be i guess you re right

to miss prime eliphalet hodges was always unexpected although he had been dropping in this way before her mother and father died twenty years gone

 well i mow liphalet that you ve heerd the news

 there aint no grass grows under the feet of the talkers in this town i tell you

 dear me  a body cant turn aroun without settin a whole forest of tongues awaggin every which way

 oh well miss hester we got to low that to yore sex the women folks must talk

 my sex  it aint my sex only i know plenty o men in this town who air bigger gossips n the women ill warrant you did nt git this piece o news from no woman

 well mebbe i did nt but i caclate there want no men there to git it fust hand

 oh ill be bound some o the women had to go an tell a man the fust thing some women cant git along without the men

 an then agin some of em kin miss hester some ofem kin

 youd jest as well start out an say what you want to say without abeatin about the bush i know jest as well as i know im alivin that youve come to tell me that i was a fool fur takin that child liphalet dont pertend  i know it

 oh no miss hester i would nt dast do nothin like that you know  he that calleth his brother a fool is in danger o hell fire an i low the lord dont make it no easier when it happens to be a sister no miss hester you know yore own business best an youve got along this fur without bein guided by people i guess youll git through but a child miss hester dont you think that its a leetle bit resky  

 resky  i dont see why the child aint agoin to eat me or burn the house down

 no no â none o that â i dont mean that at all but then you see you aint never had no â that is â you aint had much experunce in the bringin up o childern specially boys

 much  i aint had none but ive been brought up

 thats true thats true an a mighty good job yore mother made of it too i dont know of no spryer or stirriner woman around here at yore age

at my age liphalet you do talk as ef i was about fifty

 well ef i do i aint a sayin what i want to say so i d better hush where is the little fellow  

for answer miss prime pushed the door open and bade him peep freddie was still upon the floor absorbed in his book the mans face lighted up he pulled the door to long enough to say  i tell you miss hester that boys agoin to make a great reader or a speaker or somethin jest look how wrapped up he is in that book  well i do hope an pray to goodness that hell make somethin better than his father ever made

 ef he dont under yore trainin itll be because there aint nothin in him â come here freddie called hodges pushing the door open and holding out his hand with a smile the child got up from the floor and came and put his hand in the outstretched one

well i declare exclaimed miss hester  i tried my level best to git that child to make up with me an he would nt

its jest like i say miss hester you aint never had no experunce in raisin childern

 an how many have you ever raised liphalet  

the bachelor acknowledged defeat by a sheepish smile and turned again to the child you want to go aridin in my buggy freddie  

yes sir said the child unhesitatingly

all right uncle liphll take him out fur a while git his hat an wrap him up miss hester so jack frost cant ketch him

the man stood smiling down into the childs face the boy smiling back tightened his grasp on the big hand they were friends from that moment eliphalet hodges and fred

they went out to the old phaeton with miss primes parting injunction ringing after them  dont keep that child out in the cold too long liphalet an bring him back here croupy

 oh now dont you trouble yoreself miss hester me an freddie air agoin to git along all right we aint agoin to freeze air we freddie boy  ah not by a long sight not ef uncle liph knows hisself

all the time the genial man was talking he was tucking the laprobe snugly about the child and making him comfortable then he clucked to the old mare and they rattled away

there was a faraway look in miss primes eyes as she watched them till they turned the corner and were out of sight  i never did see sich a man as liphalet hodges why a bodyd think that hed been married an raised a whole houseful o childern hes worsen a old hen an its marvellous the way frederick took to him everybody calls the child freddie i must learn to call him that it will make him feel more homelike though it does sound foolish

she went on with her work but it was interrupted every now and then by strange fits of abstraction and revery an unusual thing for this bustling and practical spinster but then there are few of us but have had our hopes and dreams and it would be unfair to think that miss hester was an exception for once she had broken through her own discipline and in her own kitchen was spending precious moments in dreams and all because a man and a child had rattled away in a rickety buggy

goodness gracious mis smith

exclaimed mrs martin rushing excitedly into the house of her nextdoor neighbour  you  d ought to seen what i seen jest now

 oh i m shore you d never guess in the wide wide world

 well after a while he come out asmilin as pleasant as a basket o chips  an i like to fell through the winder fur he was aleadin by the hand â who do you suppose  

 i aint got a mortal idea who said mrs smith unless it was miss hester an they re married at last

 what a woman you air sallie martin   said mrs smith admiringly  but do hurry back an tell me what she says im jest dyin to know

 ill be back in little or no time because i cant stay nohow

mrs martin threw the borrowed shawl over her head and set off down the street she and her friend were not dwellers on the mean street and so they could pretend to so nearly an equal social footing with miss prime as to admit of an occasional neighbourly call

through the window miss prime saw her visitor approaching and a grim smile curved the corners of her mouth  cornin fur news muttered the spinster  shell git all she wants before she goes but there was no trace of suspicion in her manner as she opened the door at mrs martins rap

 hey oh miss hester busy as usual i see

yes indeed people that try to do their dooty aint got much time fur rest in this world

no indeed its dig dig dig and work work work

 take off yore shawl an set down sallie its a wonder you dont take yore death o cold or git plum full o neuralgy arunnin around in this weather with nothin but a shawl over yore head

 la miss hester they say that worthless peoples hard to kill it aint alius true though fur there was poor margart brent she was nt worth much but my  she went out like a match

yes but matches dont go out until their time ef theyre held down right an its jest so with people

thats true enough miss hester was you to margarts funeral  

oh yes i went

 did you go out to the cimetery  

 oomph huh

 did she look natural  

jest as natural as one could expect after a hard life an a hard death

 pore margart  mrs martin sighed there was a long and embarrassed silence miss primes lips were compressed and she seemed more aggressively busy than usual she bustled about as if every minute were her last one she brushed off tables set chairs to rights and tried the goldenbrown cupcake with a straw to see if it were done her visitor positively writhed with curiosity and discomfiture finally she began again  margart only had one child did nt she   yes that was all

 pore little lamb motherless childern has a hard time of it

 indeed most of em do

 do you know whats become of the child miss hester  

 yes i do sallie martin an you do too or you would nt be asettin there beatin about the bush askin me all these questions this sudden outburst gave mrs martin quite a turn but she exclaimed  i declare to goodness miss hester i aint heerd a livin thing about it only â 

she checked herself but her relentless hostess caught at the word and demanded  only what mis martin  

well i seen brother liphalet hodges takin him away from here in his buggyâ  an so you come down to see what was what eh sos you could be the first to tell the neighbourhood  

 now miss hester you know that i aint one o them that talks but i do feel sich an interest in the pore motherless child an when i seen brother hodges atakin him away i thought perhaps he was agoin to take him to raise

well brother hodges aint agoin to take him to raise

 mercy sakes miss hester dont git mad but who is  

 i am thats who

 miss prime what air you asayin  you shorely dont mean it what kin you do with a child  

 i kin train him up in the way he ought to go an keep him out o other peoples houses an the street

well o course thats somethin said mrs martin weakly

 somethin  why its everything the visitor had now gotten the information for which she was looking and was anxious to be gone she was absolutely bursting with her news

well i must be goin she said replacing her shawl and standing in embarrassed indecision  i only run in fur a minute i hope you aint got no hard feelins at my inquisitiveness

not a bit of it you wanted to know an you come and asked thats all

 i hope youll git along all right with the child

 i sha nt stop at hopin i shall take the matter to the lord in prayer

yes he knows best goodbye miss hester

 goodbye sallie come in agin the invitation sounded a little bit sarcastic and once more the grim smile played about miss primes mouth

 i low she observed to herself as she took the cake from the oven for the last time tried it and set it on the table â i low that i did give sallie martin one turn i never did see sich a woman fur pryin into other folks business

swift are the wings of gossip and swift were the feet of mrs sallie martin as she hurried back to tell the news to her impatient friend who listened speechless with enjoyment and astonishment

who would a thought you could a talked it out o her so   she gasped

 oh i led her right along tell she told me everything said mrs martin with a complacency which remembering her reception she was far from feeling

shortly after her departure and while no doubt reinforced by mrs smith she was still watching at the window liphalet hodges drove leisurely up to the door again

well freddie he said as he helped the child to alight  weve had a great time together we have an we aint frozen neither i told miss prime that she neednt be afeared dont drop yore jumpinjack now an be keerful an dont git yore hands on yore apron cause theyre kind o sticky miss hester ud take our heads off ef we come back dirty

the childsarms were full of toys â a jumpingjack a climbing monkey a popgun and the etceteras of childish amusementâ and his pockets and cheeks bulged with candy

 la liphalet exclaimed miss prime when she saw them  what on airth have you been abuyin that childâjumpinjacks an sich things  they aint a bit o good ceptin to litter up a house an put lightness in childerns minds freddie whats that on yore apron  goodness me  an look at them hands â candy  liphalet hodges i did give you credit fur better jedgment than this candy is the cause o more aches an pains than poison an some of its reelly colored with arsnic how do you expect a child to grow up healthy an with sound teeth when you feed him on candy  

now miss hester now now now i dont want to be ainterferin with yore busness but its jest like i said before an i will stick to it you aint never had no experunce in raisin children they cant git along jest on meat an bread an jam they need candy â an â ah â candy â an sich things mr hodges ended lamely looking rather guiltily at the boys bulging pockets  a little bit aint agoin to hurt no child

 liphalet i ve got a dooty to perform towards this motherless child an i aint agoin to let no foolish notions keep me from performin it

 miss hester im atryin to follow him that was a father to the fatherless an a husband to the widow â strange that was made only to the widow â an ive got somethin of a idee o dooty myself you may think im purty presumptuous but ive took a notion into my head to kind o help along araisin freddie i aint agoin to question yore authority or nothin but i thought mebbe youd len me the child once in a while to kind o lighten up that old lonesome place o mine i know that freddie wont object

 oh liphalet do go long i scarcely know whether you air a man or a child sometimes

 theres one that saysc except you become as a little child  â 

 liphalet will you go long home  

 i spect id better be gittin along â goodbye freddie be a good boy an some day ill take you up to my house an let you ride old bess around â goodbye miss hester and as he passed out to his buggy he whistled tenderly something that was whistled when he was a boy

the life of one boy is much like that of another they all have their joys and their griefs their triumphs and their failures their loves and their hates their friends and their foes much as men have them in that maturer life of which the days of youth are an epitome it would be rather an uninteresting task and an entirely thankless one to follow in detail the career of frederick brent as he grew from childhood to youth but in order to understand certain traits that developed in his character it will be necessary to note some at least of the circumstances that influenced his early life

while miss prime grew to care for him in her own unemotional way she had her own notions of how a boy should be trained and those notions seemed to embody the repression of every natural impulse she reasoned thus  human beings are by nature evil evil must be crushed ergo everything natural must be crushed in pursuance of this principle she followed out a deliberate course of restriction which had it not been for the combating influence of eliphalet hodges would have dwarfed the mental powers of the boy and cramped his soul beyond endurance when he came of an age to play marbles he was forbidden to play because it was to miss hesters mind a species of gambling swimming was too dangerous to be for a moment considered fishing without necessity was wanton cruelty flying kites was foolishness and a waste of time

the boy had shown an aptitude at his lessons that had created in his guardians mind some ambition for him and she held him down to his books with rigid assiduity he was naturally studious but the feeling that he was being driven made his tasks repellent although he performed them without outward sign of rebellion while he fumed within

his greatest relaxations were his trips to and from his old friend hodges if miss prime crushed him this gentle soul comforted him and smoothed out his ruffled feelings it was this influence that kept him from despair away from his guardian he was as if a chain that galled his flesh had been removed and yet he could not hate miss hester for it was constantly impressed upon him that all was being done for his good and the word  duty  was burned like a fiery cross upon his heart and brain

there is a bit of the pagan in every natural boy and to give him too much to reverence taxes his powers until they are worn and impotent by the time he reaches manhood under miss hesters tutelage too many things became sacred to fred brent it was wicked to cough in church as it was a sacrilege to play with a hymnbook his training was the apotheosis of the nonessential but after all there is no rebel like nature she is an iconoclast

when he was less than ten years old an incident occurred that will in a measure indicate the manner of his treatment miss primes prescription for making a good boy was two parts punishment two parts admonition and six parts prayer accordingly as the watchful and sympathetic neighbours said  she an that pore child fairly lived in church

it was one classmeeting night and as usual the boy and his guardian were sitting side by side at church it was the habit of some of the congregation to bring their outside controversies into the classroom under the guise of testimonies or exhortations and there to air their views where their opponents could not answer them one such was daniel hastings the trait had so developed in him that whenever he rose to speak the question ran around  i wonder who danl s agoin to rake over the coals now on this day he had been having a tilt with his oldtime enemy thomas donaldson over the advent into dexter of a young homoeopathic doctor with characteristic stubbornness danl had held that there was no good in any but the oldschool medical men and he sneered at the idea of anybodys being cured with sugar as he contemptuously termed the pellets and powders affected by the new school thomas who was considered something of a wit and who sustained his reputation by the perpetration of certain timeworn puns had replied that other hogs were sugarcured and why not danl  this had turned the laugh on hastings and he went home from the corner grocery where the men were congregated in high dudgeon

still smarting with the memory of his defeat when he rose to speak that evening he cast a glance full of unfriendly significance at his opponent and launched into a fiery exhortation on true religion  some folks religion he said  is like sugar all sweetness and no power but i want my religion like i want my medicine i want it strong an i want it bitter sos ill know ive got it in fred brent the sense of humour had not been entirely crushed and the expression was too much for his gravity he bowed his head and covered his mouth with his hand he made no sound but there were three pairs of eyes that saw the movementâ miss primes eliphalet hodges and the rev mr simpsons miss primes gaze was horrified mr simpsons stern but in the eye of mr hodges there was a most ungodly twinkle

when danl hastings had finished his exhortationâwhich was in reality an arraignment of thomas donaldsons medical heresies â and sat down the rev mr simpson arose and bending an accusing glance upon the shrinking boy began   i perceive on the part of some of the younger members of the congregation a disposition towards levity the house of god is not the place to find amusement i never see young people deriding their elders without thinking of the awful lesson taught by the lords judgment upon those wicked youths whom the shebears devoured i never see a child laughing in church without trembling in spirit for his future some of the men whom i have seen in prison condemned to death or a life of confinement have begun their careers just in this way showing disrespect for their elders and for the church beware young people who think you are smart and laugh and titter in the sanctuary there is a prison waiting for you there is a hell yawning for you behold there is death in the pot 

with a terrible look at the boy mr simpson sat down there was much craning of necks and gazing about but few in the church would have known to whom the pastors remarks were addressed had not miss prime at their conclusion sighed in an injured way and rising with set lips led the culprit out as a criminal is led to the scaffold how the boy suffered as with flaming face he walked down the aisle to the door the cynosure of all eyes he saw in the faces about him the accusation of having done a terrible thing something unheard of and more wicked than he could understand he felt revolted child as he was at the religion that made so much of his fault inwardly he vowed that he would never  get religion  or go into a church when he was big enough to have his own way

they had not gone far when a step approached them from behind and eliphalet hodges joined them miss prime turned tragically at his greeting and broke out dont reproach me liphalet it aint no trainin o mine thats perduced a child that laughs at old foks in the lords house

 i aint agoin to reproach you miss hester never you fear i aint agoin to say a word agin yore trainin but i jest thought id ask you not to be too hard on freddie  you know that danl is kind o tryin sometimes even to the gravity of older people an childern will be childern they aint got the sense nor â nor â the deceit to keep a smooth face when they re alaughin all in their innards

miss prime turned upon him in righteous wrath  liphalet she exclaimed  i think its enough fur this child to struggle aginst natural sin without encouragin him by makin excuses fur him

it aint my intention nor my desire to set a bad example before nobody especially the young lambs of the flock but i aint agoin to blame freddie fur doin what many another of us wanted to do

 deed an double that is fine talk fur you liphalet hodges you a trustee of the church an been a classleader aholdin up fur sich onregenerate carryinson

 i aint aholdin up fur nothin miss hestercep tin nature an the very could nthelpitness o the thing altogether i aint a boy no more by a good many years but theres times when ive set under danl hastingss testimonies jest mortally cramped to laugh  an ef its so with a man how will it be with a pore innercent child  i aint aexcusin natural sin in nobody it want so much freddies natural sin as it was danls natural funniness and there was something very like a chuckle in liphalets throat

liphalet the devils been puttin fleas into yore ear but i aint agoin to let you argy me out o none o my settled convictions although the old mans put plenty of argyment into yore head thats his way o capturin a soul â walk on ahead frederick an dont be listnin ill tend to yore case later on

 its funny to me miss hester how it is that christians know so much more about the devils ways than they do about the lords they re alius asayin the lord moves in a mysterious way but they kin alius put their finger on the devil

 liphalet hodges thats a slur  

 i aint ameanin it as no slur miss hester but most christians do seem to have a powerful fondness for the devil i notice that they re alius admirin his work an praisin up his sharpness an theyd be monstrous disappointed ef he did nt git as many souls as they expect

 well after all the years that i ve been aworkin in the church an atryin to let my light so shine before the world i did nt think that youd be the one to throw out hints about my christianity but we all have our burdens to bear an im agoin to bear mine the best i kin an do my dooty whatever comes of it and miss hester gave another sigh of injured rectitude

i see miss hester that you re jest bent an bound not to see what i mean so i might as well go home

 i think my mind aint givin way yit an i believe that i do understand plain words but i aint abearin you no grudge youve spoke yore mind an its all right  but i hope there aint no hard feelins after all these years

 oh liphalet it aint a part of even my pore weak religion to bear hard feelins towards no one no matter how they treat me im jest tryin to bear my cross an suffer fur the lords sake

 but i hope i aint agivin you no cross to bear i aint never doubted yore goodness or yore christianity i only thought that mebbe yore methods yore methods â  miss primes lips were drawn into a line she divided that line to say  i know what the scriptures say  if thy right hand offend thee  â 

 hester hester  he cried stretching out his hands to her

 goodnight brother hodges i must go in she turned and left him standing at the gate with a hurt look in his face

on going into the house miss hester did not immediately tend to fred as she had promised instead she left him and went into her own room where she remained awhile when she came out her lips were no less set but her eyes were red it is hardly to be supposed that she had been indulging in that solace of womans woes a good cry

 take off yore jacket freddie she said calmly taking down a switch from over the clothespress  im agoin to whip you  but remember i aint apunishin you because im mad its fur the purpose of instruction its fur yore own good

fred received his dressingdown without a whimper he was too angry to cry this miss prime took as a mark of especial depravity in fact the boy had been unable to discover any difference between an instructive and a vindictive whipping it was perfectly clear in his guardians mind no doubt but a cherry switch knows no such distinctions

this incident only prepared fred brent for a further infraction of his guardians rules the next day one of miss primes strictest orders had to do with fighting whatever the boys did to fred he was never to resent it he must come to her and she would go to the boys mother what an order to give a boy with muscles and fists and nature strong within him but save for the telling it had been obeyed although it is hard to feel ones self an unwilling coward a prig and the laughingstock of ones fellows but when on the day after his unjust punishment and while still stung by the sense of wrong one of the petty schoolboy tyrants began to taunt him he turned upon the young scamp and thrashed him soundly his tormentor was not more hurt than surprised like most of his class he was a tattler the matter got to the teachers ears and that night fred carried home an ominouslooking note in his heart he believed that it meant another application of cherry switch either instructive or vindictive but he did not care he had done the natural thing and nature rewards us for obeying her laws by making us happy or stoical he had gone up in the estimation of his schoolfellows even the thrashed one and he felt a reckless joy he would welcome a whipping it would bring him back memories of what he had given billy tompkins wouldnt miss hester be surprised

he thought  if i should laugh out while she is whipping me  and he laughed at the very thought he was full of pleasure at himself he had satisfied the impulse within him for once and it made him happy

miss prime read the ominous note and looked at her charge thoughtfully fred glanced expectantly in the direction of the top of the clothespress but she only said go out an git in yore kindlin freddie git yore chores done an then come in to supper her voice was menacingly quiet the boy had learned to read the signs of her face too well to think that he was to get off so easily as this evidently he would  get it  after supper or miss prime had some new refined mode of punishment in store for him but what was it he cudgelled his brain in vain as he finished his chores and at table he could hardly eat for wondering but he might have spared himself his pains for he learned all too soon

immediately after supper he was bidden to put on his cap and come along miss prime took him by the hand  im agoin to take you she said  to beg willie tompkinss pardon fur the way you did him

did the woman know what it meant to the boy  she could not or her heart would have turned against the cruelty fred was aghast beg his pardon  a whipping was a thousand times better  indeed it would be a mercy he began to protest but was speedily silenced the enforced silence however did not cool his anger he had done what other boys did he had acted in the only way that it seemed a boy could act under the circumstances and he had expected to be punished as his fellows were  but this â this was awful he clinched his hands until the nails dug into the palms his face was as pale as death he sweated with the consuming fire of impotent rage he wished that he might run away somewhere where he could hide and tear things and swear for a moment only he entertained the thought and then a look into the determined face of the woman at his side drove the thought away to his childish eyes distorted by resentment she was an implacable and relentless monster who would follow him with punishment anywhere he might go

and now they were at billy tompkinss door they had passed through and he found himself saying mechanically the words which miss prime put into his mouth while his tormentor grinned from beside his mothers chair then after a few words between the women in which he heard from mrs tompkins the mysterious words  oh i dont blame you miss hester i know that blood will tell they passed out and the grinning face of billy tompkins was the last thing that fred saw it followed him home the hot tears fell from his eyes but they did not quench the flames that were consuming him there is nothing so terrible as the just anger of a child â terrible in its very powerlessness polyphemus is a giant though the mountain hold him down

next morning when fred went to school billy tompkins with a crowd of boys about was waiting to deride him but at sight of his face they stopped he walked straight up to his enemy and began striking him with all his might

 she made me beg your pardon did she   he gasped between the blows  well you take that for it and that the boys had fallen back and billy was attempting to defend himself

 mebbe shell make me do it again tonight if she does ill give you some more o this tomorrow and every time i have to beg your pardon do you hear  

the boys cheered lustily and billy tompkins completely whipped and ashamed slunk away

that night no report of the fight went home fred brent held the master hand

in life it is sometimes god and sometimes the devil that comes to the aid of oppressed humanity from the means it is often hard to tell whose handiwork are the results

cynics and fools laugh at calflove

youth which is wiser treats it more seriously when the boy begins to think of a girl instead of girls he displays the first budding signs of a real growing manhood the first passion may be but the enthusiasm of discovery sometimes it is not at times it dies as fleeting enthusiasms do again it lives and becomes a blessing a curse or a memory who shall say that the first halfsweet pang that strikes a boys heart in the presence of the dear first girl is any less strong intoxicating and real to him than that which prompts him to take the fullgrown woman to wife  with factitious sincerity we quote  the boy is father to the man and then refuse to believe that the qualities emotions and passions of the man are inherited from this same boy â are just the growth the development of what was embryonic in him

nothing is more serious more pleasant and more diverting withal than a boys brooding or exultationâone is the complement of the otherâover his first girl as to a great extent a man is moulded by the woman he marries so to no less a degree is a boys character turned and shaped by the girl he adores either he descends to her level or she draws him up unconsciously perhaps to her own plane girls are missionaries who convert boys boys are mostly heathens when a boy has a girl he remembers to put on his cuffs and collars and he does nt put his necktie into his pocket on the way to school

in a boys life the having of a girl is the setting up of an ideal it is the new element the higher something which abashes the unabashed and makes john who caused henrys nose to bleed tremble when little mary stamps her foot it is like an atheists finding god the sudden recognition of a higher and purer force against which all that he knows is powerless why does nt john bully mary  it would be infinitely easier than his former exploit with henry but he does nt he blushes in her presence brings her the best apples out of which heretofore he has enjoined the boys not to  take a hogbite and even though the parental garden grow none comes by flowers for her in some way queer boyish bouquets where dandelions press shoulders with springbeauties daffodils and roses â strange democracy of flowerdom he feels older and stronger

in freds case the object of adoration was no less a person than elizabeth simpson the ministers daughter from early childhood they had seen and known each other at school and between them had sprung up a warm childish friendship apparently because their ways home lay along the same route in such companionship the years sped but fred was a diffident boy and he was seventeen and elizabeth near the same before he began to feel those promptings which made him blushingly offer to carry her book for her as far as he went she had hesitated refused and then assented as is the manner of her sex and years it had become a settled thing for them to walk home together he bearing her burdens and doing for her any other little service that occurred to his boyish sense of gallantry

without will of his own and without returning the favour he had grown in the rev mr simpsons esteem this was due mostly to his guardians excellent work in spite of his rebellion training and environment had brought him greatly under her control and when she began to admonish him about his lost condition spiritually she had been able to awaken a sort of superstitious anxiety in the boys breast when miss prime perceived that this had been accomplished she went forthwith to her pastor and unburdened her heart

 brother simpson said she  i feel that the lord has appointed me an instrument in his hands for bringin a soul into the kingdom the minister put the tips of his fingers together and sighed piously and encouragingly  i have been labourin with freddie in the sperrit of christian industry an i believe that i have finally brought him to a realisin sense of his sinfulness

 hmm said the minister  bless the lord for this evidence of the activity of his people go on sister

 freddie has at last come to the conclusion that hell is his lot unless he flees unto the mountain and seeks salvation

 bless the lord for this

 now brother simpson i have done my part as fur as the lord has showed me except to ask you to come and wrastle with that boy

 let not thy heart be troubled sister prime for i will come as you ask me and i will wrastle with that boy as jacob did of old with the angel

 oh brother simpson i knowed youd come i know jest how you feel about pore wanderin souls an i m so glad to have yore strong arm and yore wisdom ahelpin me

 i hope my sister that the lord may smile upon my poor labours and permit us to snatch this boy as a brand from eternal burning

we shall have to labour in the sperrit brother simpson

 yes and with the understanding of the truth in our hearts and minds

 im shore i feel mighty uplifted by comin here today do come up to dinner sunday dear brother simpson after preachin

 i will come sister prime i will come i know by experience the worth of the table which the lord provides for you and then at the same season i may be able to sound this sinful boy as to his spiritual state and to drop some seed into the ground which the lord has mercifully prepared for our harvest goodbye sister goodbye i shall not forget sunday after preaching

in accordance with his promise the rev mr simpson began to labour with fred with the result of driving him into a condition of dogged revolt which only miss primes persistence finally overcame when revival time came round as sure as death it must come fred regularly went to the mourners bench mourned his few days until he had worked himself into the proper state and then somewhat too coldly it is true for his anxious guardian got religion

on the visit next after this which mr simpson paid to miss prime he took occasion to say  ah my sister i am so glad that you pointed me to that lost lamb of the house of israel and i am thanking the maker every day that he blessed my efforts to bring the straying one into the fold ah there is more joy over the one lamb that is found than over the ninety and nine that went not astray 

mr simpsons parishioner acquiesced but she had some doubts in her mind as to whose efforts the lord had blessed she felt a little bit selfish she wanted to be the author of everything good that came to fred but she did not argue with mr simpson there are some concessions which one must make to ones pastor

from this time on the preacher was freds friend and plied him with good advice in the usual friendly way but the boy bore it well for elizabeth smiled on him and what boy would not bear a fathers tongue for a girls eyes 

the girl was like her mother dark and slender and gentle she had none of her fathers bigness or bumptiousness her eyes were large and of a shade that was neither black nor brown her hair was very decidedly black her face was small and round with the plumpness of youth but one instinctively felt in looking at it that its lines might easily fall into thinness even pitifulness at the first touch of womans sorrow she was not nor did she look to be a strong girl but her very weakness was the source of secret delight to the boy for it made him feel her dependence on him when they were together and some girlish fear made her cling to his arm his heart swelled with pride and a something else that he could not understand and could not have described had any one told him that he was going through the halfsweet halfpainful timid but gallant first stages of love he would have resented the imputation with blushes his whole training would have made him think of such a thing with terror he had learned never to speak of girls at home for any reference to them by him was sure to bring forth from miss prime an instant and strong rebuke

freddie was the exclamation that gave his first unsuspecting remarks pause  you re agittin too fresh  you d better be amindin of yore studies instead o thinkin about girls girls aint agoin to make you pass yore examination an besides you re agettin mannish  fur boys o yore age to be atalkin about girls is mannish do you hear sir  you re abeginnin to feel yore keepin too strong dont let me hear no more sich talk out o you

there never was a manly boy in the world whom the word  mannish when applied to him did not crush it is a horrid word nasty and full of ugly import fred was subdued by it and so kept silence about his female friends happy is the boy who dares at home to pour out his heart about the girls he knows and likes and thrice unhappy he who through mistaken zeal on the part of misguided parents is compelled to keep his thoughts in his heart and brood upon his little aproned companions as upon a secret sin two things are thereby engendered stealth and unhealth if fred escaped certain youthful pitfalls it was because he was so repressed that he had learned to hide himself from himself his thoughts from the mind that produced them

he was a boy strong and full of blood the very discipline that had given a gloomy cast to his mind had given strength and fortitude to his body he was austere because austerity was all that he had ever known or had a chance of knowing but too often austerity is but the dam that holds back the flood of potential passion not to know the power which rages behind the barricade is to leave the structure weak for a hapless day when carrying all before it the flood shall break its bonds and in its fury ruin fair field and smiling mead it was well for fred brent that the awakening came when it did

in the first days of june when examinations are over the annual exhibition done and the graduating class has marched away proud in the possession of its diplomas the minds of all concerned turn naturally towards the old institution the school picnic on this occasion parents join the teachers and pupils for a summer days outing in the woods great are the preparations for the festal day and great the rejoicings thereon for these few brief hours old men and women lay aside their cares and their dignity and become boys and girls again those who have known sorrow â and who has not  â take to themselves a day of forgetfulness great baskets are loaded to overflowing with the viands dear to the picnickers palate âsandwiches whose corpulence would make their sickly brothers of the railway restaurant wither with envy pies and pickles cheese and crackers cakes and jams galore old horses that save for this day know only the marketcart or the sunday chaise are hitched up to bear out the merry loads old waggons whose wheels have known no other decoration than the mud and clay of rutty roads are festooned gaily with cedar wreaths oak leaves or the gaudy tissuepaper rosettes and creak joyfully on their mission of lightness and mirth on foot by horse in waggon or cart the crowds seek some neighbouring grove and there the day is given over to laughter mirth and song the children roll and tumble on the sward in the intoxication of  swingturn  and  ringaroundarosy the young women with many blushes and shy glances steal off to quiet nooks with their imploring swains some of the elders anxious to prove that they have not yet lost all their youth and agility indulge rather awkwardly perhaps in the exhausting amusement of the jumpingrope a few of the more staid walk apart in conversation with some favourite pastor who does not decline to take part in the innocent pleasures and crack ponderous jokes for the edification of his followers perhaps some of the more daring are engaged in one of the numerous singing plays such as oh la miss brown or  swing candy two and two but these are generally frowned upon they are too much like dancing and time has been when some too adventurous churchmember has been  churched  for engaging in one

in such a merrymaking was the community which surrounded the high school at dexter engaged when the incident occurred which opened freds eyes to his own state both he and elizabeth had been in the prize ranks that year and their friends had turned out in full and made much of them even eliphalet hodges was there with old bess festooned as gaily as the other horses and both miss prime and mr simpson were in evidence the afternoon of the day was somewhat advanced the dinner had been long over and the weariness of the people had cast something of a quietus over the hilarity of their sports they were sitting about in groups chatting and laughing while the tireless children were scurrying about in games of tag  catcher and  hideandseek

the grove where the festivities were being held was on a hillside which sloped gently to the bank of a small narrow stream usually dry in summer  but now still feeling the force of the spring freshets and swollen by the rain of the day before it was rushing along at a rapid rate a fence divided the picnicground proper from the sharper slope of the rivulets bank this fence the young people had been warned not to pass and so no danger was apprehended on account of the streams overflowing condition but the youngsters at dexter were no more obedient than others of their age elsewhere so when a scream arose from several childish voices at the lower part of the hill everybody knew that some child had been disobeying and pellmell the picnickers rushed in the direction of the branch

when they reached the nearest point from which they could see the stream a terrifying sight met their eyes a girl was struggling in the shallow but swift water she had evidently stepped on the sloping bank and fallen in her young companions were running alongside the rivulet stretching out their hands helplessly to her but the current was too strong and try as she would she could not keep her feet a cry of grief and despair went up from the girls on the bank as she made one final effort and then fell and was carried down by the current

men were leaping the fence now but a boy who had seen the whole thing from a neighbouring hillock was before them fred brent came leaping down the hill like a young gazelle he had seen who the unfortunate girl was â elizabeth â and he had but one desire in his heart to save her he reached the bank twenty yards ahead of any one else and plunged into the water just in front of her for she was catching and slippingclinging and losing hold but floating surely to her death he struggled up stream reached and caught her by the dress the water tugged at him and tried to throw him over but he stemmed it and lifting her up in his arms fought his way manfully to the bank up this he faltered slipping and sliding in the wet clay and weak with his struggle against the strong current but his face was burning and his blood tingling as he held the girl close to him till he gave her unconscious form into her fathers arms

for the moment all was confusion as was natural when a preachers daughter was so nearly drowned the crowd clustered around and gave much advice and some restoratives some unregenerate with many apologies and explanations concerning his possession produced a flask and part of the whisky was forced down the girls throat while her hands and face and feet were chafed she opened her eyes at last and a fervent  thank god   burst from her fathers lips and called forth a shower of amens

i allus carry a little somethin along in case of emergencies explained the owner of the flask as he returned it to his pocket with a not altogether happy look at its depleted contents

as soon as fred saw that elizabeth was safe he struck away for home unobserved and without waiting to hear what the crowd were saying he heard people calling his name kindly and admiringly but it only gave wings to the feet that took him away from them if he had thrown the girl in instead of bringing her out he could not have fled more swiftly or determinedly away from the eyes of people tired and footsore drenched to the skin and chilled through he finally reached home he was trembling he was crying but he did not know it and had he known he could not have told why he did not change his clothes but crouched down in a corner and hid his face in his hands he dreaded seeing any one or hearing any person speak his name he felt painfully conscious of a new self which he thought must be apparent to other eyes

the accident of the afternoon had cast a gloom over the merrymakings and the picnic breaking up abruptly sent the people scurrying home so that miss prime was at the house not far behind her charge

 freddie she called to him as she entered the house  freddie where air you   and then she found him she led him out of the corner and looked him over with a scrutinising eye  freddie brent she said solemnly  you ve jest ruined yore suit he was glad he wanted to be scolded  but she went on  i dont care ef you have and here she broke down youre agoin to have another one fur you re a right smart boy thats all ive got to say for a moment he wanted to lay his head on her breast and give vent to the sob which was choking him but he had been taught neither tenderness nor confidence so he choked back the sob though his throat felt dry and hot and strained he stood silent and embarrassed until miss prime recovered herself and continued  but la child youll take yore death o cold git out o them wet things an git into bed while i make you some hot tea fur the life o me i never did see sich carryinson

the boy was not sorry to obey he was glad to be alone he drank the warm tea and tried to go to sleep but he could not his mind was on fire his heart seemed as if it would burst from his bosom something new had come to him he began to understand and blushed because he did understand it was less discovery than revelation his forehead was hot his temples were throbbing it was well that miss prime did not discover it she would have given him horehound to cure â thought

from the moment that the boy held the form of the girl to his heart he was changed and she was changed to him they could never be the same to each other again manhood had come to him in a single instant and he saw in her womanhood he began for the first time to really know himself and it frightened him and made him ashamed

he drew the covers over his head and lay awake startled surprised at what he knew himself and mankind to be

to fred brent the awakening had come â early if we would be prudish not too early if we would be truthful

if fred brent had needed anything to increase his consciousness of the new feeling that had come to him he could not have done better to get it than by going to see eliphalet hodges next day his war of thought had gone on all night and when he rose in the morning he thought that he looked guilty and he was afraid that miss prime would notice it and read his secret he wanted rest he wanted to be secure from any one who would even suspect what was in his heart but he wanted to see and to talk to some one who better then than his old friend 

so he finished his mornings chores and slipped away he would not pass by elizabeths house but went by alleys and lanes until he reached his destination the house looked rather silent and deserted and mr hodges old assistant did not seem to be working in the garden as usual but after some search the boy found his old friend smoking upon the back porch

there was a cloud upon the usually bright features and the old man took his pipe from his mouth with a disconsolate sigh as the boy came in sight

 im mighty glad youve come freddie said he in a sad voice  i ve been awantin to talk to you all the mornin set down on the side o the porch or git a chair out o the house ef youd ruther the boy sat down wondering what could be the matter with his friend and what he could have to say to him surely it must be something serious for the whole tone and manner of his companion indicated something of import the next remark startled him into sudden suspicion

 theres lots o things made me think o lots of other things in the last couple o days youve grown up kind o quick like freddie so that a body aint hardly noticed it but that aint no matter you re up or purty nigh it an you can understand and appreciate lots o the things that you used to could nt fred sat still with mystery and embarrassment written on his face he wanted to hear more but he was almost afraid to listen further

 i aint watched you so close mebbe as id ought to a done but when i seen you yistiddy evenin holdin that little girl in yore arms i said to myself i said liphalet hodges freddie aint a child no more hes growed up  the boys face was scarlet now he was sure that the thoughts of his heart had been surprised and that this best of friends thought of him as  fresh  mannish or even wicked he could not bear the thought of it again the tears rose in his eyes usually so free from such evidences of weakness but the old man went on slowly in a low halfreminiscent tone without looking at his auditor to see what effect his words had had well that was one of the things that set me thinkin an then there was another he cleared his throat and pulled hard at his pipe something made him blink â dust or smoke or tears perhaps freddie he half sobbed out old bess is dead pore old bess died last night o colic im afeared the drive to the picnic was too much fur her

 old bess dead   cried the boy grieved and at the same time relieved  who would have thought it  poor old girl it seems like losing one of the family

 she was one of the family said the old man brokenly  she was more faithful than most human beings the two stood sadly musing the boy as sad as the man old bess was the horse that had taken him for his first ride that winter morning years before when the heart of the child was as cold as the day eliphalet hodges had warmed the little heart and in the years that followed man child and horse had grown nearer to each other in a queer but sympathetic companionship

then as if recalling his mind from painful reflections the elder man spoke again  but it aint no use aworryin over what cant be helped we was both fond o old bess an i know you feel as bad about losin her as i do but im agoin to give her a decent burial sich as a christian ought to have fur while the old mare was nt no perfessor she lived the life an thats more n most perfessors do yes sir im agoin to have her buried no glueman fur me i reckon you re awantin to know how old bess dyin an yore asavin lizabeth could run into each other in my mind but they did fur as i see you standin there aholdin the little girl it come to me sudden like freddies grown now an hell be havin a girl of his own purty soon ef he aint got one now mebbe itll be lizabeth  the old man paused for a moment his eyes rested on the boys fiery face tut tut he resumed  you aint ashamed air you well what air you agittin so red fur  havin a girl aint nothin to be ashamed of or skeered about neither most people have girls one time or another an i dont know of nothin thatll make a boy or a young man go straighter than to know that his girls eyes air upon him dont be ashamed at all

fred still blushed but he felt better and his face lightened over the kindly words

 i did nt finish tellin you though what i started on i got to thinkin yesterday about my young days when i had a girl an how i used to ride back an forth on the pore old horse right into this town to see her an as i drove home from the picnic i talked to the old nag about it an she whisked her tail an laid back her ears jest like she remembered it all it was on old bess that i rode away from my girls house after her first no to me an it seemed then that the animal sympathised with me fur she drooped along an held down her head jest like i was adoin many a time after that we rode off that way together fur the girl was set in her ways an though she confessed to a hankerin fur me she wanted to be independent i think her father put the idee into her head fur he was a hard man an she was his all his wife bein dead after a while we stopped talkin about the matter an i jest went an come as a friend i only popped the question once more an that was when her father died an she was left all alone

 it was a summer day warm an cheerful like this only it was evenin an we was asettin out on her front garden walk she was aknittin an i was awhippin the groun with a switch that i had brought along to touch bess up with now an then i had hitched her out front an she kep aturnin her eyes over the fence as ef she was as anxious as i was an that was mighty anxious finly i got the question out an the girl went all red in a minute she had been jest a purty pink before her knittin fell in her lap fust she started to answer then she stopped an her eyes filled up i seen she was aweaknin so i thought id push the matter  come says i gentle like an edgin near up to her give me my answer i been waitin a long time fur a yes with that she grabbed knittin apron an all an put em to her eyes an rushed into the house i knowed shed gone in to have a good cry an settle her nerves fur thats the way all womenfolks does  so i knowed it was no use to bother her until it was done so i walks out to the fence an throwin an arm over old besss back i told her all about it jest as im atellin you she alookin at me with her big meltin eyes an whinnyin soft like

after a little while the girl come out she was herself agin but there was a look in her face that turned my heart stonecold her voice sounded kind o sharp as she said liphalet ive been athinkin over what you said im only a woman an i come purty near bein a weak one but im all right now i dont mind tellin you that ef i was ever goin to marry youd be my choice but i aint agoin to have my fathers sperrit athinkin that i took advantage of his death to marry you goodbye liphalet she held out her hand to me an i took it  come an see me sometimes she said i could nt answer so i went out and got on old bess an we jogged away it was an awful disappointment but i thought i would wait an let my girl come aroun fur sometimes they do â in fact mostly but she has never give me a sign to make me think that she has that was twenty years ago an ive been waitin faithful ever sence but it seems like she was different from most women an specially good on holdin out people that was babies then have growed up an married an now the old companion that has been with me through all this waitin has left me i know what it means it means that im old that years have been wasted that chances have been lost but you have taught me my lesson bess dear old bess even in yore last hours you did me a service an you freddie you have given me the strenth that i had twenty years ago an im agoin to try to save what remains of my life i never felt how alone i was until now he was greatly agitated he rose and grasped the boys arm  come freddie he said  come on i m agoin agin to ask miss prime to be my wife

 miss prime   exclaimed fred aghast

 miss prime was my sweetheart freddie thirty years ago jest like lizabeth is yorn now come along

the two set out hodges stepping with impatient alacrity and the boy too astounded to speak

it was a beautiful morning at the end of june the sense of springs reviving influence had not yet given way to the full languor and sensuousness of summer the wind was soft and warm and fragrant the air was full of the song of birds and the low droning of early bees the river that flowed between the green hills and down through dexter was like a pane of wrinkled glass letting light and joy even into the regions below over the streets and meadows and hills lay a half haze like a veil over the too dazzling beauty of an eastern princess the of business  for in the passing years miss prime still lived

the garden was as prim as ever the walks as straight and well kept the inevitable white curtains were fluttering freshly from the window over which a huge matrimony draped lazily and rung its pink and white bells to eliphalet paused at the gate and heaved a deep sigh so much depended upon the issue of his present visit the stream of his life had been flowing so smoothly before now if its tranquillity were disturbed it never could be stilled again did he dare to risk so much upon so hazardous a chance  were it not better to go back home back to his old habits and his old ease without knowing his fate that would at least leave him the pleasure of speculating he might delude himself with the hope that some dayâ he faltered his hand was on the gate but his face was turned back towards the way he had come should he enter or should he go back  kate decided for him for at this juncture the door opened and miss hester appeared in the doorway and do eliphalet what air you astandin out there so long a studyin about fur all the world like a bashful boy  

the shot told he was a bashful boy again going fearfully tremblingly lovingly to see the girl of his heart but there was no old bess to whinny encouragement to him from over the little fence if he eyes of miss prime did not see it for the bronze laid on his face by summers and winters of exposure  but he felt the hot blood rush up to his face and neck and the perspiration breaking out on his brow he paused long enough to mop his face and then saying to fred in a low tone  you stay in the garden my boy until its all over he opened the gate and entered in the manner of one who leads a forlorn hope through forest aisles where an ambush is suspected the door closed behind him interested excited wondering and fearing doubting and hoping fred remained in the garden there were but two thoughts in his head and they were so new and large that his poor boys cranium had room for no more they ran in this wise  miss prime is uncle liphalets girl and elizabeth is mine

within miss prime was talking on in her usual decided fashion while the man sat upon the edge of his chair and wondered how he could break in upon the stream of her talk and say what was in his heart at last the lady exclaimed  i do declare liphalet what kin be the matter with you  you aint said ten words sence youve been asettin there i hope you aint talked yoreself entirely out with fred it does beat all how you an that boy seem to grow thicker an thicker every day one ud think fur all the world that you told him all yore secrets an was afeared he d tell em by the way you stick by him  an hes jest as bad about you its amazin

freddies a wonderful good boy an hes smart too they aint none of em agoin to throw dust in his eyes in the race of life

 im shore ive tried to do my dooty by him the very best i could an ef he does amount to anything in this world itll be through hard labour an mighty careful watchin miss hester gave a sigh that was meant to be full of solemnity but that positively reeked with selfsatisfaction

 but as you say liphalet she went on  fred aint the worst boy in the world nor the dumbest neither ef i do say it myself i aint asayin mind you that hes anything so great or wonderful but ive got to thinkin that theres somethin in him besides original sin an i should feel that the lord had been mighty favourin to me ef i could manage to draw it out the fact of it is liphalet i ve took a notion in my head about fred an i m agoin to tell you what it is ive decided to make a preacher out o him

 hmâ ah â well miss hester dont you think youd better let the lord do that

 nonsense liphalet you aint got no insight at all i believe in people adoin their part an not ashovin everything oif on the lord the shiftless dont want nothin better than to say that they will leave the lord to take care o things an then fold their arms an set down an let things go to the devil remember brother hodges i dont mean that in a perfane way but then because god made the sunlight an the rain it aint no sign that we should nt prune the vine

miss hesters face had flushed up with the animation of her talk and her eyes were sparkling with excitement

eliphalet looked at her and his heart leaped he felt that the time had come to speak

 miss hester he began and the hat in his hand went round and round nervously

liphalet fur goodness sake do lay yore hat on the table youll ruin the band of it an you make me as nervous as a cat

he felt a little dampened after this but he laid down the offending hat and began again  ive been thinkin some myself miss hester an its been about you about me la liphalet what have you been athinkin now the now sounded as if his thoughts were usually rather irresponsible

it was about you an â an âold bess about me an old bess bless my soul man will you stop beatin about the bush an tell me what on airth ive got to do with yore horse  

 old bess is dead miss hester died last night o colic

well i thought there was somethin the matter with you im mighty sorry to hear about the poor old creatur but shed served you a long while

 thats jest what set me athinkin she has served me a long while an now shes dead do you know what that means miss hester it means that we re agittin old you an me do you know when i got old bess  it was nigh thirty years ago i used to ride her up to this door an tie her to that tree out there  it was a saplin then an now shes dead

the mans voice trembled and his listener was strangely silent

you know on what errands the old horse used to bring me he went on  but it wasnt to be â then hester he rose went over to her and looked down into her halfaverted face which went red and pale by turns â hester aint we wasted time enough  

there was a long pause before she lifted her face he stood watching her with the light of a great eagerness in his eyes at last she spoke there was a catch in her voice  it was softer than usual

liphalet she began  im right glad you remember those days i aint never furgot em myself its true youve been a good loyal friend to me an i thank you fur it but after all these years â 

he broke in upon her with something like youthful impetuosity  after all these years he exclaimed  an endurin love ought to be rewarded hester i aint agoin to take c no  fur an answer ive got lots o years o life in me yet â we both have â an i aint agoin on with an emptyhome an an empty heart no longer

liphalet you aint a young man no more an i aint a young woman an the lord â 

 i dont care ef i aint an i dont believe in shovin everything off on the lord

 liphalet  it was a reproach

 hester   this was love he put his arm around her and kissed her youre agoin to say yes aint you  you aint agoin to send me away miserable  you re adyin to say yes but you re atryin to force yoreself not to dont he lifted her face as a young lover might and looked down into her eyes  is it yes  

well liphalet it pears like youre jest so pesterin that ive got to say yes yes then and she returned the quiet but jubilant kiss that he laid upon her lips

 after all these years he said  sorrow may last fur a night but joy cometh in the mornin it was a long night but thank the lord mornin s broke then rising he went to the door and called joyously  freddie come on in its all over

 liphalet did that boy know what you was agoin to say  

 yes o course he did

 oh my oh my well ive got a good mind to take it all back oh my   and when fred came in for the first time in her life miss prime was abashed and confused in his presence

but eliphalet had no thought of shame he took her by the hand and said  freddie miss hesters consented at last after thirty years shes agoin to marry me

but miss hester broke in liphalet dont be aputtin notions in that boys head you go way fred right away

fred went out but he felt bolder he went past elizabeths house whistling he did nt care he wondered if he would have to wait thirty years for her he hoped not

so great has been our absorption in the careers of fred brent miss prime and eliphalet hodges that we have sadly neglected some of the characters whose acquaintance we made at the beginning of our story but nature and time have been kinder â or more cruel if you will they have neither passed over nor neglected them they have combined with trouble and hard work to kill one of freds earliest friends melissa davis is no more and the oldest girl sophy supplements her days work of saleswoman in a drygoods store by getting supper in the evening and making the younger davises step around mrs warren the sometime friend of margaret brent and enemy of miss prime has moved farther out into the suburbs for dexter has suburbs now and boasts electric cars and amusement parks time has done much for the town its streets are paved and the mean street that bore the tumbledown brent cottage and its fellows has been built up and grown respectable it and the street where miss primes cottage frowned down have settled away into a quiet residential portion of the town while around to the east south and west and on both sides of the little river that divides the city roars and surges the traffic of a characteristic middlewest town halfway up the hill where the few aristocrats of the place formerly lived in almost royal luxuriance and seclusion a busy sewingmachine factory has forced its way and with its numerous chimneys and stacks literally smoked the occupants out at their very gates it sits like the commander of a besieging army and about it cluster the cottages of the workmen in military regularity little and neat and trim they flock there like the commanders obedient host and such they are for the sight of them offends the eyes of wealth so what with the smoke and what with the proximity of the poorer classes wealth capitulates evacuates and with robes discreetly held aside passes by to another quarter and a new district is born where poverty dare not penetrate seated on a hill where as is their inclination they may look down literally and figuratively upon the hurrying town they are complacent again and the newcomers to the town the newrich magnates and the halfrich strugglers who would be counted on the higher level move up and swell their numbers at dexter view

amid all this change two alone of those we know remain unaltered and unalterable true to their traditions mrs smith and mrs martin the two ancient gossips still live side by side spying and commenting on all that falls within their ken much as they did on that day when liphalet hodges took fred brent for his first drive behind old bess their windows still open out in the same old way whence they can watch the happenings of the street if there has been any change in them at all it is that they have grown more absorbed and more keen in following and dissecting their neighbours affairs

it is to these two worthies then that we wish to reintroduce the reader on an early autumn evening some three months after the events narrated in the last chapter

mrs martin went to her back fence which was the nearest point of communication between her and her neighbour  mis smith she called and her confederate came hurrying to the door thimble on and a bit of sewing clutched precariously in her apron just as she had caught it up when the significant call brought her to the back door

 oh you re busy as usual i see said mrs martin

 it aint nothin particler only a bit o bastin that i was doin

 you aint aworkin on the machine then so you might bring your sewin over and take a cup o tea with me

la now thats so kind o you mis martin i was jest thinkin how good a cup o tea would taste but i did nt want to stop to make it ill be over in a minute jest as soon as i see if my front door is locked and she disappeared within the house while mrs martin returned to her own sittingroom

the invited knew very well what the invitation to tea meant she knew that some fresh piece of news was to be related and discussed the beverage of which she was invited to partake was but a pretext but neither the one nor the other admitted as much each understood perfectly as by a tacit agreement and each tried to deceive herself and the other as to motives and objects

there is some subtle tie between teadrinking and gossip it is over their dainty cups that women dissect us men and damn their sisters some of the quality of the lemon they take m their tea gets into their tongues tea is to talk what dew is to a plant a gentle nourishing influence which gives to its product much of its own quality there are two acids in the tea which cultured women take there is only onein the beverage brewed by commonplace people but that is enough

mrs martin had taken her tray into the sittingroom where a slight fire was burning in the prim parlour cook on which the hot water was striving to keep its quality when mrs smith came in

 la mis martin you do manage to have everything so cosy i m shore a little fire in a settinroom dont feel bad these days

 i jest thought id have to have a fire replied mrs martin  fur i was feelin right down chilly though goodness knows a person does burn enough coal in winter without throwin it away in these early fall days well the lords put it here fur our comfort an i think we re adoin his will when we make use o the good things he gives us

 ah but mis smith theres too many people that goes about the world thinkin that they know jest what the lords will is but i have my doubts about em though mind you i aint amentionin no names c no name no blame  mrs martin pressed her lips and shook her head a combination of gestures that was eloquent with meaning it was too much for her companion her curiosity got the better of her caution

 dear me she exclaimed what is it now  

 oh nothin of any consequence at all it aint fur me to be ajudgin my neighbours or atalkin about em i jest thought id have you over to tea you re sich good company

mrs smith was so impatient that she had forgotten her sewing and it lay neglected in her lap but in no other way did she again betray her anxiety she knew that there was something new to be told and that it would be told all in good time but when gossip has become a fine art it must be conducted with dignity and precision

 let me see i believe you take two lumps o sugar an no milk mrs martin knew perfectly what her friend took  i dont know how this tea is i got it from the new grocery over at the corner she tasted it deliberately  it might a drawed a little more slowly she stirred it round and round and then as if she had drawn the truth from the depths of her cup she observed  this is a queer world mis smith

mrs smith sighed a sigh that was appreciative and questioning at once it is indeed she echoed im always asayin to myself what a mighty curus world this is

 have you ever got any tea from that new groceryman   asked her companion with tantalising irrelevance

 no  i haint never even been in there

well this heres middlin good dont you think so  

 oh its more than middlin its downright good i think i must go into that grocery some time myself

 i was in there today and met mis murphy she says theres great goinons up at miss primes â i never shall be able to call her mis hodges

you dont tell me she and brother liphalet aint had a failin out already have they  though what more could you expect  

oh no indeed it aint no failin out nothin o the kind

 well what then  what has miss hester â i mean mis hodges been doin now  where will that woman stop  whats she done  

well you see â do have another cup of tea an help yoreself to that bread an butter â you see freddie brent has finished at the high school an theyve been wonderin what to make him

well what air they agoin to make him  his father was a good stonemason when he was anything

 humph  you dont suppose miss hesters been sendin a boy to school to learn latin and greek an algebry an sich to be a stonemason do you  huh uh  said i to myself as soon as i see her sendin him from the common school to high school says i  shes got big notions in her head oh no the fathers trade was not good enough fur her boy  so thinks mis liphalet hodges

 well what on airth is she goin to make out of him then  

 please pass me that sugar thank you you know mr daniels offered him a place as clerk in the same store where sophy davis is it was mighty kind o mr daniels i think to offer him the job

 well did nt he take it 

well partly he did an partly he didnt ef you can understand that

 sally martin what do you mean  a body has to fairly pick a thing out o you

 i mean that she told mr daniels he might work fur him half of every day

 half a day  an whats he goin to do the other half 

hes agoin to the bible seminary the other halfday shes agoin to make a preacher out o him

mrs martin had slowly and tortuously worked up to her climax and she shot forth the last sentence with a jubilant ring she had well calculated its effects sitting back in her chair she supped her tea complacently as she contemplated her companions astonishment mrs smith had completely collapsed into her seat folded her arms and closed her eyes  laws a massy  she exclaimed what next old tom drunken tom swearin an ravin tom brents boy a preacher  then suddenly she opened her eyes and sat up very erect and alert as she broke forth  sally martin what air you atellin me  it aint possible its agin nature a panthers cub aint agoin to be a lamb its downright wicked thats what i say

 an so says i to mis murphy them same identical words  says i mis murphy its downright wicked its ashamin of the lords holy callin o the ministry 

 an does the young scamp pertend to a had a call  

 no indeed  he was mighty opposed to it and so was her husband but that woman was so set she would nt agree to nothin else he dont pertend to a heerd no call ceptin miss hesters an that was a command i know its all true fur mis murphy while she was nt jest alistenin lives next door and heerd it all

and so the two women fell to discussing the question as they had heard it pro and con it was all true as these gossips had it that miss hester had put into execution her halfexpressed determination to make a preacher of fred he had heard nothing of it until the day when he rushed in elated over the kindly offer of a place in mr danielss store then his guardian had firmly told him of her plan and there was a scene

you kin jest tell mr daniels that you kin work for him half a day every day an that you re agoin to put in the rest of your time at the bible seminary ive made all the arrangements

 but i dont want to be a preacher the boy had retorted with some heat  id a good deal rather learn business and some day start out for myself

 it aint what some of us wants to do in this life  its what the lord appoints us to  an its wicked fur you to rebel

 i dont know how you can know so much what the lord means for me to do i should think he would give his messages to those who are to do the work

thats right freddie brent sass me sass me thats what ive struggled all the best days of my life to raise you fur

 im not sassing you but â 

 dont you think hester broke in her husband  that mebbe theres some truth in what freddie says  dont you think the lord kind o whispers what he wants people to do in their own ears  mebbe it was nt never intended fur freddie to be a preacher theres other ways o doin good besides atalkin from the pulpit

 id be bound fur you liphalet its a shame you agoin agin me after all ive done to make freddie material fit for the lords use jest think what youll have to answer fur ahelpin this unruly boy to shirk his dooty

 i aint agoin agin you hester youre my wife an ilow at yourjedgments purty sound on most things i aint agoin agin you at all butâbutâi was jest awonderin

the old man brought out the last words slowly meditatively he was jest awonderin his wife though never wondered

 mind you she went on  i say to you freddie and to yore uncle liphalet too ef he upholds you that it aint me you re arebellin against its yore dooty an the will o god that you re afightin its easy enough to rebel against man but do you know what you re adoin when you set yourself up against the almighty  do you want to do that  

yes came the boys answer like a flash he was stung and irritated into revolt and a torrent of words poured from his lips unrestrained  im tired of doing right i m tired of being good im tired of obeying god â 

 freddie   but over the dam the water was flowing with irresistible force the horror of his guardians face and the terrible reproach in her voice could not check the boy

u everything he continued  that i have ever wanted to do since i can remember has been bad or against my duty or displeasing to god why does he frown on everything i want to do  why do we always have to be killing our wishes on account of duty  i dont believe it i hate duty i hate obedience i hate everything and i wont obey â 

freddie be keerful dont say anything thatll hurt after yore mad spells over dont blaspheme the lord amighty

liphalet hodges voice was cool and tender and persuasive he laid his hand on the boys shoulder while his wife sat there motionless white and rigid with horror

the old mans words and his gentle touch had a wonderful effect on the boy  they checked his impassioned outburst but his pentup heart was too full he burst into tears and rushed headlong from the house

for a time he walked aimlessly on his mind in a tumult of rage then he began to come to himself he saw the people as they passed him he had eyes again for the street and he wondered where he was going he felt an overwhelming desire to talk to some one and to get sympathy consolation and perhaps support but whither should he turn  if liphalet hodges had been at the old house his steps would naturally have bent in that direction but this refuge was no longer his then his mind began going over the people whom he knew and no name so stuck in his fancy as that of elizabeth it was a hard struggle he was bashful any other time he would not have done it but now his great need created in him an intense desperation that made him bold he turned and retraced his steps toward the simpson house

elizabeth was leaning over the gate the autumn evening was cool she had a thin shawl about her shoulders she was humming a song as fred came up his own agitation made her seem irritatingly calm

she opened the gate and made room for him at her side

you seem dreadfully warm she said  and here i was getting ready to go in because it is so cool

 i ve been walking very fast he answered hesitatingly

 dont you think youd better go in so as not to take cold  

 oh i dont care if i do take cold the speech sounded rude elizabeth looked at him in surprise

 whats the matter with you  she asked

 im mad  thats whats the matter

 oh fred you should nt get mad  you know its wrong

he put up his hand as if she had struck him  wrong  wrong  it seems i cant hear anything else but that word everything is wrong dont say any more about it i dont want to hear the word again

elizabeth did not know what to make of his words so she said nothing and for a while they stood in strained silence after a while he said  aunt hester wants me to be a preacher

 i am so glad to hear that she returned  i think youll make a good one

you too he exclaimed resentfully  why should i make a good one  why need i be one at all  

 oh because you re smart and then youve always been good

the young man was suddenly filled with disdain his anger returned he felt how utterly out of accord he was with every one else  dont you think there is anything else required besides being f smart  and good    he himself would have blushed at the tone in which he said this could he have recognised it  im smart because i happened to pass all my examinations i got through the high school at eighteen  nearly everyone does the same im good because i have never had a chance to be bad  i have never been out of aunt hesters sight long enough anybody could be good that way

 but then older people know what is best for us fred

 why should they  they dont know whats beating inside of us away down here the boy struck his breast fiercely  i dont believe they do know half the time what is best and i dont believe that god intends them to know

 i would nt talk about it if i were you i must go in wont you come in with me

 not tonight he replied  i must be off

 but papa might give you some advice  ive had too much of it now what i want is room to breathe in once

 i dont understand you

 i know you dont nobody does or tries to go in lizzie he said more calmly  i dont want you to catch cold even if i do goodnight and he turned away

the girl stood for a moment looking after him  her eye was moist then she pouted  freds real cross tonight and went in

it is one of the glaring sarcasms of life to see with what complacency a shallow woman skims the surface of tragedy and thinks that she has sounded the depths

fred continued his walk towards home he was thinking it ran in him that elizabeth was a good deal of a fool and then he felt horrified with himself for thinking it it did not occur to him that the hard conditions through which he had come had made him mentally and spiritually older than the girl he was thinking of his position how perfectly alone he stood most of the people whom he knew would see only blind obstinacy in his refusal to be a minister but were ones inclinations nothing  was there really nothing in the  call  to preach  so he pondered as he walked and more and more the hopelessness of his predicament became revealed to him all his life had been moulded by this one womans hands would not revolt now say to the world  i am grown now i do not need this woman who has toiled i can disobey her with impunity i will do so

he went home and before going in leaned his head long upon the gate and thought a listless calm had succeeded his storm of passion he went in and to bed

at breakfast he seemed almost cheerful while mr hodges was subdued his wife had taken refuge in an attitude of injured silence

 aunt hester said the young man apparently without effort  i was wrong yesterday  i am sorry i will do whatever you say even to being a preacher something came up in his throat and choked him as he saw a brightness come into the face and eyes of his beloved uncle liph but it grew hard and bitter there as mrs hodges replied  well i m glad the lord has showed you the errors of your way an brought you around to a sense o your dooty to him an to me

poor blind conceited humanity  interpreters of god indeed we reduce the deity to vulgar fractions we place our own little ambitions and inclinations before a shrine and label them  divine messages we set up our delphian tripod and we are the priest and oracles we despise the plans of natures ruler and substitute our own with our short sight we affect to take a comprehensive view of eternity our horizon is the universe we spy on the divine and try to surprise his secrets or to sneak into his confidence by stealth we make god the eternal a puppet we measure infinity with a footrule

when fate is fighting with all her might against a human soul the greatest victory that the soul can win is to reconcile itself to the unpleasant which is never quite so unpleasant afterwards upon this principle frederick brent acted instinctively what with work and study and contact with his fellowstudents he found the seminary not so bad a place after all indeed he began to take a sort of pleasure in his pursuits the spirit of healthy competition in the school whetted his mind and made him forgetful of many annoyances from without when some fellowsalesman at the store gibed at him for being a parson it hurt him  but the wound was healed and he was compensated when in debate he triumphed over the crack speaker of his class it was a part of his training to do earnestly and thoroughly what he had to do even though it was distasteful and it was not long before he was spoken of as one of the most promising members of the school

notwithstanding its steady growth toward citydom dexter retained many of the traditions of its earlier and smaller days among them was that of making the church the centre of its social and public life for this reason the young student came in for much attention on account of his standing in the religious college another cause which elicited the praise and congratulations of his friends was his extreme youth that community which could send out a  boy preacher always deemed itself particularly favoured by providence dexter was no exception and it had already begun to bestow the appellation upon young brent much to his disgust he knew the species and detested it it was mostly composed of ignorant and hypocritical young prigs in whom their friends had seemed to see some especial merit and had forthwith hoisted them into a position that was as foolish as it was distasteful they were hailed as youthful prodigies and exploited around the country like a patent medicine or a sideshow what is remarkable at eighteen is not so striking at twentyeight so when their extreme youth was no longer a cause for surprise the boy preachers settled down into everyday dulness with nothing except the memory of a flimsy fame to compensate the congregations they bored

against this frederick brent fought with all his strength he refused invitation after invitation to  talk  or  exhort on the plea that he wished to be fully prepared for his work before entering upon it

but his success at school militated against him for the fame of his oratorical powers was gradually but surely leaking out the faculty recognised and commended it so he could not hope long to hide behind his plea although he dreaded the day when it would no longer serve his purpose

some of the  older heads  accused him of an unwarranted fear of cowardice even and an attempt to shirk his evident duty the truth of it was that these same people wanted to hear him and then attack his manner or his doctrine they could not would not forget that he was the son of old tom brent the drunkard and of the terrible the unspeakable margaret his wife they could not forget that he was born and lived the first years of his life on the  mean  street when it was a mean street and when any obstinate old fossil was told of the youths promise he would shake his head as who should say  what good can come out of that nazareth 

but the young man went his way and heeded them not he knew what they were saying he knew what they were thinking even when they held his hand and smiled upon him and it filled him with a spirit of distrust and resentment though it put him bravely on his mettle while he was a man and in the main manly sometimes he was roused to an anger almost childish then although he did not want to be a preacher at all he wished and even prayed to become a great one just to convince the old fools who shook their heads over him to his ears had crept as such tales will creep some of the stories of his parents lives and while he pitied his mother there was a great fierceness in his heart against his father

but as in the old days when miss primes discipline would have turned all within him to hardness and bitterness eliphalet hodges stood between him and despair so now in this crucial time elizabeth was a softening influence in his life

as the days came and went he had continued to go to see her ever since the night when he had stood with her at the gate and felt the bitterness of her lack of sympathy but all that had passed now and unconsciously they had grown nearer to each other there had been a tacit understanding between them until just a few weeks before it was on a warm spring evening he had just passed through her gate and started towards the house when the opening chords of the piano struck on his ear through the opened window and arrested him elizabeth had a pleasant little voice with a good deal of natural pathos in it as the ministers daughter the scope of her songs was properly according to dexter rather limited but that evening she was singing softly to herself a lovesong the words were these if death should claim me for her own today and softly i should falter from your side oh tell me loved one would my memory stay and would my image in your heart abide 

or should i be as some forgotten dream that lives its little space then fades entire 

should time send oer you its relentless stream to cool your heart and quench for aye loves fire 

i would not for the world love give you pain or ever compass what would cause you grief and oh how well i know that tears are vain 

but love is sweet my dear and life is brief so if some day before you i should go beyond the sound and sight of song and sea t would give my spirit stronger wings to know that you remembered still and wept for me

she was alone in the room the song was hardly finished when brent stepped through the window and laid his hand over hers where they rested on the keys

 why do you sing like that elizabeth   he said tremulously

she blushed and lowered her eyes beneath his gaze as if she already knew the words that were on his lips or feared that her soul lay too bare before him

why do you think of death   he asked again imprisoning her hands

 it was only my mood she faltered  i was thinking and i thought of the song and i just sang it

 were you thinking of any one in particular lizzie  

her head drooped lower until her face was hidden but she did not answer a strange boldness had come to him he went on  i listened as you were singing and it seemed as if every word was meant for me lizzie it may sound foolish but i â i love you wont you look at me and tell me that i am right in thinking you love me   she half raised her face to his and murmured one word in it were volumes he bent down and kissed her it was the first time he had ever kissed a girl he did it almost fearfully it was a kiss in which reverence struggled with passion

you are to be my little sweetheart now and i am to be in your thoughts hereafter when you sing only we dont want any more such songs as this one i dont want to  remember still and weep for you i want to have you always by me and work for you wont you let me  

elizabeth found her tongue for a moment only but that was enough for her lover a happy light gleamed in his eyes  his face glowed he was transfigured love does so much for a man

from that time forward when he was harassed by cares and trouble he sought out elizabeth and even though he could seldom tell her all that was in his heart he found relief in her presence he did not often speak of his trials to her for in spite of his love for her he felt that she could not understand  but the pleasure he found in her company put sweetness into his life and made his burdens easier to bear

only once had a little shadow come between them and the fact that so little a thing could have made a shadow shows in what a narrow constrained atmosphere the two young people lived young brent still had his halfday position in the store and when the employees of a rival establishment challenged danielss clerks to a game of baseball he was duly chosen as one of the men to uphold the honour of their house upon the diamond

the young man was not fossilised he had strength and the capacity for enjoyment so he accepted without a thought of wrong the saturday came the game was played fred brent took part and thereby brought a hornets nest about his ears it would scarcely have been so bad but the young man entered the game with all the zest and earnestness of his intense nature and several times by brilliant playing saved his side from defeat in consequence his name was in the mouth of every one who had seen or heard of the contest he was going home that evening feeling pleased and satisfied with himself when he thought he would drop in a moment on the way and see elizabeth he had hardly got into the house before he saw from her manner that something was wrong and he wondered what it could be he soon learned it is only praise that is slow

 oh fred said the girl reproachfully  is it true that you have been playing baseball

 baseball yes  what of it  what are you looking so horrified about

 did you think it was right for you in your position to play  

if i had thought it was wrong i assuredly should not have played the young man returned

 everybody is talking about it and father says he thinks you have disgraced your calling

 disgraced my calling by playing an innocent game  

 but father thinks it is a shame for a man who is preparing to do such work as yours to have people talking about him as a mere ballplayer

the blood mounted in hot surges to the young mans face he felt like saying  your father be hanged but he controlled his anger and said quietly  elizabeth dont you ever think for yourself 

 i suppose i do fred but i have been brought up to respect what my elders think and say

dont you think that they as well as we can be narrow and mistaken  

 it is not for me to judge them my part is to obey

 you have learned an excellent lesson he returned bitterly  that is just the thing  obey obey well i will i will be a stick a dolt i will be as unlike what god intended me to be as possible i will be just what your father and aunt hester and you want me to be i will let them think for me and save my soul i am too much an imbecile to attempt to work out my own salvation no elizabeth i will not play ball any more i can imagine the horrified commotion it caused among the angels when they looked down and saw me pitching when i get back to school i shall look up the four gospels views on ballplaying

 fred i dont like you when you talk that way

 i wont do that any more either he rose abruptly  goodbye elizabeth i am off he was afraid to stay lest more bitter words should come to his lips

 goodbye fred she said  i hope you understand

the young man wondered as he walked homeward if the girl he had chosen was not a little bit prim then he thought of her father and said to himself even as people would have said of himself  how can she help it with such a father  

all his brightness had been dashed he was irritated because the thing was so small so utterly absurd it was like the sting of a miserable little insect âjust enough to smart and not enough to need a strong remedy the news of the game had also preceded him home and his guardians opinion of the propriety of his action did not tend to soothe his mind mrs hodges forcibly expressed herself as follows   i put baseballplayin right down with dancin and sich like it aint no fittin occupation for any one thats agoin into the ministry its idleness to begin with its awastin the precious time thats been given us for a better use a young man thats goin to minister to peoples souls ought to be consecrated to the work before he begins it who ever heerd tell of jesus playin baseball  

among a certain class of debaters such an argument is always supposed to be clinching unanswerable final but mr hodges raised his voice in protest  i aint agoin to keep still no longer i dont believe the boys done a bit o harm theres lots of things the lord did nt do that he did nt forbid human beins to do we aint none of us divine but you mark my words freddie an i say it right here sos yore aunt hester can hear me too you mark my words ef you never do nothin worse than what youve been adoin today itll be mighty easy for you to read yore title clear to mansions in the skies

 omph huh liphalet there aint nothin so easy as talkin when satins apromptin you

there you go hester there you go agin apattin the devil on the back i low the old boy must be tickled to death with all the compliments christian people give him

 a body d about as well be complimentin the devil as to be acountenancin his works as you air

the old man stopped with a piece halfway to his mouth now jest listen at that hester prime aint you ashamed of yoreself  me acountenancin wrong  sayin that to me an me ol enough to be â to be â well im your husband anyway

in times of excitement he was apt to forget this fact for the instant and give his wife her maiden name as if all that was sharp in her belonged to that prenuptial period but this storm relieved the atmosphere of its tension mrs hodges felt better for having spoken her mind and mr hodges for having answered while the young man was relieved by the championship of his elder and so the storm blew over it was several days before brent saw elizabeth again but thanks to favouring winds the sky had also cleared in that direction

it was through such petty calms and storms that fred passed the days and weeks of his first year at the seminary some of them were small annoyances to be sure but he felt them deeply and the sting of them rankled it is not to be supposed because there was no specific outburst that he was entirely at rest vesuvius had slumbered long before pompeiis direful day his mind was often in revolt but he kept it to himself or confided it to only one friend this friend was a fellowstudent at the seminary a man older than fred by some years he had first begun a literary career but had renounced it for the ministry even to him fred would not commit himself until near the end of the year taylor declared his intention of now renouncing the study of theology for his old pursuits then brents longing to be free likewise drew his story from his lips

taylor listened to him with the air of one who had been through it all and could sympathise then he surprised his friend by saying dont be a fool brent its all very nice and easy to talk about striking out for ones self and all that ive been through it all myself my advice to you is stay here go through the academic discipline and be a parson get into a rut if you will for some ruts are safe when we are buried deep they keep us from toppling over this may be a sort of weak philosophy i am trying to teach you but it is the happiest

if i can save any man from selfdelusion i want to do it ill tell you why when i was at school some fool put it into my head that i could write i hardly know how it came about i began scribbling of my own accord and for my own amusement sometimes i showed the things to my friend who was a fool he bade me keep on saying that i had talent i did nt believe it at first but when a fellow keeps dinging at another with one remark after a while he grows to believe it especially when it is pleasant it is vastly easy to believe what we want to believe so i came to think that i could write and my soul was fired with the ambition to make a name for myself in literature when i should have been turning virgil into english for classroom i was turning out more or less deformed verse of my own or rapt in the contemplation of some plot for story or play but somehow i got through school without a decided flunk in the mean time some of my lines had found their way into print and the little cheques i received for them had set my head buzzing with dreams of wealth to be made by my pen if we could only pass the pitfalls of that dreaming age of youth most of us would get along fairly well in this matteroffact old world but we are likely to follow blindly the leadings of our dreams until we run our heads smack into a cornerpost of reality then we awaken but in most cases too late

 i am glad to say that my father had the good sense to discourage my aspirations he wanted me to take a profession but elated by the applause of my friends i scorned the idea what mew my talents up in a courtroom or a hospital  never it makes me sick when i look back upon it and see what a fool i was i settled down at home and began writing lots of things came back from periodicals to which i sent them but i had been told that this was the common lot of all writers and i plodded on a few things sold just enough to keep my hopes in a state of unstable equilibrium

well its no use to tell you how i went on in that way for four years clinging and losing hold standing and slipping seeing the prize recede just as i seemed to grasp it then came the awakening i saw that it would have been better just to go on and do the conventional thing i found this out too late and i came here to try to remedy it but i cant no one can you get your mind into a condition where the ordinaryroutine of study is an impossibility and you cannot go back and take up the train you have laid so you keep struggling on wasting your energy hoping against hope then suddenly you find out that you are and can be only third or at best secondrate god what a discovery it is how you try to fight it off until the last moment but it comes upon you surely and crushingly and cut bruised wounded you slip away from the face of the world if you are a brave man you say boldly to yourself i will eke out an existence in some humble way and you go away to a life of longing and regret if you are a coward you either leap over the parapets of life to hell or go creeping back and fall at the feet of the thing that has damned you willing to be thirdrate anything for you are stung with the poison that never leaves your blood so it has been with me even when i found that i must choose a calling i chose the one that gave me most time to nurse the serpent that had stung me

taylor ceased speaking and looked a little ashamed of his vehemence

 this is your story said brent  but men differ and conditions differ i will accept all the misery all the pain and defeat you have suffered to be free to choose my own course

taylor threw up his hands with a deprecatory gesture  there he said  it is always so i might as well have talked to the wind

so the fitful calms and elizabeths love had not cured frederick brents heart of its one eating disease the desire for freedom

it was not until early in brents second year at the bible seminary that he was compelled to go through the ordeal he so much dreaded that of filling a city pulpit the dexterites had been wont to complain that since the advent among them of the theological school their churches had been turned into recitationrooms for the raw students but of  old tom brents boy as they still called him they could never make this complaint so as humanity loves to grumble the congregations began to find fault because he did not do as his fellows did

the rumours of his prowess in the classroom and his eloquence in the society hall had not abated and the curiosity of his fellowtownsmen had been whetted to a point where endurance was no longer possible indeed it is open to question whether it was not by connivance of the minister himself backed by his trustees on one side and the college authorities on the other that brent was finally deputed to supply the place of the rev mr simpson who was affected by an indisposition fancied pretended or otherwise

the news struck the young man like a thunderbolt albeit he had been expecting it he attempted to make his usual excuse but the kindly old professor who had notified him smiled into his face and patting his shoulder said its no use brent id go and make the best of it they re bound to have you i understand your diffidence in the matter and knowing how well you stand in class it does credit to your modesty

the old man passed on he said he understood but in his heart the young student standing there helpless hopeless knew that he did not understand that he could not only he himself could perceive it in all the trying horror of its details only he himself knew fully or could know what the event involved â that when he arose to preach to ninetenths of the congregation he would not be frederick brent student but old tom brents boy he recoiled from the thought

many a fireside saint has said  why did not savonarola tempt the hot ploughshares  god would not have let them burn him faith is a beautiful thing but savonarola had the ploughshares at his feet the children of israel stepped into the red sea before the waters parted but then moses was with them and what was more pharaoh was behind them

at home the intelligence of what brent was to do was received in different manner by mrs hodges and her husband the good lady launched immediately into a lecture on the duty that was placed in his hands  but eliphalet was silent as they sat at the table he said nothing until after supper was over and then he whispered to his young friend as he started to his room  i know jest how you feel freddie it seems that i oughtnt to call you that now but i low youll allus be freddie  to me

 dont ever call me anything else if you please uncle liph said the young man pressing eliphalets hand

 i think i kin understand you better than most people mr hodges went on  an i know it aint no easy task that youve got before you

youve always understood me better than any one and â and i wish you knew what it has meant to me and that i could thank you somehow

sh my boy its thanks enough to hear them words from you now you jest calm yoreself an when sunday comes â i dont know as i d ought to say it this way but i mean it all in a christian sperrit â when sunday comes freddie my boy you jest go in an give em fits

the two parted with another pressure of the hand and it must be confessed that the old man looked a little bit sheepish when his wife hoped he had been giving fred good advice

 you dont reckon hester that id give him any other kind do you  

not intentionally liphalet but when it comes to advice theres pints o view mrs hodges seemed suspicious of her husbands capabilities as an adviser

 theres some times when peopled a good deal ruther have sympathy than advice

an i reckon cordin to yore way o thinkin this is one o them well i intend to try to do my dooty in this matter as ive tried to do it all along

 hester yore dootyll kill you yit its a wonder you dont git tired alookin it in the face

 i aint agoin to skirk it jest to live in pleasure an ease

no need o shirkin hester no need o shirkin but theys some people that would nt be content without rowin down stream

an then mind you liphalet i aint aexchangin words with you fur thats idleness but theres others that would nt row up stream but ud wait an hope fur a wind to push em these impersonalities were as near spatting as mr and mrs hodges ever got

through all the community that clustered about mr simpsons church and drew its thoughts ideas and subjects of gossip therefrom ran like wildfire the news that at last they were to have a chance to judge of young brents merits for themselves it caused a stir among old and young and in the days preceding the memorable sunday little else was talked of

when it reached the ears of old danl hastings who limped around now upon two canes but was as acrimonious as ever he exclaimed tapping the ground with one of his sticks for emphasis what that young brent preachin in our church in our ministers pulpit its a shame â an he the born son of old tom brent that all the town knows was the worst sinner hereabouts i aint agoin to go i aint agoin to go

 dont you be afeared to go danl there aint no danger that his docterns air agoin to be as strong as his fathers whisky said his old enemy

 oh its fur the likes o you thomas donaldson to be atalkin o docterns an whisky in the same breath you never did have no reverence said the old man testily

 an yet danl ive found docterns an whisky give out by the same breath

mr hastings did not think it necessary to notice this remark he went on with his tirade against the prospective  supply    why cant elder simpson preach hisself id like to know instead o puttin up that young upstart to talk to his betters  why i mind the time that that boy had to be took out o church by the hand fur laffin at me â at me mind you the old man repeated shaking his stick  laffin at me when i was expoundin the word

thats terble danl fur as fur as i kin ricollec when you re aexpoundin the word it aint no laffin matter

 i tell you thomas donaldson the worlds agoin down hill fast but i aint agoin to help it along i aint agoin to hear that brent boy preach

this declaration however did not prevent the venerable danl from being early in his seat on the following sunday morning sternly uncompromisingly critical

as might have been expected the church was crowded friends enemies and the merely curious filled the seats and blocked the aisles the chapel had been greatly enlarged to accommodate its growing congregation but on this day it was totally inadequate to hold the people who flocked to its doors

the rev mr simpson was so far recovered from his indisposition as to be able to be present and assist at the service elizabeth was there looking proud and happy and anxious mrs hodges was in her accustomed place on the ladies side of the pulpit she had put new strings to her bonnet in honour of the occasion her face wore a look of great severity an unregenerate wag in the back part of the church pointed her out to his companions and remarked that she looked as if she d spank the preacher if he did nt do well  poor fellow if he sees that face hell break down sure opposite in the  amen corner the countenance of the good eliphalet was a study in changing expressions it was alternately possessed by fear doubt anxiety and exultation

sophy davis sat in a front seat spick and span in a new dress which might have been made for the occasion people said that she was making eyes at her young fellowsalesman though she was older than he mrs martin and her friend whispered together a little farther back

a short time before the service began brent entered by a side door near the pulpit and ascended to his place his entrance caused a marked sensation his appearance was impressive the youthful face was white and almost rigid in its lines  scared to death was the mental note of a good many who saw him but his step was firm as elizabeth looked at him she felt proud that such a man loved her he was not handsome his features were irregular but his eyes were clear and fearless if a certain cowardice had held him back from this ordeal it was surely not because he trembled for himself the life he had lived and the battles he had fought had given a compression to his lips that corrected a natural tendency to weakness in his mouth his head was set squarely on his broad shoulders he was above medium height but not loosely framed he looked the embodiment of strength

 he aint a bit like his father said some one

hes like his father was in his best days replied another

he dont look like hes overpleased with the business they say he did nt want to come

 well i guess its purty resky work gittin up to speak before all these people thats knowed him all his life an know where an what he come from

they say too that hes some pumpkins out at the college

 i aint much faith in these schoolmade preachers but well soon see what he kin do in the pulpit we ve heerd preachers an we kin compare

 thats so  we ve heerd some preachers in our day he must toe the mark he may be all right at college but hes in a pulpit now that has held preachers fur shore a pebbles all right among pebbles but it looks mighty small longside o boulders hes preachin before people now why brother simpson himself never would a got a special dispensation to hold the church all these years ef it had nt been fur the people backin him up an conference was afraid theyd leave the connection

 well ef this boy is anything lord only knows where he gets it fur everybody knows â 

sh

the buzz which had attended the young speakers entrance subsided as mr simpson rose and gave out the hymn that finished he ran his eyes over the front seats of the assembly and then said  brother hastings lead us in prayer

the old man paused for an instant as if surprised and then got slowly to his knees it was a strange selection but we have seen that this particular parson was capable of doing strange things in the course of a supplication of some fifteen minutes duration brother hastings managed to vent his spleen upon the people and to pay the lord a few clumsy compliments during the usual special blessing which is asked upon the preacher of the hour he prayed o lord let not the rarin horses of his youth run away with thy chariot of eternal truth lord cool his head and warm his heart and settle him firm grant that he may fully realise where hes astandin at an who hes aspeakin to do thou not let him speak but speak through him that thy gospel may be preached today as thy prophets of old preached it

throughout the prayer but one thought was running through frederick brents mind and his heart was crying in its anguish  oh my god my god why do they hound me so  

it is a terrible thing this first effort before the home people especially when home has not been kind

when he arose to meet the peoples eyes his face was haggard and he felt weak but unflinchingly he swept his eyes over the crowd and that instants glance brought before him all the panorama of the past years there before him was the sneaking billy tompkins now grown to the maturity of being called  bill then there was danl hastings oh that night years ago when he had been marched up the aisle with crimson face  in one brief second he lived it all over again the shame the disgrace the misery of it there severe critical expectant sat his guardian the masterhand who had manipulated all the machinery of his life all this passed through his mind in a flash as he stood there facing the people his face changed the haggard look passed away his eyes kindled his cheeks mantled even in the pulpit even in the house of god about to speak his word the blood sped hotly through his veins and anger burned at his heart but he crushed down his feelings for the moment and began in a clear ringing voice  judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again the lesson he drew from the words was gods recognition of the fallibility of human judgment and the selfcondemnation brought about by ignoring the prohibition in the text by an effort he spoke deliberately at first but the fire in his heart came out more and more in his words as he progressed  blinded by our own prejudices he said  circumscribed by our own ignorance we dare to set ourselves up as censors of our fellowmen unable to see the whole chain of life which god has forged we take a single link and say that it is faulty too narrow to see his broad plan we take a patch of it and say this is not good there is one who works even through evil that good may come but we take the sin of our brother and without seeing or knowing what went before it or shall come after condemn him what false blind petty judges we are  you women who are condemning your fallen sisters you men who are execrating your sinful brothers if christ today were to command let him who is without sin cast the first stone look into your own hearts and answer me how many of you would dare to lift a hand  how many of you have taken the beam out of your own eye before attempting to pluck the mote out of your brothers  o ye pharisaical ones who stand in the public places and thank god that you are not as other men beware beware the condemnation that surely and inevitably shall fall upon you is not the judgment of jesus christ it is not the sentence of the father it is your own selfcondemnation without charity without forbearance without love  for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged  stand by the wayside if you will draw aside your skirts in the vainglory of selfrighteousness from the passing multitude say to each other if you will  this woman is a sinner this man is a criminal close your eyes against their acts of repentance harden your hearts against their pleas for forgiveness withhold mercy and pardon and charity but i tell you of one who has exalted charity into the highest and best of virtues i bring you the message of one whose judgment is tempered by divine love he is seeing you he is hearing you over the parapets of high heaven the gentle father leans waiting to take into his soul any breath of human love or charity which floats up to him from this sinparched world what have you done to merit his approval  have you been kind or have you been hard  have you been gentle or have you been harsh  have you been charitable or have you hunted out all the evil and closed your eyes to all the good  you have forgotten o ye of little faith you have forgotten you without charity in your hearts and you who claim to follow christ and yet have no love for your fellowsâ you have forgotten that god is a god of wrath as well as of love that christ hath anger as well as pity  that he who holds the hyssop of divine mercy holds also the scourge of divine indignation you have forgotten that the lash you so love to wield over your brothers back shall be laid upon your own by him who whipped the moneychangers from his temple listen the day shall come when the condemnation you are accumulating against yourselves shall overwhelm you stop trying to steal the prerogative of heaven judge not god only is just 

the silence throughout the sermon was intense during the closing words which have been quoted it was like a presence in the chapel the voice of the preacher rang out like a clarion his eyes looked before him as if he saw into the future his hand was uplifted as if he would call down upon them the very judgment which he predicted

without more words he sat down no one moved or spoke for an instant danl hastings let his cane fall upon the floor it echoed through the silent place with a crash some of the women started and half cried out but the spell was now partly broken mr simpson suddenly remembered to pray and the gossips forgot to whisper when their heads were bowed there were some pale faces in the crowd and some which the galling of tears had made red there was in the atmosphere something of the same tense silence that follows a terrific thunderclap and so the service ended and the people filed out of church silent still some few remained behind to shake the preachers hand but as soon as the benediction was over he hurried out the side door and before any one could intercept him was on his way home but he left a willing substitute mrs hodges accepted all his congratulations with complacent condescension

 danl said thomas donaldson as he helped the old man down the church steps  i was mistaken about the docterns an the whisky it was stronger an better because it was the pure stuff

i aint got a word to say said danl ceptin that a good deal of it was jest sass but he kept mumbling to himself as he hobbled along jedge not fur youre apilin up sentences on yoreself i never thought of it that way before  no i never brent did not come out of his room to dinner that afternoon mrs hodges was for calling him but the old man objected  no hester he said  freddie jest wants to be let alone hes afeelin now

 but liphalet he ought to know how nice people talked about his sermon i tell you that was my kind o doctern its wonderful how a child will learn

notwithstanding his belief that his young friend wanted to be left alone the old man slipped into his room later on with a cup of tea the young man sat before the table his head buried in his hands eliphalet set the cup and saucer down and turned to go but he paused at the door and said  thank the lord fur the way you give it to em freddie it was worth a dollar he would have hurried out but the young man sprang up and seized his hand exclaiming it was wrong uncle liph it was wrong of me i saw them sitting about me like jackals waiting for their prey i remembered all that i had been and all that i was i knew what they were thinking and i was angry angry god forgive me  that sermon was preached from as hot a heart as ever did murder the old man stroked the young ones hair as he would a childs  never mind he said  it dont matter what you felt thats between you an him i only know what you said an thats all i care about didnt you speak about the lord awhippin the moneychangers from the temple aint lots o them worse than the moneychangers  was nt christ divine  aint you human would a body expect you to feel lessn he did huh jest dont you worry remember that you did nt hit a head that was nt in striking distance and the old man pressed the boy back into his chair and slipped out

beside an absolute refusal again to supply brent made no sign of the rebellion which was in him and his second year slipped quickly and uneventfully away he went to and from his duties silent and selfcontained he did not confide in mr hodges because his guardian seemed to grow more and more jealous of their friendship he could not confide in elizabeth on account of a growing conviction that she did not fully sympathise with him but his real feelings may be gathered from a letter which he wrote to his friend taylor some two months after the events recorded in the last chapter

my dear taylor it ran time and again i have told myself that i would write you a line keeping you in touch as i promised with my progress many times have i thought of our last talk together and still i think as i thought then â that in spite of all your disadvantages and your defeats you have the best of it when you fail it is your own failure and you bear down with you only your own hopes and struggles and ideals if i fail there falls with me all the framework of pride and anxiety that has so long pushed me forward and held me up for my own failure i should not sorrow my concern would be for the one who has so carefully shaped me after a pattern of her own however else one may feel one must be fair to the ambitions of others even though one is the mere material that is heated and beaten into form on the anvil of anothers will but i am ripe for revolt the devil is in me â a restrained quiet wellappearing devil but all the more terrible for that

i have at last supplied one of the pulpits here that of my own church the rev mr simpson was afflicted with a convenient and adaptable indisposition which would not allow him to preach and i was deputed to fill his place i knew what a trial it would be and had carefully written out my sermon but i am afraid i did not adhere very strictly to the manuscript i think i lost my head

i know i lost my temper but the sermon was a nine days wonder and i have had to refuse a dozen subsequent offers to supply it is all very sordid and sickening and theatrical the good old lowry tried to show me that it was my duty and for my good but i have set my foot down not to supply again and so they let me alone now

 it seems to me that that one sermon forged a chain which holds me in a position that i hate

it is a public declaration that i am or mean to be a preacher and i must either adhere to it or break desperately away do you know i feel myself to be an arrant coward if i had half the strength that you have i should have been out of it long ago but the habit of obedience grows strong upon a man

there is but one crowning act to be added to this drama of deceit and infamy â my ordination i know how all the other fellows are looking forward to it and how according to all the prescribed canons i should view the momentous day but i am i have you ever had one of those dreams where a huge octopus approaches you slowly but certainly enfolding you in his arms and twining his horrid tentacles about your helpless form  what an agony of dread you feel you try to move or cry out but you cannot and the arms begin to embrace you and draw you towards the great body just so i feel about the day of the ceremony that shall take me into the body of which i was never destined to be a member

 are you living in a garret  are you subsisting on a crust happy happy fellow but thank god the ordination does not take place until next year and perhaps in that time i may find some means of escape if i do not i know that i shall have your sympathy but dont express it ever sincerely yours brent

but the year was passing and nothing happened to release him he found himself being pushed forward at the next term with unusual rapidity but he did not mind it the work rather gave him relief from more unpleasant thoughts he went at it with eagerness and mastered it with ease his fellowstudents looked on him with envy but he went on his way unheeding and worked for the very love of being active until one day he understood

it was nearing the end of the term when a fellowstudent remarked to him well brent it is nt every man that could have done it but youll get your reward in a month or so now

 what do you mean   asked brent done what

 now dont be modest rejoined the other i am really glad to see you do it i have no envy

 really barker i dont understand you

 why i mean you are finishing two years in one

 oh pshaw it will hardly amount to that

 oh well you will get in with the senior class men

 get in with the senior class  

it will be kind of nice a year before your time to be standing in the way of any appointive plums that may happen to fall and then you dont have to go miles away from home before you can be made a fullfledged shepherd well here is my hand on it anyway

brent took the proffered hand in an almost dazed condition it had all suddenly flashed across his mind the reason for his haste and his added work what a blind fool he had been 

the church conference met at dexter that year and they had hurried him through in order that he might be ready for ordination thereat

alleging illness as an excuse he did not appear at recitation that day the shock had come too suddenly for him was he thus to be entrapped  could he do nothing  he felt that ordination would bind him for ever to the distasteful work he had only a month in which to prevent it he would do it from that day he tried to fall gradually back in his work  but it was too late the good record which he had unwittingly piled up carried him through nolens volens

the week before conference met frederick brent residing at dexter by special request of the faculty was presented as a candidate for ordination even his enemies in the community said  surely there is something in that boy

mrs hester hodges was delighted she presented him with his ordination suit and altogether displayed a pride and pleasure that almost reconciled the young man to his fate in the days immediately preceding the event she was almost tender with him and if he had been strong enough to make a resolve inimical to her hopes the disappointment which he knew failure would bring to her would have greatly weakened it

now conference is a great event in the circles of that sect of which cory chapel was a star congregation and the town where it convenes or sets as the popular phrase goes is an honoured place it takes upon itself an air of unusual bustle there is a great deal of housecleaning hanging of curtains and laying of carpets just prior to the time people from the rural parts about come into town and settle for the week ministers and lay delegates from all the churches in the district comprising perhaps half of a large state or parts of two come and are quartered upon the local members of the connection for two weeks beforehand the general question that passes from one housewife to another is  how many and whom are you going to take   many are the heartburnings and jealousies aroused by the disposition of some popular preacher whom a dozen members of the flock desire to entertain while the less distinguished visitors must bide their time and be stuck in when and where they may the  big guns  of the church are all present and all the  little guns are scattered about them popping and snapping every time a big gun  booms

but of all the days of commotion and excitement the climax is ordination day when candidates for the ministry college students and local preachers are examined and either rejected or admitted to the company of the elect it is common on that day for some old dignitary of the church seldom a less person than the president of the conference himself to preach the sermon then if the fatted calf is not killed at least the fatted fowls are and feasting and rejoicing rule the occasion

this ordination day was no exception a class of ten stood up before the examining committee and answered the questions put to them among them stood frederick brent he wished he tried to fail in his answers and be rejected even though it meant disgrace  but try as he would he could not force of habit was too strong for him or was it that some unseen and relentless power was carrying him on and on against his will  he clinched his hands the beads of perspiration broke out on his brow but ever as the essential questions came to him his tongue seemed to move of its own volition without command from the brain and the murmurs of approval told him that he was answering aright never did man struggle harder for brilliant success than this one for ignominious failure then some whisper in his consciousness told him that it was over he felt the laying of hands upon his head he heard the old minister saying  behold even from the lowliest god taketh his workers and he felt a flash of resentment but it was only momentary he was benumbed something seemed to be saying in his mind will the old fool never have done   but it did not appear to be himself it was afar off and apart from him

the next he knew a wet cheek was laid against his own it was aunt hester she was crying and holding his hand afterwards people were shaking hands with him and offering their congratulations but he answered them in a helpless mechanical way as he had answered the questions

he sat through the sermon and heard it not but some interest revived in him as the appointments were being read he heard the president say  it gives me pain to announce the resignation of one who has so long served in the masters vineyard but our dear brother simpson has decided that he is too old for active work and has asked to be retired while we do this with pain and sorrow for the loss â though we do not wholly lose him â of so able a man we feel that we cannot do better than appoint as his successor in this charge the young man whom you have all seen so brilliantly enter into the ranks of consecrated workers the rev frederick brent

a murmur of approval went round the assembly and a few open  amens  broke forth as the unctuous old ecclesiastic sat down it sounded to the ears of the young preacher like the breaking of waves on a faroff shore and then the meaning of all that had happened sifted through his benumbed intellect and he strove to rise he would refuse to act he would protest he would tell them that he did not want to preach but something held him down he could not rise the light went blue and green and purple before him the church with its sea of faces spun round and round his head fell forward

 he has fainted said some one

the excitement has been too much for him

 poor young man he has been studying too hard working for this

they carried him out and took him home and one of the elders offered a special prayer for his speedy recovery and that being recovered he might bear his new responsibilities with becoming meekness

when the young minister came to himself he was lying on the bed in his own room and mrs hodges eliphalet and a doctor were bending over him

 hes coming round all right now said the medical man you wont need me any longer and he departed

how are you now fred asked mrs hodges

the young man closed his eyes again and did not answer he had awakened to a full realisation of his position and a dull misery lay at his heart he wished that he could die then and there for death seemed the only escape from his bondage he was bound irrevocably bound

 poor child mrs hodges went on  it was awful tryin on his nerves joy is worse n sorrow sometimes  an then hed been workin so hard i d never a believed he could do it ef brother simpson hadnt stuck up fur it

 she knew it then thought fred  it was all planned

 i dont think youd better talk hester said her husband in a low voice he had seen a spasm pass over the face of the prostrate youth

well ill go out an see about the dinner some o the folks ive invited will be cornin in purty soon an othersll be droppin in to inquire how he is i do hope hell be well enough to come to the table it wont seem hardly like an ordination dinner without the principal person jes set by him liphalet an give him them drops the doctor left

as soon as he heard the door close behind her brent opened his eyes and suddenly laid his hand on the old mans shoulder you wont let anybody see me uncle liph  you wont let them come in here  no no my boy not ef you dont want em said the old man

 i shall have to think it all over before i see any one i am not quite clear yet

 i low it was unexpected

 did you know uncle liph   he asked fixing his eyes upon his old friends face

 i knowd they was aplannin somethin but i never could find out what or i would have told you

a look of relief passed over brents face just then mrs hodges opened the door  heres elizabeth to see him she said

 sh said the old man with great ostentation  and tiptoeing over to the door he partly drew it to putting his head outside to whisper he is too weak it aint best fur him to see nobody now

he closed the door and returned to his seat it was lizabeth he said was i right  

for answer the patient arose from the bed and walked weakly over to his side

tut tut tut freddie said eliphalet hesitating over the name youd better lay down now  you aint any too strong yet the young man leaned heavily on his chair and looked into his friends eyes  if god had given me such a man as you as a father or even as a guardian i would not have been damned he said

sh sh my boy dont say that youre goin to be all right youre â youre â  eliphalets eyes were moist and his voice choked here rising he suddenly threw his arms around freds neck crying you are my son god has give you to me to nurse in the time of your trial the young man returned the embrace  and so mrs hodges found them when she opened the door softly and peered in she closed it noiselessly and withdrew

well i never she said there was a questioning wonder in her face

 i dont know what to make of them two she added they couldnt have been loviner ef they had been father and son after a while the guests began to arrive for the dinner many were the inquiries and calls for the new minister but to them all eliphalet made the same answer  he aint well enough to see folks

mrs hodges herself did her best to bring him out or to get him to let some of the guests in but he would not finally her patience gave way and she exclaimed  well now frederick brent you must know that you air the pastor of a church an youve got to make some sacrifices for peoples sake ef you kin possibly git up â an i know you kin â you ought to come out an show yoreself for a little while anyhow youve got some responsibilities now

 i did nt ask for them he answered coldly there was a set look about his lips  neither will i come out or see any one if i am old enough to be the pastor of a church i am old enough to know my will and have it

mrs hodges was startled at the speech she felt vaguely that there was a new element in the boys character since morning he was on the instant a man it was as if clay had suddenly hardened in the potters hands she could no longer mould or ply him in that moment she recognised the fact

the dinner was all that could be expected and her visitors enjoyed it in spite of the absence of the guest of honour but for the hostess it was a dismal failure after wielding the sceptre for years it had been suddenly snatched from her hand and she felt lost and helpless deprived of her power

as brent thought of the long struggle before him he began to wish that there might be something organically wrong with him which the shock would irritate into fatal illness but even while he thought this he sneered at himself for the weakness a weakness selfconfessed holds the possibility of strength so in a few days he rallied and took up the burden of his life again as before he had found relief in study now he stilled his pains and misgivings by a strict attention to the work which his place involved

his was not an easy position for a young man he had to go through the ordeal of pastoral visits he had to condole with old ladies who thought a preacher had nothing else to do than to listen to the recital of their ailments he had to pray with poor and stricken families whose conditions reminded him strongly of what his own must have been he had to speak words of serious admonition to girls nearly his own age who thought it great fun and giggled in his face all this must he do nor must he slight a single convention no rules of conduct are so rigid as are those of a provincial town he who ministers to the people must learn their prejudices and be adroit enough not to offend them or strong enough to break them down it was a great load to lay on the shoulders of so young a man but habit is everything and he soon fell into the ways of his office writing to taylor he said i am fairly harnessed now and at work and although the pulling is somewhat hard i know my way it is wonderful how soon a man falls into the cant of his position and learns to dole out the cutanddried phrases of ministerial talk like a sort of spiritual phonograph i must confess though that i am rather good friends with the children who come to my sundayschool my own experiences as a child are so fresh in my memory that i rather sympathise with the little fellows and do all i can to relieve the halfscared stiffness with which they conduct themselves in church and the sundayschool room

 i wonder why it is we make church such a place of terror to the young ones no wonder they quit coming as soon as they can choose

i shock miss simpson who teaches a mixed class terribly by my freedom with the pupils she says that she cant do anything with her charges any more but i notice that her class and the school are growing ive been at it for several weeks now and like a promising baby i am beginning to take an interest in things

 if i got on with the old children of my flock as well as i do with the young ones i should have nothing to complain of but i dont they know as little as the youngsters and are a deal more unruly they are continually comparing me with their old pastor and it is needless to say that i suffer by the comparison the expastor himself burdens me with advice i shall tell him some day that he has resigned but i am growing diplomatic and have several reasons for not wishing to offend him for all which shop  pray forgive me

one of the reasons for not wishing to offend the rev mr simpson of which brent wrote was as may be readily inferred his engagement to elizabeth it had not yet officially become public property but few of dexters observant and forecasting people who saw them together doubted for a moment that it would be a match indeed some spiteful people in the community who looked on from the outside said that  mr simpson never thought of resigning until he saw that he could keep the place in the family but of course they were baptists who said this or episcopalians or presbyterians â some such unregenerate lot

contrary to the adage the course of love between the young people did run smooth the young minister had not disagreed with the older one so elizabeth had not disagreed with him because she did not have to take sides she was active in the sundayschool and among the young peoples societies and brent thought that she would make an ideal ministers wife every sunday after church they walked home together and sometimes he would stop at the house for a meal they had agreed that at the end of his first pastoral year they would be married and both parent and guardian smiled on the prospective union

as his beloved young friend seemed to grow more settled and contented eliphalet hodges waxed more buoyant in the joy of his hale old age and his wife all her ambitions satisfied grew more primly genial every day

brent found his congregation increasing and heard himself spoken of as a popular preacher under these circumstances it would seem that there was nothing to be desired to make him happy but he was not so though he kept an unruffled countenance he felt the repression that his position put upon him he prayed that with time it might pass off but this prayer was not answered there were times when within his secret closet the contemplation of the dead level of his life as it spread out before him drove him almost to madness

the bitterness in his heart against his father had not abated one jot and whenever these spasms of discontent would seize him he was wont to tell himself  i am fighting old tom brent now and i must conquer him

thus nearly a year passed away and he was beginning to think of asking elizabeth to name the day he had his eye upon a pretty little nest of a house sufficiently remote from her fathers and he was looking forward to settling quietly down in a home of his own

it was about this time that as he sat alone one evening in the little chamber which was his study and bedroom in one mr simpson entered and opened conversation with him

for some time a rumour which did violence to the good name of sophy davis had been filtering through the community but it had only filtered until the girls disappearance a day or two before had allowed the gossips to talk openly and great was the talk the young minister had looked on and listened in silence he had always known and liked sophy and if what the gossips said of her was true he pitied the girl

on this particular evening it was plain that mr simpson had come to talk about the affair after some preliminary remarks he said you have a great chance dear brother brent for giving the devil in this particular part of the moral vineyard a hard blow

 i dont clearly see why now more than before returned brent

 because you are furnished with a living example of the fruits of evil dont you see  

 if there is such an example furnished the people will see it for themselves and i should be doing a thankless task to point it out to them i would rather show people the beauty of good than the ugliness of evil

yes thats the milkandwater new style of preaching

 well we all have our opinions to be sure but i think it rather a good style brent was provokingly nonchalant and his attitude irritated the elder man

we wont discuss that we will be practical i came to advise you to hold sophy davis up in church next sunday as a fearful example of evildoing you neednt mention any names but you can make it strong and plain enough

brent flushed angrily are there not enough texts in here he asked laying his hand upon the bible  that i can cite and apply without holding up a poor weak mortal to the curiosity scorn and derision of her equally weak fellows  

 but it is your duty as a christian and a preacher of the gospel to use this warning

 i do not need to kick a falling girl to find examples to warn people from sin  and as for duty i think that each man best knows his own

 then you are nt going to do it  

 no the young man burst forth  i am a preacher of the gospel not a clerical gossip  

 do you mean that i am a gossip

 i was not thinking of you

 let me preach for you sunday

 i will not do that either i will not let my pulpit be debased by anything which i consider so low as this business

you will not take advice then 

 not such as that

 be careful frederick brent i gave you that pulpit and i can take it away âi that know who you are and what you come from  the whole town knows what you know so i do not care for that as for taking my pulpit from me you may do that when you please you put it upon me by force and by force you may take it but while i am pastor there i shall use my discretion in all matters of this kind

 sophys been mighty quiet in her devilment she does nt accuse anybody maybe youve got more than one reason for shielding her

brent looked into the mans eyes and read his meaning then he arose abruptly and opened the door

 im not accusing â 

 go said the young man hoarsely his face was white and his teeth were hard set

 youll learn some respect for your elders yet if â 

 go  brent repeated and he took a step towards his visitor mr simpson looked startled for a moment but he glanced back into the young mans face and then passed hurriedly out of the room

brent let two words slip between his clenched teeth   the hound 

no one knew what had passed between the young pastor and mr simpson but many mutterings and headshakings of the latter indicated that all was not right no one knew  perhaps that is hardly correct for on sunday the sermon over when brent looked to find elizabeth in her usual place whence they walked home together she was gone he bit his lip and passed on alone but it rankled within him that she had so easily believed ill of him

but he had not seen the last of the rev mr simpsons work it was the right of five members of the congregation to call a churchmeeting and when he returned for service in the evening he found upon the pulpit the written request for such an assembly to be held on tuesday night heading the list of members was the name of the former pastor although this was not needed to tell the young man that it was his work in anger he gave out the notice and went on with his duties

somethin must a riled you tonight fred said eliphalet when church was out you give em a mighty stirrin touch o fire it minded me o that old supply sermon brent smiled mirthlessly he knew that the same feelings had inspired both efforts

on tuesday evening he was early at church and in the chair as was the pastors place early as he was he did not much precede mr simpson who came in followed by a coterie of his choicest spirits

when the assembly had been duly called to order brent asked  will some one now please state the object of this meeting  

mr simpson arose

 brothers and sisters he said  the object of this meeting is a very simple one

from the time that i began to preach in this church twentyfive years ago we had purity and cleanness in the pulpit and in the pew brents eyes were flashing eliphalet hodges who had thought that the extra session was for some routine business pricked up his ears

simpson proceeded  one in this flock has lately gone astray she has fallen into evil ways â 

 brother simpson interrupted brent his face drawn and hard with anger will you state the object of this meeting  

 if the pastor is not afraid to wait he will see that that is what i am doing

 then you are bringing into the church matters that have no business here

 we shall see about that we intend to investigate and see why you refused to hold up as a warning one of the sinners of this connection we propose to ask whom you were shielding â a sinner in the pew or a sinner in the pulpit as well we propose â   stop   the young mans voice broke out like the report of a rifle  stop i say or as god sees me here in his temple at his very altar i will do you violence i speak to you not as your pastor but as a man not as an accused man for you dare not accuse me

the church was in a commotion in all its long history such a scene had never before been enacted within the sacred walls the men sat speechless  the women shrank far down into their seats only those two men the young and the old stood glaring into each others faces

 remember brethren said someone recovering himself  that this is the house of god and that you are preachers of the gospel

 i do remember that it is gods house and for that reason i will not let it be disgraced by scandal that would stain the lowest abode of vice i do remember that i am a preacher and for that reason i will not see the gospel made vindictive â a scourge to whip down a poor girl who may have sinned â i know not â but who if she did has an advocate with god once before in this place have i told you my opinion of your charity and your love once before have i branded you as mockeries of the idea of christianity now i say to you you are hypocrites you are like carrion birds who soar high up in the ether for a while and then swoop down to revel in filth and rottenness the stench of death is sweet to you putridity is dear to you as for you who have done this work you need pity your own soul must be reeking with secret foulness to be so basely suspicious your own eyes must have cast unholy glances to so soon accuse the eyes of others as for the thing which you mine enemy have intimated here tonight as pastor of this church i scorn to make defence but as a man i say give such words as those breath again and i will forget your age and only remember your infamy i see the heads of some about me here wagging some that knew my father i hear their muffled whispers and i know what they are saying i know what is in their hearts you are saying that it is the old tom brent in me showing itself at last yes it has smouldered in me long and i am glad i think better of that spirit because it was waked into life to resent meanness i would rather be the most roistering drunkard that ever reeled down these streets than call myself a christian and carouse over the dead characters of my fellows

tonight i feel for the first time that i am myself i give you back gladly what you have given me i am no longer your pastor we are well quit even while i have preached to you i have seen in your hearts your scorn and your distrust and i have hated you in secret but i throw off the cloak i remove the disguise here i stand stripped of everything save the fact that i am a man  and i despise you openly yes old tom drunken tom brents son despises you go home go home there may be work for your stenchloving nostrils there

he stood like an avenging spirit pointing towards the door and the people who had sat there breathless through it all rose quietly and slipped out simpson joined them and melted into the crowd they were awed and hushed

only mrs hodges white as death and her husband bowed with grief remained a silent party they walked home together not until they were in the house did the woman break down and then she burst into a storm of passionate weeping as if the pentup tears of all her stoical life were flowing at once

 oh fred fred she cried between her sobs  i see it all now i was wrong i was wrong but i did it ail fur the best the lord knows i did it fur the best

 i know you did aunt hester but i wish you could have seen sooner before the bitterness of death had come into my life he felt strangely hard and cold her grief did not affect him then

 dont take on so hester said the old man but the woman continued to rock herself to and fro and moan  i did it fur the best i did it fur the best the old man took her in his arms and after a while she grew more calm only her sobs breaking the silence

 i shall go away tomorrow said brent  i am going out into the world for myself ive been a disgrace to every one connected with me

 dont say that about yoreself fred  i aint agoin to hear it said eliphalet youve jest acted as any rightthinkin man would a acted it would nt a been right fur you to a struck brother simpson but im nearer his age an my hands itched to git a hold o him the old man looked menacing and his fist involuntarily clenched

 liphalet said his wife  ive been ameddlin with the business o providence an ive got my jest deserts i thought i knowed jest what he wanted me to do an i was more ignorant than a child furgive me ef you kin fred my boy i was tryin to make a good man o you

 theres nothing for me to forgive aunt hester im sorry ive spoiled your plans

 im glad fur mebbe godll have a chance now to work his own plans but pore little lizabeth 

brents heart hurt him as he heard the familiar name and he turned abruptly and went to his room once there he had it out with himself  but he told himself if i had the emergency to meet again i should do the same thing

the next mornings mail brought him a little packet in which lay the ring he had given elizabeth to plight their troth

 i thank you for this he said  it makes my way easier

the story of the altercation between the young minister and a part of his congregation was well bruited about the town and all united in placing the fault heavily on the young mans shoulders as for him he did not care he was wild with the enjoyment of his newfound freedom only now and again as he sat at the table the morning after and looked into the sad faces of eliphalet and his guardian did he feel any sorrow at the turn matters had taken

in regard to elizabeth he felt only relief it was as if a halfdefined idea in his mind had been suddenly realised for some time he had believed her unable either to understand him or to sympathise with his motives he had begun to doubt the depth of his own feeling for her then had come her treatment of him last sunday and somehow while he knew it was at her fathers behest he could not help despising her weakness

he had spent much of the night before in packing his few effects and all was now ready for his departure as they sat at breakfast mrs hodges was unusually silent and her haggard face and swollen eyes told how she had passed the night all in a single hour she had seen the work of the best part of her life made as naught and she was bowed with grief and defeat frederick brents career had really been her dream she had scarcely admitted even to herself how deeply his success affected her own happiness she cared for him in much the same way that a sculptor loves his statue her attitude was that of one who says  look upon this work is it not fair i made it myself it was as much her pride as it was her love that was hurt because her love had been created by her pride she had been prepared to say exultingly u look where he came from and look where he is  and now his defection deprived her for ever of that sweet privilege people had questioned her ability to train up a boy rightly and she had wished to refute their imputations by making that boy the wonder of the community and their spiritual leader and just as she had deemed her work safely done lo it had come toppling about her ears even if the fall had come sooner she would have felt it less it was the more terrible because so unexpected for she had laid aside all her fears and misgivings and felt secure in her achievement

 you aint aeatin nothin hester said her husband anxiously  i hope you aint afeelin bad this mornin he had heard her sobbing all night long and the strength and endurance of her grief frightened him and made him uneasy for she had always been so stoical  had nt you better try an eat one o them buckwheat cakes put lots o butter an molasses on it theyre mighty good

 ef they re so good why dont you eat yoreself you been foolin with a half a one for the last ten minutes indeed the old mans food did seem to stick in his throat and once in a while a mist would come up before his eyes he too had had his dreams and one of them was of many a happy evening spent with his beloved boy who should be near him a joy and comfort in the evening of his life  and now he was going away

the old man took a deep gulp at his coffee to hide his emotion it burned his mouth and gave reason for the moisture in his eye when he looked up at fred

 what train air you goin to take fred   he asked

 i think ill catch that eightfifty flier its the best i can get you know and vestibuled through too

 you have jest finally made up yore mind to go have you  

 nothing could turn me from it now uncle liph

 it seems like a shame you aint got nothin to do down in cincinnaty

 ill find something before long i am going to spend the first few days just in getting used to being free the next moment he was sorry that he had said it for he saw his guardians eyes fill

 i am sorry frederick she said with some return to her old asperity  i am sorry that ive made your life so hard that you think that you have been a slave i am sorry that my home has been so onpleasant that you re so powerful glad to git away from it even to go into a strange city full of wickedness an sin

 i did nt mean it that way aunt hester

youve been as good as you could be to me you have done your duty by me if any one ever could

well i am mighty glad you realise that sos ef you go away an fall into sinful ways you cant lay none of it to my bringinup

 i feel somehow as if i would like to have a go with sin some time to see what it is like

 well i lay youll be satisfied before youve been in cincinnaty long for ef there ever was livin hells on airth its them big cities

 oh i have got faith to believe that fred aint agoin to do nothin wrong said eliphalet

 nobody dont know what nobodys agoin to do under temptation sich as is layin in wait fur young men in the city but im shore ive done my best to train you right even ef i have made some mistakes in my poor weak way an manner

 if i do fall into sinful ways aunt hester i shall never blame you or your training for it

but you aint agoin to do it fred you aint agoin to fall into no evil ways

i dont know uncle liph i never felt my weakness more than i do now

 then that very feelin will be yore strenth my boy keep on feelin that way

 itll not be a strenth in cincinnaty not by no means there is too many snares an pitfalls there to entrap the weak mrs hodges insisted

it is one of the defects of the provincial mind that it can never see any good in a great city it concludes that as many people are wicked where large numbers of human beings are gathered together there must be a much greater amount of evil than in a smaller place it overlooks the equally obvious reasoning that as some people are good in the larger mass there must be also a larger amount of goodness it seems a source of complacent satisfaction to many to sit in contemplation of the fact of the extreme wickedness of the world they are like children who delight in a  bluggy story â who gloat over murder and rapine

brent however was in no wise daunted by the picture of evil which his guardian painted for him and as soon as breakfast was over he got his things in hand ready to start buoyant as he was with his new freedom this was a hard moment for him despite the severity of his youthful treatment in dexter the place held all the tender recollections he had and the room where he stood was the scene of some memories that now flooded his mind and choked his utterance when he strove to say goodbye he had thought that he should do it with such a fine grace he would prove such a strong man but he found his eyes suffused with tears as he held his old guardians hand for in spite of all she had done the best for him that she knew and she had taken a hard uncompromising pride in him

 i hope youll git along all right frederick she faltered forth tearfully  keep out of bad company an let us hear from you whenever you can the lord knows ive tried to do my dooty by you

poor eliphalet tried to say something as he shook the young mans hand but he broke down and wept like a child the boy could not realise what a deal of sunshine he was taking out of the old mans life

 ill write to you as soon as i am settled he told them and with a husky farewell hurried away from the painful scene at the gate the old couple stood and watched him go swinging down the street towards the station then they went into the house and sat long in silence in the room he had so lately left the breakfasttable with all that was on it was left standing unnoticed and neglected a thing unprecedented in mrs hodges orderly household

finally her husband broke the silence  it pears as if we had jest buried some one and come home from the funeral

an thats jest what we have done ef we only knowed it liphalet weve buried the last of the fred brent we knowed an raised even ef we ever see him agin hell never be the same to us hell have new friends to think of an new notions in his head

 dont say that hester  dont say that i cant stand it he is never goin to furgit you an me an it hurts me to hear you talk like that

 it dont soun none too pleasant fur me liphalet but ive learned to face the truth an thats the truth ef it ever was told

well mebbe its fur the best then itll draw us closer together and make us more to each other as we journey down to the end its our evenin hester an we must expect some chilly winds long towards night but i guess he knows best he reached over and took his wifes hand tenderly in his and so they sat on sadly but gathering peace in the silence and the sympathy until far into the morning

meanwhile the eightfifty flier was speeding through the beautiful ohio valley bearing the young minister away from the town of his birth out of sight of the grief of his friends he had regained all his usual stolid selfpossession though his mind often went back to the little cottage at dexter where the two old people sat and he may be forgiven if his memory lingered longer over the image of the man than of the woman he remembered with a thrill at his heart what eliphalet hodges had been to him in the dark days of his youth and he confessed to himself with a half shame that his greatest regret was in leaving him

the feeling with which he had bidden his guardian goodbye was one not of regret at his own loss but of pity for her distress to elizabeth his mind only turned for a moment to dismiss her with a mild contempt something hard that had always been in his nature seemed to have suddenly manifested itself

 it is so much better this way he said  for if the awakening had come later we should have been miserable together and then his thoughts went forward to the new scenes towards which he was speeding

he had never been to cincinnati indeed except on picnic days he had scarcely ever been outside of dexter but cincinnati was the great city of his state the one towards which adventurous youth turned its steps when real life was to be begun he dreaded and yet longed to be there and his heart was in a turmoil of conflicting emotion as he watched the landscape flit by

it was a clear august day nature was trembling and fainting in the ecstasies of sensuous heat beside the railway the trenches which in spring were gurgling brooks were now dry and brown and the reeds which had bent forward to kiss the water now leaned over from very weakness dusty and sickly the fields were ripening to the harvest there was in the air the smell of freshcut hay the cornstalks stood like a host armed with brazen swords to resist the onslaught of that other force whose weapon was the cornknife farther on between the trees the much depleted river sparkled in the sun and wound its way now near now away from the road a glittering dragon in an enchanted wood

such scenes as these occupied the young mans mind until amid the shouts of brakemen the vociferous solicitations of the baggageman and a general air of bustle and preparation the train thundered into the grand central station something seized brents heart like a great compressing hand he was frightened for an instant and then he was whirled out with the rest of the crowd up the platform through the thronged waitingroom into the street 

then the cries of the eager men outside of cab sir cab sir let me take your baggage and  which way sir   bewildered him he did the thing which every provincial does he went to a policeman and inquired of him where he might find a respectable boardinghouse the policeman did not know but informed him that there were plenty of hotels farther up with something like disgust brent wondered if all the hotels were like those he saw at the station where the guests had to go through the barroom to reach their chambers he shuddered at it so strong is the influence of habit but he did not wish to go to a hotel so carrying his two valises he trudged on though the hot sun of the midafternoon beat mercilessly down upon him he kept looking into the faces of people who passed him in the hope that he might see in one encouragement to ask for the information he so much wanted but one and all they hurried by without even so much as a glance at the dusty traveller had one of them looked at him he would merely have said mentally  some country bumpkin come in to see the sights of town and be buncoed

there is no loneliness like the loneliness of the unknown man in a crowd a feeling of desolation took hold upon brent so he turned down a sidestreet in order to be more out of the main line of business it was a fairly respectable quarter  children were playing about the pavements and in the gutters while others with pails and pitchers were going to and from the corner saloon where their vessels were filled with foaming beer brent wondered at the cruelty of parents who thus put their children in the way of temptation and looked to see if the little ones were not bowed with shame  but they all strode stolidly on with what he deemed an unaccountable indifference to their own degradation he passed one place where the people were drinking in the front yard and saw a mother holding a glass of beer to her little ones lips he could now understand the attitude of the children but the fact nevertheless surprised and sickened him

finally the sign  boarding here  caught his eye he went into the yard and knocked at the door a plump german girl opened it and to his question as to accommodation replied that she would see her mistress he was ushered into a little parlour that boasted some shabby attempts at finery and was soon joined by a woman whom he took to be the  lady of the house

yes mrs jones took boarders would he want room and board terms five dollars per week had he work in the city  no  well from gentlemen who were out of work she always had her money in advance but would he see his room first

wondering much at mrs joness strange business arrangement brent allowed her to conduct him to a room on the second floor which looked out on the noisy street it was not a palatial place by any means but was not uncomfortable save for the heat which might be expected anywhere on such a day he was tired and wanted rest so he engaged the place and paid the woman then and there

 you just come off the train i see will you have luncheon at once mr â  

brent said he yes i will have some luncheon if you please

 do you take beer with your luncheon    noo he said hesitating and yet why should he not take beer  everybody else did even the children then he blushed as he thought of what his aunt hester would think of his even hesitating over the question she would have shot out a  no  as if it were an insult to be asked so without beer he ate his luncheon and lay down to rest for the afternoon when one has travelled little even a short journey is fatiguing

in the evening brent met some of the other boarders at supper there were not many they were principally clerks in shops or underbookkeepers one genial young fellow struck up a conversation with fred and became quite friendly during the evening

 i guess you will go out to the zoo  tomorrow wont you  that is about the first place that visitors usually strike for when they come here

 i thought of getting a general idea of the city first so that i could go round better before going farther out

 oh you wont have any trouble in getting around just ask folks and they will direct you anywhere

 but everybody seems to be in a hurry and by the time i open my mouth to ask them they have passed me

the young clerk mr perkins by name thought this was a great joke and laughed long and loudly at it

 i wish to gracious i could go around with you i have been so busy ever since i have been here that i have never seen any of the show sights myself but i tell you what i will do  i can steer you around some on thursday night that is my night off and then i will show you some sights that are sights the young man chuckled as he got his hat and prepared to return to the shop brent thanked him in a way that sounded heavy and stilted even to his own ears after the others light pleasantry

 and another thing said perkins  we will go to see the baseball game on sunday clevelands and the reds â great game you know it was well that mr perkins was halfway out of the door before he finished his sentence for there was no telling what effect upon him the flush which mounted to brents face and the horror in his eyes would have had

go to a baseball game on sunday  what would his people think of such a thing  how would he himself feel there â he notwithstanding his renunciation of office a minister of the gospel  he hastened to his room where he could be alone and think the city indeed was full of temptations to the young and yet he knew he would be ashamed to tell his convictions to perkins or to explain his horror at the proposition again there came to him as there had come many times before the realisation that he was out of accord with his fellows he was not in step with the procession he had been warped away from the parallel of everyday ordinary humanity in order to still the tumult in his breast he took his hat and wandered out upon the street he wanted to see people to come into contact with them and so rub off some of the strangeness in which their characters appeared to him

the streets were all alight and alive with bustle here a fakir with loud voice and marketplace eloquence was vending his shoddy wares there a drunkard reeled or was kicked from the door of a saloon whose noiselessly swinging portals closed for an instant only to be reopened to admit another victim who ere long would be treated likewise a quartet of young negroes were singing on the pavement in front of a house as he passed and catching the few pennies and nickels that were flung to them from the door a young girl smiled and beckoned to him from a window and another who passed laughed saucily up into his face and cried  ah there   everywhere was the inevitable pail flashing to and fro sickened disgusted thrown back upon himself brent turned his steps homeward again was this the humanity he wanted to know was this the evil which he wanted to have a go with  was aunt hester after all in the right and was her way the best  his heart was torn by a multitude of conflicting emotions he had wondered in one of his rebellious moods if when he was perfectly untrammelled he would ever pray  but on this night of nights before he went wearily to bed he remained long upon his knees

brent found himself in a most peculiar situation he had hated the severe discipline of his youth and had finally rebelled against it and renounced its results as far as they went materially this he had thought to mean his emancipation but when the hour to assert his freedom had come he found that the long years of rigid training had bound his volition with iron bands he was wrapped in a mantle of habit which he was ashamed to display and yet could not shake off the pendulum never stops its swing in the middle of the arc so he would have gone to the other extreme and revelled in the pleasures whose very breath had been forbidden to his youth but he found his sensibilities revolting from everything that did not accord with the old puritan code by whichthey had been trained he knew himself to be full of capabilities for evil but it seemed as if some power greater than his held him

back it was frederick brent who looked on sin abstractly but its presence in the concrete was seen through the eyes of mrs hester hodges it could hardly be called the decree of conscience because so instantaneous was the rejection of evil that there was really no time for reference to the internal monitor the very restriction which he had complained of he was now putting upon himself the very yoke whose burden he hated he was placing about his own neck he had run away from the sound ofright and duty but had not escaped their power he felt galled humiliated and angry with himself because he had long seen the futility of blind indignation against the unseen force which impelled him forward in a hated path

one thing that distressed him was a haunting fear of the sights which perkins would show him on the morrows night he had seen enough for himself to conjecture of what nature they would be he did not want to see more and yet how could he avoid it  he might plead illness but that would be a lie and then there would be other nights to follow so it would only be a postponement of what must ultimately take place or be boldly rejected once he decided to explain his feelings on the subject but in his minds eye he saw the halfpitying sneer on the face of the worldly young cityite and he quailed before it

why not go  could what he saw hurt him was he so great a coward that he dared not come into the way of temptation  we do not know the strength of a shield until it has been tried in battle metal does not ring true or false until it is struck he would go he would see with his own eyes for the purpose of information he would have his boasted bout with sin after this highly valorous conclusion he fell asleep

the next morning found him wavering again but he put all his troubled thoughts away and spent the day in sightseeing he came in at night tired and feeling strange and lonesome  whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad we used to say but all that is changed now and whom the devil wishes to get he first makes lonesome then the victim is up to anything

brent had finished his supper when perkins came in but he brightened at the young clerks cheery salute hello there ready to go are you  

 been ready all day he replied with a laugh its been pretty slow

 aint made much out then seeing the sights of this little village of ours  well well do better tonight if the people dont see that black tie of yours and take you for a preacher getting facts for a crusade

brent blushed and bit his lip but he only said  ill go up and change it while youre finishing your supper

guess youd better or some one will be asking you for a sermon perkins laughed goodnaturedly but he did not know how his words went home to his companions sensitive feelings he thought that his haste in leaving the room and his evident confusion were only the evidence of a greenhorns embarrassment under raillery he really had no idea that his comrades tie was the badge of his despised calling

brent was down again in a few minutes a grey cravat having superseded the offending black but even now as he compared himself with his guide he appeared sombre and ascetic his black prince albert coat showed up gloomy and oppressive against young perkinss natty drab cutaway relieved by a dashing red tie from head to foot the little clerk was light and dapper and as they moved along the crowded streets the preacher felt much as a conscious omnibus would feel beside a pneumatictired sulky

you can talk all you want to about your chicago perkins was rattling on  but you can bet your life cincinnatis the greatest town in the west chicagos nothing but a big overgrown country town everything looks new and flimsy there to a fellow but here you get something thats solid chicagos pretty swift too but there aint no flies on us either when it comes to the go

brent thought with dismay how much his companion knew and felt a passing bitterness that he though older had seen none of these things

ever been in chicago asked perkins  but of course you have nt this was uttered in such a tone of conviction that the minister thought his greenness must be very apparent

 ive never been around much of anywhere he said  ive been hard at work all my life

 eh that so you dont look like youd done much hard work what do you do  

 i â i â ah â write was the confused answer

perkins fortunately did not notice the  confusion  oh ho   he said   do you go in for newspaper work  

 no not for newspapers

 oh you re an author a regular outandouter well dont you know i thought you were somehow different from most fellows ive met i never could see how you authors could stay away in small towns where you hardly ever see any one and write about people as you do but i suppose you get your people from books

 no not entirely replied brent letting the mistake go  there are plenty of interesting characters in a small town its life is just what the life of a larger city is only the scale is smaller

well if youre on a search for characters youll see some tonight thatll be worth putting in your notebook well stop here first

the place before which they had stopped was surrounded by a high vinecovered lattice fence over the entrance flamed forth in letters set with gaslights the words  meyers beergarden and variety hall welcome he could hear the sound of music within â a miserable orchestra and a woman singing in a high strident voice people were passing in and out of the place he hesitated and then shaking himself as if to shake off his scruples turned towards the entrance as he reached the door a man who was standing beside it thrust a paper into his hand he saw others refuse to take it as they passed it was only the announcement of a temperance meeting at a neighbouring hall he raised his eyes to find the gaze of the man riveted upon him

 dont you go in there young man he said you dont look like you was used to this life come away remember its the first step â 

chuck him said perkinss voice at his elbow but something in the mans face held him a happy thought struck him he turned to his companion and said in a low voice  i think ive found a character here already will you excuse me for a while  

 certainly business before pleasure pump him all you can and then come in youll find me at one of the tables on the farther side perkins passed on

you wont go in my young friend said the temperance man

 what is it to you whether i go in or stay out   asked brent in a tone of assumed carelessness

 i want to keep every man i kin from walkin the path that i walked and sufferin as i suffer he was seized with a fit of coughing his face was old and very thin and his hands even in that hot air were blue as with cold  i wisht youd go to our meetin tonight weve got a powerful speaker there thatll show you the evils of drink better n i kin

 where is this great meeting   brent tried to put a sneer into his voice but an unaccountable tremor ruined its effect

he was duly directed to the hall  i may come around he said carelessly and sauntered off leaving the man coughing beside the door of the beergarden given all of his life to the devil he mused drunk himself to death and now seeking to steal into heaven by giving away a few tracts in his last worthless moments he had forgotten all about perkins

he strolled about for a while and then actuated by curiosity sought out the hall where the meeting was being held it was a rude place in a poor neighbourhood the meetingroom was up two flights of dingy rickety stairs hither brent found his way his acquaintance of the street was there before him and sitting far to the front among those whom by their position the young man took to be the speakers of the evening the room was half full of the motleyest crew that it had ever been his ill fortune to set eyes on the flaring light of two lardoil torches brought out the peculiarities of the queer crowd in fantastic prominence there was everywhere an odour of work but it did not hang chiefly about the men the women were mostly little weazenfaced creatures whom labour and ill treatment had rendered inexpressibly hideous the men were chiefly of the reformed the bleared eyes and bloated faces of some showed that their reformation must have been of very recent occurrence while a certain unsteadiness in the conduct of others showed that with them the process had not taken place at all

it was late and a stuffy little man with a wheezy voice and a very red nose was holding forth on the evils of intemperance very much to his own satisfaction evidently and unmistakably to the weariness of his audience brent was glad when he sat down then there followed experiences from women whose husbands had been drunkards and from husbands whose wives had been similarly afflicted it was all thoroughly uninteresting and commonplace

the young man had closed his eyes and suppressing a yawn had just determined to go home when he was roused by a new stir in the meeting and the voice of the wheezy man saying and now brothers we are to have a great treat we are to hear the story of the california pilgrim told by himself bless the lord for his testimony  go on my brother brent opened his eyes and took in the scene beside the chairman stood the emaciated form of his chance acquaintance it was the mans face now seen in the clearer light that struck him it was thin very thin and of a deathly pallor the long grey hair fell in a tumbled mass above the large hollow eyes the cheekbones stood up prominently and seemed almost bursting through the skin his whole countenance was full of the terrible hopeless tragedy of a ruined life he began to speak

 ill have to be very brief brothers and sisters as i have nt much breath to spare but i will tell you my life simply in order to warn any that may be in the same way to change their course twenty years ago i was a hardworkin man in this state i got along fairly an had enough to live on an keep my wife an baby decent of course i took my dram like the other workmen an it never hurt me but some men cant stand what others kin an the habit commenced to grow on me i took a spree now an then an then went back to work fur i was a good hand an could always git somethin to do after a while i got so unsteady that nobody would have me from then on it was the old story i got discouraged an drunk all the more three years after i begun my home was a wreck an i had illtreated my wife until she was no better than i was  then she got a divorce from me an i left the town i wandered from place to place sometimes workin always drinkin sometimes ridin on trains sometimes trampin by the roadside finlly i drifted out to californy an there i spent most o my time until a year ago i come to see myself what a miserable bein i was it was through one of your bands of hope from then i pulled myself up but it was too late i had ruined my health i started for my old home talkin and tellin my story by the way i want to get back there an jest let the people know that ive repented an then i can die in peace i want to see ef my wife an child â  here a great fit of coughing seized him again and he was forced to sit down

brent had listened breathlessly to every word a terrible fear was clutching at his heart when the man sat down he heard the voice of the chairman saying  now let us all contribute what we can to help the brother on his journey  he hasnt far to go come forward and lay your contributions on the table here now some one sing now whos going to help brother brent  

the young man heard the name he grasped the seat in front of him for support he seized his hat staggered to his feet and stumbled blindly out of the room and down the stairs

 drunk  said some one as he passed

he rushed into the street crying within himself  my god my god he hurried through the crowds thrusting the people right and left and unheeding the curses that followed him he reached home and groped up to his room

 awful  murmured mrs jones  he seemed such a good young man  but hes been out with mr perkins and men will be men

once in his room it seemed that he would go mad back and forth he paced the floor clenching his hands and smiting his head he wanted to cry out he felt the impulse to beat his head against the wall  my god  my god it was my father he cried  going back home what shall i do   there was yet no pity in his heart for the man whom he now knew to be his parent his only thought was of the bitterness that parents folly had caused  oh why could he not have died away from home without going back there to revive all the old memories  why must he go back there just at this troublous time to distress those who have loved me and help those who hate me to drag my name in the dust 

he has chosen his own way and it has ever been apart from me he has neglected and forgotten me now why does he seek me out after a life spent among strangers  i do not want him i will not see him again i shall never go home i have seen him i have heard him talk i have stood near him and talked with him and just when i am leaving it all behind me all my past of sorrow and degradation he comes and lays a hand upon me and i am more the son of tom brent tonight than ever before is it fate god or the devil that pursues me so

his passion was spending itself when he was more calm he thought  he will go home with a religious testimony on his lips he will die happy and the man who has spent all his days in drunkenness killed his wife and damned his son will be preached through the gates of glory on the strength of a few words of familiar cant there came into his mind a great contempt for the system which taught or preached so absurd and unfair a doctrine  i wish i could go to the other side of the world he said  and live among heathens who know no such dreams i frederick brent son of tom brent temperance advocate sometime drunkard and wifebeater there was terrible scorching irony in the thought there was a pitiless hatred in his heart for his fathers very name

i suppose he went on  that uncle liph  â he said the name tenderly â  has my letter now and will be writing to me to come home and hear my fathers dying words and receive perhaps his dying blessingâ his dying blessing but i will not go  i will not go back anger mingled with shame at his origin and a greater shame at himself flamed within him he did not care for the helpless son sixteen years ago  let him die without the sight of the son now his life has cursed my life his name has blasted my name his blood has polluted my blood let him die as he lived âwithout me

he dropped into a chair and struck the table with his clenched fists

mrs jones came to the door to ask him not to make so much noise he buried his face in his hands and sat there thinking thinking until morning

next morning when brent went down to breakfast he was as a man who had passed through an illness his eyes were bloodshot his face was pale his step was nervous and weak

just what i expected muttered mrs jones he was in a beastly condition last night i shall speak to mr perkins about it he had no right to take and get him in such a state

she was more incensed than ever when the gay young clerk came in looking perfectly fresh  hes used to it she told herself  and it does nt tell on him but its nearly killed that poor young man

 hullo there brent said perkins  you chucked me for good last night did you lose your way or was your character too interesting

 character too interesting was the laconic reply

 and ill bet youve been awake all night studying it out

you are entirely right there said brent smiling bitterly  i havent slept a wink all night ive been studying out that character

 i thought you looked like it you ought to take some rest today

 i cant ive got to put in my time on the same subject

mrs jones pursed her lips and bustled among the teacups the idea of their laughing over their escapades right before her face and thinking that she did not understand  she made the mental observation that all men were natural born liars and most guilty when they appeared to be most innocent  character indeed did they think to blind her to the true situation of things  oh astute woman 

 strange fellow said perkins to his spoon when after a slight breakfast brent had left the table

 theres others that are just as strange only they think they re sharper quoth mrs jones with a knowing look

 i dont understand you returned her boarder turning his attention from his spoon to the ladys face

 theres none so blind as those who dont want to see

again i say i dont understand you mrs jones

 oh mr perkins its no use trying to fool me i know men in my younger days i was married to a man

 strange contingency  but still it casts no light on your previous remarks

youve got very innocent eyes i must say mr perkins

 the eyes madam are the windows of the soul perkins quoted with mock gravity

 well if the eyes are the souls windows there are some people who always keep their windows curtained

 but i must deny any such questionable performance on my part i have not the shrewdness to veil my soul from the scrutiny of so keen an observer as yourself

oh flattery isnt going to do your cause one mite of good mr perkins im not going to scold but next time you get him in such a state i wish youd bring him home yourself and not let him come tearing in here like a madman scaring a body half to death

 will you kindly explain yourself what condition  and who is him   

 oh of course you dont know

 i do not

 do you mean to tell me that you were nt out with mr brent last night before he came home  

 i assuredly was not with him after the first quarter of an hour

well its hard to believe that he got that way by himself

 that way  why he left me at the door of meyers beergarden to talk to a temperance crank who he thought was a character  well no temperance character sent him rushing and stumbling in here as he did last night character indeed it was at the bottom of a pail of beer or something worse

 oh i dont think he was  loaded hes an author and i guess his eye got to rolling in a fine frenzy and he had to hurry home to keep it from rolling out of his head into the street

 mr perkins this is no subject for fun i have seen what i have seen and it was a most disgraceful spectacle i take your word for it that you were not with mr brent but you need not try to go further and defend him

 im not trying to defend him at all  its really none of my business and perkins went off to work a little bit angry and a good deal more bewildered  i thought he was a jay  he remarked

to brent the day was a miserable one he did not leave his room but spent the slow hours pacing back and forth in absorbed thought interrupted now and then by vain attempts to read his mind was in a state of despairing apprehension it needed no prophetic sense to tell him what would happen it was only a question of how long a time would elapse before he might expect to receive word from dexter summoning him home it all depended upon whether or not the  california pilgrim  got money enough last night for exploiting his disgraceful history to finish the last stage of the journey

what disgusted the young man so intensely was that his father after having led the life he had should make capital out of relating it would not a quiet repentance if it were real have been quite sufficient  he very much distrusted the sincerity of motive that made a man hold himself up as an example of reformed depravity when the hope of gain was behind it all the very charity which he had preached so fiercely to his congregation he could not extend to his own father indeed it appeared to him although this may have been a trick of his distorted imagination that the  pilgrim  had seemed to take a sort of pleasure in the record of his past as though it were excellent to be bad in order to have the pleasure of conversion his lip involuntarily curled when he thought of conversion he was disgusted with all men and principles one man offends and a whole system suffers he felt a peculiar selfconsciousness a selfglorification in his own misery placing the accumulated morality of his own life against the fullgrown evil of his fathers it angered him to think that by the intervention of a seemingly slight quantity the results were made equal

 what is the use of it all he asked himself  my struggle involuntary though it was my selfabnegation my rigidity when what little character i have built up is overshadowed by my fathers past  why should i have worked so hard and long for those rewards real or fancied the favour of god and the respect of men when he after a career of outrageous dissipation by a simple act or claim of repentance wins the deitys smile and is received into the arms of people with gushing favour while i am looked upon as the natural recipient of all his evil  of course they tell us that there is more joy over the one lamb that is found than over the ninety and nine that went not astray it puts rather a high premium on straying he laughed bitterly  with what i have behind me is it worth being decent for the sake of decency after all is the game worth the candle  

he took up a little book which many times that morning he had been attempting to read it was an edition of matthew arnolds poems and one of the stanzas was marked it was in  mycerinus

oh wherefore cheat our youth if thus it be of one short joy one lust one pleasant dream stringing vain words of powers we cannot see blind divinations of a will supreme 

lost labour  when the circumambient gloom but holds if gods gods careless of our doom 

he laid the book down with a sigh it seemed to fit his case

it was not until the next morning however that his anticipations were realised and the telegraph messenger stopped at his door the telegram was signed eliphalet hodges and merely said come at once you are needed

needed what could they need of him wanted would have been a better word â  wanted  by the man who for sixteen years had forgotten that he had a son he had already decided that he would not go and was for the moment sorry that he had stayed where the telegram could reach him and stir his mind again into turmoil but the struggle had already recommenced maybe his father was burdening his good old friends and it was they who  needed  him then it was his duty to go but not for his fathers sake he would not even see his father no not that he could not see him

it ended by his getting his things together and taking the next train he was going he told himself to the relief of his guardian and his friend and not because his father â his father â wanted him did he deceive himself were there not at the bottom of it all the natural promptings of so close a relationship which not even cruelty neglect and degradation could wholly stifle 

he saw none of the scenes that had charmed his heart on the outward journey a few days before for now his sight was either far ahead or entirely inward when he reached dexter it was as if years had passed since he left its smoky little station things did not look familiar to him as he went up the old street because he saw them with new eyes

mr hodges must have been watching for him for he opened the door before he reached it

 come in freddie he said in a low voice tiptoeing back to his chair  ive got great news fur you

you neednt tell me what it is said brent i know that my father is here 

eliphalet started up  who told you   he said  some blockhead ill be bound who did nt break it to you gently as i would a done actully the people in this here town â 

 dont blame the people uncle liph said the young man smiling in spite of himself  i found it out for myself before i arrived  and i assure you it was nt gently broken to me either to the old mans look of bewildered amazement brent replied with the story of his meeting with his father

 its the good lords doins said eliphalet reverently

 i dont know just whose doing it is but it is an awful accusation to put on the lord ive still got enough respect for him not to believe that

 freddie exclaimed the old man horrorstricken you aint agettin irreverent you aint abeginnin to doubt air you dont do it i know jest what youve had to bear all along an i know what you re abearin now but you aint the only one that has their crosses im abearin my own an it aint light neither you dont know what it is my boy when you feel that somethin precious is all your own to have a real owner come in an snatch it away from you while i thought yore father was dead you seemed like my own son but now it pears like i aint got no kind o right to you an its kind o hard freddie its kind o hard after all these years i know how a mother feels when she loses her baby but when its a grown son thats lost one that shes jest been pilin up love fur its â its â  the old man paused overcome by his emotions

 i am as much â no more than ever your son uncle liph no one shall ever come between us no not even the man i should call father

 he is yore father freddie its jest like i told hester she was fur sendin him along in spite of himself a pang shot through brents heart at this  but i said no no hester hes freds father an we must take him in fur our boys sake 

 not for my sake not for my sake  broke out the young man

 well then fur our masters sake we took him in he was mighty low down it seemed like the lord had jest spared him to git here hesters with him now an â an â kin you stand to hear it  â the doctor says hes only got a little while to live oh i can stand it brent repliedwith unconscious irony the devotion and the goodness of the old man had softened him as thought struggle and prayer had failed to do

will you go in now   asked eliphalet  he wants to see you he cant die in peace without

the breath came hard between his teeth as brent replied  i said i would nt see him i came because i thought you needed me

 hes yore father freddie an hes penitent all of us pore mortals need a good deal o furgivin an it does nt matter ef one of us needs a little more or a little less than another it puts us all on the same level remember yore sermon about charity an â an jedge not you aint seen all o his plan come on and taking the young man by the hand he led him into the room that had been his own hester rose as he entered and shook hands with him and then she and her husband silently passed out

the sufferer lay upon the bed his eyes closed and his face as white as the pillows on which he reclined disease had fattened on the hollow cheeks and wasted chest one weak hand picked aimlessly at the coverlet and the laboured breath caught and faltered as if already the hand of death was at his throat

the young man stood by the bed trembling in every limb his lips now as white as the ashen face before him he was cold but the perspiration stood in beads on his brow as he stood gazing upon the face of his father something like pity stirred him for a moment but a vision of his own life came up before him and his heart grew hard again here was the man who had wronged him irremediably

finally the dying man stirred uneasily muttering  i dreamed that he had come

 i am here brents voice sounded strange to him

the eyes opened and the sufferer gazed at him  are you â 

 i am your son

you â why i â saw you â   you saw me in cincinnati at the door of a beergarden he felt as if he had struck the man before him with a lash

did â you â go in  

 no i went to your temperance meeting the elder brent did not hear the illconcealed bitterness in his sons voice  thank god he said you heard â my â story an â it leaves me â lessâto tell somethingâ made me speakâto you that â night come nearer will â you â shake hands with â me

fred reached over and took the clammy hand in his own

 i have â had â a pore life the now fast weakening man went on an i have â done wrong â by â you but i â have â repented will you forgive me  

something came up into brents heart and burned there like a flame

 you have ruined my life he answered  and left me a heritage of shame and evil

 i know it â god help meâ i know it but wont â you â forgive me my son i â want to â call you â that âjust once he pressed his hand closer

could he forgive him could he forget all that he had suffered and would yet suffer on this mans account then the words and the manner of old eliphalet came to him and he said in a softened voice  i forgive you father he hesitated long over the name

thank god forâfor â the name â an â forgiveness he carried his sons hand to his lips  i sha nt be â alive â long â now âan my â death â will set â people â to talkin they will â bring â up the âpast i â dont want you â to â stay an have â to bear â it i dont want to â bring any more on â you than i have â already go â away as â soon as i am dead   i cannot leave my friends to bear my burdens

 they will not speak â of them â as they â will speak ofâyou my â poor â boy you â are â old â tom brents â son iâwish i could take â my name â an all â it means â along â with âme but â promise â me â you â will â go promise â 

 i will go if you so wish it

 thankâ you an ânow â goodbye iâcant talk â any â more i dont dare â to advise â you â after â all â you â knowâof me  but do â right â do right

the hand relaxed and the eyelids closed brent thought that he was dead and prompted by some impulse bent down and kissed his fathers brow â his father after all a smile flitted over the pale face but the eyes did not open but he did not die then fred called mrs hodges and left her with his father while he sat with eliphalet it was not until the next morning when the air was full of sunlight the song of birds and the chime of church bells that old tom brents weary spirit passed out on its search for god he had not spoken after his talk with his son

there were heavy hearts about his bed but there were no tears no sorrow for his death â only regret for the manner of his life

mrs hodges and eliphalet agreed that the dead man had been right in wishing his son to go away and after doing what he could to lighten their load he again stood on the threshold leaving his old sad home mrs hodges bade him goodbye at the door and went back she was too bowed to seem hard any more or even to pretend it but eliphalet followed him to the gate the two stood holding each others hands and gazing into each others eyes

 i know you re agoin to do right without me atellin you to said the old man chokingly  thats all i want of you even ef you dont preach you kin live an work fur him

 i shall do all the good i can uncle liph but i shall do it in the name of poor humanity until i come nearer to him i am dazed and confused now and want the truth

 go on my boy youre safe youve got the truth now only you dont know it fur theys one that says inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these ye have done it unto me 

another hearty handshake and the young man was gone

as fred went down the street some one accosted him and said  i hear yore father s home

yes hes home said fred

tom brent was buried on tuesday morning the rev mr simpson who in spite of his age had been prevailed upon to resume charge of his church preached the sermon he spoke feelingly of the  dear departed brother who though late had found acceptance with the lord and he ended with a prayer â which was a shot â for the  departeds misguided son who had rejected his masters call and was now wandering over the earth in rebellion and sin it was well that he did not see the face of eliphalet hodges then

danl hastings nodded over the sermon in the back part of the church mrs martin and mrs smith whispered together and gaped at the two old mourners and wondered where the boy was they had heerd he was in town

bill tompkins brought elizabeth to the funeral

in another town than dexter the events narrated in the last chapter would have proved a nine days wonder gained their meed of golden gossip and then given way to some newer sensation but not so here this little town was not so prolific in startling episodes that she could afford to let such a one pass with anything less than the fullest comment the sudden return of tom brent his changed life and his death were talked of for many a day the narrative of his life was yet to be a stock campmeeting sermon story and the next generation of dexterites was destined to hear of him he became a part of the towns municipal history

freds disappearance elicited no less remark speculations as to his whereabouts and his movements were rife the storm of gossip which was going on around them was not lost on eliphalet hodges and his wife but save when some too adventurous inquirer called down upon himself mrs hodges crushing rebuke or the old mans mild resentment they went their ways silent and uncommunicative

they had heard from the young man first about two weeks after his departure he had simply told them that he had got a place in the office of a packing establishment furthermore he had begged that they let his former fellowtownsmen know nothing of his doings or of his whereabouts and the two old people had religiously respected his wishes perhaps there was some reluctance on the part of mrs hodges for after the first letter she said  it does seem like a sin an a shame liphalet that we cant tell these here people how nice freds adoin sos to let em know that he dont need none o their help it jest makes my tongue fairly itch when i see mis smith an that bosom crony o hern sallie martin anosin around tryin to see what they kin find out

 it is amazin pesterin hester im suprised at how i feel about it myself fur i never was no hand to want to gossip but when i hear old danl hastings that cant move out o his cheer fur the rheumatiz â when i hear him asayin that he reckoned that fred was agoin to the dogs i felt jest like up an tellin him how things was

 why on airth did nt you  ef i d a been there id â 

 but you know what freddies letter said i kept still on that account but i tell you i looked at danl from his pocket the old man took the missive worn with many readings and gazed at it fondly  yes he repeated  i looked at danl hard i felt jest like up an tellin him

well no wonder im afeard id  a clean furgot freddies wishes an told him everything to think of old danl hastings as old he is agossipin about other peoples business  sakes alive  he needs every breath hes got now fur his prayers â as all of us pore mortals do now added mrs hodges as she let her eyes fall upon her own wrinkled hands

yes were old hester you an i  but im mighty glad o the faith ive been astorin up fur its purty considerable of a help now

 of course liphalet faith is a great comfort but its a greater one to know that youve allus tried to do yore dooty the very best you could  not asayin that you aint tried

 most of us tries hester even danl  i aint agoin to talk about danl hastings hes jest naturally spiteful an crabbed i declare i dont see how hes agoin to squeeze into the kingdom

 oh never mind that hester god aint agoin to ask you to find a way

mrs hodges did not reply she and her husband seldom disagreed now because he seldom contradicted or found fault with her but if this dictum of his went unchallenged it was not so with some later conclusions at which he arrived on the basis of another of freds letters

it was received several months after the settlement of the young man in cincinnati and succeeded a long silence  you will think it ran  that i have forgotten you but it is not so my life has been very full here of late it is true but not so full as to exclude you and good aunt hester i feel that i am growing i can take good full breaths here i could nt in dexter the air was too rarefied by religion

mrs hodges gasped as her husband read this aloud but there was the suspicion of a smile about the corners of eliphalets mouth

you ask me if i attend any church the letter went on yes i do when i first left i thought that i never wanted to see the inside of a meetinghouse again but there is a young lady in our office who is very much interested in church work and somehow she has got me interested too and i go to her church every sunday it is congregational

 congregational  exclaimed mrs hodges  congregational an he borned an raised up in the methodist faith its the first step

 he was nt borned nothin but jest a l pore little outcast sinner an as fur as the denomination goes i guess that church is about as good as any other

liphalet hodges air you abackslidin too  

 no  i m like freddie im agrowin

its a purty time of life fur you to be atalkin about growin you re jest like an old tree that has fell in a damp place an sens out a few shoots on the trunk it thinks its agrowin too but them shoots soon wither an the tree rots thats what it does

 but before it rotted it growed all that was in it to grow didnt it well thats all anybody kin do tree or human bein he paused for a moment  i aint got all my growth yit

 you kin git the rest in the garden of the lord

 it aint good to change soil on some plants too soon i aint ready to be set out he went on reading   im not so narrow as i was at home i dont think so many things are wrong as i used to it is good to be like other people sometimes and not to feel yoreself apart from all the rest of humanity i am growing to act more like the people i meet and so i am â  the old mans hand trembled and he moved the paper nearer to his eyes â  i â  whats this he says   i am learning to dance 

 there  his wife shot forth triumphantly  what did i tell you  going to a congregational church an learnin to dance an he not a year ago a preacher of the gospel

eliphalet was silent for some time his eyes looked far out into space then he picked up the paper that had fluttered from his hand and a smile flitted over his face

 well i dont know he said  freddies young an theys worse things in the world than dancin

you aintaupholdinhim in that too air you  well i never youd uphold that sinful boy ef he committed murder

 i aint aupholdin nothin but what i think is right

right liphalet hodges what air you asayin

 not that i mean to say that dancin is right butâ

there aint no buts in the christian religion liphalet an there aint no use in yore tryin to cover up freddies faults

 i aint atryin to cover nothin up from god but sometimes i git to thinkin that mebbe we put a good many more bonds on ourselves than the lord ever meant us to carry

 oh some of us dont struggle under none too heavy burdens some of us have a way of jest slippin em off of our shoulders like a bag of flour

 meanin me well mebbe i have tried to make things jest as easy fur myself as possible but i aint never tried to make em no harder fur other people i like to think of the master as a good gentle friend an mebbe i aint shifted so many o the burdens he put on me that he wont let me in at last  liphalet i didnt say what i said fur no slur agin you youre as good a christian man as â well as most

 i know you did nt mean no slur hester it was jest yore dooty to say it ive come to realise how strong yore feelin about dooty is in the years weve been together an i would nt want you to be any different

the calm of old age had come to these two lifes turbulent waters toss us and threaten to rend our frail bark in pieces but the swelling of the tempest only lifts us higher and finally we reach and rest upon the ararat of age with the swirling floods below us

eliphalet went on with the letter he says some more about that little girl alice is a very nice and sensible girl i like her very much she helps me to get out of myself and to be happy i have never known before what a good thing it was to be happy â perhaps because i have tried so hard to be so i believe that i have been selfish and egotistical freddie dont furgit his words the old man paused to say  i have always thought too much of myself and not enough of others that was the reason that i was not strong enough to live down the opposition in dexter it seems that after all your kindness to me i might have stayed and made you and aunt hester happy for the rest of your days bless that boy   but the air stifled me i could not breathe in it now that i am away i can look back and see it all â my mistakes and my shortcomings for my horizon is broader and i can see clearer i have learned to know what pleasure is and it has been like a stimulant to me i have been given a greater chance to love and it has been like the breath of life to me i have come face to face with christianity without cant and i respect it for what it is alice understands me and brings out the best that is in me i have always thought that it was good for a young man to have a girl friend  

for an instant mrs hodges resumed her old manner a slight wave from the old flood had reached the bark and rocked it she pursed her lips and shook her head  he furgot elizabeth in a mighty short time

 ef he had nt hed ought to be spanked like a child elizabeth never was the kind of a mate fur freddie an there aint nobody that knows it better than you yoreself hester an you know it

mrs hodges did not reply the wavelet had subsided again

now jest listen how he ends up l want you and aunt hester to come down and see me when you can i will send for you in a week or two if you will promise to come write to me both of you wont you  your changed boy fred changed an im glad of it hes more like a natural boy of his age now than he ever was before hes jest like a young oak saplin before he allus put me in mind o one o them oleander slips that you used to cut off an hang agin the house in a bottle o water sos theyd root well go down wont we hester well go down an see him

 not me liphalet you kin go  but i aint agoin nowhere to be run over by the cars or wrecked or somethin not that im so powerful afeared of anything like that fur i do hope im prepared to go whenever the master calls but it aint fur me to begin arunnin around at my age after livin all these years at home no indeed why i could nt sleep in no other bed but my own now i dont take to no sich new things

and go mrs hodges would not so eliphalet was forced to write and refuse the offered treat but on a day there came another letter and he could no longer refuse to grant the wish of his beloved boy the missive was very brief it said only  alice has promised to marry me wont you and aunt hester come and see me joined to the dearest girl in the world   there was a postscript to it i did not love elizabeth i know it now

 hester im agoin said eliphalet  go on liphalet go on i want you to go but i m set in my ways now i do hope that girl kin do something besides work in an office she ought to be a good housekeeper an a good cook sos not to kill that pore child with dyspepsy i do hope she wont put saleratus in her biscuits

 i think its freddies soul that needs feedin 

 his soulll go where it dont need feedin ef his stomach aint tended to right ef i went down there i could give the girl some points

 i dont reckon youd better go hester as you say you re set in yore ways an mebbe her ways ud be different an then â then youd both feel it

 oh i suppose she thinks she knows it all like most young people do

 i hope she dont but im agoin down to see her anyhow an ill carry yore blessin along with mine

for the next week great were the preparations for the old mans departure and when finally he left the old gate and turned his back on the little cottage it was as if he were going on a great journey rather than a trip of less than a hundred miles it had been a long time since he had been on a train and at first he felt a little dubious but he was soon at home for his kindly face drew his fellowpassengers to him and he had no lack of pleasant companions on the way

like fred the noises of the great station would have bewildered him but as he alighted and passed through the gate a strong hand was laid on his shoulder and his palm was pressing the palm of his beloved son the old carpetbag fell from his hands

 freddie brent it aint you  

its i uncle liph and no one else and im so glad to see you that i dont know what to do give me that bag

they started away the old man chattering like a happy child he could not keep from feasting his eyes on the young mans face and form

well freddie you jest dont look like yoreself you re â you re â 

 im a man uncle liph

 i allus knowed youd be my boy i allus knowed youd be but yore aunt hester told me to ask you efâef youd dropped all yore religion shes mighty disturbed about yore dancin

brent laughed aloud in pure joy

 i knowed you had nt the old man chuckled

 lost it all  uncle liph why ive just come to know what religion is its to get bigger and broader and kinder and to live and to love and be happy so that people around you will be happy

 you re still a firstrate preacher freddie

oh yes uncle liph ive been to a better school than the bible seminary i have nt got many religious rules and formulas but im trying to live straight and do what is right

the old man had paused with tears in his eyes i been aprayin fur you he said

 so has alice replied the young man  though i dont see why she needs to pray shes a prayer in herself she has made me better by letting me love her come up uncle liph i want you to see her before we go on to my little place

they stopped before a quiet cottage and fred knocked in the little parlour a girl came to them she was little not quite up to freds shoulder his eyes shone as he looked down upon her brown head there were lines about her mouth as if she had known sorrow that had blossomed into sweetness the young man took her hand uncle liph he said this is alice she came forward with winning frankness and took the old mans hand in hers the tears stood in his eyes again

 this is alice he said  this is alice then his gaze travelled to freds glowing face and with a sob in his voice that was all for joy he added alice im glad youre alivin
