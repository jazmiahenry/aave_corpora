revelation trial and exile of john epics walker thomas h b  fiction
john the beloved disciple was the youngest of the apostles the son of zebedee and salome and brother of james the great it is supposed that he was religiously inclined when quite a boy and as soon as his age permitted became a follower of the harbinger of the gospel

while a disciple of john the baptist his soul was cheered one day to hear his master say behold the lamb of god who taketh away the sins of the world

immediately he followed the christ

from an expression once made by the blessed jesus the apostles got the impression that john would never die john  

john was admitted with two other disciples into all the secret passages of the blessed lords life and even at the last hour when jesus was dying before giving up the ghost he committed his mother for care and protection into the hands of john who it is supposed labored in the ministry about jerusalem after our saviours crucifixion for sixteen years till mary died about a d  gal  paul on his third journey met him at jerusalem it is supposed that he went to ephesus about a d 

it is related by tertullian that john was carried to rome and placed in a kettle of oil a more full acâ count of which is found in the verse of this little volâ ume in book one

eusebius and irenaeus give an account of the writâ ing of the revelation or apocalypse during the later part of the reign of domitian

it is supposed that john with many other prisoners were brought backfrom the exile on patmos in the aegean sea during the reign of nerva

he was the author of five books viz the book bearing his name three epistles and the revelation

he died at ephesus during the reign of trajan about the age of  or possibly  according to suidas

john put in a kettle of oil at rome by domitian and the deliverance

on the lonely isle of patmos a servant of god was sent in exile for preaching the word

it was the disciple beloved the son of zebedee

the trio select of the christ the younger of the three

he was arrested for preaching against wickedness and sin and was led to prison by bloodthirsty men

he was thrust in a dungeon as dark as night but his spirit was not crushed for he saw a heavenly light

from ephesus they brought him to the city of rome for appear he must before the emperors throne

the ruler in those days was domitian by namea man of severity quite noted by fame

spoke domitian the ruler in words quite severe come nigh ye stranger lend me your ear

art thou a follower of him they call christ who died on the cross from the dead did rise

do you publish that fact when you know it wasnt true

none else have seen himnot one but you

liar thou art die thou must so odious thy doctrine thou my soul disgust

when lived ever man who rose from the dead

find history of book 

such thing ever said

or find me the manhim i would seethat selfsame hour thou wouldst be free

john looked at domitian the proud emperor of rome his face fairly twitched he drew nearer the throne

liar thou called me but liar im not the place where they laid him i know the spot

i saw him quite dead as your soldiers found i followed the company they put him under ground

him i again saw after rising from dead i was filled with awe i was almost afraid

then said he to thomas push your hand in my side you see im no ghostim he that died thomas stepped forward

he said lord i believe 

sorry am i that thee i grieved there was a crowd who saw himeleven in alli tell thee the truth tho the next minute i fall

but domitian doubted he trembled like a knave and the disciple beloved to the mob he gave

he was led from the prison and convicted to die in a caldron of oil that boiled on a fire

his skin was to be boiled until the flesh left the bones

the verdict commanded the bones be boiled till each joint was alone when this was all done the verdict was to be to cast the caldron contents into the mgtan sea

there the fishes would feast on the fisher of men and the gospel of the christ would come to an end

to put john in the kettle a committee was made and five wicked of the most wicked formed the devils brigade

how they did laugh as they thought of the bonus and oh how they giggled as they feasted on their honors

that they should be honored to kill the servant of god to them was the greatest gift their country could afford

with a rope in their hand his form they did tie so that at the chaldrons bottom his body might lie

they said your christ deny or die

you have one hour more

john said deny my lord never

to death let me go

in went the body with a drop and a bump and out jumped the oil as the caldron caught the lump

the oil was as hot as the hottest of lead why the men that it struck in a minute were dead

so happy is the story tho an adage it goes that at once all our friends dont die neither all our foes

so of the fire brigade while three did die two were left to receive this honor so high

so they exulted over the thought as warriors do forgetting the dead they lose if they can only kill you

they busied themselves tho they were with heat but smothered and never once stopped till the kettle was covered

oh look my dear reader it makes my heart ache for as they pulled out their dead they began the fire to rake

and as they piled on the wood around the great oil can they looked like demons lynching a man

for hours and hours this heating did last until they thought the boiling had finished its task

but there is a godthey had forgotten his namethe god who heard the hebrews on duras plains

the god who sleeps neither night nor in the longest day but in the rule of this world must have his way

as daniel was made to sleep on a lions mane john was saved from all hurt that came from the flames

the ordinary man by the oil would have drowned but god is the same on the water or ground

when through water or fire or evils much less his only command put thy trust in him and lean on his breast

when the top was removed they were very much astonied to see the face of their martyr shine as the sun

and with no invitation from them that was found he caught the side of the caldron and leaped to the ground

and just like his master gods own dear son he began preaching the gospel to them every one

he preached with such power at first they felt glad but when they thought of their defeat they got angry yea mad

they then rushed upon him and with one mans cry they said we will now see you perish or well every one die

book two

the second trial if time would permit me in just a little while i will tell thee the story of johns second trial

he was brought from prison where he stayed a full week while his foes oer his destruction did puzzle and seek

thus spoke each of the rulers as it came their turn no heat can hurt him as he fire will not burn

all laughed and made grimaces as they their heads did pound why you certainly cant hurt him for he water will not drown

one said you cant kill him this we have all found

you could not stop him from breathing tho he was buried under ground

another said what heat cant harm no sword can stick and like achilles of troy he certainly is a trick

what my opinion is from my heart i say you just as well loose him and let him go his way

they then spoke to the prisonerdemanded of him why he could not stop his errors and this christ deny

john looked at the men lightning flashed from his eyes for this question burnt him far more than the fire

what deny my dear lord

my savior and friend upon whom all my trust and my hope depend

no never no never

till the sun leaves his place till the last son of adam has died in the race till the stars and moon fade and grow dim and the heavens grow old ill not deny him

he is my salvation my hope from the fall i will preach to the nation for he loves them all

john paused a second and he was melted to tears and to them he preached without dread or fear

he told of the christ whom they had just crucified who suffered for all men on the cross when he died

how he conquered old death even hell and the grave and rose with all power his people to save

as he told the story of jesus the whole court agreed that john seemed quite honest and he should be freed

but up stood an old man that the devil had taught and from the breast of the judges drove the good thought

he said gentlemen to kill john is now plain to me we will exile him far into the egeah sea

as sure as i speak believe me if you will some fowl or beast him surely will kill

if these do not kill him pray tell me his salvation for he surely will die from the dent of starvation it took but a moment and they all did agree

they led the servant of god to the edge of the sea where a boat had been mooring since the rise of the sun they it employed to make the great run

now into its cabin the prisoner was led and across the blue waters how swiftly it sped

in a silent tone to the prisoner in the toil it seemed to say you cant escape me tho you did the hot oil

i take thee to exile i take thee to death and as far as your preaching you all people have left

you go to an island in tlje archipelago that is as hard as the reefs that hug the seashore where the land is sandy and rocky by man never tilled and other prisoners have died as you surely will

the sailors at him laughed for they worked for their hire

they said you never will return unless domitian should die

it is thought by some of the best historians that john was exiled during the reign of domitian and brought back during nervas reign

but john remained firm he never once complained he knew his lord protected those who trusted his name

with his arms folded he walked the floor of the ship praying to his god tho he moved not his lips

whatever is thy will oh lord let it be done

let me please thee dear father am i not thy son

from the caldron thou saved and thou led me from jail to deliver thy servants thou never has failed

now on the next day at the setting of the sun to patmos island the little bark comes

the width was a mile and a half with a little crook and then eleven miles long from end to end

to get along with the story in the shortest delay they threw john on the bank and sailed away

book three

i chapter revelation

he is thrown on the island but sees a vision

now on reaching the island it happened this way that the time that they landed was the seventh day

he walked down the island

i think i am quite right when i say the day was gone and it was far in the night

in our modern times with our pomp and power our days begin at the midnight hour

with our ancient fathers their days begun at the twilight hour or the setting of the sun

now in those times the apostles were so holy in their ways that for sabbath worship they devoted two days

one was the seventh as every one knows and the other was the day that the dear lord arose

as the good book tells in a very vivid way john was kneeling in prayer on the holy lords day

behind him spoke a voice as a trump

john turned to look

it said what thou seest write in a book

to let them know that you yet live tho the world tries to besmirch us write this revelation letter to all the seven churches

to smyrna and pergamura sardis thyatira and ephesus laodicea and philadelphia and tell them i jesus your savior and friend who in all ages doth live remain as anxious as ever their sins to forgive

amid seven golden candle sticks he saw the son of man holding seven bright stars in his right hand

as pure white wool did appear his hair and as the noonday sun shone his face more fair

from his head to feet a stately garment was flung and a golden girdle around his waist was strung

his eyes like a flame of fire out his mouth came a sword like burnished brass were the feet of the lord

john became dumbfounded fell at his feet for awhile as one dead he lost his speech

christ said get up john

with his hand touched him

i am alpha omega the beginning and end

i am the living one was dead and am alive evermore

i cany the keys of death and of hades below

i shall open a mystery now unto thee of the past and the present and whatever shall be

the seven candle sticks my churches they are the angels of the churches are the seven stars

chapter ii

john is commanded to write unto the churches

write thou a letter to the ephesian church their toil and patience i know are much

how they opposed apostles false selling themselves to the devil and in the fight grew weary not as they try to stop evil

tho thou wert faithful against thee i have aught because thou didst not continue thy loving walk

remember whence thou art fallen renew thy love do thy first work repent else thy candle i move

what the spirit saith to the churches ye that hath an ear hear thou art blessed that overcometh you need not fear

thou shalt eat the luscious fruit that grow in paradise that is found in gods orchard of the tree of life

write to the church of smyrna these things saith the first and last who was dead yet lives again and has lived all in the past

i know thy poverty and tribulation blasphemy is satans part how in prison theyll cast thee but rich indeed thou art

until death be thou faithful and a crown of life ill give the second death shall hurt thee not overcome and with me live

to the angel of pergamum saith he that hath the twoedge sword i know thou iivest where satan builds up his throne against my word

thou my faith did not deny my name thou didst hold fast

tho they martyred of thy number my faithful antipas

but a few things hold i against thee thou the doctrine of balaam taught and some have practiced fornication almost brought my work to naught

blot thou out the nicolaetans and stop the practice of sorcery repent thou quickly else i come and with my mouth make war on thee

he that hath an ear oh hear

what the spirit says to the churches overcome get hidden manna and a stone most white and precious

upon that stone a new name written i my name on it inscribe none can know it but he that receives it

it will make thee sanctified

write to the angel of thyatira thus saith the son of god i know thy works faith and ministry thy patience and thy love

thou hast my commendation of the last work i see of you for it shows much improvement on the first that thou didst do

i have this against thee thou suffered jezebel to seduce many of my children and are leading them to hell

of the reins and heart of poor man the searcher am i i note the actions of each one who lives in thyatira

ye hold fast till i come and my work keep to the end ill give thee authority over nations and thou shalt conquer sin

as received i of my father i will give thee the morning star thus saith the spirit to the churches let him hear that has an ear

letters continued

write the angel of the church of sardis gods seven spirit at my command im he that liveth and art dead i hold seven stars in my right hand

revive now thy dying embers thy imperfection has been my grief if thou repent and watcheth not on thee i will come as a thief

a few names yet are in sardis that shall see the heaven bright they are worthy to be honored they shall walk with me in white

in lifes book his name shall stand for i know he did his best before my father and the angels i his name will confess

to the church in philadelphia saith the holy one thats true

to open and shut and shut and open no other one as i can do

now i place an open door that i set before thine eye my word thou kept with a little power and did not once my name deny

because thou kept my word steadfastly in hours of triads ill keep thce

keep thy crown i come quickly thou my glory soon shall see

overcome and a pillar in the temple of my lord thou wilt be out no more thou shalt go but singing praise thy work shall be

my new name upon him ill write and the name of our god new jerusalem as well i will be his savior and lord

to laodicea write saith amen the faithful and witness true the beginning of gods creation i know the work that thou do

thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert as one should be because lukewarm thou insist from my mouth ill spew thee

thou think thou art rich when thou art poor very poor indeed thou art blind miserable and deceived and in the very direst need

i counsel thee to buy of me refined gold thats all right hide thy nakedness with my garments that are fine pure and white

behold at the door i stand and knock i am knocking now for thee if any man will let me in with him ill sup and he with me

and he that overcometh shall sit upon a throne as i sit with my father who rules the world alone

thus closed the letters to seven churches in all ages they cover from century to century unfurling the mysteries of our elder brother

he sees the mysterious throne etc

john saw and behold an open door iq heaven was standing wide a trumpet voice proclaimed to him if thou would see come nigh

i will show thee things that must come to pass of a very great merit and straightway when i caught his words i fell into the spirit

i saw in heaven like a pyramid a shining dazzling throne and brighter still was the form of him that sat thereon

he looked like a jasper or sardius stone with such beautiful radiant fair the light that sparkled about the throne just like an emerald shone or rainbow in the air

there were four and twenty thrones that circled his around and on these thrones elders sat who had on golden crowns

their garments were white as burning light spirits of god were seven all in number

and a sea of glass was before the throne and there were lightning and thunder

four curious beasts as neer were seen full of eyes before and behind faces like a calf eagle lion and man crying holy thrice holy all the time six wings did have each cherubim wings covered with eyes like feathers they cried lord god almighty thou art was and shall be forever and ever

when those beasts give thanks and honor and glory to him on high upon their faces fall the four and twenty and all begin to cry thou art worthy  lord my god to receive honor glory and power for all things hast thou created for thy pleasure even now

the book containing the mortgage

the one that sat upon the throne had a book in his right hand written within and seven times sealed a mortgage against poor man

with a strong loud voice an angel proclaimed who is worthy to open the book its seals to loose the debt to pay or even on it look

he searched heaven and sky even hell and underground with discontent he left each for no one could be found

and when john saw that none was found he began to cry and weep with drooping wings the angel returned and around the throne did seek

an elder cried weep not john in judahs tribe is revealed of jesses line and davids stem comes one wholl open the seals

john turned and looked toward the throne his weeping was in vain he saw the lamb to open the bookemanuel was his name

seven eyes had he and upon his head he had seven horns and from the blood upon his form it seemed he many scars had borne

the lamb took the book out of justices hand and loosened every seal he paid the debt as was commanded his people he redeemed

the way this book was opened it was stated in this formtwas a mystery of salvation and again we must be born

when the lamb took the book before him four beasts and elders fell there were such music and songs that it shook the gates of hell

you say from whence the harps came on which the elders play on this the writ is silent the good book doesnt say

ferhaps they were just created i see no other way for they certainly at the lambs reception had golden harps to play

each elder had a golden vial that was full of the sweetest odor and while they sung anew new song each emptied his vial in order

the vials held the prayer of saints  that went up from old earth mixed with sadness sorrow pain groans and maybe a little mirth

when the elders played and four beasts sung music swept heaven as a flood from all kindred tongues nations and people came kings and priests to god

john said when the lamb took his seat ten thousand angels he saw and thousands of thousands cried so loud that he was filled with awe

in unison went the voices high they cried naught but one nameall wisdom riches strength and glory receive thou worthy lamb was slain

in heaven in sea in earth beneath â all forms of creatures prayed worthy the lamb who was slain

were all they sung or said

amen then the four beasts said the four and twenty elders bowed

and said we worship thee thou lamb was slain the way that we know how

they threw their crowns before the throne

and bowed to worship him with far more adoration than ever was known to men

worthy art thou  lamb said they to receive honor glory power created all things by thee for thy pleasure accept our praise this hour

the opening of the seals horses coming forth representing all ages of christianity

when the lamb opened a seal it sounded as thunder unto me

one of the four beasts saying come now john and see

and saw i a horse come forth a white color pure he that sat upon his back in his hand held a bow

much interest was centered on him by those who stood around as conquering unto conquest went when he received his crown

oh church of god so pure in those apostles time no little mean and narrow things did ever affect their mind

each brother honored his brother first they all in common lived the rih the poor and everyone unto the lord did give

when he opened the second seal the second beast said come see john i looked and behold the horse was red

his rider was commissioned take from the earth its peace war was to reign through all the world north west south and east

men were to slay each other

blood like water flowed for to the rider was given a great and sharp sword

oh lord behold thy temple explain thy morning star

does this change represent sin in division as we are

do we give our brother a genuine revelation

do we help thy cause by many denominations

when he opened the third seal the third beast then heard i come and see i looked and saw a black horse passed me by

balances were in his hand his duties they were many three measures of barley or one of wheat was he to give for a penny

touch not the wine or the oil for darker days will come and in that time of dire distress you may then need some

when the lamb opened the fourth seal it was another mystery the fourth beast said to me come john and see

i looked and behold a rider death was his cognomen

the horse he rode was pale and hell followed him

they went forth those partners to destroy all joy and mirth with hunger sword death and beast they were to kill a fourth of the inhabitants of earth

when the fifth seal was opened under the altar were the slain of those who held the testimony of the dear jehovahs name

they were killed for praising god and preaching his holy word how long  lord holy one

was the cry i heard

how long dear lord how long judgest thou not sinful men that dwellest on the earth and avenge our blood on them

white robes were then given to them every one they were to await their fellow servants and brethren to come

they too should be slain like them should be killed but a little season they should wait twould then be fulfilled

for soon they would join their loved ones around that glorious throne and always chant holy praise as they their saviour owned

when the sixth seal was opened i beheld and lo there was a great earthquake and a mighty uproar

the sun was dark as sackcloth black the moon became as blood the stars of heaven fell to earth and covered the ground as a flood

they fell like sgs untimely fall by a storm forced through the air

the heavens departed as a scroll confusion was everywhere 

the mountains moved from their place the islands quit their bed the wicked hid in dens and rocks as they from jehovah fled

hide o hide us thus they cried from jehovahs face

undone undone undone are we if we have tasted net his grace

they cried to the rocks and to the mountain mountain hide thou me

thus cried the great the poor and small the rich and bond and free

hide me from the lambs face hide me if you can for the great day of his wrath is comer and who shall be able to stand
