 oh  well hes too careless and too trifling hes smart enough got wit enough but it all runs the wrong way

ive about gin him up

 oh no father dont say that dont get discouraged lets wait awhile longer

you and i and bernice here ought to be able to bring up one boy even if we are getting old i shall not give him up yet

he may come out a good man after all

said mrs howell kindly

ah mother what is bred in the bone cant be got out through the flesh the boy is his mother right over

there father dont let us talk about that you know we agreed years ago to bury that matter forever

this dialogue occurred in an oldfashioned country house in a settlement not far from philadelphia over fifty years ago

the house was built wholly of wood and consisted of two partsâan old and a new âalthough the new part gave evidence of having seen many summers the old part was only one story high but the long rafters and consequently highpeaked roof gave room for a large attic it had its heavy projecting eaves its oaken door which had one day been red its genuine leather latchstring hanging outside and its heavy oaken latch within there were also the large open fireplace the swinging crane with its pothooks of various lengthy and the heavy wrought andirons the furniture of this part of the house consisted of a solid table several chairs some with splint bottoms and others with bottoms of untanned skin a carved corner cupboard and a rude settee which served often as a bed

the new part of the house was of two stories although the ceilings were low and the furniture of the room as it was called differed from that in the older part of the house indeed two generations were represented in the furniture of this humble dwelling in the  room  were a tenplate stove a wooden clock with its picture of two brothers clasped in loving embrace on its front and its peculiarly musical stroke a black walnut table with its feet of dragon claws then more than a halfcentury old and a wellworn rocking chair

the house within and the yard around were generally kept scrupulously neat and orderly and the small farm on which it stood showed signs of industry and thrift in all its details the fences were clean and in good repair the wagons plows and harrows as well as the live stock all showed the effects of intelligent care

leonard howell was no idler nor did he tolerate idleness in those around him

brusque in manner diligent in business of good health and with good appetite endowed with energy and a constant flow of good spirit he was a thorough master of his work and the strength and support of the home or at least he had been so for many years now however he was rapidly advancing toward old age the estate upon which he lived had been left him by his father and he was at this time possessed of sufficient means to afford a plain but comfortable living and was free from debt in his earlier days he had been successful both as a small farmer and as a dealer in cordwood and hooppoles and many of his ventures in this line had sailed out of the tortuous rivers of south jersey to philadelphia where the wood and the poles then found ready sale

leonard howell was fairly shrewd at driving a bargain and was possessed of an exterior which on first sight would indicate rather a hard nature but those who knew him well could bear testimony to his benevolence of heart and also to a keen sense of humor which he at times manifested like most men of his time and vicinity he occasionally drank apple whiskey or apple  jack as it was called but he was never known to become the worse for liquor he was a member of the church and was thoroughly sound in the faith and a good contributor but religious matters with him were to a large extent turned over to his brother who was a deacon in the church and to his wife who was better read than himself and who was thoughtful and pious leonard howell evidently leaned more upon his wifes prayers and his brothers counsels than upon any devotions of his own he had his principles and was ever ready to do what he called the right thing but as for services of devotion and the likeâwell âhe submitted to them but never gave evidence that he enjoyed them

aunt milly howell was in many respects the very opposite of her husband both in outward and inward character she was spare and delicate of form and quite generally in poor health her manners were soft and refined and she was far above the average woman of her neighborhood in point of intelligence she had read much considering her opportunities and her memory was well stored with bible facts and texts and with many gems of old english literature

although usually unwell herself she was nevertheless filled with the tenderest sympathy for others and was the special friend of the children of the community

her resignation and patience and her quiet pleasant manner filled the old home with a soothing influence making all who dwelt there happier if not indeed better because of it the restraint which her presence imposed upon the boisterous was by no means burdensome because it was always accompanied by her own subdued example and by her instructive and elevating conversation i can see her now as i write sitting in her highbacked chair with her neatfitting house dress on the clean handkerchief folded over her shoulders with its lower ends concealed beneath her apron her spectacles her white cap with its frills her gray hair and smooth brow her softly treading slippers yes i see her now in that old homestead with the light of heaven falling in its gentle fullness upon her painworn face and my soul warms with the vision she was one of gods angels sent to bless the earth

in this quiet home lived also the maiden daughter bernice the youngest of a family of seven sons and daughters who had passed their childhood there she was at the time of the dialogue above mentioned about twentyfive years of age rather large and stalwart in form inheriting her fathers energy and selfreliance coupled with much of her mothers reserve and kindness she had the will the nerve and the cool courage fitting her to fill a more important sphere her dignity of manner was sublime her scorn terrible she could freeze or flay with less than a word her look was enough she lived long beyond the time of my story but she never married hers was the helping hand of the community ever ready to do good

no home is complete without the boy

leonard c howell junior was a grandson and was at this time about thirteen years old he was bright but it could not be said that he was industrious and he seemed to have imbibed a dislike to everything about the farm except the fruit that grew on the trees and the food that came to his plate at table the fowls calves colts horses and dogsâall seemed to hate or fear him he was inclined to be cruel as well as  careless his chief pastime was to blow outlandish airs upon a small fife the notes of which were as much out of place in that orderly home as were his manners and temper

leonard however always had a faithful and powerful friend and apologist in his aunt bernice and hence when grandfather howell expressed himself as being about worn out with little len bernice waited until her mother had finished and then with her black eyes fairly snapping fire she added len is not so bad he is mischievous and careless and troublesome but he is only a boy yet hell be all right when he gets older

this was said with an emphasis that meant much more than the words themselves expressed and as bernice wielded great influence over her father and as she was pleading for his namesake and grandson the case was soon won and the old gentleman dismissed the matter by saying god grant he may

the father of young leonard the oldest son of leonard howell senior had married greatly against the judgment of his parents and although the aged couple had long ago forgiven him and had freely received his wife as their daughterinlaw yet they had never really changed their opinion

it was to this wife of course and not to his own son that grandpa howell referred when he said what is bred in the bone cant be got out through the flesh he may have been right but it is just as probable that he was wrong he believed he was right however and his beliefs were always quite positive bernice shared none of this feeling and to her leonard was simply a nephew to be warmly loved and kindly treated

leonard did not stay long on the farm after this conversation  although the treatment he continued to receive was kind even to indulgence he became more and more discontented and early one bright morning in may was missing a brief search revealed the fact that he had run away he took the natural course of runaway boys which was to the city and thence made his way by sailing vessel to boston he had hired himself to the shipmaster as cabin boy but leonard grew heartily tired of the sea and of the discipline on shipboard long before he reached boston and as soon as the vessel was snugly at her wharf he slipped away from her forfeiting what little pay was due him

out in the streets of that strange city with scarcely a penny in his pocket without a friend or acquaintance to whom he could look and altogether unacquainted with city life leonard for the first time repented his rashness the seat of his repentance was however rather in his stomach than in his heart and his feelings came and went according as he happened to be hungry or fed when want pinched him his thoughts would turn toward the smoking dinners of coarse but wholesome food that he had so often sat down to in the old home and he would then reproach himself for running away but when chance threw a good meal in his way all these reflections departed and his evil courage returned

thus he wandered up and down the crooked streets of boston for a number of days catching odd jobs and living around the markets  until one day it was his good fortune to meet with a farmer who was needing help and who offered him a temporary home

a bargain was soon made and it was with a glad heart that leonard leaped into the farmers wagon to enter upon the same sort of life as that from which he had run away

his short experience however had taught him the importance of having a home and he entered upon his contract with a full resolution to fulfill it by staying until the haying season was over with such feelings he began his work on the kingsley farm

although he had been bred to farm work in south jersey he soon found that being a hired boy on a farm in massachusetts differed very much from the life he had lived upon his grandfathers farm in new jersey the land was rough and stony the hills quite steep and high and the people were accustomed to long days and hard work up in the morning by the time it was light they did half a jersey days work before breakfast and supplemented the day with the other half after supper poor leonard had indeed fallen into a trying situation he was earning his bread by the sweat of his brow and was becoming so lean and holloweyed that it did not seem that even the poor privilege of sweating would be long allowed him his voice became thin and piping and his spirits sank within him he was tired every moment and saw no prospect of relief until the end of the terrible haying season this came at last and with it the promised lull in the incessant rage of labor that for weeks had been sweeping over the sultry hills and valleys of the commonwealth

leonard had succeeded so well during the few weeks that farmer kingsley now offered him a permanent home agreeing to pay him regular wages until the autumns work should be over and to board him during the winter he doing the chores and in the meantime going to school this was accepted and by the latter part of november the work was well over and leonard ready to enter the district school

dressed in thick comfortable clothes with stout boots and large for his age muscular and well formed he was a noticeable accession but when he came in contact with the other boys he soon found that he was far behind them in his studies he was awkwardly out of place and entirely too large for his grade this however instead of paralyzing his energies tended to greatly stimulate them and he resolved to catch up with those more advanced

the teacher was a young man who had completed a subacademic course and was now preparing himself for college by private study and at the same time trying to earn the money necessary for college expenses by teaching the district school he was earnest and efficient as a teacher and kind to his pupils but being somewhat absorbed in his own studies and ambitious to enter college with a good record he was rather too much preoccupied to be a good disciplinarian he enjoyed the work of teaching but disliked the drudgery of enforcing order

in keeping with the inborn principles of his nature leonard soon formed the acquaintance of the more disorderly boys and became in some respects their ringleader being entirely away from parental restraint he was more reckless in his manner than most of the other boys and they soon accorded him the bad eminence of leadership although not orderly he was naturally apt and was rapidly advancing to a position in school more in accord with his size

as grandfather howell had said he had wit enough and could acquire knowledge readily when he chose to do so and just now he was bent on his books but his mischievous malevolent disposition had not been at all modified by his hard experience on the contrary it had grown apace and had hardened in form during these months and he had become more habitually surly in his nature and more liable to fits of unreasonable passion it was evident almost from the day of his entrance to the school that leonards presence was not to be a blessing to it and as soon as he had acquired the quasi leadership the audacity of the turbulent element increased and the principles of order and respect were trampled underfoot the condition soon became so bad that the attention of the trustees was called to it but they were in favor of mild measures and accordingly induced the superintendent a kind and elderly gentleman to give the boys a lecture on their behavior this instead of correcting the evil rather emboldened the offenders and leonard who now rejoiced in being the bully of the school began openly to annoy the teacher as if purposing to bring on a conflict

 hell not attempt to flog any of us

shouted bill woodford as he ran from the schoolhouse door to join the group of turbulents that stood in a distant part of the yard

 hum in like to see him try it wouldnt you len  squeaked little dave claypole looking up in leonards face

 say fellers i tell you what lets do

said sam duncan when he calls us out in class this afternoon lets all stand with our feet wide apartâso and our hands in our pockets and our heads way back like that striking the attitude at which all the boys laughed heartily

 thats the very thing piped out little dave  that will make him mad he hates anything like that

all were soon agreed and mutual pledges were passed with considerable formality

they were to stand by one another in the fight and were never to tell anything about their part of the matter afterward thus filled with evil purpose the little band of juvenile covenanters entered the schoolroom

leonard had said but little but he had agreed to the proposal not having the moral courage to oppose although he knew that being at the head of the class he would be the first one to meet the issue the probable consequences of which had now begun to swim before his mind

during all these days of semidefiance the teacher had not been unobservant nor idle he had studied the situation thoroughly and had reached his own conclusion

he knew that a crisis must soon come and had braced himself for it flogging had not gone out of practice in the schoolroom nor was there any law or sentiment that interfered with the teachers free use of the birch

when the boys were to take their places in class true to their agreement they ambled out slowly and noisily pounding the floor and the desks with their big boots as they went along and finally all stood in a line with their legs well straddled out their hands in their pockets and their chins well up in the air stripped from its intention it was altogether a comic sight and it is not at all unlikely that mr

boyne saw something funny in the froglike attitude which the boys assumed it was grotesque and was not lost on the rest of the school the teacher had ignored many breaches of order but he determined not to ignore this

calling on leonard to recite he said calmly  take your hands out of your pockets and stand as you ought to

leonard did not move but began to recite his face wearing an air of defiance and contempt

 leonard i say take your hands out of your pockets and stand as you ought to

repeated mr boyne

leonard smiled but did not move the teacher turned quietly around and drew from behind his desk a seasoned rod that the boys had never seen before and the next instant this rod was wrapping itself around leonards straddled legs with amazing vigor the teacher struck only two blows but these stung as though a redhot wire had been coiled around his bare skin

leonard sprang forward and caught the teacher by the throat clutching it with all the strength of his hardy nature his whole being inflamed with wild passion he drew back his right hand with his fist clinched to strike he never delivered the blow however for mr boyne quick as lightning threw out his left hand seized leonards right wrist and the next instant by a trip and a twirl threw him full length to the floor falling upon him in his descent leonards head had struck heavily against a desk and he was partially stunned nevertheless he still clung to the teachers throat and for a few moments the struggle was fierce all this time mr

boyne had refrained from blows and when at length he freed himself and arose to his feet he was still quite cool and collected leonard arose but the fall and the blow he had received from the desk had unnerved him and dazed humbled and bleeding he went away to his seat and sank down into a halfunconscious condition

the boys who had done so much in planning the affair and who had pledged themselves so solemnly had been very careful to take no part in the fight and were now quite backward in showing their sympathy toward leonard as they looked upon the late bully exhausted and cowed with clothes torn hair disheveled face besmeared and head bruised and bleeding they may have inwardly charged him with folly and chuckled over their own good sense but it would have been impossible to have defended themselves from the charge of meanness after a painful waiting one or two of them finally ventured to assist him in getting himself fixed up and leonard crestfallen and disgusted set out for home

to leonards everlasting credit be it said he had not acquired the habit of lying and on arriving home he gave farmer kingsley a truthful account of the affair no doubt suppressing the circumstances which told most against himself farmer kingsley listened patiently and although he had no sympathy whatever with leonards conduct he did not hastily decide against him he had seen leonards ambition to learn and knew that he was apt and he was now convinced that the recent experience had made upon him a good impression this was true leonard was not only thoroughly humiliated but was also greatly enlightened and had firmly resolved to alter his ways

his work done and supper eaten he went early to bed but slept little during the night his head pained him seriously but the reflections which came to his mind were much more painful he saw that he had made a fool of himself even if he did not clearly see the wrong he had been guilty of and then the recollections of his earlier wrong steps and the dark pictures of the immediate future which his lively imagination paintedâfor as yet he knew nothing of farmer kingsleys intentionsâpursued each other back and forth across his mind like the waves of a squalltossed sea this severe agitation served to confirm within him the resolution he had formed and the next morning when mr

kingsley proposed that he should return to school he felt greatly relieved although as yet he did not know how the matter could be settled

farmer kingsley was a man of great energy and probity of character and was well known his influence was almost without limit in the community and convinced of leonards sincerity he now took his cause and by much persuasion finally had him restored to the school

leonards change of conduct was apparent to all and becoming more diligent than ever he fairly bounded along in his studies

had his reformation been more thorough and had he gone back to the principles he had been taught by precept and by loving example in his new jersey home had his change been deeply moral and led him to retrace his runaway steps and ask forgiveness of the tender relatives he had wronged his whole life would doubtless have been brighter as it was the change was great and his resolution noble but it had respect only to prudence and rested upon a merely utilitarian morality it was a halfmeasure and a compromise and it was upon such a basis that leonard set out to erect that character upon which as a monument he should at last inscribe his name and the record of his life

his schooldays were finished without further event and in the spring he returned to work with increased energy and fidelity saving his earnings with scrupulous care

he soon won the reward due his upright and manly bearing in the confidence and good will of the community and the unpleasant school episode faded from public memory it was a boyish freak that should not be charged to the disadvantage of the enterprising young man who had not only repudiated it but who had done all in his power to atone for it leonard howell was forgiven

the city of charleston in south carolina is often spoken of as the hotbed in which the rebellion of the south was sprouted before the war charleston was a delightful city especially for persons whose temperament fitted them to enjoy its semitropical climate and customs socially it was extremely staid and conservative and the various classes of which its population was composed moved along their allotted planes with but little apparent friction each individual family seeming content with its social lot charleston was the philadelphia of the south with increased emphasis

in situation it enjoyed the advantages of which new york may boast without having the obstruction of long island

from the battery which beautifully matched new yorks castle garden the eye uninterrupted might sweep out over a harbor of quiet beauty and drop its exhausted vision to rest in the distant haze of the open sea the low greencrested islands which marked the lines of the opening perspective served as a delicate border connecting the picture with ourselves while bold sumter challenged our gaze for a moment as she reared her grim form against the eastern sky as the faithful gatekeeper of the  city by the sea

the view presented by the city itself to the traveler approaching it from the sea was also one of rare beauty its shipping spires and abundant shrubbery and shade trees combined to enlist the lively sympathy of the visitor while its background of forest and its surrounding meads of luxuriant green enwrapped it in a setting as delightful as ever greeted the eye

east and west of the city flowed the ashly and cooper rivers quite similar to the east and north rivers of new york and on their waters floated the tiny boats of the scores of fishermen who daily supplied the markets with the best fish in the world within the city were fine old residences reflecting the wealth and magnificent tastes of their occupants but the visitor would be more deeply impressed by the public buildings there was the old saint michaels church with its magnificent chimesâsaint michaels once saved by the heroism of a negro slave upon whom the rich sentiment of charleston bestowed as a wreath of honor the boon of freedom there stood the old french church telling its story of the huguenots there the citadel filled with aristocratic cadets there the theater coining down from colonial times the arsenal asylums hotels and school buildings churches were numerous and the population decidedly churchgoing

the clearlydefined classes in charleston society were nearly as follows on the one extreme were the old families who enjoyed a distinction founded upon blood and who were generally accorded the first place in everything the other extreme was occupied by the few white laborers and mechanics to whom was permitted no social standing whatever they existed and looked on they did not live and partake among the aristocrats were to be found the merchants of the best class the planters who maintained city residences or who were frequent visitors to the city the lawyers and above all the leaders in politics as a rule they were gentlemen of leisure with fair education and had sometimes traveled extensively dignified and indolent of manner and splendid talkers their pronunciation of english was oldfashioned but uniform and fixed as one pronounced they all pronounced their tones were musical and their inflections indicative of taste they were not without virtue although the south carolina aristocracy was really an item brought forward from a closed account and was both out of date and away from home in the american republic nevertheless it had its era and some virtue of its vices it is not necessary to speak all who knew it will admit that it was more admirable at a distance than at close view the lowest class of whites need not be specially noted many of them were upright and respectable and under freer conditions would have reached the higher ranks of society the poor white trash of the carolinas generally were not always the worst people they were uniformly sinned against by the lordly class and were very much what their condition made them but amoug them were many who were far from being despicable

between the two extremes already mentioned were several strata of the middle class comprising superior mechanics merchants of secondary grade school teachers clerks bookkeepers and the like amoug these were to be found the usual proportion of good and bad no doubt but it was also among them that some of the best people that the city ever produced were to be found the virtues somewhat spurned by the upper classes and rendered impossible to the lowest class by reason of their social surroundings seemed to find congenial homes among many of those who were neither high nor low in the social scale here alone the domestic virtues especially received their warmest support and brought forth their best fruit

charleston was also the center and marked representative of a slaveholding section and had a very large slave population here the denmark vesey insurrection was planned and here too it came to grief when twentytwo resolute negroes who had been willing to risk something for freedom met their death in silence on the scaffold here also was the whippinghouse known among negroes ironically as the sugar house to which genteel slaveholders sent their slaves to be whipped at so much per lash yes charleston had her slaves her free negroes her free browns and her mixedblooded colored people seemingly without number the colored people too free and slave were also divided into several classes the most noted of which were the free browns

the center of which was the brown fellowship society representing persons of mixed blood who were freeborn and the compact a society of blacks that admitted none to membership saving blacks who had been born in wedlock

the antebellum charleston however is passed away leaving behind it only memories for anything like a correct description of it we are dependent upon the fastfading recollections of the few survivors who knew it as it was its picture beautiful as it was in many respects is not to be found in its own current literature not that artists were wanting but rather because the leaders of thought carried public attention into other fields the ambitions of politics utterly despoiled the provinces of literature

the vanross family belonged to the middle and nonslaveholding class and it may be well to observe that this class of southerners so generally kept in the background was very largely in the majority

reduced to the very minimum in social influence by the slaveholding policy of the south they have seldom appeared in southern literature except at great disadvantage nor indeed have they received from the north that share of public attention in any form to which their character and their numbers entitle them the slaveholder actual or ex has always managed to set himself up as the exclusive representative of the south and he has been too often admitted as such without a thought concerning the great majority of good people whom he did not represent

the vanross family were not slaveholders but were nevertheless intense southerners they were plain practical and industrious considered in the light of the habits and custom of their community in another place they would have reached high rank in society as it was they enjoyed a large share of respect

the discussion going on in the country foreboding actual war reached the quiet home of mrs vanross and greatly agitated the little domestic circle they loved charleston as only charlestonians can  and from this standpoint in widening circles but with diminishing degrees they loved the whole south the soft skies the balmy climate the richlyscented flowers the songbirds the delicious fruits their own loved home the band of cherished friendsâthese were their south rather than the hideous machine of human slavery rolling out its bales of cotton on one side and oozing out its stream of blood and death on the other

true to the political and religious teachings they had received from infancy the whole family went with their state the two older sons knew that if the war came it would be  a rich mans war and a poor mans fight but they also knew the intolerant spirit by which they were surrounded and for the sake of their mother and sisters they saw that they should be compelled to shoulder muskets the family consisted of a widowed mother two daughters and three sons two of whom william and charles were well grown

the father had not been long dead and the house in which they lived was their own and mrs vanross had a small income besides

the boys had been early taught to lend a hand in their own support and the girls had been carefully trained by their mother in all household duties they and their mother usually doing all the work of the family when help was necessary they usually employed free colored people

this however occasioned no remark for slaveholders sometimes did the same as a matter of fact the members of the vanross family were all opposed to slavery but they were very careful never to give expression to their views with the same hearts had they lived in boston rather than in charleston they would have been earnest abolitionists as it was they were noted for their kindness to colored people both free and slave

may  the charleston of the past was gone great fires had swept over it

shot and shell had pierced and racked its buildings pinching want had reigned within it all was over now war had spent its fury and peace had returned

the flag of our union once more floated from the flagstaff of the citadel soldiers soldiers soldiers were inarching everywhere socially charleston now was chaos and coma the cornerstone of its fabric slavery had been plucked out of the building and a general collapse had followed

paralyzed and confused at this hour it had not taken its first steps toward social reconstruction the city was not without population however for besides the soldiers from fortyfive to fifty thousand civilians were moving to and fro amid its ruins

the ruling class that had given tone to its society had practically disappeared and the others entirely unaccustomed to lead were existing in a state of apparent bewilderment negro soldiers were there some fresh from the island plantations others from the free north and west they had entered the city triumphantly singing john brown and thousands of freed men had caught the stirring chorus the streets were daily crowded old faces were slowly disappearing and new ones arriving with every steamer

two colored soldiers of the fiftyfourth massachusetts were making their way rather carelessly along vanderhost street in front of the market both sides of the walk were lined with rude market stands and the narrow passageway was thronged with people the soldiers stopped before an old colored ladys stand and asked for glasses of root beer they were chatting and stepping backward rather carelessly quite rudely jostled two typical southern white ladies the ladies being naturally in a sensitive state of mind felt themselves insulted the soldiers quickly observing their fault immediately straightened themselves up and raising their caps politely offered their apologies

 we are not accustomed to that sort of treatment from negroes said the elder lady

 oh  ma tis no use to talk the negroes have got the city now said the younger lady i hope the yankees are satisfied now they have put us under our own negroes

this was a little more than the soldiers could bear cheerfully whether a thought of butlers famous new orleans order came into their minds or not it would be impossible to say but they at once changed their attitude and taking up the glasses of root beer which they had ordered they tendered them in a brusque manner to the ladies and with the freedom of thorough familiarity commanded them to drink to the old flag

the ladies embarrassed and frightened saw now their mistake and fancied themselves in danger their eyes filled with tears and they were now ready to apologize in their turn the soldiers did no more than press the glasses upon them but this to them was a terrible humiliation

as they stood hemmed in by the crowd and suffering from their rude stare suddenly a young officer dashed up and comprehending to some extent the situation addressed the soldiers loudly what in thunder are you boys doing

 nothing sir was the quick response

well then move on said lieutenant howell

the soldiers drank their beer and at once complied with the order although a glance passing from the officer to the men covertly assured them that they had nothing to fear from him lieutenant howell then advanced directly to the ladies proffering his assistance and escort at the same time handing to the elder lady his card his offer was kindly accepted and in the short walk from the market to their home his manners and conversation so pleased the ladies that he not only received their thanks but also an invitation to call on them at his convenience

when the war broke out leonard who had just reached manhood and still possessed that martial spirit which had manifested itself in the shrill notes of his boyish fife enlisted at the first call entering the ranks as a private soldier he carried within him a spirit of frankness and fidelity which had been growing in his character since the memorable schoolroom battle and being blessed with that enthusiasm which naturally springs from good health it was not long before he became favorably known to both officers and men he possessed also a fair degree of patriotism and distinguished himself early by a close attention to duty and by a careful and intelligent execution of orders

but like hundreds of other privates who remained in the ranks all through the war although more worthy to command than scores of others who through political influence secured shoulderstraps leonard seemed destined never to hold a commission advanced to the position of sergeant his course of promotion stopped and in all probability he would have reached no higher military plane had not the government been compelled about this time to accept the services of colored soldiers

the black regiments that were forming needed officers and it was the policy of the government to put only white men in command this opened before the white noncommissioned officers a prospect of promotion toward which they could regard themselves as in direct line faithfulness to duty efficiency in drill gallantry in the field all led to promotion as commissioned officers in these newlyforming colored regiments here was a chance for merit to make its way and it has been claimed that these white officers placed in charge of colored troops were among the best found in the service

hence when sergeant howell received a commission as a second lieutenant in the fiftyfourth massachusetts regiment composed of colored soldiers it was not only a partial surprise to him but a compliment to his fidelity and skill

entering upon his new duties his bearing and manners were such that he soon won the respect of the men of his company and the confidence of his superior officers lie was at the storming of wagner and at the fearful and disastrous battle of olustee when it was evident that some one had blundered at honey hill he participated in that bloody bayonet duel between his own regiment and a crack regiment from georgia the savannah grays in which the southern regiment was literally cut to pieces in a word he was with his regiment constantly from the time that he joined it with his new commission until it practically ended the war with the last fight against rebellion at boyntons mill singular enough it is that the black man should open the war by becoming its first victim in baltimore on april   and should close it in the last victory won over armed treason in 

but the fighting was now over jefferson davis was in hiding probably somewhere in georgia carrying the executive department of the gasping confederacy in his trunk his cabinet and other high officials were seeking rest for their weary feet in the glades and forests and awaiting opportunities to escape to foreign lands the whole south was under military rule and the provost marshal was the most important dignitary in every town the condition of things under the military was bad enough but it was immeasurably better than it had been under the declining days of the confederacy and better in many respects than that rule which followed it under the guise of reconstruction

when the two black privates stopped mrs vanross and her daughter and were insisting upon their drinking to the old flag in a glass of common root beer they had not the fear of socalled southern chivalry or southern law before their eyes they knew that southern chivalry had been unhorsed by federal bayonets and that southern law had been declared inoperative by the department commander the glance that passed between lieutenant howell and the men was not entirely soldierly it was rather patriotic and fraternal and the men moved cheerfully on as bid deporting themselves as though nothing unusual had occurred

lieutenant howell bowed his thanks on leaving the ladies for their kind invitation to call and turned away with as much dignity as he could command he was greatly elated over the whole affair and felt very much more like complimenting the soldiers who had brought it about than like reporting them for breach of discipline

his accidental meeting with the two modest ladies had made him quite a hero and had set his mind running in a new direction

returning to his quarters occupied with his own bright thoughts his life began to assume a romantic cast and he began to paint himself as the leading character of a drama already well on its course the pleasant words and sweet smiles of mrs

vanross and her daughter had been accepted by him very much above their real value so long deprived of female society and knowing but little of the ways of the world lieutenant howell was not prepared to interpret the language and maimers of charleston politeness he had been decidedly embarrassed while in the presence of the ladies and had barely borne himself above the gauge of awkwardness but now that he was at home he saw himself only as a victor he was not familiar with the fact that charleston had learned her english greatly through the french and that words uttered by her fair daughters especially in their own home so far as they are employed as vehicles of sentiment needed to be greatly modified as they are translated into the received currency of new england life hence our lieutenant had taken the words and manners of the ladies to signify a great deal more than was intended and yet the ladies were not insincere nor had they been extravagant on the contrary they were both reserved and sincere according to their standard notwithstanding they appeared so cordial

it was with difficulty that leonard restrained himself until a seasonable time for the promised call should arrive it came however at length and most carefully attired leonard set out for the visit his reception was all that he could have wished and he was delighted with the quiet grace of the mother and with the beauty of miss hortense to tell the whole truth leonard had never before enjoyed the companionship or even the society of such thoroughly refined people âexcepting of course their antipathy to negro soldiers which to them at that time was quite excusable

leonards visits to the vanross residence became afterward quite frequent and as the days and weeks rolled on the intimacy between himself and the family grew into friendship and when in midsummer his regiment was ordered north to be mustered out of service miss hortense had exacted from him the promise to write to her the whole family also joined in inviting him to pay them a visit during the coming winter

scarcely had the frost painted the leaves of the new england forests their many colors before lieutenant howell with his trunk packed was on his way to new york there to take the first outgoing steamer for charleston a delightful passage of three days brought him to the city and as soon as propriety would permit he was striking the knocker of the high gate of the vanross residence his reception was an overflow of genuine cordiality

i am so glad to see you exclaimed mrs vanross her deep black eyes still sparkling with a luster that seemed to contradict the testimony of her gray hairs

you are looking so well said hortense and leonard fairly blushed with pride and confusion

 we are all glad to welcome you back to charleston said lavinia disclosing to the full a set of pearly teeth her arched eyebrows and long drooping eyelashes resting upon a complexion of richest brunette possessed of a figure most delicately molded and crowned with a luxuriant mass of black and glossy hair which had just enough of curl in it to give it a look of life

lavinia was in fact bewitchingly beautiful  and as she advanced toward mr

howell clad in snowy evening dress extending her faultlessly shaped hand to clasp his that seemed so large and illmade in comparison he experienced a degree of embarrassment hard to define in a few moments however he was at his ease

seated on the piazza with a sister on either side and the mother in front he told in his best style which was indeed poor enough his experiences during the passage northward and of the great muster out

not omitting to mention the greetings he had received among his friends at his home

led on by their interested attention and artless questions he spoke quite freely of his plans for the future continually circling around the one point more important to him than all others and yet keeping it well in the distance much of what he said was intended especially for hortense and leonard hoped that she would see that she made the greater part of that really practical future which he enthusiastically painted although he carefully avoided any selfcommitting expressions like the shipofwar seeking to draw the fire of some concealed battery he hoped by his honest description his bits of romance and his occasional jets of wit to bring some response from the wellguarded fort within but all in vain hortense listened with desdemonalike sympathy and talked with the utmost freedom but she more than puzzled him by giving out no sign that she was reading the ardent story of his heart that was fairly living and breathing between the lines of his sprightly conversation

lavinia fluttered around him almost as gay in manner as the little hummingbird which at that moment was flitting among the flowers that scented the piazza she was unquestionably superior to her sister in beauty and was also her junior in years

leonard greatly admired herâindeed he was bewildered by her beautyâand if pressed for a reason for not preferring her to her sister would probably have answered in a tone subdued almost to reverence she is too handsome for me

leonard c howell admired the beauty of lavinia but he was of too coarse a cast to hope to bring to his side a creature so fine of fiber and so spiritual as lavinia and he had the supreme manliness not to seek to possess and despoil a soul for whose intimate companionship he was in no sense fitted he admired lavinia but she was above his love

the love which he felt for hortense had in a measure created his world anew for although it was ardent and romantic enough it was at the same time accompanied by the fond hope that at an early day the noble object would be his and it was this hope which inspired him in his practical planning for the future and which bore him up in his present sacrifices of pleasure and often of comfort

the course of true love was never smooth if for a time leonards way seemed so clear and the goal so near at hand it was only to entice him to surrender himself more completely to its gentle but imperious sway he is honest and earnest and the love which he brings to hortense is the full offering of his ripening manhood and there seems nothing to prevent its being kindly accepted the differences in maimer in taste expression and experience between them only serve to make them more interesting to each other and although on different sides during the war that does not now interfere with their friendship

the evenings conversation terminated very pleasantly after an engagement on leonards part to join the vanross family in a little social gathering at their home a week later on which occasion he would be regarded as the guest of the family generally and the especial escort of hortense

up to this time there was nothing like a betrothal between the two young people that is there had been no formal proposal nor indeed any set courtship or lovemaking the feeling between them had come up topsylike without any making it had grown secretly but irresistibly and although neither had confessed it in words yet both knew and felt its presence and had manifested it to others in a thousand ways even when trying most to hide it

the long week ended at last and leonard found himself the center of a very quiet evening party at the vanross residence it was a gathering of relatives and very intimate friends for even the middle circle in which the vanross ladies moved was not generally prepared to entertain an ex yankee officer great care had been exercised in sending out the invitations that no inharmonious guest should be present

the party therefore was small but congenial and the time passed in easy conversation lieutenant howell receiving marked attention he noticed however that the guests on retiring were more ceremonious and that they were generally richer in their expressions than those he had been accustomed to meet in his northern experience

as the party had been in his honor he was of course the last to leave and during the brief afterconversation the first straw to cross his pathway fell it was but a straw but it came and it stayed

seated alone with the family by the merest accident the subject of religion came up in some form and the fact was disclosed that mrs vanross and her daughters were christians of the oldfashioned orthodox type the bible was to them the supreme rule of life and hortense an earnest defender of its teachings

leonard had imbibed somewhat of the socalled liberal ideas of new england and although he had no definite creed of his own he had learned perhaps to doubt orthodoxy as he called it but of which he had no precise ideas and certainly to complain of the restraints of religion hence when he saw his adored hortense appear as the champion of a subject and a cause which he inwardly hated there arose within him a warfare which for the time compelled him to maintain silence it was now the turn of hortense to play the part of the tantalizing corvette and despite leonards caution he soon found himself reduced to the necessity of exposing his opinions

hortense observing his uneasiness durin the conversation and the maladroitness of some of his responses said with kindness i fear mr howell that the conversation is hardly agreeable to you perhaps we had better turn our thoughts into another channel

by no means replied mr howell if you are willing to allow a difference of opinion who knows but we may hit upon some undiscovered truth  at least it will be a pleasure to hear hypatia discourse even upon that driest and most threadbare of all subjectsâcreeds and confessions said he with an air of compliment to hortense and of ill concealed contempt for religion

 oh mr howell the subject does not seem dry at all to me you must come and hear our ministerâdr caulfield he makes it interesting enough

oh yes i have heard many fine preachers and have heard many good things from the pulpit and i have nothing to say against the many hardworking men in that calling who honestly believe what they say  i only feel sorry for them  but for those who do not believe and who yet go on and preach i have no feeling but one of contempt i admit all the morality claimed and taught by the most ardent religionists but i am not willing to enslave myself to their creeds

well replied hortense laughingly perhaps it is because you do not have the time to think of religion as we do or are so strong that you do not feel the need of something to lean upon gentlemen do not seem naturally so religious as women

i and sister lavinia have been so accustomed all our lives to lean upon either papa while he lived or upon william since papas death that we have been molded for religion we could not live without it and then maâshe has just led us to god by her own faith and life

leonard was a little disturbed by the reply of hortense her earnestness and sincerity greatly heightened his admiration but at the same time he saw enough to convince him that she would not readily surrender her faith unwilling to appear as a direct opponent of religion and desiring to avoid being pushed further inton discussion which had suddenly assumed so serious a form he turned the admirable plea aside with a pleasantry remarking that one so strong in character and so rich in endowments as herself had much more to give than to receive he doubted not that the favored brothers could see something of divinity in their sister

hortense though earnest and pious was not beyond the effects of a compliment especially from leonard and she knew that the compliment was sincere if not indeed deserved her dark cheek crimsoned slightly and betraying a little confusion she said oh mr howell you do not mean me you mean sister lavinia she is the boys idol sister lavinia in their eyes is the incomparable one

this was said with no tone of sisterly jealousy hortense knew that lavinia was more richly endowed than herself in point of beauty but far from envying her on this account she rather took pleasure in it as so much the more added to the common stock of the household besides hortense herself was by no means devoid of beauty she was of the same type as her sister had the same black eyes the same glossy hair pearly teeth ruby lips and rich dark complexion but there was more of the robust the positive the material in hortense she was rather grand and stately while her sister was more fairylike and captivating the beauty of lavinia was of that type that brings its worshipper to her feet bewildered and almost bereft of his mind the beauty of hortense bids him rise to his greatest altitude and gird himself with his noblest thought

lavinia who was not far away having heard her name mentioned was soon standing by the side of hortense her face beaming with sisterly affection and her bewitching eyes sending their gleaming arrows right through leonard howells heart

an entrancing picture she presented as she poised herself gracefully a moment and said what is it sister may i not have a share in this deeply interesting conversation you have complimented me by mentioning my name andâyou know a womans curiosityâso you must tell me what you are talking about

explanations were made and the conversation lightened up and as it was growing late mr howell soon after sought his hat and light overcoat and withdrew the ladies accompanying him to the piazza and following him with their gaze until he had descended the high steps and passed down the shrublined white walk to the high street gate opening this he paused and bowed his final goodnight and then started briskly down rutledge street to return to his hotel

the streets were badly lighted the sidewalks uneven and except on the best business streets unpaved a large part of the city through which he passed was familiarly known as the  burnt district

in which stood numerous chimneys rearing their heads sullenly in the darkness as so many tombstones marking the graves of departed homes on every hand was also to be seen the ruinous work of shot and shell the scene altogether as it was revealed by the dim lamplight was well fitted to awaken in the mind of the solitary walker serious if not somber reflections

mr howell had left the vanross residence in no gay mood he felt somewhat dissatisfied with himself and with the part he had played in the later conversation of the evening nor was he well pleased as he thought over the entire evening the party had been very agreeable and he had been the center of attention still he was not satisfied but little accustomed to fashionable life and altogether a stranger to the social manners of charleston he felt that he had not been able to deport himself with becoming grace and he was specially mortified that he had disclosed his religious views to the vanross family

the more he thought over the matter the greater became his uneasiness and the more intense his disgust with himself

the whole family will turn against me sure said he half aloud  and as to hortenseâah well it is fortunate that i have said no more to her she shall never know what i intended  i will quietly withdraw and she will be none the wiser for my experience it is clear she will never love me and why should i waste my love further upon her the affair must drop right where it is and we will remain only friends

soliloquizing thus leonard drew himself up to his full height and with the firm step that the drill had taught him flattered himself that he had reached a conclusion and had dismissed a newborn love calling up the gayety of his spirits he entered the hotel and hastened to his room his sleep however was not refreshing and when morning at last came he found himself as firmly bound in the toils of unpleasant thought as when he paced the dark streets on the night before the party the conversation and hortense were still with him and it seemed as difficult to get away from them as to get away from himself

leonard continued sadly confused in mind all that day and it was several days before he regained his wonted composure

he was not an insincere coxcomb and had never indulged in the ghastly pastime of playing at chess with womens hearts on the contrary he had a heart of his own and at present he seemed pretty much all heart a hundred times in a day did he resolve to untwine the silken cords that bound him to hortense and a hundred times in a day at the conclusion of each series of efforts would he find himself more firmly bound than before her face her form her eyes her teeth her hair her sweet musical voice her refined silvery charleston laugh her graceful though rather stately carriage her artless and becoming mannersâeach charm in detail had its hold upon him and when each was loosened as he fancied he soon found that the tout ensemble had entirely restored its hold ah love  love  who can measure thy power or weigh thy force  less ponderous than sunlight thou art heavier than the universe

but it was not only leonards heart that caused him to remain in charleston and that would send him in a few days back to the vanross gate but his pride was also divided in its forces a goodly part of his pride acted as ally with his heart for had not his flowing tongue and pen got the better of him at times among his old army associates as well as among the companions of his early youth  and was it not an open secret among his acquaintances that he had gone south on an errand of love 

brave ns leonard was before his heart he found it hard to bear up against the assaults of his pride he had faced bullets on the field but he fairly cowed now at the thought of facing ridicule and so yielding to the power of love he nevertheless took some comfort in the unmanly thought that he surrendered rather to his pride

it was but a few days indeed before leonard again found himself at mrs vanross but these had been long days to him

the welcome proved that no illeffect from his previous conversation had lingered in the hearts of the ladies it was quite early in the afternoon of a beautiful november day and mr howell came to invite the young ladies to take a drive the invitation was accepted and in a few minutes all were seated in the best conveyance to be lad himself and hortense on the back seat and lavinia directly in front

the drive included a short trip up the road to the halfmoon battery and through the lanes of liveoaks that then lined the plank roadway extending for some miles north of the city thence somewhat retracing their course they ended their drive with a tour through the city to the famous battery arriving home just about dark

the conversation during all the way had been cheerful and free but still leonard was not fully relieved from the unpleasant recollections of the brief discussion on the night of the party it was his purpose to recur to the topic at the first convenient opportunity in order that he might clear away any unfavorable impression which he feared his remarks had made but the scenes of the drive had so occupied the attention of the entire party that he was kept busy in observing especially as on their return the whole beautiful harbor came into view

arriving and alighting from the carriage which was then dismissed leonard accompanied the ladies into the house and

was soon seated alone with hortense in the parlor while lavinia busied herself in preparing a simple repast notwithstanding the heroic efforts he had made to free himself from the peculiar bonds which seemed to link his fate to the chariot wheels of hortense vanross leonard never before felt so completely under her sway and although he had longed for the moment to come when he might be alone with her now that it had come he was confused and almost paralyzed in his efforts to talk or even to think however moving over and taking a seat on the large oldfashioned sofa on which hortense was already seated he made an effort to reintroduce the subject that had caused him so much uneasiness at the same time desiring to offer some apologies for his manner and to modify the remarks he had made

i fear miss hortense said he that you were not pleased with what i said the other evening when we were talking on the subject of religion

 perhaps i did not altogether agree with you mr howell and perhaps i spoke too warmly i beg pardon for anything in my tone or manner which may have led you to think that i was displeased  i assure you i was not at all displeased replied hortense seriously

i surely did not mean to be impolite or in any way lacking in courtesy i accidentally got into the subject and i have felt ever since that i expressed myself quite improperly i am certainly not a heathen nor do i claim to be an infidel although i admit that i am not orthodox on all religious topics but i wished to call up the matter only to apologize for my manner on that evening and after this with your consent we will taboo the subject altogether

 oh no mr howell you do not need to apologize i am sure no one was the least offended and it has not been tallied of at all the subject is not at all disagreeable to me and i shall be glad to resume it at any time whenever it may please you 

leonards confusion and embarrassment rather increased as the conversation went on and he felt himself far away from the subject at that time dearest to his heart

how should he ever unfold to the honored creature at his side the love that was consuming his life a few weeks ago he flattered himself that she knew his interest in her and more than reciprocated it and he imagined then that he could go through the form of proposal without a ruffle of spirit or quake of heart and would carry off in triumph the rich evidence of his conquest how tall and proud he appeared then in his own eyes as he surveyed himself in the flattering mirror of his own fancy with what excusable assurance did he speak of his southern belle and his southern beauty the charleston rebel  that he had captured

thus talked lieutenant howell to his army associates when miles away but where now is that volubility adroitness and courage as he sits on this oldfashioned sofa not far from the side of his adored hortense what has become of the freedom of tongue he possessed even on the occasion of his first visit to the vanross house after his return to the city as a civilian 

lieutenant howell was in a new role and his situation could have been described as one of painful deliciousness he suffered but he enjoyed his own sufferings

my dear hortense i am always ready to converse with you upon this subject or about anything whatever pleases you delights me it is such a rich privilege to be in your society that the sort of conversation is not of much importance it is a pleasure to me to look at you and to listen

and leonard moved a little nearer to her but still the distance between them on that long sofa was very respectable

hortense replied with thanks for the compliment and suggested pantomime but leonard was not equal to the demands of such a performance and begged to be excused miss hortense then returned to the earlier conversation about where they had left off

 no mr howell you cannot be a heathen  and you say you are not an infidel which i must also accept but then at the same time you tell us that you do not believe in creeds and confessions  and you do not believe in christians and in churches of course this is all strange to us who have always believed in such things pardon me but i am curious to know just what you do believe on these subjects

although lieutenant howell would have much preferred to have passed from the subject by an easier route now that he had done his best to remove the previous unpleasantness yet he saw no way to avoid the open door into which hortense almost commandingly invited him to enter in his own mind and heart a question was struggling for utterance which at that time was vastly more important to him than the question of his faith his hobby of irreligion had now lost all its charms

however he made some efforts to avow his beliefs but found the task very difficult

it had been an easy matter to talk with men of his own way of thinking about superstitious and creeds and churches and preachers but when he was called upon to make a confession of his faith to that earnest christian woman who was already the sovereign of his heart his tongue was singularly tame

again the honest demand of hortense had somewhat nonplussed him he had been in the habit of asserting only his disbeliefs and ridiculing the beliefs of others now he was asked for his own belief and to ridicule the belief of hortense did not enter his thought leonard found himself reduced within very narrow limits and for the nonce was compelled to cast the lead into the depths of his own soul he was unable to command art enough to deceive even had he been so inclined hortense had brought him abruptly visã vis with himself and transfixed him as it were before his own soul with mesmeric power and he must stay until the answer was given leonard thou art now at the command of the empress of thy heart looking in upon thy soul and thou must answer her question thou art unable to deceive thou durst not disobey what dost thou believe  negatives and ridicule will not avail thee in the presence of this spotless woman who awes thee by the very divinity of her character

well it would be much easier miss hortense said leonard to tell what i do not believe than to tell just what i do believe but i will say this  i do believe in god and i believe him to be a being of wisdom and love but i do not hold the usual orthodox opinions about religion either as a theory or as an experience i believe all things are under invariable law thus sliding into a familiar retreat and hoping the discussion would soon terminate

well replied hortense perhaps we do not differ so widely in our opinions

you believe in a god of goodness and love and in law which to me is nothing more than gods unchangeable ways this is a part of religion to believe in god as good and loving

yes but somehow i cannot bring myself to think of the great god as taking any personal interest in us individually or as having anything to do with our petty affairs i look upon it that all things are placed under law and left to work out their destiny i believe the law the best that could be for the whole but not the best for each individual i will even grant it to be a law of benevolence but i think it is fixed  and so i cannot see the value of prayer nor can i recognize any personal communication with the divine being i lack all that element which is called faith

i am not spiritual perhaps if i had your gifts i should have also your faith

but mr howell replied hortense now turning her gaze full upon him and appearing grander in his eyes than ever before as her whole face kindled with an earnestness that heightened every line of beauty in her form and features i am sure you do not lack sympathy even if you do lack faith i noticed today how easily you were interested in everything along the drive and how you were fairly enraptured with our beautiful harbor and battery myself and sister were delightfully entertained by your enlivening remarks you wrong yourself mr howell

you have a soul to see the beautiful and admire it and to see suffering and you have a heart to feel with the sufferer and to relieve his sufferings if possible your soldier training may have deceived you but i know that you have sentiment enough spiritual life enough do not say you are not spiritual you wrong yourself

lieutenant howell had never listened to such flattering remarks concerning himself before ill all his life and he was greatly affected he would have been pleased had the words been spoken by only a friend but to hear them spoken by the one person above all others whose good opinion he desired transported him beyond himself

he saw earnestness and interest in the tone look and attitude of hortense all so chaste and he drew in at once the most exhilarating draught of hope the old anticipation that had been a little blurred by recent circumstances now came back increased a thousandfold he felt that he not only enjoyed the good opinion of hortense as expressed by her kind words and hinder tones but what was so much more precious to him he read in the signlanguage known only to real lovers that her heart was not locked against him he permitted himself to believe that he had at length secured a recognition in her heart as something more than a friend

before he could press the advantage which came to him through the kind words of hortense lavinia entered the room and invited them to tea and the remainder of the evening was passed in the presence of the family the conversation became quite general although it was unavoidably colored from the effects of the previous brief discussion and the whole family recognized lieutenant howells opposition to christianity as professed and practiced in their household there was no real discussionâcertainly nothing like debateâ but the general conversation tended to show that lavinia greeted the views of leonard with more tolerance than did the others hortense appeared as one pained at the position in which she saw her friend placed but in the midst of her manifest solicitude she never allowed herself to indorse any expression of doubt or disbelief

the evening ended and lieutenant howell went to his hotel feeling very bright and congratulated himself that the day of betrothal was near the hope had now returned to him that he should secure the muchcoveted promise ere he should be compelled to leave the city he fancied the barriers were well out of the way the manners of hortense during the drive and all the evening had been most gracious and the goodnight she gave leonard at parting was accompanied with a cordial invitation to come again bright visions arose before him ns he fell asleep that night under the transforming influences of the lovers hope

let us pass over the minor incidents of a few days as they occur in the lives of these two loversâfor at last hortense is to be regarded as really deeply and ardently in love with the young lieutenant

her love has kindled slowly and its flame has grown amid difficulties but it is now burning with all the ardor of her natureâ such a love as only a heart ripened beneath a southern sky can produce how begins the real struggle love is blind it is said  but hortense was not blind to the fact that her lover was not a christian she saw that he was practically a disbeliever in the religion which her mother professed and which she had been taught to love and honor should she accept him as a lover 

would not this be indorsing his irreligion 

could she love him without herself being led into sin dear reader do not i beg you yield to the silly notion that woman does not reason never was there uttered a more unworthy libel upon our mothers wives sisters and daughters how often is the wife and mother the only reasoning and reasonable one of the entire household 

hortense reasoned and debated earnestly with herself her great question in all possible forms and generally ended with the resolve to dismiss the interloper from her heart the reasoning was all right and the conclusion came forth with syllogistic precision  but the gates of the citadel were commanded by love against whose authority the assaults of reason have but little significance hortense would have been happier if she had been less disposed to reason

the lover soon became a family topic and mother sister and brother discussed the affair in all its bearings all generally expressing themselves against the lieutenants views and yet at the same time all willingly granted that he was possessed of many estimable qualities his manner was frank and open  he was fairly intelligent his morals were above question  he appeared well related and had fair prospects but he was an infidelâthis was the barrier between them and him

oh dont say his infidelity said lavinia with some sign of impatience as they were one day discussing the everpresent topic i am sure mr howell is not an infidel and it is not fair to speak of him as such

no sister said william he may not be an infidel in the sense that he denies the bible as in some way a book of history and even of morals but he does not recognize it as the authority in the matter of faith nor does he believe in christ he cannot be called a christian in any just sense

 he confesses to a belief in god and he believes that people ought to do right

replied lavinia and he is himself perfectly correct kind and courteous i dont know but i would rather have the  works  any time than the profession i know many people professing to be christians who are not so good as mr howell is i dont find any fault with him i know he loves sister hortense here and i believe sister loves him said she teasingly and when he comes to ask for her i am going to ask him to take me too and her silvery laugh rang out in sincere merriment

hortense blushed in reply and said  yes you may do so when he asks for me

dont you think so ma 

mrs vanross was too close an observer not to know that leonard was in love with hortense and that her daughter was returning his love and was too good a mother not to be deeply concerned in her heart about it she had watched the growth of their affection with real solicitude but had guarded so perfect a silence respecting it that when hortense appealed to her as above she little suspected that her mother already shared the supposed secret love can never be hid and is never lost the heart may be doublelocked and doublebarred but speak it will

when hortense then looked up into her mothers face with an attempt at gayety and queried dont you think so ma 

mrs vanross saw not the mock gayety that spread itself as the very thinnest veil over her countenance and attitude but she saw the wounded struggling heart of her daughter that was crying for a sympathy and help which her tongue dared not ask

however she replied pleasantly suppose he should ask for the mother and have both daughters thrown in for good measure how would that do 

at this little sally all laughed heartily and the conversation continued in that tone and was reaching a high degree of merriment when it was suddenly interrupted by a loud knock at the gate it was leonard

he had not overheard the conversation for although the windows were open and the house stood high enough from the ground to allow the sound to pass out to the street over the high tight fence and the ladies voices had become quite animated yet thanks to the distanceâas the house sat well backâand the unearthly noises made by the venders with their cries of sweet taters feesh and eoisters

lieutenant howell had heard from the house only some confused sounds merry voices and laughter

i do not know by what occult force the mind and heart of one person especially where love is concerned seem to be able imperceptibly to throw their emanations in advance and to set other persons thinking and talking toward the very subject that occupies his own thoughts perhaps some day we shall know more about this mystery

how often do we open the door to greet loved ones to say to them truthfully well i have been looking for you all day or we were just this moment talking of you

the thoughts which had been revolving in lieutenant howells mind as he had slowly and silently and by a roundabout way walked from his hotel to the vanross residence had already gone ahead of him and had already made their impression upon the dwellers within the first to respond to their train was the highly spiritual lavinia she had been the fairy forerunner preparing the way for him without herself being aware of it

leonards errand on this early evening was the most serious of all his life his heart quaked less when detailed with a picket guard to watch some dangerous post than it did on that night as he awaited admission to this plain residence on rutledge street he was to leave charleston soon and this was to be his last visit to the family for the present he came not to make a formal proposal to hortense for somehow he had begun to feel that he had already won her regard  but he came to comply with an honorable custom which takes rank among the highest of social laws in charleston as indeed it should everywhere he came to ask the consent of mrs van rose to sue for the hand of her daughter he flattered himself that the heart of hortense was already on his side but he desired to obtain the mothers consent and blessing

lieutenant howell entered receiving the usual cordial greetings notwithstanding there was a blushing undertone which said as plainly as quiet actions couldâwe have been thinking of you it was understood by the family that his stay in the city was wellnigh over and they were expecting his leavetaking at any time soon after his arrival therefore the whole family with a few nearby friends assembled in the parlor and on the piazza to do special honor to his visit the young ladies and their brothers were more or less occupied during the early evening in giving attention to callers and to the special friends who had come to join the family in saying goodby which circumstance afforded a favorable opportunity for leonard to engage the attention of mrs vanross it may be that mrs vanross herself successfully planned the affair so that the desired interview might come as though by the ordinary turn of events whether such was the case or not as soon as leonard found himself alone with mrs vanross he at once summoned up his courage and began mrs vanross will you permit me to speak with you freely a moment about a matter of the very highest importance to myself 

despite his efforts to be dignified there were evident signs of embarassment in his manner which mrs vanross perceiving relieved at once with that tact that can only spring from pure ladylike instinct

turning to him her full view she answered with the most assuring cheerfulness  certainly mr howell i shall be only too glad to have you do so

leonard knowing that the moments were precious went quite rapidly over the story of his love for hortense speaking in low tones lest other ears might be aroused to listen and ended it by saying  and now mrs vanross i have made a clean breast of it and i thank you for permitting me to say all to you i love your daughter i have no titles honors or riches but i offer an honest heart and a true love and i think enough of this worlds goods to insure her a comfortable home and i pledge you upon my honor as a man that i will do all in my power to render her happy i await your approval of my suit may i hope to have it

mrs vanross listened to his story with serious attention and was fully satisfied as to the frankness and good faith of her wouldbe soninlaw in her eyes he was not at all unworthy as to cultivation and morals and she was satisfied with his business prospects and yet she hesitated

she did not wish to oppose and she was unwilling to favor on the one side of the problem was a genuine affection which she could not disrespect on the other an irreligious character which she feared if she gave her approval she would be encouraging a union between her daughter and a person whose religious views she could not sanction perhaps to bring great future sorrow to the entire family if she declined the union might nevertheless take place or the life of her daughter be blasted by being denied the love of her heart

mrs vanross therefore hesitated and begged for further time intending to converse more pointedly with hortense before giving her final answer

 i must keep my dear girls with me as long as i can she said  i suppose i shall never part with them cheerfully although i know i must do so at some time and william i do not know what he would do without  tonsy as he calls her

 oh well she will not be far away and can come home often and all can see her frequently it is my purpose to make my home somewhere in this section quite probably in georgia replied leonard

 well i must withold my answer for the present at the same time i beg to assure you of my sincere esteem and as the young people were now disengaged no further opportunity was offered to continue the conversation

mrs vanross although a most thorough southerner was not afflicted with any prejudices against yankees or northerners and was in no sense a narrowminded woman she thoroughly respected honest affection as something almost divine and she already believed the attachment between lieutenant howell and her daughter to be one of genuine love hence although she was not a little pained and would have wished it otherwise she felt that she had neither the authority nor the power to command love and she feared to throw herself against it lest she might be found fighting against god

as all present were fully aware of the tender attachment existing between leonard and hortense they with very polite consideration allowed the two to share each others society undisturbed during the greater part of the remainder of the evening i do not think we ought to pry too curiously into what was either said or done by these two young people on that to them most memorable autumnal evening

love casts over them its spotless drapery and very properly creates for them its world of two happy with each other let us not dare intrude

suffice it that although no formal engagement such as might serve as the basis of a breachofpromise suit was entered into yet when the visit closed leonard c

howell knew that he was the accepted lover of hortense vanross and she was both proud and happy to feel herself loved by him and in her heart admitted an engagement from which there was no retreat there had indeed been a heart engagement between them for a long time but it had grown up so imperceptibly from beginnings impossible to date that it had stolen upon them unawaresâespecially in the case of hortense with her the feeling had never been confessed nor fairly recognized hitherto but on this night it had reached that degree of vigor and maturity that compelled its expression

it asserted itself in such looks tones gestures and words that when these two young people ended their conversation they were more than friends

when the time for leavetaking arrived all gave the parting hand except hortense all manifested interest and regard but hortense accompanied him to the gate standing by that gate as he was about to open it to be absent for months perhaps for years partly covered by the darkness of the evening and protected from view by the shrubbery which lined the walks holding her right hand in his almost without thought his left sought her waist and she was drawn to him in loving clasp her face toward his their lips met and the opening kiss of a new love was born into the world

hortense reentered the oldfashioned homestead no longer possessed of a whole heart one half of her heart had gone with her lover but more than half of his remained with her lieutenant leonard c howell and hortense vanross were engaged

it was a cool clear bracing december sabbath one of those rare winter days in charleston neither warm nor wet as a rule the winter days there are either if clear unpleasantly warm or if cloudy most disagreeably cold and wet but on this day the weather was at its best a cool north wind was blowing and the sun was shining brightly

as usual with the vanross family when the weather was favorable all set out at the appointed hour for church there was some special interest in the service today growing out of the fact that the church building which had been occupied under military authority by missionaries who had come down from the north in the wake of the union army was now turned over to the original congregation and dr

caulfield the former pastor would preach his first sermon in it since the surrender

as this was the case generally with the churches of the city there was a rallying of the local congregations

most of the churches were well filled and the services were quite earnest generally and in some instances touchingly pathetic

empty seats veiled widows weeping mothers and sisters and sweethearts with thoughtful and pensive looks told the sad story of the war husbands brothers and lovers had gone forth in support of a cause by them held dear but had not returned

these weeping wives and mothersâthese thoughtful and pensive sweethearts and sisters who could not weepâhad lost their cause and lost their loved ones with it

the ministers who knew the people and who had passed through the entire experience of the war both at home and in camp preached to them the best consolation they could they held up to them the rich promises of the divine word and bade them hope in god and in the world of deathless love and joy already won by their husbands fathers and sons who had gone on before them they bade them to rejoice in peace even though it came as the peace of defeat and to look for the land wherein wars never arise and over which the great prince of peace sways his gentle scepter

dr caulfield preached earnestly and eloquently that clear sabbath morning

the sun was bright the atmosphere invigorating and the church well ventilated

he preached as i say in an earnest enlivening manner fully justifying what hortense had said of him to lieutenant howell but a few weeks before neither his subject nor his manner was in any respect dull and audible responses came from many parts of the crowded building while tears were drawn from nearly every eye

in all that congregation there was no listener more sympathetic no worshipper more devout than hortense doubtless there was some hero worship in her devotion but she was altogether unconscious of it she admired and loved dr caulfield as who did not and a share of her worship was received by the instrument which should have gone past him to fall at the shrine of the infinite one but none are perfect and hortense worshipped with sincerity and listened with childlike docility and to her the service was truly exhilarating

lavinia was more spiritual but less constant than her sister capable of soaring to greater heights but unable to sustain for any lengthy period either intense emotion or exalted vision  hence she was not so wrapt as to overlook several material accessories of the service she saw and felt the heavenly it is true for she was by no means irreverent but she saw also to a very reasonable extent the men and women who made up the congregation

seated in the pulpit with dr caulfield was a young minister with yellow curling hair florid face and of robust build smoothly shaven and neatly dressed he was not specially clericallooking ills appearance was rather boyish and if a goodsized frame had been put about him as he sat there he might have suggested a picture to advertise the fountain of youth

evidently he was not a dyspeptic his clear lips clean teeth smooth skin bright eyes strong step and firm positive movements all told of a mighty digestion of a stomach like the mills of the gods he was a joy and inspiration to look at he was full of life to overflowing

he was a stranger to the entire congregation and when dr caulfield invited him to take part in the services all eyes were fixed upon him his voice was in full harmony with his general appearanceâfull round sympathetic and musical and his manner was free from belittling affectation

the service closed and after greeting the pastor the vanross ladies immediately started for their home on the way the sisters walked side by side while mrs

vanross proudly leaned on the arm of her eldest son of course the sermon and the service were remarked upon by all but we must pardon them if their thoughts quickly turned to their many friends who had returned from their weary misfortunes to once more worship in their dear old church while it had been an occasion of worship it had been also in a quiet and restricted sense a real social reunion of friends and families long separated the services therefore taking in this wide view furnished much food for conversation

but the strange young minister was not overlooked nor forgotten his name had been announced in the church and he had been presented to a few of the leading male members and also to a few matronly dames but a devout respect for the occasion and the place as well as the general haste prevented any larger number of personal introductions consequently as the vanross sisters walked home from the church that beautiful sabbath morning they were ignorant even of the strangers name for they bad not been fortunate enough to hear it distinctly as it was announced

lavinia was the first to speak of him to her sister on the way home

 sister said she  what was that young ministers name that was in the pulpit this morning 

 i dont know i could not hear what dr caulfield called him replied hortense

calling to her brother who was a few steps ahead she said in a low voice william oh william what did dr caulfield say that young ministers name was sister yeeny here is dying to know

tis no such thing replied lavinia  tonsy wants to know just as badly as i do

ah said william tantalizingly the young preacher seems to be all of the text or the sermon that you remember delightful subject i know a good full sermon for all the young ladies and you each seem to have received your portion

 oh william tell us said both at once  we know you know because we saw you shake hands with him

 dont you wish you had had that privilege replied william still teasing them and then he ended the conversation by saying oh sisters you will have to wait until we get home and have had dinner

dr caulfield was a fair southerner but was not so bitter toward the unionists and northerners as were some of his clerical brethren and hence when the young stranger approached him presenting firstclass testimonials and manifesting a spirit so guileless and brimming with love and hope and wearing a manner so entirely free from conceit his respect and confidence were soon won and some time before the sabbath morning in which we have seen the two sitting side by side in the pulpit his whole nature had been somewhat warmed and cheered by the intercourse already had with his new acquaintance between them was already that attraction which springs up so readily between the phlegmatic and the sanguine between ripened age and budding youth between the languid luxuriant south and the energetic north and although so unlike in appearance and manners the two seemed to be born to be friends

the young minister was the rev thomas gordon he had been a country boy in new york and had passed through academy college and seminary without becoming either dyspeptic effeminate or conceited and was now prepared to do the work of pastor and teacher among the freedmen in the south here by his own choice he fancied he was to do his masters work and acquire that experience and insight into human nature which would serve him so well in future years in other fields

is it strange that one filled with such purposes and such spirit should form the acquaintance and friendship of dr caulfield and should be found worshiping in this rebel church on this bright sabbath morning mr gordon was not born to hate rich and poor northerners and southerners black and white were all very much alike to him his heart was an overflowing fountain that sent out only sweet waters and sent them out with such volume and force as to bear down all petty prejudices with their current his religion was one of love and so it was with his usual warmth and joy that he took part in the services of this southern church  and the pearls of earnest sympathy which his manner and voice scattered were not trampled underfoot by the congregation

toward the close of the week following dr caulfield knowing of the liberal sentiments or at least tolerance of the vanross family decided to invite the young minister to call upon them in company with himself

it is needless to say that the family especially the female members stood very high in the confidence and respect of the church generally and that they were favorites of the pastor so far as his position allowed him to have any favorites

he had not failed to speak of them to mr

gordon with just enough of twinkle in his eye to show that the  old adam  in him was not entirely dead like the serpent that has done duty so long it had been effectually scotched but it still breathed and dr caulfield felt a little of the gallantry that once possessed his soul as he walked toward the vanross residence accompanied by his young friend he was dignified almost to courtliness generally but on this occasion there seemed to be a decided bending on his part toward the manners of his friend indeed there was a tendency unconscious no doubt on the part of each of the two gentlemen to incline toward each other in spirit and manner

dr caulfield became less still and reserved mr gordon rather more restrained and grave thus impressed the one by the other the two clergymen entered the gate walked up the steps and stood upon the piazza of the vanross residence they were admitted by a servant and given seats in the parlor before any of the family were aware of their presence

rosa the maid came into the sitting room where mrs vanross and her daughters were seated and announced that dr caulfield and a young gentleman were in the parlor and then sidling up to lavinia with whom she was especially familiar she said slyly deed miss veeny him de pootiest young gentleman i eber see

hortense said with some excitement it is that young minister

mrs vanross arose at once and going into the parlor greeted her pastor with cordiality and turning at once to the stranger awaited a formal introduction

 rev thomas gordon mrs vanross i take the liberty of presenting him to you

said dr caulfield with his usual grace

 mr gordon replied mrs vanross extending her hand i am glad to see you be seated gentlemen the girls will be in in a moment

all were soon seated and engaged in conversation which consisted chiefly of anxious inquiries about neighbors and friends and in expressions of sympathy concerning those whose sufferings were mentioned mr gordon was touched by the little disclosures made and his sympathetic attention soon induced them to take him into their confidence and his presence ceased to be any embarrassment

in a few moments the two daughters entered the room together how like and yet how different were they in appearance and manner as viewed together by the young stranger hortense approached first and received mr gordon graciously and quite cordially lavinia blushed and for once was somewhat embarrassed as she extended her faultless hand to the stranger

mr gordons manner so far had been frank and apparently somewhat perfunctory he was certainly not indifferent to the refinement and beauty of the vanross ladies but as yet he had exhibited no signs of special interest he took the hand of mrs vanross and of hortense bowing his acknowledgments of their favors and expressing himself with elegance and ease but that was all but as he stood before lavinia and took her hand in his their eyes met and his whole manner underwent a change for a moment his eyes lingered upon the dark beauty that stood before him and he seemed almost transfixed by the bright scintillations that shot forth from her wondrous eyes like illumined rays from the matchless kohinoor their hands had clasped their eyes had met and thomas gordon and lavinia vanross were in love she might have said then what she long afterward said in the ardor of one of her delicious love episitles after the engagement had been made an unseen hand prepared strong links to bind our hearts or long afterward when transformed almost into another being she said  i received my inspiration when our eyes first met in charleston you may locate and date it when you choose he might have said that very evening what he afterward declared amid many elegant sentences since i met you on that memorable afternoon in your lovely home i have been simply yours to command

the love between two such natures soon leaped to maturity thomas gordon was generous and spontaneous and although well educated and comparatively well experienced for his age he had not become distrustful of either man or woman in a general way he was not devoid of proper caution and was not a man to be easily duped but he was not afraid to trust his own love his own judgment and the concurrent testimony surrounding the beautiful lavinia he loved her at sight and he knew it he came he saw and he had been if not conquered certainly captivated  and he did not try to conceal the fact either from himself or from others lavinia for the first time in her life felt her powers succumb  and although granted the dominion she felt herself rather the subject the fact of drawing so great and noble a soul to herself seemed to throw a feeling of awe over her and she grew less frivolous and more sedate and thoughtful every day

the love between them grew apace and before the coming spring lavinia wore on her finger a plain gold ring which had been placed there by another hand

mr gordon entered upon his work in savannah with all the zeal and earnestness of his robust and hearty nature while lavinia began preparations for the marriage which had been set for the coming autumn how bright were the visions that rose up before her as she contemplated union with the generous noble being who had already won her heart she became less gay in manner but a deep sweet happiness filled her whole soul and diffused itself about her in such manner as to affect the entire household mother sister and brother were quite happy in the good fortune of the pet of the family  although all sorrowed at the thought of the disruption of their little domestic kingdom

already they saw it invaded and partitioned off among other powers with hortense as the wife of lieutenant howell and lavinia married to mr gordon the family would be practically broken up the nest might remain but the birds of song would have carried their music to other bowers

rev thomas gordon vigorous and robust unaccustomed to pain or sickness of any sort committed the error so often committed by persons in perfect health

he worked hard ate heartily and scarcely ever gave a thought to himself toiling on head hand and heart through the winter which to him indeed was little different from summer spring came and found him not a little relaxed in constitution his eye had lost some of its accustomed brightness his step was less brisk his complexion less rosy and healthfullooking  still he was not sick and thought nothing of giving up his work it was his intention to go north in july or august returning thence in the fall to resume his work and prepare for the wedding

a tacit agreement existed between himself and the vanross family as well as with his relatives and friends in the north that he should give up his work among the freedmen after the marriage and enter a northern field

he was now happy in hope and although he loved the work among the lowly his heart was so full of broad sympathy that no special conditions were needed to call it forth he was fitted to be an apostle of love to all men while others required sad conditions to awaken their sympathies and set them to work thomas gordon saw in every man something to arouse kindly interest and call forth the look the word or the hand of sympathy encouragement or help

the summer came on and while his work became more absorbing he at the same time became less fitted for it the work which ordinarily seemed to go itself needed now to be pushed and his labor began to tell on him his rest was not so sweet and refreshing as formerly and there was a strange confused feeling in his head at times and now and then telltale pains would dart through his limbs

these with other symptoms were telling the story of savannahs fearful malaria

secretly the poison had distributed itself throughout his system with all the strategy of a relentless foe preparing for a general attack and it seemed to have proportioned its forces to the robustness of his physique

the attack came with its inevitable chill and its burning fever which rapidly gallopped from intermittent to remittent and finally assumed the dangerous typhoid form

mr gordons homo was in the household of an elderly widow whither he had been advised to go for the twofold purpose of securing quiet for himself and that the pay might be some help to her the first part of this purpose was hardly accomplished for mrs chamomile was a tireless talker and her conversation was not always edifying or soothing

when she saw her boarder becoming sick she was secretly pleased with the thought that it would bring her into greater prominence especially as she prided herself upon her skill as a nurse

after mr gordon had been compelled to take to his bed and before the fever had assumed a malignant form the doctor who was experienced in such diseases saw reason to apprehend a serious attack and counseled particular care and quiet he however never lost hope of his patients ultimate recovery

the deacons from the church calling were comfortably assured by the physician that the sick mans chances for getting well were good  and although he was very sick he believed he would survive the run of the fever and would then recuperate perhaps quite rapidlyâowing of course to his splendid constitution

after the departure of the doctor mrs

chamomile said  ah my brothers you cant place too much confidence in what the doctor says

doctors always say their patients are going to get well i tell you i have been nursing sick people for a good many years and they cant fool me i tell you brother gordon is a mighty sick man and if he ever gets out of that bed alive it will be a miracle no indeed he is not likely to get well and yet i shall do all i can and if he can be saved anywhere he can be saved here for you know he cant get any better nursing in savannah than i can give him

the deacons took mrs chamomiles account of the sick mans condition with some allowance but nevertheless they thought it best to write to his family in the north that mr gordon was seriously and dangerously ill at the same time putting in their letter all the comforting assurances that the doctor had given them

in reply to their letter mrs wilson a devoted sister of the minister was at his bedside just as soon as traveling conveniences could bring her there mrs

chamomile did not look with pleasure upon this movement regarding it as in a measure intruding upon her special prerogatives as nurse and then also mrs

chamomile was a southern woman and although she could conquer her prejudices in the presence of the affable mr gordon she could not always succeed so well when talking with his sister she regaled mrs

wilson with stories of her own great deeds and descriptions of her own great virtues and high standing as a nurse and a ladyâalways ending with a long dissertation upon the sacrifices she had made on behalf of  brother gordon and how she had now brought him out of danger rescuing him from an almost certain death and finally saying  if it hadnt been for me you would never have seen your brother alive when you got here no indeed you might have been here time enough to have seen him in his coffin  but you would have never seen him alive when you got here the trouble was all over he had passed the crisis he has got nothing to do now but to get well

mrs wilson received all this meekly and watched by her brother day by day until the fever left him and convalescence fairly set in poor mrs chamomile saw her monoply broken and her manners daily became more contemptuous toward mrs

wilson and less gracious even toward mr

gordon

the climax was reached one bright morning when a carriage containing two ladies of dignified and refined appearance drove up to the gate they alightedâthe one elderly but so thoroughly bred that her presence was sufficient to commaud the highest respect the other young and beautiful their countenance showed the serious character of their mission

mrs vanross and her daughter had arrived in answer to a note addressed them by mrs wilson the good sister had decided to take her brother home by steamer from savannah to new york and having learned from him the full story of his love she had dared to address a note to mrs vanross informing her of the condition of mr gordon and of her intention of taking him north quite probably not to return soon if at all

the note was carefully worded and as mrs vanross received it and read it she called lavinia and said very quietly  veeny here is some news for you

what is it ma who is the letter from betraying a deeper interest than she intended

 it is a letter from mr gordons sister

replied her mother with forced calmness

it seems that he is sick in savannah and his sister has come to take him home

mrs vanross then partly read the letter aloud and finally handed it to her daughter

it did not invite the ladies to come and see the sick man but it opened the way for a volunteer visit and lavinia saw enough in the letter to lead her to the feeling that her sick lover desired to see her

true to her real nature she arose to a sublime womanhood

 i shall go to him tonight the boat sails at four oclock

mrs vanross remonstrated for a moment but lavinias dark eyes were already overflowing and looking her mother full in the face she said with all the sad emphasis of her soul  oh mamma i must go or die i cannot help how it looks or what people say i must go

it was this sincere assertion disclosing the thoroughly concentrated devotion of her tropical nature that led to the series of events which terminated as we have seen with the arrival of the two ladies at mrs

chamomiles residence

the meeting between the ladies and mrs wilson was cordial and although there were no formal introductions they all recognized one another and were soon at ease together mrs wilson was a most devoted sister and thoroughly admired her manly brother and she was most agreeably impressed by the appearance and kind and polished manners of the visitors contrasting as they did with the disagreeable and almost repulsive manners of mrs chamomile

it was hard for mrs wilson to decide which one of the strange ladies delighted her the moreâthe mother with her quiet dignity and grace of manner or the daughter with her astonishing beauty she read at once in the eyes and tender expression of countenance of lavinia the story of a love that dared assert itself and to which she seemed entirely subject in a moment their hearts beat as one for they both loved the same hero and were so related to him that they could not become rivals already they were sisters the salutations being over and a few words of explanation interchanged mrs wilson tripped lightly upstairs and in a cheerful manner told the sick man of the arrival of the ladies arranging at the same time that they should follow almost immediately so there should be no suspense as mrs vanross entered the room and looked upon the face of the sick man so altered and so thin she with difficulty restrained herself from betraying surprise in her countenance but lavinia who came in a step behind her hastened directly to the bedside happy only to see and be near her lover the sunken eyes hollow cheeks and parched lips were not noticedâit was enough that she saw him and that he was still alive her thought her purpose and her prayers were that he should get well

her intense spirit seemed to take hold of him and bid him to look out upon life and upward to health through her strong faith and hope her visit was indeed an angel visit

so far everything had progressed smoothly mrs chamomile was out and at this very moment was relating with contemptuous laughter all that had passed between the sick man and his sister since the latter had arrived adding to her story from her evil imagination whatever she thought would heighten the effect or further elevate herself in the estimation of her listeners she was now playing the role of martyrgeneral of the community who had been burdened by the sick man and his sister as no lone woman had ever been burdened before

during her absence the doctor had also called and finding the ladies so agreeable had tarried perhaps longer than his professional duties strictly required and when mrs chamomile returned well laden with food for talk she was not a little confused to find her parlor open and mrs

wilson with the two strange ladies and the doctor all seated within engaged in earnest conversation she was not pleased ever since mrs wilsons arrival she had been careful to have her feel that she was an alien and a stranger and to emphasize this impression she had been very careful not to offer her anything that could be construed as an invitation to the freedom of her house mrs wilson saw this and had thoroughly respected the landladys wishes but this morning she thought it absolutely necessary to assume something like the authority of the mistress of the house and had so acted consequently she had invited the ladies to seats in the parlor and had presented the doctor to them and all were in pleasant mood as mrs chamomile entered

mrs wilson introduced the ladies pleasantly and mrs chamomile did her best to make a favorable impression upon her visitors but could not hide her aversion toward mrs wilson the doctor was remarking i am sure the disease is thoroughly over now and all that he needs is to regain his strength i do not apprehend any relapse although no one can speak with certainty in such matters it will be necessary to be very careful of his diet for some time but i think the change of air will do him good the northern air is so much more bracing than ours that i shall expect to hear that he is building up rapidly

why doctor broke in mrs

chamomile  are they going to take mr gordon away 

mrs wilson did not wait for the doctor to reply but answered at once pleasantly  yes mrs chamomile  i am going to take him home with me

 when  almost shrieked mrs chamomile her eyeballs glaring like those of an enraged tigress the vanross ladies observed her attitude and were almost frightened but they managed to preserve apparent composure mrs wilson understood it all and answered quietly   tomorrow morning at  oclock

humph replied mrs chamomile does the doctor say he may go does he know how bad he was last night

why doctor he did not sleep a bit hardly all night and he had quite a fever this morning

ah said the doctor he does not appear to have any fever now and he seems to be slowly but surely mending

while he is still very weak yet i think it better for him to go north at once

mrs chamomile had a kind of superstitious reverence for the doctor and in his presence she managed to subside promptly but it was with a clearly defined mental reservation as soon as the doctor had taken his departure her tone was immediately reversed

mr gordon had been snatched from the grave through her great skill and care and now he and his ungrateful sister were leaving her with scant pay and no thanks

this was about the feeling she entertained and she was not at all careful to conceal it

her manner toward mrs wilson became so offensive that the visitors were pained and took their departure at their earliest convenience and when the carriage came to take the sick man to the steamer it was a welcome relief

embarking upon the steamer they breathed a sigh of relief and after a pleasant passage of little over three days landed in new york city and were rapidly transferred to their home up the state despite the favorable predictions of the doctor and the excellent care received mr gordon continued in a low state of health all summer and it was quite late in the fall before he began to manifest his usual vigor

meantime mrs chamomile continued to tell the story of his sickness and of her nursing generally delivering herself about as follows  now there was mr gordonâhe would have been dead sure if it hadnt been for me i tell you its all in the nursinâi always bring my patients through mr

gordon had firstclass treatment if i do say it myself they may well thank me for having him alive now i done that much good anyhow i saved his life the nursin is everything

the winter approached and as the cool and bracing breezes began to come in from the north mr gordons health commenced rapidly to regain its wonted state his step daily became more buoyant his countenance wore a more radiant and cheerful look his eye was clear and he was increasing in strength and weight his food was relished as never before and his sleep was quiet and refreshing

the physician who had attended him during the crisis of his illness in savannah had intimated that his temperament was hardly suited to a southern climate and had advised him for his healths sake to seek a field of labor in a higher latitude

with this view the doctor who had watched his convalescence in the north fully concurred  while his friends and relatives were only too happy to lend their counsel and support in the same direction already halfpersuaded in his own mind mr gordon found it hard nevertheless to give up all thought of returning to his field of virgin labor in georgia as his health improved his soul longed anew for the work in which he had already begun to win success but the wishes of friends and the counsel of physicians as well as his own sober judgment finally overruled his generous zeal and he decided to accept a call which had recently reached him from a church in brooklyn

the church was a small one and regarded as rather unimportant and unpromising and the salary offered was not tempting he was known to be a single man of striking appearance and these facts may have had something to do with securing him the church the trustees probably thought that these attributes in their minister would add to his drawing power but if so they were doomed to an early disappointment

mr gordon was typically brave generous and honest and it was not long after his settlement that he informed the officers of the church that he contemplated early marriage of course such a fact could not be kept in official hands only and within a very few days the entire congregation and many others knew of the pastors engagement it was soon known among the ladies of the church that the wedding would take place early in january and that the newly married couple would soon thereafter occupy the parsonage the usual interest was awakened and as the time drew nigh for mr gordon to start south for his bride plans were set on foot to thoroughly renovate the modest church building and refurnish the parsonage during his absence mr gordon was to know nothing of this as it was the intention of the congregation to make the affair an agreeable surprise to him on his return

the furniture and carpets were already purchased and all things were in readiness for the work of transformation which was to begin as soon as mr gordon should be out of the way it was known that he intended to leave so as to arrive in charleston on the last day of december and that the wedding was to take place on the evening of january st the event had been postponed from a date in autumn on account of mr gordons illness and the arrangements were now presumably complete

on the evening of december th mr

gordon arrived in charleston and as soon as convenient called upon his affianced by whom he was received with every token of affection his stay however was short

all was bustle and confusion even in that sedate and well ordered household the first bride was being adorned for her husband and besides it was in the midst of the holiday season which nowhere else brings more of social and domestic movement than in charleston the whole family were interested in the marriage of course and so was quite a large circle of friends who kept themselves busy coming and going bringing presents volunteering little services and above allâtalking the wedding must be in all respects conformable to the canons of social taste and must be not only a southern but a charleston function and so it came to be

mr gordon took up his abode with his old friend the reverend doctor caulfield who as the friend of both bride and groom could heartily rejoice with both

january the first came a dull misty day cold and disagreeable and as the day advanced the fog became so thick as to differ little from rain mr gordon bad risen early and breakfast being over was seated near the front window looking over the morning papers and talking with members of the family as they came into the room

thus passed away the greater portion of the forenoon suddenly the dull sound of a drum was heard accompanied by other sounds of inferior martial music the children both within the bouse and on the street in front announced the coming of a procession and in a few minutes the bead of the column appeared it was a great motley procession of freedmen numbering with its followers not less than five thousand persons probably many more they were celebrating the anniversary of emancipation for the first time and in the long line could be seen many banners with varying symbols and mottoes and every now and then quite respectable portraits of the great lincoln

the young ladies of the caulfield family expressed their disgust at the procession and were sorry that mr gordon must witness a scene so shocking no doubt they painted their disgust in overdrawn terms and did it for the special benefit of their northern visitor for all their lives they had been accustomed to look upon scenes much more revolting

their sympathy was lost however upon mr gordon he saw in this black procession men women and children and his soul at once thrilled with enthusiasm as he looked upon these newborn sons and daughters of freedom far from being disgusted or offended at the rude pageant it was for him the most interesting and affecting spectacle upon which lie had ever gazed lie was so attracted by it that as soon as convenient he went out into the street to learn its destination on hearing that it was on its way to the famous racecourse where a monster meeting was to be held he at once made his way thither

arriving on the grounds he beheld the largest body of colored people he had ever seen and quite probably the largest that had ever assembled in the country surely there were not less than ten thousand assembled in the open air with faces all turned toward a large high platform standing in the midst of the expectant throng

the speeches that were delivered by the â white and colored orators were of small consequence and were heard by but few but what impressed mr gordon most was the quiet earnest and even intense demeanor of the vast multitude again came the yearning of his heart to go among that people and take an earnest part in giving to them right guidance he saw in that vast throng so much of promise and hope if properly guided and felt that there was so much of danger to themselves and to the state if they should fall into the hands of selfish and unprincipled men but his own course had been settled and it was now too late to reconsider

in the vanross residence the preparations were still going on and as evening came the family experienced that feeling of relief which comes when all things are about ready twilight approached and for a marvel everything was indeed in readiness for the final act to wit that of dressing the bride and even this was well under way the house was illuminated and the guests were beginning to assemble the night without was dark and disagreeableâfitting finale of a disagreeable dayâbut all was brightness within

dr caulfield had arrived and at the appointed moment the bridal party entered the room and the ceremony began lavinia was at the very climax of her beauty as she stood in the full light of the chandelier and her dress reflected the perfect taste of the family rev thomas gordon appeared noble and grand indeed standing there as the support of his peerless bride

it was the union of the full rosyhued masculine blonde of teutonic type with grayblue eyes and curling yellow hair on the one side with a genuine brunette or rather spanish creole type on the other

the contrast was beautiful and suggestive of the heights and depths of sweetest pleasure how sincere were the responses to the solemn questions with what real affection were their hands clasped as the minister repeated   those whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder

if ever a couple were joined together by the hand of god thomas gordon and lavinia vanross were admirably fitted to each other by nature each answering to the other by a most happy opposite there was before them a most charming prospect

the ceremony ended wine was served but neither groom nor bride tasted it mr

gordon was a strict teetotaler and did not depart from his principles even on this occasion and lavinia joined with him in the polite refusal

the brides outfit had been carefully packed in the huge trunks which had already been sent to the depot the last of the gifts had come in the last congratulations had been received and the newly married couple were soon on their way to take a midnight train for the north

reader have you ever seen a newlymarried couple on the train  perhaps you have at some time overheard their delightful talk their conversation and actions are always very interesting to others and it is usually not very long before they secure a monopoly of attention well dominie gordon and his bride were an emphatically newly married couple and everybody on the train soon found it out

they were happy and could not help showing it let us excuse them they were walking in the way the divine creator marked out for man

in due time they arrived in new york and were soon at their new home astonished and delighted to find the parsonage most thoroughly renovated and refurnished the church brightened up by a general cleansing and a committee of ladies on hand to welcome the new bride after having done all that was necessary for the comfort of the new family the committee had the good sense to retire promptly and the minister and his new wife for the first time sat down to a meal together in their home and began to feast freely upon that perpetual banquet of love which their own hearts hourly furnished

happy in the confidence and love of a growing church their lives were truly blessed dr gordon as he soon came to be made happy and strong by the undying love and sympathy of the wife whom he had received from the lord and rich himself in the possession of a loving and hopeful nature was not long in finding himself crowded with work and blessed with every form of prosperity

they are doing well and the somewhat gay and very beautiful and very loving lavinia vanross has grown into the hopeful and helpful mrs gordonâready to put her hand to every good work she has accepted much of her husbands radiant nature while he has deepened and softened through hers he has improved in judgment she has been strengthened in purpose  and both are admirably suited to the large work providentially opening before them

we will for awhile leave them undisturbed feeling assured that sunshine smiles upon them and that peace as gentle and as sweet as ever came to the lot of man abides in their modest dwelling

leonard c howell after leaving charleston and making a brief stay in the north left again for the south and when mr gordon and his bride were fairly settled in their work in brooklyn he was preparing to enter into business in middle georgia as the representative of an extensive banking house in new york

as the industries of the south were just beginning to revive and as there was great demand for fabrics and provisions all through the land in consequence of the destruction and exhaustion of the war the opportunities for trading were great the cotton fields were again bringing forth their snowy harvests and as the price of the staple was high there was a large amount of money coming into the south although its stay in that section was necessarily brief it came from new york and the east in return for cotton and went almost immediately to the west for bacon corn and mules still the merchants warehousemen and brokers managed to draw off from the general current as it swept by them important side streams which left their valuable deposits of cash in their coffers while the poor planter came out at the end of the year with barely enough to pay the taxes above his necessary expenses for corn bacon mules and labor and was compelled to get advances at killing rates to enable him to pitch his crop for the coming year the merchants warehousemen and brokers had fared so well generally that they were able to accommodate the farmer to all the money that he might need at two and a half per cent a month and good security delightful condition indeed  when the men who owned the land and made the crops were thus bound like groveling captives to the chariot wheels of their financiers the overthrow of their armies in the field had left them free but they had fallen into an economic serfdom from which there seemed but little hope of early escape

into this volume of trade with plenty of capital and endowed with natural shrewdness leonard c howell entered he had received a good practical business education and his experience among men had taught him how to succeed he was neither sensitive nor sentimental he had been given a liberal opportunity and it was his intention while serving his employers faithfully also to make something for himself what little money he had was invested along with that of the firm and all was invested in such a way as to wring from the producers the lions share of georgias one great crop of course he prospered he was strictly sober honest and industrious and was bending all his energies to the one end he was a good citizen however and was not devoid of benevolence and good feeling

as the time wore on and wealth and influence came he became not only more indifferent upon the subject of religion but actually more hostile to the church and more uncharitable in his thoughts toward christians generally yet all the while cherishing the love of hortense and now confidently expecting to have her as his wife does he anticipate the destruction of her happiness in the consummation of his own  does he think to win her from her religion  or is it his purpose to be tolerant and charitable toward her well we shall see leonard believed ill morality and in benevolence became a friend of the people an ardent advocate of popular liberty and popular education but he was drifting in sentiment far away from orthodox views even upon the subject of marriage he was becoming radical the vision of hortense vanross still lived in his mind and heart and his love for her had not abated but he had begun to question the propriety of a marriage for life

the bond of love he would place above the bond of matrimony and deceived by such reasoning his mind had started toward those shoals of idealism upon which many precious lives have been wrecked

although he had not received the cordial approval of the family as the suitor of hortense yet the engagement between the two was a living fact and he was now demanding the fixing of the day lavinia was already happily married and settled a daughterinlaw had taken her place in the household and another son had set up a home for himself in another part of the city only hortense the eldest and john c the youngest of the family remained unmarried and hortense was engagedâ engaged although a dread apprehension seemed to cast its depressing shade over the thought of the prospective marriage

the matter still lingered before her somewhat in the form of a question and was still debated within with great earnestness

true her heart had once and again decided but doubt and even fears beset her

mrs vanross counseled delay and hoped for the best but nevertheless she saw that the issue was closing she must yield and adapt herself to the situation and she prepared in all sincerity to do so she withdrew all objections which had really never been expressed and the day of marriage was finally settled she still continued to look forward to the event with a sad heart however not only because she was so reluctant to part with her companiondaughter as hortense had long been but because she feared for her daughters future

she had not thought it wise to interpose authority in the matter and now as she regarded her own lifeday as wellnigh spent she quietly bowed to what seemed inevitable she had no fault to find with the manners morals or prospects of mr

howell he was a gentleman and he had already provided a comfortable home for her daughter in the south  but she feared his religious indifference would develop into hostility and that his prejudices would render him blind even to the sincere piety of hortense

the day arrived and the wedding took place it was entirely businesslike on mr howells part and he was soon away with his bride there was love real genuine love in the marriage hortense had loved deeply and long and her love had grown with each succeeding month despite the dark clouds that had gathered around it it was a pure sweet undying affection which the  many waters  hitherto had not shaken and which the many waters

yet to come would not be able to quench

leonard had loved ardently until the question of acceptance had been settled then the ardor of his affection had somewhat abated and he earnestly addressed himself to the practical requirements of the situation he loved hortense as he received her as his bride but he looked upon her now too much as his acquisition

she was his companion to comfort and delight him rather than that he should be hers to comfort and delight her he had made all preparations for her happiness but the end in view seemed to be that thereby he might be the more happy the fact was that leonard in pursuing his course of moneymaking had developed out of proportion his selfish instincts and these were already beginning to poison that rich and pure love which once drew him so sweetly toward the noble woman who now stood by his side as his wife

the leavetaking was not pleasant the mother lingered long in tears over her departing daughter and only surrendered her at the call of stern necessity giving her all counsel and encouragement noble pious hortense  thou art indeed entering the deep valley of trial concerning which all these sad incidents are prognostications and thy course henceforth is to be one of increasing cloudiness thy pathway is to be bestrewn with thorns and thou shalt walk alone for years through tribulations deep until the light streaming from the golden gate shall fall upon thee and thou shalt hear the heavenly  wel the corn of wheat fell into the ground and perished but the stalk that sprang from it bore its seven full ears to the harvest the great day will tell thee that thy suffering was not in vain

mrs howell found herself quite elegantly situated in her new home in the charming inland city of macon the city itself with its broad streets and many spacious and beautiful residences all untouched by the ravages of the war presented a contrast to siegeworn charleston while its grand embankment of surrounding hills covered with grass and timber stood out in sharper contrast to the low and marshy surroundings of the latter city hortense was delightfully impressed with her new home and with the cordial manners of the people decidedly less sentimental and perhaps less cultured than the folks of charleston they were nevertheless none the less agreeable there was a heartiness a robustness in their manners appearing at times a little abrupt but all was tempered with a genuine friendliness of feeling and a reigning desire to make the stranger at home

the social position into which mrs

howell was welcomed was all that she could desire not only was she accorded her proper place and sphere but she won to herself friends whose hearts joined with hers in loving sympathy and with whom she was solicited to cooperate in the many womanly undertakings of the community

mr howell was delighted with the success of his wife from a social standpoint and so far peace reigned over their lives and love dwelt in their elegant abode the threatening clouds seemed to have passed away and the clear sunlight of happiness within and prosperity without shone upon them occasional visits were interchanged between them and the family at charleston and the mistrust seemed gradually wearing away yet all this time hortense could not freely give herself up to be happy she always feared that the happiness of their home was somewhat insecure and there was always a corner of unrest in her heart no matter how bright the day

the years rolled on and a daughter and a son were added to the household and with their advent came the increasing burden of concern to the mother these little ones opened the way for the first approach of the portentous cloud that had so long forced its somber shade across the soft spirit of the gentle hortense it was with respect to them that the fathers indifference to religion began to manifest itself in a threatening way he not only spoke lightly of having them baptized in the christian faith but finally refused to take part in the ceremony he did not positively object to the mothers having them christened in the church of which she was a member but he objected quite positively to being a party to the transaction he who had stood by the side of his wife before the christian minister when their lives were to be finally united ungallantly declined to do more than accompany his wife on the occasion of presenting their children to god by baptism here was the christian wife and mothers first great cross

how should she act should she hold back from what she regarded as a christian duty or should she present herself apart from her husband and thus take the first step which looked like putting asunder what god had joined together  the matter was finally compromised by mr howells consenting to accompany her to the church and stand with her in the ceremony but to take no part by word or act which could be construed into an acquiescence in his wifes belief

mr howell had become a convert to the watercure had progressed quite rapidly toward the doctrine of freelove and was beginning to adopt a kind of substitute for religion he still maintained the confidence of his wife who firmly believed him pure and honest and who was disposed to yield to his views to some extent he began to talk more of love as the controlling principle of life and to draw sharp distinctions between the freedom of love and the bondage of society if said he mankind could lift their eyes and look upon love and its relations to life as the child of god instead of seeing only lust which with the majority now crowds love aside then would they be able to consider this matter in its true light love needs no bonds it will take care of itself

these views so lofty for a time completely captivated hortense who saw only the outside and she too began to imbibe somewhat liberal  sentiments crediting her improved views to the teaching of leonard whom she said she knew  to be one of the purest men living she did not see the inside movement of the enemy as he was gradually undermining the foundations of their home and opening the way to irretrievable disaster before the flood tide of evil came upon this young and happy household however another sad event swept over the vanross family and left its weight of woe upon the weakening faith and hope of hortense it will make this part of my story entirely too sad to do little more than mention it

mrs vanross the mother of this interesting family and the center of unity of the pious household the priestess and exemplar at the altar of their devotion sickened and died sons and daughters sousinlaw and daughtersinlaw with graudsons and granddaughters and scores of relatives and friends felt the loss caused by her departure the lovely wife and ideal mother beautiful even in her old age when gray hairs and wrinkles and feebleness had marked her for the tomb beautiful ay sacredly beautiful when dying while the light of the world to come seemed to bathe her countenance with a balm of glory

indeed it might almost be said of her that she did not die at all but having finished her work she fell asleep lulled to her final rest by angelic songs and enveloped with the curtains of eternal peace

tears  tears measureless tears 

grief grief inconsolable grief  such was the outburst that followed this incomparable loss stalwart sons and matronly daughters follow her ascending spirit as did the eyes of elisha the ascending form of his master elijah  and they all involuntarily express the sense of their loss in a sentence of childhood that formed itself in their hearts and threw itself out in tones of deepest grief mother is gone

yes it was too true the charmed central figure that had so long held all the separate parts of that happy circle in place was gone the sadness that followed was not unmixed with comfort and even joy

glorious had been the life and triumphant the death of the woman unknown to fame or story but of whom the world below was no longer worthy the family circle that had been kept in form because of her influence could not subsist materially upon her memory it was broken never to be reunited other circles were forming from other centers to take the place of the superior circle which had transferred its center from the material to the spiritual world a sweet and happy home had faded  for what of home is left when mother is gone  well a mothers work was done and a home had departed but all was not gone the old building was there with its precious memories and the inspirations of a holy life remain when the queenly spirit that once presided in that modest residence passed away there was no more earthly home for living sons and daughters their home ascended on high with their model mother but then these sons and daughters had become also homemakers and the one christian home had multiplied itself into five the character and heart of this good woman have since exerted their influence in five houses upon five groups of interesting children some of whom have already grown up we trust to give those chaste and holy principles and that rich and refining christian influence a still wider place in the generations to come

mrs vanross had passed to her rest reverend thomas gordon with his affectionate wife and interesting family had long been living in brooklyn mr howell had prospered fairly in macon and was now enjoying leisure no pen can paint the loss which hortense experienced in the death of the mother who had been her exemplar companion and confidant her life was henceforth to be a rapid course along the declivity leading toward a darker vale leonard maintained for some time a merely negative position upon the subject of christianity regarding its doctrines as devoid of importance and its rules of conduct as of no authority but from the date of the christening of the children on which occasion a temporary compromise had been made a spirit of hostility had manifested itself in his conduct and he had entered upon that course which ultimately banished the sunshine of peace from his home

to understand the aspect which the positive character of leonard assumed as leisure came to him it will be necessary to recall our earlier acquaintance with him and take a second look upon him as a young man we must not forget the emotion the enthusiasm the ardor that we saw in him as a youth and a lover he had a buoyant and hopeful nature full of the rich elan which belongs to good blood fostered by plenty of outdoor exercise

when he entered upon his business life he simply put this part of his nature under bonds as it were and developed the practical and withal selfish principles of his constitution somewhat to excess it was this unequal and very rapid development of the underworld of his being that corrupted the stream of his love for hortense even before their marriage and that subsequently robbed their home of the pure fountain of happiness which it should have possessed

now that the struggle for wealth or at least for competency was over and his business so arranged that his wants were amply supplied and he began to free his hands and his thoughts from the hitherto tireless pursuit of fortune his original nature once more asserted itself and all his sentimentalism returned his soul now reached out to grasp something positive

the question that hortense had put to him years ago returned and demanded its answer denying the religion of his wife he had now come to the necessity of substituting some form of belief of his own it was incumbent upon him to give a positive answer to himself and to the world he could no longer live on negatives

when this emotional and sentimental nature put forth its second manifestation at this matured period of his life leonard was a different man from what he had been in his early days he had seen much and experienced much  and his mind had become unconsciously warped a frank and generous nature under the domination of the single desire to gain in business had become sordid and selfish and when these best elements fettered by ironclad habits of thought attempted to reassert themselves the success was but meager chafing within their limits like caged eagles they grew to be shockingly sensual a brilliant intellect became at first the seducer and later the slave of a debased and corrupt heart

let us return to the dwelling of mr

howell in macon georgia it was the early part of october â the most delightful month of the whole year in that vicinity the day was done and mr

howell was seated with his wife and one visitor in their spacious parlor the planting season was also ended and a good crop of cotton was maturing in the fields bringing to mr howells coffers its annual returns of substantial profits with condition easy and good health it was an apt time for the very brightest angel of the inner courts of his nature to appear

the visitor also was the right person to invite forth his best and purest thoughts for the gentleman who joined their circle was the reverend dr dan forth the pastor of his wifes church a man of most agreeable manners and unlike many other ministers neither pugnacious nor affected  neither fond of controversy for its own sake nor for the bootless victory it might afford he was devoted to his one work was companionable and natural mr

howell had grown to respect him not only upon hortenses account but because of what he had discovered in the man we may say that mr howell and mr danforth were real friends hence in this circle on this quiet and peaceful evening in the presence of his wife and his friend the minister mr howell could hardly avoid the subject upon which the two others would naturally converse in some form

without any premeditation he found himself drawn into a religious discussion and was soon defining and defending his position

some people said he even think me an infidel and call me one but they are much mistaken i was out viewing the heavens only a short while ago and i could not help saying what a beautiful night

and i reflected upon the grandeur and mysteriousness of the works which prove the existence of a god but the stronger the proofs i receive of his greatness the more strongly do i feel how vain we are to dare to believe that he has a personal superintendence over our affairs and yet if i could believe that even i was of some use to the creator it would be a great comfort to me

mr danforth knew how to answer this readily so far as the logic of his friends position was concerned  but he cared much more for his friends good feelings than for any temporary success to be won in dispute he wished to win mr howell to the side of truth and in his reply was cautious lest any word he should utter might drive him further away he believed the expressions to which he had listened had been uttered in all sincerity so even leonards wife believed at the time but it is doubtful if leonard was more than half sincereâin his last remark especially and if he desired even at that time to have anything whatever to do with a god whose character was against sin and uncleanness

after a moments reflection mr danforth replied  there is much in nature viewed either by night or by day to tell us of god i dont know but the beautiful night scenes are the more impressive one of davids sweetest psalms describes a night scene and its effects upon him in words which exactly comport in meaning with what you have just said when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him  and the son of man that thou visitest him

 yes replied mr howell that is the way i look at it to my mind it is exalting man beyond his true sphere and belittling god to represent him as taking interest in all our petty affairs he has placed all things under wise just and good laws and leaves them to work out their destinies

i think so too i think the laws under which all things are placed are the best possible if you please and that their tendency is to produce the greatest good to the greatest number these laws do credit to the wisdom justice and love of the lawgiver

mrs howell who had thus far been a listener only and was not a little puzzled at the drift the argument seemed to he taking now spoke up with considerable earnestness indeed it often seems to me that so many tilings happen for which l can see no reason that i am sometimes inclined to think that the jaws forget their duty i find more comfort i believe in thinking of god as our father who is ready to come to our aid despite the laws than i do in the cold aspect of law i do not care to see god only as a lawgiver

well we are permitted to look upon the divine being both as a wise lawgiver and as a tender and loving father replied mr danforth  he is a god of love indeed he is love so that we may feel sure that his laws are perfect

 ay echoed mr howell  you have struck the point now exactly god is love and love is god wherever love is there is god everywhere i regard love as the gift of god at leastâa child of god it is divine i mean real love not anything less it is that which unites all other feelings into one grand passion it is a harmony from god himself

it was evident from the readiness with which leonard uttered these words as well as from the warmth with which he spoke that he was entirely upon familiar ground and upon a phase of the subject that was specially inviting to him already he was constructing a religious social and moral creed to suit his rapidly deteriorating nature already the power of hortense to hold him up to his highest and best standard had been partially subverted already others were beginning to occupy the throne with her and he was worshipping at more than one altar who that has read the story of henry viii trimming his creed and training his conscience to favor his infatuation with anne boleyn could not see that leonard c howells enthusiasm for his creed did not spring entirely from abstract or spiritual considerations he had carefully concealed from hortense every unsightly feature of his professed belief and had so covered it with the flowing robes of wellchosen words that it appeared to her somewhat as an angel of light  and she was confused if not deceived her love for and fidelity to her husband made her wish to believe as he did  and she was halfinclined to accept his creed as an advance from what she had begun to allow herself to feel were the unnecessarily narrow views of the past days hence when she listened to his smooth and familiar utterances and saw the fire of his nature kindle as he spoke she was halfpleased and waited anxiously for her ministers reply

said mr danforth  love has no independent existence it is an intensely personal attribute and takes its character from the being whence it emanates it is like the stream unable to rise above its fountain  and like it also in being unable to be better than its fountain love too is also under law some things a man may love and be happy other things he may love and be miserable

there is a love that ennobles purifies and elevates  and there is a love that degrades and destroys chastened love love subject to reason and conscience is the proudest ornament of human character the only foundation for that purest and happiest place on earthâhome i agree with you in your eulogium of love but i must be allowed to add the love must be of the right kind and between the proper persons

ay there it is replied mr howell somewhat petulantly  we do not tie or bind our benevolence our charity our philanthropy our friendship or any other of our attributes but love the highest of them all must be fettered why so 

permit me to ask

you do not lock up the newspaper you received yesterday nor your kitchen furniture nor even the costly carpet and furniture of this beautiful room they are all valuable why do you lock up your gold the most valuable of all  is it not that thieves and robbers may not get to it for reasons somewhat similar but a thousandfold higher and stronger the love that comes to us and the love that goes out from us should be guarded the man who employs his money without care or control may come to penury and want the man who thus employs what you are pleased to call the  highest and holiest attribute of his soul will come to ruin

i am of the opinion replied leonard now fairly disclosing his views to the minister that it is not love which darkens homes it is rather our selfishness and monopolizing spirit which claims more than its due love is the one gift of god which always brightens if as i said we could regard love rightly then there would be great rejoicing by onlookers at every new birth of love as there really is in our hearts until we feel the shadow of jealousy darkening its brightness

happily for hortense she saw nothing of the purport of this argument nor of the real struggle which was going on in her husbands mind and which was rapidly hastening to a settlement against god and right and her there was on her part confusion and foreboding but her purity her loyalty and love had thoroughly guarded her from the awful truth which was one day to break upon her nor did mr dan forth read all that was going on within that rapidly blackening heart mr howells life thus far appeared in fact like some fruit which only ripens to rot had the theory produced the man  or had the man produced the theory both they were acting and reacting the one upon the other

let us once more return to our starting point to god and his relation to us

evidently you grant that he is entitled to our homage replied mr danforth and that the best love of our hearts is due him and that in cultivating respect for his laws and reverence for his character we are pursuing our highest good we cannot go wrong in loving god and loving our neighbor love is the fulfilling of the law and all the commandments are summed up in loving god to the extent of our ability and in loving our neighbor as we love ourselves

i accept that as a general principle

we should have respect for the divine laws and reverence for the divine character as we see it exhibited in the work of creation around us and we should be governed by kind even brotherly feeling generally but this does not touch the main question or questions upon which i presume we differ replied mr howell  you of course look upon the bible and christianity in one light and i in quite another you regard the bible as inspired and christianity as the only true religion i do not i believe the bible inspired in the same sense that shakespeares and emersons and scores of other mens writings were inspired it is a great book containing much that is beautiful and much that is valuable and when it shall have become freed from the chains of orthodoxy men will learn to prize it much more than they do now the christian religion i believe to be true as i believe other religions are true true in part as a form and expression religion is an essential of our nature and its real seat is in the heart its best exponents are the influences of nature and the responding impulses arising within

to this still bolder exhibition of his views mr danforth thought it proper to make an earnest reply he did not for a moment attempt to defend the inspiration of the bible for he at once saw that this would give his friendly opponent the opportunity to drift further from the core of the subject and also to employ an array of arguments already prepared the answering of which would result in mere waste of lime he chose to challenge the two points upon which mr howell placed the entire support of his whole fabric of religion to wit the voice light or influence of nature and the light within whether called reason conscience or heart

mr howell had flattered himself that these were new ideas to the minister when as a matter of fact mr danforth had studied them in all possible forms and given due consideration to every vestige of their importance in his seminary days while studying his  hooker and following his syllabus with ease he showed the insufficiency of these lights either singly or jointly to support an active religion and that the question was not between revealed religion and natural religion but between revealed religion and no religion such it was in the nature of the case and such it was in the history of the world

so clear so earnest and loving were his method and manner that mr howell was manifestly impressed and saw no way of escaping to his favorite branch of the subject by anything like a direct movement he therefore proposed to yield in some measure the points he had maintained thus granting the importance of the religious writings and admitting the superiority of the christian scriptures

mr howells real position was about this the scriptures and the churches stand in the way of what i conceive to be the plan of life which will afford me most pleasure the plan of life to which i am attracted by uncontrollable desire if they are right i am wrong fatally wrong

when at an earlier period of his life he discussed the subject with the vanross family he had only a transient interest in the matter he had imbibed the views of others but they rested quite lightly upon his manly and generous nature he lived more in the hopes of securing the bride of his choice than in the realms of religious controversy he was not then and indeed never was afterward at all fitted for abstract thinking or reasoning he dwelt always in the actual concrete world his mind was practical and acute and was kept always in close contact with living realities hence the first religious discussion upon which we saw him enter was in the presence and full appreciation of his intended bride and in the light of a happy worldly future in which there was no thought of sin all the surroundings at that time were such as almost to drive him to that form of religion whose home is always with the pure in heart

the interregnum came and leonard became a whole man in business living only in that hard and narrow world scarcely allowing hie mind to arise above it or wander from it he permitted occasional sallies into the field of popular benevolence so far as to give bis support to public education and other public measures but these subjects were generally contemplated by him through the fieldglasses of business

when the interregnum had passed and the question of religion had recurred it was now his own question it was within his heart his mind and his conscience it was a concrete question it was to be settled in the presence of wife and children who had upon him claims which he could not ignore and in the presence of a future filled with sin the differences in mental and moral state and above all the differences in purpose and heart had much more to do with mr howells changed maimer in discussing this subject than any abstract consideration of the question itself

he had not learned more but he had sunk lower he preached purity and love he advocated freedom of intercourse among friends he extolled virtue he condemned the tyranny of custom and conventionalism he expatiated on a higher form of friendly attraction which should exist between persons of opposite sex a feeling so far above the corrupt and debased feeling which usually prevailed that impurity could not exist in its presence he described a possible state of personal purity in which persons might mix in delightful freedom enjoying and expressing by word and caress the sincerest affection and yet there would be no evil he was a dreamer of eden delights between men women and children surrounded by love purity and peace this he preached to hortense

this he preached to his household and this he claimed to practice himself and urged upon his wife to practice this was the angel of light into which the filthiest doctrine ever invented by man was transformed and which came so near deceiving one of gods  elect the pious and ever faithful hortense

how nearly she was deceived is shown by one of her confidential letters written to her sister lavinia about this period

she says in defense of her husband and in explanation of her views a subject upon which both mr gordon and lavinia were at this time specially exercised   leonard fully and earnestly believes and practices upon that belief that quite free exchange of relations between two congenial persons of opposite sex is extremely beneficial mentally and physically to both that the soft quiet harmless and enduring warmth and delight of a pure affection will spring up in which love becomes the master passion and bids all others to stand at bay he believes that in all mankind those are the highest natures who have met with temptations and conquered he has not much respect for innocence but the highest veneration for virtue

this was leonard c howells picture as painted by his wife in strictest confidence to her own sister up to this hour he enjoyed the fullest faith and love of that christian woman whose mind and heart he was seeking to corrupt by most pernicious theories and whose jealousy he was laboring to prevent and disarm by a skill that seemed almost diabolical leonard c howell was not sincere his theory was a mere ruse a systematic work of strategy by which he proposed to hedge himself in from the gaze of mankind to some extent and from the eyes of his noble wife in particular leonard feared that pure woman he could brave the scorn or sneers of the world if he had to but he could not endure the soft tender loving eyes of her who had given herself to him for life coming to him as pure as she came from her infant cradle and having no thought but to be true to the spirit of the words until death do us part corrupt her he could not blindfold and deceive her he must to this double purpose of corruption and deception he consecrated the astonishing energy of his fertile intellect

the winter passed away with no marked change in the howell family so well was leonard acting his part beautiful spring arrived and mrs howell and the children went once more in peace to attend the easter services it was their last peaceful easter ere another came the cloud had hurst and the torrents of woe were pouring in upon them as a memento of this easter on returning from the service hortense wrote the following spiritual lines tis easter morn  and tender eyes bedewed with tears of love and deepest sympathy are raised in praise of our dear lord while trust and faith and hope profound beam forth on this sweet morn to testify that though the ages pass his work doth still go on

the fond heart thrills as with an agony of pain his sufferings are recalled and once again the faithful soul asserts its fealty to its risen lord

thus flowers and songs and tuneful bolls are made to evidence our thought of what this morn has been to us of what christs death hath wrought

yet can we serve alone with all this passion of an earthly adoration

these symbols are but vain and mocking to this worth if in our daily lives we fail to imitate his work

then let our hands stretch forth to lift the erring soul whose path beset by dire temptation trips his feet let tender words of confidence and hope heal up the wound inflicted by the worlds cold scorn

let the sweet smiles of charity and love

beam from our eyes oer all who trembling fail to walk the narrow path 

thus shall we praise our risen lord

in this highly spiritual poem unchained by style or rule there breathes a fervent loyal devotion to christ and his cause which up to this hour had not been overthrown by the most subtle and dangerous assaults the spirit of a broad charity for the erring sympathy for those who are suffering from the worlds cold scorn and love and tenderness for those who fail to walk in the narrow wayânot who have strayed from but who fail to walk in the narrow wayâalso manifests itself freely the poem tells of a christian faith and christian love and shows a pure soul drawing supplies of strength from contact with the allloving allsaving christ

had leonard been able to walk with his wife on the same highway of faith their happiness would have been complete

unfortunately bad books and worse companions uniting with his own unevenly developed moral nature had driven him from the path of peace he wandered in a philosophy which he had accepted as religion and which had driven all love for the church and all regard for the sabbath from his breast while hortense was delighting and strengthening her soul with the rich thoughts of easter he was exciting and stimulating thoughts of an opposite character as he met with other wild spirits in discussion upon such delectable themes as freedom radicalism and progress

aside from what went on away from home under the guise of friendship leonards associations brought to the house and into the presence of hortense persons whose manners and spirit became very objectionable to her chaste and sensitive nature the freedom which she saw on occasions existing between her husband and some of the female visitors was to her decidedly irritating and although she tried hard to conceal from herself the approaching revelation and sought to take refuge in selfaccusations of narrowness and jealousy yet gradually and relentlessly and at length overpoweringly came the conviction to her that her husbands heart was no longer hers the angel of light which she had forced herself to see in leonards philosophy was now unrobed and she saw a form that was of the earth earthy she was supplanted

once we saw leonard thoughtfully looking upon hortense as her inward pious character shone out to his view almost startled and asking himself could he love her in spite of her religion his indecision however lasted scarcely long enough for him to formulate the question in his own mind her rich womanhood quenched the thought as soon as its truant scintillations told of its existence but now the drama presents a reverse and hortense stands swayed between a love that knows not its own depths and the possibilities of a hatred as deadly as the possibilities of her nature

her black hair and flashing eyes her whole form and manner told of her power to hate and avenge but happily for her for her children and for leonard the panther within had long been locked in chains and the keys were with the angels true to that charity which sang itself in that easter poem she continued to love and pity the one being who had wronged her most she sacredly guarded his good name and shielded his children from the knowledge of his ways it was a prodigious workâtoo great for any woman

hortense was manifesting a greatness that eclipsed to darkness that of the crowned isabellas and elizabeths of fame and story

she was burning at the stake not with outward and material fire but with the exquisite torture of secret spiritual agony

two years went on leonard in sinning

two yearsâlong dreadful horrible years âwent on hortense in dying jealousy says solomon is the rage of a man jealousy is devouring flames to a woman

slowly but steadily burning by night and by day this inextinguishable fire fed by the sins of an erring husband continued to engulf in its pitiless flames the body and soul of the helpless victim who was passing through it bound as with cords of iron to this altar of sacrifice

the atmosphere around leonard may have had something to do with awakening the beast that was within him still it must be said he never became a southerner but confined himself quite closely to the new england colony dwelling in the neighborhood and to the few southerners of kindred sentiments who associated with them

among these were to be found the few spirits who had advanced beyond all forms of orthodoxy and who spent their time seeking after the truth in this circle he fed his soul with all the untried vagaries that active brains could bring forth and pushed to excess his theories respecting marriage and the relation of the sexes supporting his views by the declaration that to the pure all things are pure he constantly pleaded for an enlargedâa more developed love claiming that the more that is given out the happier will he the giver and the richer the world in receiving

no great naturesaid he should be expected to confine itself to one small love

this theory he held for both sexes proclaiming that all persons even in wedded life should be perfectly free to give and receive love taking care all the time to guard his theory from the least suspicion of physical impropriety

hortense who had been partly charmed with the beautiful idealistic pictures of a lovecharmed world which leonard drew in which people of both sexes and all ages who would come up to the doctrine should be bound together in happy concord through the commerce of a pure affection at length saw the sham dissipated and was now realizing the sad truth that as two kings cannot reign on one throne so two women cannot reign in one heart

the heart that had professed itself large enough for the many was fast becoming too small for her to find in it a lodgingplace of any sort she felt herself banished from it as the dove from the ark and as she wandered about in thought over the wide earth finding no restingplace for the sole of her foot bruised in spirit and bleeding at heart she threw her weary wings against leonards breast only to find it closed there was not room for two and the usurper was within after a few vain efforts hortense turned away and abandoned herself to her living death

chastened gentle and sweet of spirit she had always given out much of her heart to her children but was also much dependent upon her husbands favor his confidence respect and love had been her life in a large degree as she turned from this support to confront the fires in which she read her fate she said the caresses of love have been my life from infancy

by my mother my sister and my brothers i have been nourished on tenderness

since my marriage my husband has yielded me his love now all is gone i cannot unburden my heart to any one i cannot live without my husbands love no longer loved by him for whom i have given all oh god let me die my heart is dried up i have no more to give even for his children let me die

mrs howell however concealed her grief locking the fire within her bosom only now and then allowing it to break forth in her hours of solitude her two children now in their teens willie and mary became her constant and only companions  while leonard happy in the new love for which he had prepared his heart by treacherous philosophy seemed not to know of his poor wifes pain had his doctrine then succeeded  thought he as he passed on from day today receiving no word of reproach from the saint by his side who was preparing for heaven he knew nothing of  the powers of the world to come which had descended and clothed the woman with an invincible patience and which were supporting her faith even amid the cruel fires which he kept so fiercely burning all around her

but my pen refuses to follow either the wicked steps of leonard or the thorny path trodden by poor mrs howell let us pass by the greater part of these two years of sinning by the one and of suffering by the other and take up the story nearer its crisis

flesh and blood although divinely supported cannot endure everything the months of sorrow told upon hortense

her flesh departed her strength failed her shoulders were stooped her hair turned gray her steps began to falter her eyes became too brilliant for continued stay and her whole face and manners indicated that the end was coming leonard had at length begun to notice it and day by day the dark fact came nearer to him and confronted and reproached him but he resisted it with the firmness of desperation

ah leonard thou hast sown to the wind  ay worse than that thou hast sown to the wind and flesh of the one thou shalt reap corruption and of the other death the tables are turning

poor hortense has suffered in quiet

nature was long and stubborn in dying but nature is dead with her now her sufferings are all over and her soul is peaceful the long weary battle is fought and the victory won the flesh the world satan and self with her are dead and she is resting ay hiding now in the secret of his presence who keeps we know not how ah leonard she is not thine now

once she was but when she came to thy heart so sad so weary after her long flight in quest of an earthly lodging dost thou remember leonard how her tired dewdripped wings rapped against the casements of the windows of thy breast and thou bewitched by sinful delights didst not admit her dost thou remember it leonard  then it was thou sentest her away she is not thine now she has passed through the fires and is purified

she is gods and awaits only the robe and the crown she is waiting leonard waiting for thee fear her not leonard though her form is holiness in the fear of the lord her heart is filled with that love which thou hast sought to counterfeit by a love that was earthly sensual devilish

hortense is no longer thine

thus spoke a voice to leonards conscience one morning as he lay in bed halfawake startling him to the very core of his being the voice seemed familiar and notwithstanding the solemn and somewhat strange form of expression the impression at first vague became more distinct as he fully awoke the message that had come to him was so clear so thrilling that the whole world was transformed to him in an instant the voice the solemn manner the form that dimly outlined itself to his visionâall bespoke the preternatural appearance of the departed mrs vanross the mother of his dying wife

oh the harrowing thoughts that rushed in upon his soul the levees were overthrown and the whole plain of bis sinful heart was inundated with grief and remorse

as the morning advanced he went into his wifes room for she was now bedfast and having calmed himself greeted her with his usual   goodmorning tonsy how are you this morning

but he was not prepared for the answer that came from the sick woman

oh leonard said she quite vivaciously i am well well this morning mamma came to see me last night in my dreams and oh leonard she looked so sweet so angelic and so heavenly and kissed me so lovingly that i am well this morning

i have not an ache nor a pain a grief nor a sorrow all all are gone my pains my tears my sorrows are all gone yes i am well this morning

leonard could stand no more attempting to reply he could only say  ma came to me also and sank into a chair by his wifes bedside and there burying his face in the bedclothes near his wifes pillow wept aloud oh how he lashed himself and how his awakened conscience stripped his heart bare to the blows he had partially tired of his newfound idol and she had departed the hour of reaction or for a deeper plunge into sin was at hand had the allmerciful god in his providence crossed his path at this opportune moment to save him or was the accumulation of outward and inward sorrows that were beginning to pour their flood into his soul destined to bury him in irretrievable ruin

as soon as leonard could command words he attempted to make a full confession of his wrongsâpainting himself in true colors he told the story of his duplicity and of his treachery of his deceitful philosophy and of his wicked sinning but ere he had more than outlined it hortense replied  my dear husband you need not tell me i know it all and have known it all along the pain has ceased now the iron doesnt hurt my heart any more all that could feel the smart your action was causing has passed away my saviour has kept me and i am at peace my work is done and my sufferings are ended this was gods way it seemed strange and hard to me months ago but i see it was all right the journey is over now and i am only waiting

leonard had never heard his wife talk in that strain before and the beautiful light that seemed to shine from her countenance as well as the calm confidence of her tones alarmed him he was awed by what he saw and heard once more the inner spiritual character of the wife of whom he saw that he had never been worthy shone out with superior effulgence

again he saw her as she stood in her youth and beauty before him holding up as he attempted to reason or ridicule the standard of sublime devotion to the faith which saves now lying upon her bach with bodily strength all gone he sees that triumphant faith bearing her up he is awed and he is alarmed he feels that the sad crisis is hurrying on

hortense is dying leonard she has been dying nearly two years art thou her murderer

as soon as possible leonard made his way to the telegraph station and soon thereafter messages were hurrying over the wires to relatives in charleston and to lavinia in brooklyn hortense sick very sick was the burden of all the communications that went forth as leonard went from duty to duty in the early morning this thought was tearing his soul in shreds i have killed her i have killed her

and then halfcrazy with remorse and grief he would exclaim  oh that some one would avenge her death upon me oh that some one would kill me 

now fully awake to all his past misdoings and to the horrible fact of his wifes serious situation leonard hastening back to her bedside broke out with the suppressed lamentation oh hortense you must not die i cannot endure the loss of you you must get well try to wont you his face was bathed in tears and there rested upon it also the conflicting expressions of tenderness and of love of sorrow and of guilt as he ceased speaking there was a most pitiful beseeching look in his eyes as he gazed fully into the face of his sick wife

the reply of hortense was calm and sweet  leonard do not grieve the storms are all over with me there is no hope of return i shall never retrace my steps i am nearing the banks of the jordan  i hear the noise of wings  said she quoting from a familiar hymn

then it was that leonard poured out his soul in confession in grief and in remorse as he paced back and forth in the room alone with his wife and at last turning to her he said hortense will you forgive me for my great sin against god myself and you

he stopped and waited for a reply

hortense with fervor answered i forgive even as i am forgiven as i stand before my god fully absolved so have i released every living person yes leonard all is forgiven

let me pass over what immediately followed only to record this last solemn conversation of the dying wife and mother with her erring but now repentant husband

leonard said she our children are baptized in the christian faith i solemnly promised to rear them in accordance with the beliefs and practices of the church i have done the best i could thus far leonard to bring them up christians and i feel sure my work has not been unsuccessful they are christian children to some extent but the work of training is not done yet i can no longer be with them to carry out the obligations i assumed for them before the lord in his church who leonard will finish my work as she said this she fixed on leonard a look of earnest entreaty and awaited his answer

leonard continued to pace the floor in silence for some time a deep and fierce struggle was going on within between his pride bis love and his moral sense should he throw overboard all that cargo of theories he had so long been carrying and admit himself to have been deceived by his own subtle reasonings he had given up his sins why not jettison the cargo of pestiferous theories which had nourished and defended them in part his theories never had been sufficient to entirely cover his conduct stretch the covering as he would it was not sufficient to cloak all his misdoings his theory stopped short at a line drawn between love and lust but his practice confounded these two passions and ignored the limitation of his philosophy

why not discard the theory as being sufficient neither to produce a good life nor to defend a bad one  somewhat in this line ran leonards thoughts as he walked up and down his sick wifes bedroom

at length he stopped his face showed great agitation and his whole frame shook and in a voice hushed and choked he said my dear wife i will god helping me take hold of the work where you lay it down and to the best of my ability will carry out the obligations made in the church and which i now assume i will try to walk before our children in your spirit that they may be saved from such a life as mine has been if god will forgive the unchangeable past i will from this hour dear hortense consecrate myself to the carrying out of your life you shall live hortense then with tears streaming down his cheeks he groaned  god be merciful to me a sinner

the pledge was made and peace came to the struggling soul of leonard but the thorn of regret for those years of sin never passed completely away the mind of hortense was now thoroughly at rest

leonard had awakened from his dream and had laid hold upon god he was no longer weak but strong through divine aid she knew that all was well and her pious heart sang  i have anchored my soul in the haven of rest

leonard was not happy how could he be happy in such surroundings but he was saved from evil and his work was before him his one thought was to live for his son and his daughter never before had they appeared so precious in his sight never before had life seemed so awful to him i must put on the garment of the pure christian mother of my children and train them for god and heaven this is my vow before god this my pledge to my dying wifeâmy martyr wifeâi must do it

this was his purpose as defined within himself by himself

the crisis soon came and mrs howell passed quietly away not however until after the arrival of relatives from charleston and new york complying with her own request as well as with the wishes of the family at large her form was carried to charleston and laid to rest by the side of the remains of her departed mother in the old cemetery peacefully she sleeps there now and the secret of her lifes sorrow sleeps with her no member of the family much less any one outside had been permitted to share her confidence

by no word or act of hers had the good name of leonard c howell received the slightest tarnish with all his sinning he was still her husband in the eyes of the world and was the father of her children and with a loyalty that ended only in death she had guarded her familys honor even against her own relatives

gossipping neighbors had had their say  but fortunately their talk had not spread beyond their own locality and the relatives of hortense as they assembled around her open grave to witness the last sad rites had nothing in their hearts to the prejudice of mr howell

after the funeral mr howell returned to macon and as soon as possible put his business in such position that he could safely leave it and then prepared to give up his home in the south the beautiful house in which he had lived with his family and all its surroundings were as so many faithful witnesses against him and he could no longer bear to be near them acting on the suggestion of his brotherinlaw he decided to remove to brooklyn because of the superior educational advantages to be found in that city the duty of caring for his children appeared to him now as it had never before and when mr gordon offered to take them into his home as a part of his own family mr howells feelings were so intense that he felt compelled to decline the brotherly offer he shrank from the thought of turning over the care of these more than halforphans to any one or of even dividing it with others he feared to place so near himself a temptation which might cause him to turn aside from the duty he had imposed upon himself by the most solemn sacrament

under this impulse he established for himself a quiet home in the outskirts of the city furnishing it just as he thought the taste of his wife would have dictated had she been alive and into it wifh his two children by his side he entered with the resolution to lead a life that should bo the just sequel of the life of his departed companion

how weak how awkward how unworthy he felt as he now practically contemplated his work a feeling of inability of shame and of reluctance crept over him

it was evening in full view over the mantel hung the portrait of hortense

leonard was seated by the table musing willie and mary had said their evening prayers and with the hush of sadness that had not left their souls since  mamma went away as they always expressed it had gone to their beds the gas was burning brightly and leonard was wrapped in thought the whole past came up before him from the days of his childhood on his grandfathers farm to the stirring scenes and dangers of warâhis meeting with hortense his marriage his life her suffering her death and again his obligation liaising his eyes he gazed upon her picture as it looked down upon him her looks seemed to purify and strengthen him in that life in that form leonard sees again that power before which his reason and his heart had bowed down in reverence

like jacob of old awaking from his vision he could say surely god has been in my dwelling all these days and i poor blind foolish man knew it not again he solemnly repeated his vow again he declared with great internal emphasis in tones halfaloud hortense you shall live i will accept your work i will carry out your purpose oh that i might receive your spirit

leonard had began life anew and sweet and pleasant were the exchanges of thought and feeling between father and children

their abode became more and more like an ideal home despite the absence of the mother leonards heart was now indeed opening and was giving out real love and receiving love in return his love was now taking its place in obedience to reason and conscience and was enjoying its freedom under law he united with his brotherinlaws church and was daily becoming more active in good works but his life was not yet free from sad regrets

years have passed by and william and mary are grown young people they are of refined and pleasant manners of pure and lofty character of gentle and pious spirit both active members of their uncles church both active supporters of the pastors wife their tenderhearted aunt lavinia in her many enterprises for good

early every spring leonard goes to charleston and spends day after day in the cemetery looking after the grave of his wife and from this mecca he derives renewed inspiration already his heart his love and his work have widened active in sundayschool his attention has been drawn to the fatherless and motherless little ones of the city rapidly he is becoming in heart the father of the orphan  and there is beginning to form in his mind the picture and the purpose of an asylum for those unfortunate ones leonards life is one of work and it has now entered that domain where love is the mainspring of duty he found his ideal of love not in the fleshly sensual world which entrapped his feet through a pernicious philosophy but in that quiet life which was with christ in god having been led there at great cost and within whose sacred precincts he has been trying for years to dwell as vet he saw it and felt its power but had not tasted its thoroughly satisfying joys

it was easter mr howell was seated in his brotherinlaws church his daughter whose voice had received most careful training was in the choir which occupied a small gallery in the rear of the pulpit and in full view of the whole congregation this morning she was to sing her first solo in church the church was handsomely decorated with flowers and entirely filled with worshippers mr gordon was all aglow with his theme and the occasion mr

howell occupied a seat in the pastors pew by the side of mrs gordon the years that had passed had left their marks on all these faces mrs gordon was still beautiful but she had long since ceased to be the lavinia that bewildered leonard howell by her sprightly loveliness in the long ago

she was now the soft and gentle wife and mother the kind and tender helpmeet of a broad and energetic pastor leonard had become a practical philanthropist and christian his face showed benevolence and earnestness but it bore upon it also the unmistakable signs of sadness and regret the service began and every step of its progress was marked with fitness and reality it was no mere performance the sermon was full of thought and feeling and was received by sympathetic hearers

at its conclusion there was a slight rustle and then the organ gave forth a few preliminary notes and mary howell arose to sing

soon her rich clear voice came out rather softly in the opening phrases of a song of christian triumph

 who are these in bright array   she sang with a sweetness that riveted the attention of every one in the house and when after a brief interlude she poured forth her voice the fullness of its strength to render the rapturous answer these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb all were moved by the sweet tones and by the correct interpretation of the opening scenes in the transforming drama which was by her matchless power of song enacting itself in full view then dropping into the purest recitative she went on therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them into living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes as she sang this her eyes wandered away from the people in front and in the galleries and her gaze seemed to seek a restingplace near the ceiling her eyes were glistening her voice was superlatively rich but it did not tremble and she appeared like one completely absorbed she was but a medium through whom the glories of heaven were being revealed to an almost startled audience as she ceased to sing she sank back in her chair and covering her face with her handkerchief softly murmured  mammaâ through tribulations deep god shall wipe away all tears  

leonard c howell had heard the song and had seen the vision he saw the throng in white robes and golden crowns before the throne of god he read their history through tribulations deep

he recognized among them the wife whose name he honored the sorrow and sadness were lifted from his soul for a moment as he saw  god himself wiping the tears from her eyes and felt that her work was still going on
