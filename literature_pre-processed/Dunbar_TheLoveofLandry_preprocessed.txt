love of landry the dunbar paul laurence 
for a time at least the osborne family circle was to be broken up there were only three of them in the big old house in gramercy park john osborne the father and helen and mildred the daughters the mother had died when mildred was less than ten and since then the three had never been separated for long at a time even when they were away for the summer the father managed to join them every week or two if they were near new york or if far away to spend several weeks with them at the end of the season but now mildred who was a slight girl had contracted a cough and the doctor had ordered her away from new york

 there is at present nothing the matter with her lungs said old dr van pelt  nothing except a tendency but a tendency my dear sir is a thing that should always be stopped by all means always stop a tendency

but heavens doctor exclaimed osborne where shall i send the child 

he was usually a very placid old gentleman until something came near one of his doves then he was apt to become nervous and lose his repose

 oh theres the south of france southern california colorado â oh a dozen places but for my part he added shaking his pincenez thoughtfully  i should go to colorado high dry air outofdoor life and in a year or maybe two our young lady comes back blooming and hearty

 but yan pelt man colorado why that seems almost beyond civilisation 

 it is nt but what matter if it were you know im a doctor of the old school although ive kept up with the new and its one of my oldfogy opinions sort of left over as it were that civilisation has always been a foe to good health when our ancestors painted themselves and danced impossible things on the sand who ever heard of weak lungs but now after a season of tripping it in a close room in heavy silks my lady has a cough but its no matter john its no matter its a slight thing pack up the little girl nevertheless and take her away goodmorning goodmorning

so it was decided that to colorado mildred must go but then the quandary confronted the family who would go with her there were many reasons why helen could not leave and the father thought of his business at this juncture they did as they always did and called in council aunt annesley she was the sister of john osbornes deceased wife a widow of fortune and possessed of very positive views she came and the case was laid before her

 hum she mused  to colorado why not to southern france 

 the doctor prefers the former place

 hes an old fogy and i dont see why you have him john

i beg your pardon anna but hes both an old friend and an excellent physician

 oh i mean no harm to your yan pelt he comes of a very excellent old family and i have no doubt does very well for his age the question is merely do you insist upon colorado 

 we do

then the matter simply settles itself without further discussion john you must go with mildred

 but anna â 

 you have worked long enough and hard enough to take a years vacation the business for that length of time can do without your personal supervision how dont interrupt me you know that mildred must have some one of her near and dear ones with her now helen cant go while mr berkeley â that is while matters are as at present in statu quo

helen went furiously red while mildred laughed behind her hand

 i would go myself went on mrs annesley if things were otherwise in fact i should nt mind a trip to france but colorado â way out there ânever 

and so because there was no gainsaying mrs annesleys word this much was settled that john osborne should accompany his younger daughter out west while mrs annesley should take charge of helen and their home

and i do hope my dear mrs annesley added before going  that you ll take good care of yourself out there among those cowboys and catamounts and things it really seems terrible to send you to such a place

 why aunt anna i m going to wear leggings and go deerhunting laughed mildred   and i shall come back wearing a sombrero and a buckskin skirt

 dont joke mildred dont joke its highly improper and im sure you are joking for you could never so disgrace your family as to wear leggings and a buckskin skirt

 dear aunt anna has such an overpowering sense of humour said mildred as the door closed upon their worthy relative

you really shouldnt laugh at her mildred returned helen  you know she has such a good heart and it was so good of her to offer to come here and take charge of the house

 i d rather it were you than i though replied the younger girl id sooner take my chances with catamounts and cowboys

more than either her father or sister mildred osborne retained her good spirits in face of the coming separation she was young she had only turned twenty and she had youths belief in her powers of recuperation not for one moment did she doubt what would be the outcome to her health she saw that the western trip was the inevitable and like a little philosopher accepted it

it was the night before the day of their departure that she stood in the drawingroom looking out on the dreary september streets it was early in the month but a cold rain blew gustily against the pane every now and then a bouncing hansom went by its lamps throwing a silvery glow on the wet streets a moment before mildred had been crying as she and helen talked over the morrows parting but now her cheery mood had reasserted itself and she was drumming on the glass and humming a merry tune to herself suddenly she ceased and pressed her face against the pane with a convulsive motion  look there  she cried  at that poor child trudging along with a bundle through this miserably cold rain

helen came to the window  too bad  she said calmly

 oh why will people send their children out such nights as this 

because theyre poor and have to i suppose

 and we re warm and comfortable here in the house while that poor child is out there stumbling through the rain look she almost fell im going out to her

mildred you must not you he not well and you ll take your death of cold

 oh helen dont stop me i must and i will it is nt right ive never thought about it at all until tonight

as she talked the girl was hastily throwing a cloak about her shoulders against her sisters continued remonstrances she hurried out into the street and after the child the little trudger with the great bundle had gotten some distance beyond the house when mildred went to find her and helen shivering in the doorway saw her when she overtook and stooped to speak to the midget and then watched her lift the childs bundle and turn back toward the house

 impulsive girl she said to herself starting down the steps but just then she saw a hansom which was about passing stop and a gentleman get out he took possession of the bundle placing his umbrella at the disposal of the two helen gasped  arthur heathcote â what will he think 

it did nt seem to matter much what arthur heathcote thought for it was a very merry party that came up the steps of the osborne house mildred was squeezing the hand of the mite and laughing and the young englishman looking decidedly awkward with his bundle smiling down upon them both mediãval bravery very commonly risked death for a womans love but it remained for nineteenthcentury courage to risk ridicule

 surely you re not going to bring her in here how do you do mr heathcote

 why not  this from mildred

 oh why shes so draggly just drop the bundle right here mr heathcote

 the more reason for bringing her in come on little girl

the osborne house was oldfashioned enough to have in its drawingroom the grate of an earlier period of course in winter there was furnace heat and no one shivered about the inadequate open fire as they had done at functions of fifty years before but then it looked cheerful and it showed up the mellow tints of some famous pictures a maclise and a corot among them and so when the nights were chill the fire was duly lit before it tonight the little girl was placed and the wet shawl taken from her head and put out to dry nina the maid held the garment gingerly between her thumb and forefinger and sniffed perceptibly but mildred beamed on the child as she sat blinking her round black eyes at the blaze with her own hands she brought her hot tea and good things to eat and the child halfdazed and wondering looked up into the girls face and took them all in silence save when they could draw from her lips the reluctant answer to some question

i wonder if shes real clean  asked helen timorously approaching

 cleanliness in children is abnormal and should be discouraged said mildred shortly

 oh ha ha ha good good  cried heathcote  cleanliness abnormal good but of course miss mildred you dont mean it 

at this juncture the visitor feeling her dignity offended made a motion to go mildred hastened to wrap her up warmly and to slip something shiny in her hand the little hard fingers closed around the soft ones and mr osbornes young daughter received a look from the childs grave eyes that brought the tears into her own and made her stoop and kiss the grimy face when she looked up again heathcote was standing at the door hat in hand and waterproof on

im going to send the little one home you know he explained

 oh â  began helen

 but it is good of you said mildred softly and he bowed himself out helping the child down the steps as if she had been a princess

 mildred how could you  cried helen almost tearfully

i couldnt if he hadnt helped me dear he didnt do it because i made him but because it was in him helen i have a slight cough and every one is helping and sheltering me father is leaving his business to go there across the country with me that poor little thing did nt you hear her cough and yet she is out in the rain alone and carrying her great burden could nt i do that little bit for her 

 what a queer girl you are mildred 

and then heathcote came back his face was glowing with exercise and no man ever looked less disgraced

 i put her in a cab you know and told the cabby where to go he said  some beastly little street down here really you ought to have seen the little beggar she looked as pleased as a kitten and hugged her bundle up as tight â  and there was a light in his eyes as he looked down upon mildred such as they put in the halo of a saint  wasnt it jolly  he added

jolly yes said mildred with just the suspicion of a shake in her voice and then they talked of other things of commonplaces until helen according to that ancient and not always respected custom rose and excused herself

there was a long silence between them when they were alone the big englishman fair with the suggestion that the blood was always just ready to come swift to his face was good to look at and the girl with the color in her cheeks and her thick brown hair half high upon her head was a fitting foil for him

 so you are going tomorrow miss mildred  he said

yes tomorrow but you know tomorrow is the day that never comes

 i have believed that fallacy until now he said but now i find that it does come and crushingly soon

yes i go tomorrow she added aimlessly its going to be a long journey isnt it

 i wish i might take it for you

 you are good you have been so good to me tonight and i thank you

 please dont thank me i wish i might go on being good to you for a thousand years even if i had no other reward than hope

miss mildred i dont want to go on boring you but you know you know dont you 

 i know of course i do arthur dear arthur but cant you understand its so hard for me to explain it tonight

ima brute for making you think of it instead of trying to make this last night of yours at home pleasant what a miserable blunderer and brute i am 

no no it is i who am the brute who cannot feel â i â 

 i wish heaven would send me the man who would say so you can feel you do feel only i am not the man well let me see this is the fifth  no  i have heard from you since april very well no no that you say shall be final until some other claims you and now i must not keep you up i shall not see you tomorrow

his tone was cheery but his face was pale though the light that was in his eyes when he looked at her had not died out as he left her she sank down crying softly  he is so good so honest why cannot i love him 

the rain was over and the sun come from his sulking tent looked bravely on the world again it was the morning of mildreds departure heathcote had sent flowers and mrs annesley had already come and begun her matronly duties over john osbornes house she was very busy indeed much more busy than circumstances at all demanded but she felt that nervous bustle would anyway show the importance of the position she held

 its really awful john for me to have to leave my dear home and come here but i knew under just what an affliction you and the dear girls were labouring and so i determined to make the sacrifice john do be careful of mildred you know how her poor dear mother went off

she applied her handkerchief tenderly to her eyes and shook with ostensible sobs she had helped worry her sister to death

 it was very good of you to come here anna said mr osborne  and i know how you will miss the comforts of your own home his house was twice as large and a good deal more homelike

 of course you know john its been a dear house to me ever since annesley died and you know how attached i am to it and how hard it is for mo to leave it

when she wasnt at lenox or at newport she was abroad

i know all anna i know all and your kindness shall never be forgotten

 oh well for myself i shall be all fears and anxiety for the dear child but of course on helens account it would nt do to let my feelings get the better of me and so i had thought that perhaps this winter not too soon you know but if we have good news of our dear mildred my grief might make the concession of a few receptions and a ball or two

thats right thats right

 and its such a magnificent house for entertaining that ballroom would accommodate an army

 have your army anna and draw on me for supplies

 oh you dear generous john what times we shall have and its all so necessary for helen while mr

berkeley â that is while matters are as i said before in statu quo 

 give helen any pleasures she wants to keep her spirits up â balls parties dances the theatre

 glorious i ll do it oh could her poor mother have lived to see this day and oh john do he careful of mildred among those people out there and dont let her put on leggings and a buckskin skirt

john osborne started away he could stand it no longer and a short time later he was locked securely in his library to spend the hour before train time

after leaving him mrs annesley traversed the whole servants department awing them into respect for her authority then with a muttered  now i must go and comfort the girls she started for her nieces room but the rustle of her silken skirts upstairs was a herald that preceded her and just before she reached the top a door banged to she kept her way however right on to helens room it was deserted then she went to mildreds room and looked at the grim panels shut against her

 poor child she said  i know that she hates so to leave me that the sight of my face would be only a grief to her i wont go in and mrs annesley went down into the drawingroom to spend the rest of the time alone

the girls were together in mildreds room they had gone there because helen would not have dared to lock her door upon her aunt they were in the close intimate converse of girls about to part and the elder sister was shedding real tears as she chided the younger for her apparent heartlessness

i dont believe you care for me a bit mildred or you surely would show more feeling than you do at leaving me

dearie said mildred whats the use of my crying and reddening my eyes when i know it will be such a short time until we re laughing at the whole thing and at all the funny things we ve seen 

 but oh suppose you dont come back 

 but i am coming back now nell dont be a silly goose did i ever say i was going to do a thing that i didnt do 

mildred was bearing up bravely poor little girl though there were dark rings about her eyes and she had to keep swallowing fortunately a new matter of interest took hold of her sisters mind and she asked suddenly arthur heathcote did he propose again 

instantly mildreds whole attitude changed she became at once defiant and yet with something of sorrow in her manner the defiance was external the sorrow personal

 yes she said

 and you 

 i gave him the same answer the only one i can ever give him

 oh mildred â 

 please dont lets talk of it helen hes such a good fellow

 and such a chance

 im looking for love not chance arthur heathcote demands love and i cannot give it to him such men as mr berkeley make a chance oh forgive me helen yon know i did nt mean it she cried as helen had recourse to her rather inadequate handkerchief again  i didnt mean what i said i dont know what im saying arthur heathcote is so good i came near to surrendering last night but i know i couldnt give him what he wants what he deserves and i wouldnt give him less

 you can try

no said the girl dreamily there is something else for me i have known it ever since men talked to me of love some one some prince maybe she added laughing will come to claim me and i have known just how i shall feel when he takes me by the hand

so many women believe this it is true of so few

 that all comes of reading your silly stories mildred

 oh no you goose and mildred threw her arms about her sisters neck it all comes of reading my silly heart

 and suppose prince charming does not appear 

 then i shall marry arthur if he is still unwed

 but what silly talk this is for us within an hour of parting

 helen said mildred gravely this is just the kind of talking i want to do and if you touch that handkerchief again i ll strangle you with smellingsalts

the morning was bringing out its most vivid contrast to the nights dreariness as they rolled away to the station helen was subdued but mildred chattered like a magpie and her aunt kept pace with her

 remember all my warnings said the latter as they neared their destination

yes auntie dear im to flirt with the cowboys if they he not a thing of the past and i suppose they are in this degenerate age of the world when everything romantic is past 

 mildred dont lay any such thing at my door i said nothing of the kind

 and im to bring you a little papoose to raise

john listen to the girl a papoose  why i would nt have such a thing

never mind aunt anna youre right a papoose would be troublesome ill bring you a great big indian

mrs annesley collapsed just as they reached the grand central station she revived as the carriage drew up and they found arthur heathcote there to help them out

the others went on up to the train but he held mildred back a pace

i couldnt help coming he said  you know i did nt intend to but âbut you ll forgive me wont you 

kindness is always easy to forgive and oh thank you for your flowers

 i am glad if they gave you pleasure but i should nt have come should i 

 do you feel very guilty  she asked playfully

i am simply bowed with my transgression you know

 i shall not scold you then since you are sufficiently contrite

then i shall always be contrite before you

 really yon are like a methodist who is always possessed of  a lowly and a contrite heart but then when a man has no weapon against a woman he uses his shield of contrition

 i hope at least this time it has turned aside your anger they were approaching the others on the platform then  where shall you stop  he asked abruptly

 oh we he going out on a ranch belonging to one of fathers friends or a company he knows or something like that it is situated somewhere between denver and the setting sun

groodbye he said gently i know this must be a family party and i cannot claim the pleasure of admittance goodbye i must speak to your father

he went over and shook osbornes hand and then turned away down the platform looking back every moment with a wistful expression on his face until he had turned the corner and was out of sight

and then they went into the luxurious coach helen as tearful as nina the maid and mildred all gayety mrs annesleys handkerchief was in constant use and john osborne was very grave he was taking his child away from her sister perhaps never to see her again then a polite porter said  all off please

mrs annesley kissed her niece quickly on the nose and hurried to the door but helen held her sister in one long embrace

 oh mildred  was all she could say

and  oh helen  was the choking reply and then the younger girl brightened up as her sister left the car and waved a frantic farewell to her then the bluecoated official waved his arms and the long train pulled out mildred was alone in the stateroom with her father as they passed from the sight of those on the platform she threw herself on his breast crying  oh father father  and burst into tears

mr osborne had felt a sort of grieved surprise at his daughters gayety in the face of departure from the ties she should have held sacred but he was more terribly shocked at her utter breakdown when he saw that instead of being heartless she had really been brave for her sisters sake he felt a helpless resentment at his own stupidity that could wrong her even in thought he hastened to try to quiet the girls sorrow and when mildred saw that her tears disturbed her father she dried her eyes and smiling like an april day exclaimed  oh what a baby i am but it was hard was nt it papa leaving helen and everything i love 

it was hard and you are a brave little girl thats what yon are and im an old fool not to have seen it

yon mustnt call yourself a fool papa it isnt at all respectful and then there isnt a shade of reason for it

 oh yes there is do you knowâ he began

but she put her hand over his month

yes i know you thought i was heartless and unfeeling because i didnt seem to care about leaving and thats just what i wanted you to think then i wanted them all to think it so im not so bad at acting you see

her cheeriness warmed her fathers heart and restored his selfrespect

he laughed and chatted with his daughter in his old accustomed way and she responded in such a merry mood that he did not note the tremour in her voice nor see the cloud that now and then rested on her brow

do you know he was saying im glad i had the chance to come with you mildred i feel already like a new man i suppose i should have stayed on there just working with my little summer jaunts for intermission until i should have dropped in harness its strange to me how little enjoyment the rich really get out of their wealth talk about the slavery of the poor its the rich who are really to be pitiedâ those people with enjoyment in their grasp and yet with golden scales upon their eyes that keep them from seeing and grasping their opportunities i wish helen could be here

just then the porter came in to see if anything was needed at least that was ostensibly what he came for in reality he came because he needed or thought he needed something after he had been dismissed mildred asked  but papa dont you think that even the life the wealthy drudge leads is better than the existence dragged out by that poor coloured man who just came in here trying to smile a little fee out of our pockets 

poor coloured man why mildred that man gets more out of life than i do he has a greater capacity for enjoyment with the paradox that less satisfies it you think it humiliates him to take a tip not in the least thats his business he courteously fleeces us and then laughs about it no doubt ha ha 

 you re becoming quite a cynic im ashamed of you

well i guess an old codger who has dropped business and gone racing across the continent with the prettiest little malingerer in the world can afford to be a bit cynical even contemptuous in his attitude towards the rest of the world

mildred cuddled up close to her father and so they rattled on

the train bounded over the rails like a thing of life it sped over bridges that spanned great rivers through cities towns and hamlets pausing only at long intervals to take breath as if weary of its terrific race then it stops for a little while at a great city on an inland sea it is night when they reach there and the shimmer of the water and the lights of the streets make mildred sad for a space for her mind goes back to the bay and the rivers at home and she thinks of helen alone there with just the servants and aunt annesley then the porter comes again and she goes to bed to bathe the pillow with tears of homesickness and yearning while her father goes into the smokingroom to brood over his cigar what a pity it is that women cannot smoke they would weep less the puffs that john osborne took on his cigar that night were the full equivalent of mildreds tears

with all the faith one may have in ones self with all the strong hopefulness of youth it is yet a terrible thing to be forced away from home from all one loves to an unknown uncaredfor country there to fight hand to hand with death an uncertain fight there is none of the rush and clamour of battle that keeps up the soldiers courage there is no clang of the instruments of war the panting warrior hears no loud huzzas and yet the deadly combat goes on in the still night when all the worlds asleep in the gray day in the pale morning it goes on and no one knows it save himself and death then if he go down he knows no heros honorsif he win he has no special praise and yet it is a terrible lone still fight

in the morning both mildred and her father were in their accustomed good spirits their minds had adjusted themselves to the changed situation and nature as if rewarding them for their good behaviour smiled upon them it was a glorious day great masses of white clouds were piled high in the heavens like fairy mountains and between them stretched long rifts of blue like intervening streams they were passing through a green rolling land touched not yet with the yellow hand of decay although it was september much of the land was in pasture and mildred laughed as she watched the horses gallop wildly away from the fences as the train flew by or the placid cows regarding the express with undisturbed equanimity

so the day passed and they went through another great city on a lake and then on again the country becoming flatter and browner as they proceeded the rolling green land was succeeded by perfect seas of yellow corn com here there and everywhere it seemed that all the world had been drowned beneath its moving billows look to either side she would the girl saw nothing but the one grain stretching for miles along the track and on over to the horizon

 what â what do they do with so much corn papa  she asked

 they bring down prices with so much corn he answered grimly

yes but what else do they do with it surely it has some other use besides that 

 it has they eat it they feed it to their stock they mill it and they corner it

 ive heard of corners in wheat but â 

my dear there can be a corner in anything that one man has and another man wants a corner is just the repetition of the act of the dog in the manger in the fable with the exception that the ox is left the alternative of paying a high price to the dog or going without well even an option is a good thing and the old man chuckled thoughtfully

 papa were you ever in a corner  which side the cornerer or the cornered 

 the cornerer

mr osborne smiled again and patted the girls head

 well now if this were the inquisition and i had to answer that question or go to the rack i should be in a very unpleasant situation  and still laughing he rose and made his way to that refuge of the wayfaring man â the smokingroom

i wonder if papa ever cornered anybody mused mildred but finding no answer to the question in the fields that had made it possible she turned her mind to other things it did not take long for the other things to drive all thoughts of corn and corners out of her head for those other things proved to be prairiedogs sitting demurely by their houses with their hands up like devout little boys in prayer a sudden peal at the bell so decided so hurried that it brought the porter hastening to mildred as if she were on fire and he had to hurry to put her out evinced her interest

what is it miss asked the startled servant

tell my father to come here quickly

can i help you  he was sure something was the matter

 no no just hurry thats all

if that porter had been a blackbird instead of a black man he would have flown so great was his excitement as it was he came as near accomplishing that impossible feat as nature a narrow aisle and a rolling car would allow him he had to go the length of another car before he found mr oshorne but he seemed to achieve the distance in an incredibly short time then he came guiding back the old gentleman who was white to the lips

mildred stood up as he approached

what is it  he asked in an anxious tone

 didnt you see them  and just then they passed another dogtown and she cried  there they are there they are oh papa look at them 

mr osborne saw what the excitement was about and collapsed limply into his seat

 mildred mildred be said  is this what you have called me for where oh where is your reserve the fruit of a hundred drawingrooms what would your aunt anna say  and he bent into a very undignified curve

i dont care mildred pouted  they are just as cute as they can be

why you nearly startled that porter out of his wits he didnt say it but he looked as if he thought you might be in a fit

and indeed the coloured man was still staring at them with wide white eyes and when he saw them burst anew into laughter he left the door and went back to his place in disgust no doubt with the thought in his mind that here was another instance of white people trampling on and making a fool of the black man

i didnt mean to frighten him said mildred  but it was such a new sight to me ill give him an extra tip before we leave

 you should make him pay you for turning him so near white even for such a short space of time

 i dont know anything ive enjoyed half so much as those dear little dogs they are such plump rolypoly little things do you know papa they remind me of little chinese babies 

 have mercy on the dogs mildred do

i love them

 that proves you a tenderfoot i dont believe they are held in such reverence by the people of the west especially those whose business takes them riding over the prairie

they were nearing denver and it was afternoon

 theres our first glimpse of pikes peak said osborne

 where oh yes but look papa heres another dogtown

it was dusk when they rolled into denver where they were to stop for a day

 this is denver denver and i am west she said breathlessly

you are west yes you are west little girl

as they alighted at the hotel door she looked round her once more at the busy streets the hurrying people and murmured as if in a dream  denver

yes denver the city where so many hopes were blighted where so many dreams came true where so many fortunes went up and so many lives went down denver over which nature broods with mystic calm and through which humanity struggles with hot strenuous life

the ranch to which they were destined lay about one hundred miles south and west of denver and after a days rest they set out therefor the train took them within eight miles of the place and at the station they were to take wagon to the end of their journey

mildred declared herself better already the sights were all so new to herâthe rolling illimitable plains then the great bleak mountains standing up like hoary sentinels guarding the land

 its magnificent  she breathed this is geography realised the rockies 

 wait until you get to going over those roads in a wagonteam though  dont pour cold water now papa let me go on enjoying when i may so that i shall have something to remember when i may not

 go on child and store up numerous memories for you ll need them said her father banteringly

every turn of the train disclosed new beauties to the girls wondering eyes before her lay the panorama of mountain and cloud time and time again she found herself puzzled to tell which was vapour and which was rock first the brown foothills shrouded in a purple haze and behind them range after range rising in snowgarmented grandeur

when they arrived at the station a young man came forward to meet them his dress was in no way remarkableânot at all in the extravagant style which the illustrators of fiction had made familiar to mildreds eyes and she had time to notice that he had a pleasing face although it was much browned and a good gray eye before he saidâ  this is mr osborne 

 thats my name sir i suppose you are hendrickson 

no mr hendrickson was unable to come and so sent me in his place our buckboard is just here at the end of the platform

 unable to come mused mildred mentally hum that is not dialect and heres aunt annesleys cowboy at last i wonder where his pistols are

she laughed to herself as she thought of her aunt looking askance at the young man who was with them she turned to look at him and his eyes were fastened on her face

impertinence thought mildred hed better attend to his own business i am right though he has got good eyes such a soft gray

here we are said the young man quickly as they approached the vehicle a large easy twoseated affair to which two wiry horses were harnessed

he offered mildred his hand but she gave her father her arm and stepped in mr osborne and the young man followed the latter clucked to the horses and they trotted away the road lay for awhile between widely scattered houses and shacks then it broke away into the open country where the bridges across the ditches were precarious and the sight of a human being a novel thing

it was a silent party for a strange embarrassment had fallen on the girl and she replied to her fathers bantering advances with none of her pretty retorts and tricks finally mr osborne turned to the driver and said â  you ve quite a place out here my friend hopkins tells me

 pretty fair yes

 ive known hopkins for a great many years even before he had any interests at all in the west

 yes

 i suppose he seldom visits you 

 very seldom

 whenever he has spoken of his place here he has always said that this man hendrickson filled the bill completely

yes hendrickson is a good man i suppose you have been in bis employ for some time

just the ghost of a smile crossed the young mans brow as be answered yes ive been here for some little while

 what do you do that is mostly  mildred was nudging her father but be was determined to be friendly

 ob almost anything i just knock around generally

 ob

after this unproductive attempt at conversation mr osborne lapsed into silence surely if the rest of the people on the ranch were no more loquacious they would have a dull time of it well mildred bad come out for climate not for conversation

the young lady herself kept her eyes straight before her she did not like the taciturnity of their driver in face of her fathers genial overtures  it is all of a piece with the mistaken idea of democracy and equality in the west she thought  the idea has run wild independence has been superseded by insolence and every labourer is so afraid of being put upon that his attitude is one of aggression or defiance toward his superiors and she grew inwardly angry as she felt that the young man was looking at her out of the corner of his eye

 thats just the trouble her thoughts went on he has been partly educated and thats what keeps him from knowing his place now in england it would be different  a servant would be respectful at least even nina is better well we are different in the east

 i think you ll like it out here said the driver  after you get used to the silence  and she relented a little towards him perhaps he was only embarrassed after all of course there were not many modest men she had never seen one but then she had heard that there were such things

 i am sure i shall like it said her father  i need a little silence after the bustle and buzz of new york

 i should think you would

with this little talk he drew up at the entrance of an enclosure and leaping down flung open a long barred gate through this the horses walked and then waited until he closed it when they resumed their journey up a road the counterpart of the former one save that it lay through fenced ground they must have proceeded about a mile when they came to a broad low house there was the barking of dogs within as the wagon stopped and a big man who would have been fair but for the suns care came running out to meet them he was followed by a plump little woman

 how do you do mr osborne  said the man

 this is hendrickson said the driver as they alighted

 how do you do mr hendrickson said mr osborne and this is my daughter miss mildred osborne i have heard much of you from my friend hopkins

we think a great deal of mr hopkins out here although we dont often see him this is my wife he added as they neared the smiling little woman

mr osborne bowed and mildred shook hands with her she felt glad to see the face of another woman besides the silent maid  come right in then hendrickson went on laughingly â  i hope you have nt had any trouble with landry on the road

 with landry  said mr osborne questioningly

 oh yes i dont reckon hes introduced himself to you thats just like him to drive eight miles with people and never say who he is â landry

mildred turned in time to see the driver who was about going off with the team flush beneath his tan  will he dare to introduce him thats what hes going to do she thought  well this is too much of western democracy

the young fellow had left his charges and strolled up not without a certain grace in his bearing

 this is our mr landry mr and miss osborne

mildreds bow was very slight

 i shall give him special charge of your pleasure and comfort hes better able to take care of you than i am so they went into the house and landry went about his work

the plump little woman took charge of mildred and showed her to their rooms there were four for her father herself and nina plainly furnished but comfortable

 mr landry mused the girl as her maid was making her comfortable and he is to provide for our pleasure nina shall be my proxy there even on a ranch one must draw the line somewhere

jack one of the men was leading the horses away from the wagon when he turned to landry and said  great gal i tell you what a face to â 

what 

jack stopped

 if ever i hear you speak that way of that young lady again i ll break every bone in your body said the young man calmly

if mildred had expected the man landry to force his attentions upon her she was greatly mistaken he gave her no occasion whatever to offer ninas services as proxy hendrickson had fulfilled his promise and left them much to the young ranchmans care while indeed he was all that courtesy or hospitality could demand all his offers of service were made to mr osborne and mildreds presence or participation in the pleasures he provided was a mere incident he seldom spoke to her except to answer some question or to point out some place of interest as they journeyed to and fro about the ranch she had not been there a week before she was compelled to change her ideas of western democracy and to admit that she had done landry himself an injustice what she could not understand was his attitude toward themselves and the attitude of the men towards him the former while perfectly respectful had nothing that could suggest the relation of master and servant while there was nothing of assertiveness about his manner he seemed to look upon them calmly as equals and her father had already accepted him as such but it was harder for the girl there is in every woman a bit of the snob and while it was at its lowest development in this clean sweet american maiden she could not but feel a certain resentment at the cool way in which he took his acceptability for granted she could not deny that his manners and his language were those of a gentleman and she could not withhold a measure of admiration for his sturdy manhood as she saw him hardy and alert at his labours or swinging across the plains at the long lope which is the chief charm of the western rider

the men treated him with a peculiar mixture of comradeship and respect which mildred could attribute to nothing but his superior education or perhaps his prowess with his fists which she had always heard was a good foundation for respect in the west

and while she mused and pondered over landry he went calmly on treating her politely and letting her alone now there was just enough of the coquette in mildreds makeup for this sort of treatment to pique her so it was in a spirit entirely feminine that she set out to compel the notice of the man whose attentions she had determined to resent

with this end in view she began to talk to landry more and to attempt to draw him out no one could long resist mildreds sweetness and charm and this strange reticent ranchman was no exception to the rule he soon responded and within three weeks the two young people were on a footing of pleasant companionship

landry talked more though not much but he found time to take the girl about the ranch showing her things which he did not think mr osborne would care for and so did not trouble him about he grew frankly to like her and made no attempt to conceal it mildred often blushed at the honest admiration she saw in his gray eyes and it gave her a thrill of something between pleasure and fright as she saw how his face would light up at unexpected meetings between them a man whose face was such a telltale might be embarrassing sometimes but it was pleasant to be liked in such a frank honest way

they rode and walked together and he taught her how to shoot with the rifle it gave him a quiet delight to saddle her pony for her with his own hands and he taught her how to guide the intelligent little beast as the cowboy does by the mere inclination of her lithe body

meanwhile mr osborne looked on at the growing intimacy between them and made no attempt to check it he liked landry and did not see why mildred should not do so especially as he was the means of keeping her out in the open air and the roses were coming back into her cheeks of course this was a mans point of view

men are so unpractical about these things a woman would have looked at the matter differently mrs annesley now for instance would have scented danger as soon as she saw that landry did not wear buckskins and a pistol a man hardly entertains an idea of love in a case where a woman goes forward and postulates it

so landry and mildred rode on toward the dreamland of romance he consciously gladly she unknowing

it was one golden morning in october that he came to her saying i am going out to ride the fence miss mildred some of the men report breaks in it somewhere along the west side wont you come with me 

really i ought to write letters this morning mr landry

 oh please dont mr landry me he said a little impatiently  surely you ye known me long enough to see that no one gives me mr and to do like them

she looked at him in surprise you must forgive me for being impatient he went on  but you know that mr smells to me of civilisation and it makes me feel stuffy

 all right i ll  mr you no more then landry

 he smiled gladly  and now wont you come 

 i ought nt to but i will and we ll throw up the wide windows of the morning to remove the stuffy feeling she laughed gaily and went in to put on her strong gray habit

they were soon out and in the saddle and galloping away over the plains the sun in her eyes and the wind in her hair and the joy of youth and freedom throbbing in her heart

landry looked at her in silence a smile like a sunbeam lying on his lips the desire to possess her rose up and grew strong in his being what a glory it would be to hold this light airy creature against the world to anticipate all her wants and to supply them

the morning was like a song so sweet it was half sad the air was like wine and so clear that the farthest mountain ranges looked near and neighbourly the alfalfa fields with their deep dark green half sprung from the third cutting stood out in deep contrast to the browns and yellows which are colorados prevailing autumn tints the sky was a dream of blue and white with a touch of crimson over a peak where the sun had lately come up the mysterious everchanging mountains were clothed in a morning veil of pale opal light except in the hollows where the darkness of shadow turned it to lavender and purple

mildred looked like the child of the day and rode like the spirit of the wind and for a long time neither she nor landry said anything they were too busy just enjoying what nature had given them after awhile she drew rein and turned to him smiling

 i wonder what my people at home would say of this weak plant if they could see me now

you have thrived in the sunshine and they could only be thankful just then a jackrabbit flashed across their path a mere leaping bundle of graywhite and he laughed aloud at the joy she had in the sight

 they would say for one thing that your capacity for enjoyment was in no way diminished by coming out here

 i wonder mildred laughed  if they could believe that there was anything to enjoy in this desert

 i dont like to hear it called a desert it is full of teeming life to me with things to see and things to love and to do

 oh hut they would never understand that unless they had seen it for themselves i know i did nt why i had a letter from my sister in the mail that you brought yesterday and she asked me if you wore many pistols or were at all careless in handling firearms i had written her about youâblushing

landry laughed a good deal longer than the humour of the remark demanded but he was laughing out of pure joy because she had thought of him and had written about him the impulse seized him to speak then and know his fate and he was only able to check it by darting away on the pretended chase of another rabbit he came back laughing

 what an awful opinion they must have of us  he said  i wonder they let you come out here

 it was not without many admonitions from my aunt to be careful of cowboys and catamounts â that was quite the nearest to the concrete she could bring the west and so she seized on that i really dont believe that she regards this part of the country as civilised

nothing is quite so conceited as what we call civilisation and what does it mean after all except to lie gracefully to cheat legally and to live as far away from god and nature as the world limit will let if it must mean that out here pray god that it may never come to this part of the country if it does then some of us will have no refuge

mildred looked at him with wide eyes  why are you so bitter  she asked now i think that civilisation is very good when it treats ns well maybe it didnt treat you well though anyway i m glad to know one thing that papa is wrong he says that every one who has a chance to live in the heart of the world and yet comes here must be driven either by consumption cupidity or crime no some of us come to get breathing space when we are stifled back there by meanness and deceit some of us come here to look at the great mountains and broad plains and forget how little man is to see nature and through it natures god and so get back to faith

his face was flushed and his manner vehement and mildred thought she had offended him

 oh you mustnt mind papas remark  he was only trying to make an epigram you know it s the fashion to make epigrams now alliterative if possible but epigrams of some kind they are supposed to be philosophical shortcuts

yes i know they are a kind of electriclighted royal road to truth but i confess i never did like electric lights but you must forgive me for making a shadow on your day

 you have nt she said simply they had come to one of the breaks in the fence now and he had dismounted to see what could be done and if possible to make repairs he went at his work cheerfully almost joyously mildred watched him for a time and then she asked suddenly do you really like it landry 

he looked up in surprise  why yes why not 

 oh i dont know she answered blushing  but it does nt seem like you it seems so trivial inadequate inconsequential oh i dont know what i mean

 why its work im doing something

 but would nt you rather be doing something else 

 i dont see that i should im not only mending fences out here that would be trivial perhaps although even fencemending has its place and farther south they have men who do nothing else but ride the fence day after day but besides this we are digging a new irrigation ditch and altogether i m bearing my share in the work of feeding the world what man can do more 

 oh yes i know â but â but â  she paused embarrassed

landry laughed and went on you see miss mildred it isnt what a man does hut how he does it i love work not for works sake but for what it accomplishes although i do find a certain pleasure in the process

 but dont you know landry pardon me if i seem impertinent you might have made a good soldier or an officer she said diffidently

 i dont know that i should want to he he said calmly and then dropping his work he went on i know it isnt heroic but i dont know that those fellows brave as they may be who are out there fighting a lot of halfnaked savages are doing any more for ultimate good than we who are here fighting the hard conditions of nature i like a fight but there are fights and fights and i d rather know that this irrigation ditch that i m digging is going to make the land better and a lot of people happier than to feel that i was carrying a cartridgebelt full of civilisation to folks that didnt want it

 oh shame shame you re an antiexpansionist said mildred

no im not an antiexpansionist either i believe in americas spreading out as big and as broad as she can and doing all the good she can but whenever i look around me on all this â  he swept his eyes around the horizonâ  i cannot help thinking that there s a good deal of expanding to be done at home  would you recall the men from the philippines 

i wouldnt recall anybody or anything those fellows for that work and every man to his liking but i do say that a good many of those boys who are out there wasting their lives under suns that werent made to shine on anybody but niggers might be better employed out here in gods country where every air is a blessing helping to make a paradise of this land thats so near it already

 why landry you re really eloquent when you get started

pardon me he said blushing under his tan ive been blowing off a good deal but i was so full of it

with landrys work the morning went quickly and it was past noon when they started riding leisurely back to the ranchhouse

 i wish you could help me brighten things for the boys out here a little

he said  their lives are sometimes dull ive been thinking of giving them some music one of these nights i have a violin and a guitar

 you have  she exclaimed  why you never told me

no im not much of a musician but you have a banjo and i could make shift if you could help me will you

she hesitated he was so blunt so direct why could nt he hint at things and give her a chance

 will you  he repeated

yes she answered at last

and as they alighted at the door and he held her hand in saying goodbye she wondered what manner of man was this landry who hated civilisation and yet practised all its graces

 papa said mildred when she and her father were alone again  that mr landry has very queer ideas  is that so my dear he surely doesnt maintain that the moon is made of green cheese 

no no but he does maintain something almost as heretical â the heroism of common labour

 oh he preaches that doctrine does he he being the common labourer eh 

well he doesnt say quite that either for as i remember now he said that he wasnt heroic but he claims that the men who make a farm or a ranch better are as good and as great as the men who are fighting in the philippines

mr osborne laughed then said musingly  ive seen men in my day whom i regard as greater generals than any our war has yet produced and their battlefields were only offices and countingrooms too landry is right he has a great deal of sound sense for a man in his station

 his station thats just it papa what is his station

mr osborne paused and looked at her  well now that is one on me come to think of it i have never considered the matter he is not a man whose character or manner lends itself to much speculation about station one feels so sure about his manhood that he forgets to ask about the status of it

 but i do want very much to know the daughter pursued he has asked me to help him in a little entertainment for the men and i have told him i would

oh well that wont hurt you it will be a good thing for the men and out here you can afford to be pretty democratic although landry strikes me as being a man one couldnt well be ashamed of anywhere

it pleased mildred so to hear her father say this of landry that she immediately resented both her feeling and his remark

 i must say papa that you do make some sudden and enthusiastic friendships

i am seldom wrongthough the old man returned

and so the girls mind was set at rest as to the fitness of her helping landry in his entertainment for the men or the  boys as he more often called them

somehow the young man seemed to find even more spare time than usual that week and much of it was spent in practising with her sometimes it was the violin and the banjo sometimes it was the banjo alone and as often it tinkled to the heavier strumming of the guitar and they laughed and enjoyed it and were glad they had thought of this plan of entertaining the boys

and so the days went on and the night of the concert arrived â a moonlight night with a cool wind blowing down from the mountain after a hot day the ranchhouse was a scene of repressed joy repressed for your ranchman prides himself on his stoicism and holds the concealment of his emotion a great virtue young tod though the youngest of the helpers had been insane with delight and was doing fancy steps before the door an hour and a half earlier than the hour set for the festivities

the general diningroom a long wainscoted chamber had been fitted up with chairs and settees as the audience hall and all the lamps and lanterns obtainable had been brought into requisition to make it bright and cheerful little less pleased than tod mr hendrickson came in as soon as it was decently near the time of beginning and seated himself near the centre of the room smiling and dumb with joy his wife was flying around as tod expressed it  like a chicken with its head wrung off very busy putting the finishing touches to things and saying an admonishing word to the boys who were dropping in one by one

a lamp flared and smoked and a halfdozen willing pairs of hands were up to attend to it and as many faces bronzed and mellow in the light bent over it smiling to be of service

when it was time to begin mr osborne came in with mildred and the banjo and they were greeted with a burst of uproarious applause the old man looked a little embarrassed and sank quickly into a seat where he sat smiling upon the scene as if it were all a play and he had been unexpectedly cast for a part mildred blushed like a peony and began tuning her banjo to relieve her confusion the entrance of landry a little later with his violin and guitar was the signal for another outburst the rancher only smiled as he took his seat beside mildred and she made the mental comment that surely this man was different from those around him

in order to get things going landry struck a few chords on his guitar and he and mildred swung into one of the liveliest of sousas marches it is just possible that none of the musical societies had recommended the banjo and guitar as two instruments especially adapted for such work but these bronzed hardhanded fellows so far away from the pleasures and amusements of the town isolated from their fellows the companions of cattle â they were not critics the music light though it was gave them the hint of the better brighter things outside their own barren lives and never was a performance so thoroughly enjoyed fingers were snapped and feet were stamped in time to the strain and some even joined to whistle softly the air

encouraged by these signs of appreciation mildreds fingers fairly flew over the strings she had entered heart and soul into the spirit of the affair her face was flushed and her eyes were shining no wonder that landry could not see the men around him nor the room nor hear the applause which greeted the music all his senses were absorbed in one and that one was wholly devoted to drinking her in with his eager eyes

finally though he awakened and in response to a vociferous encore they began another tune after this he called out to tod â  come on now tod and give us  your ranchers song

 tod tod  chorused the others tod ducked his head and sat still he was embarrassed by the presence of mildred who seemed to him like a being from another sphere

come on tod repeated landry striking his guitar  the boys ll join in the chorus wont you boys 

 thats what  they shouted and you bet 

thus adjured tod rose from his seat but at the sight of the faces looking at him collapsed into it again like a scared schoolboy on exhibition day

there was a burst of laughter at this but it stopped suddenly for mildred was standing up speaking

 wont you come on and sing please  she was saying  i should feel very badly if i thought you felt strange before papa and me

 go on you cant refuse the lady  the men urged and tod rose again a little less embarrassed and shuffled forward he bowed awkwardly to mildred as he came out and gave her a look it was such a look as one of the rude shepherds halfstartled halfuplifted might have bent on the angels with the glad tidings it was as if the purity of the girl had suddenly metamorphosed the mans whole nature and the light of the change was made manifest in his eyes

landry saw the look and the insane desire took possession of him to get up and hug tod but he only said  go on and struck up the tune

tod began to sing the  ranchmans song one of the few clean ones in the plainsmans repertoire â the ranchmans life is the life for meâ a wild sweet life indeed by day the sun on the mesa free by night the mad stampede

chorus

a long lope and a slow lope that is the gait we ride but who would change the life of the range for the city and all its pride

this is the life for the man who feels the warm blood in his veins to sit him straight when his pony wheels and to skim the melting plains

chorus

i have no wife no kin have i i bide alone and free but cattle plains and hill and sky are wife enough for me

chorus

i have no house and i have no home so comrades when i die just plant me here where the cattle roam and you will still ride by

chorus

the men roared the chorus out lustily and the song ended with a great flourish then a banjo solo by mildred ran the men wild again and while they were still shouting over the encore she played landry began singing to the accompaniment of his own guitar a hush fell upon the room and mildred looked at him in surprise his voice was a rich baritone â the voice for a manâand he sang with deep feeling even emotion it was only a simple ballad â such as one may hear from the balladsinger any time at a music hallâbut the manner of the singing was instant in its effect the men began clearing their throats and looking down at their boots tod got up and stood with his back to the rest looking at the wall as if he saw a picture there nor did he turn around when landry had finished but swept his sleeve quickly and surreptitiously across his eyes and joined in the hearty applause the men straightened up and began smiling sheepishly at each other and not one of them would have admitted to another the presence of the great lump in his throat

mildred found her own lashes wet as she joined landry and they broke into the inspiriting strains of the  georgia campmeeting the change was instantaneous the men like great children were as quickly swayed from grief to joy or the reverse the music got into their blood like fire and the imp of dancing tickled their feet tod suddenly left his corner and springing into the middle of the floor began to dance wildly but not ungracefully there was the hasty pushing back of chairs and a halfdozen men joined him embarrassment and restraint were forgotten in the momentary excitement even hendrickson was taken by the infection and seizing his plump little wife spun her dizzily about the room tod danced his way toward nina and then paused before her bowing the maid gave a startled glance toward mildred who nodded and a moment later she was flying away in the arms of the happy rancher who laughed at the envious faces of his comrades

when the tune had been played through there were loud cries of again again and it was repeated to the hilarious joy of the dancers nina came hack breathless from the exertion

oh miss mildred she gasped  i dont know what youll think of me    ill think youve been enjoying yourself like a sensible girl replied mildred

 mr tod is a nice dancer of course â   i abhor conventionality interrupted mildred her father heard her and smiled at her he was satisfied for she was happy

they played once more and then landry announced that the concert was over the men took their hats and crowded to the door but there they stopped and looked hungrily back

 mildred will never know why she did it save that something in their eyes compelled it and made her forget herself and she swung her banjo into position and began playing softly home sweet home

landry did not attempt to accompany her but stood gazing at her in admiration and delight the men were transfixed again tod turned to the wall and there were honest tears in the eyes of some of the fellows

 goodnight and thanks they said when she had finished and then they stepped out as if afraid to disturb something that she had put to sleep within them but once outside their restraint fell off like a mantle from their shoulders and they rent the night air with three cheers for the lady and three more for landry

mildred looked at landry as she took her fathers arm  what great children they are she said

 you have made them very happy tonight landry returned and i thank you for helping me

dont thank me she said i feel selfish i am so happy i am happier than i have ever been

 i am so glad and the boys will not forget this you may rest assured we always try to have something like this for them before the fall roundup but there has been none like this

 the fall roundup what is that  we get together all the cattle twice a yearâin the spring and fall when we drive them from the ranges down into the valley next week is time for the fall driving

 oh may i see it 

it is a rather rough experience but i will try my best to help you to a sight of it you will go mr osborne 

 i shall be greatly interested  oh thank you landry goodnight

goodnight said landry and under his breath god bless you 

a whole week passed a happy week full of the joy of outdoor life for mildred she saw herself acquiring both gaiety and health the reward one gains by living near to natures heart she was not yet done babbling of the pleasure the concert had given her and her father went on smiling happy too and unseeing the poor man thought it really was the concert that had pleased his daughter and brought a light into her eyes and a thrill into her voice that he had never known there before now a girl may be of a very charitable disposition and mildred was such a one but there are certain effects on the feminine nature which even the joy of doing good cannot produce she had suddenly become more affectionate than usual with her father and she had fallen into the way of running to him on the impulse of the moment and throwing her arms around his neck with quick unaccounted for kisses her father called it pecking took it gladly and attributed it all to returning health â and the concert

the girl developed a hundred pretty little ways which notwithstanding her charm she had not possessed before she was as gay and as joyous as a bird and as irresponsible she went about the place singing and the men looked on and blessed her little mrs hendrickson adored her while her husbands admiration seriously interfered with his articulateness whenever the sprightly maiden was around meanwhile mildred herself had not analysed her feelings she was just glad glad as a robin is or a squirrel and she did not know that it was because landry was near her that her life was so much like a holiday she was content to take the joy without questioning whence it came but she was destined to an unpleasant awakening

when god is letting a revelation slowly illumine the mind and soul of one of his creatures there is too often some fool to rush in and anticipate his process this was the part upon which mrs annesley now entered although she was nearly three thousand miles away she felt what mr osborne on the spot could not see with the solicitude of the kindly intentioned destroyer she wrote mildred â  my dear child â i feel it my duty they always do feel it their duty to mention a thing which both your dear sister and myself have noticed in your last letters you know my dear mildred i am the last person in the world whom any one could accuse of being suspicious but there are certain circumstances which make me feel that i should be doing less than my duty to you as the daughter of my dear deceased sister did i fail to warn you of what i fear my dear who is this man landry and what are your relations with him are you aware child that you have spoken of him in every one of your last letters do you know that in the very last you called his name six times mildred felt that she knew just the manner in which her aunt would have shot that last question at her could she have been there in person and her face was suffused with angry blushes the letter went on from what i can understand from your letters the fellow is a common cowboy or i hesitate at the word â cowpuncher as i have heard them called dear let me beg you not to disgrace your family i have heard of young girls falling in love with such persons out of a mistaken sense of the romantic dont do it mildred think over what i have said and confide in me if necessary helen and i will come out to see after you helen may come now as mr berkeley has spoken i hope that i do not anticipate your sister in telling you this but she would have told you soon anyway

 one more thing my dear niece and i am done it has been brought to my ears that the women of colorado are advocating riding their horses astride horrors and have made an appeal to the country on the score of humanity oh mildred i cannot even contemplate the spectacle of a niece of mine astride a horse mrs annesley underscored her  astride  as she had done her questions about landry dont do it my dear propriety in a girl of your station is very much more necessary than humanity the poor can afford to be humane the rich cannot afford to be less than proper

 ask your dear blind father where his eyes are and believe me  your affectionate aunt anne annesley

mildred finished the letter and flinging it across the room burst into tears there should be a penalty imposed upon the old woman who wounds the maiden modesty of a young girl mildred cried for very shame but she was not without the temper to resent her aunts letter

aunt annesley she exclaimed through her tears is a meddling narrowminded old woman i in love with landry indeed and then she blushed so hotly that she hid her face in her arms and wept the more and in that moment it went very hard for landry the sins of mrs annesley were visited upon his head

 he is very presumptuous mildred thought  and no doubt took it for granted that i cared for him just because i was kind to him he has been no more than my groom and i d as soon think of marrying the butler oh how i hate aunt annesley

the girls pride was wounded to the quick and it is a quality which women and snakes have in common when wounded to strike regardless of reason at everything near and so mildred felt angry with every one about as being concerned in her humiliation she sat down and wrote a brief curt note to her aunt â my dear aunt it ran â i am exceedingly glad to hear that mr berkeley has proposed it relieves you of one great responsibility i can assure you also that i am not riding astride nor am i going to marry landry who has been little more than a faithful groom to me

that was all and it was unworthy of her but who can blame a young girl hurt as she was for being unjust to every one about her she read the note through again and again and the meanness of it struck her more and more each time finally she tore it into shreds i wont send it she cried  i wont send it she may think as she pleases

very sad and miserable she felt as she went outofdoors to the shelving roof which did duty as a porch and where her father was now sitting with his cigar

 why what is it my dear  exclaimed osborne  you re not looking well

im feeling very well she replied but ive been reading letters from home

and youre homesick well i dont wonder child but landry shall cheer you up

it was like a match to the fuse she turned upon her father all the pain of her resentment and humiliation flashing in her eyes and thrilling in her voice  i am sure papa i dont see why i must depend upon landry for amusement she said angrily

 why i thought you and he were such friends

we are not friends i am surprised that you want your daughter to make friends with the servants i have ridden with him because there was nothing else to do

why mildred said her father in surprise i am sorry if i have seemed to neglect you i â i â thought â   he stopped helplessly

 oh every one thinks she said a little brutally and then there was landry approaching swinging along with his swift easy stride she gave him one glance and then turned and went into the house

he saw the action and wondered what had he done to offend her he would rather his right arm were cut off than that he should give her pain he came up awkwardly and stammered a few commonplaces to mr osborne who was equally puzzled and embarrassed but his mind was with the girl who had so palpably turned her back upon him

what had he done what had he done he went away cursing himself for a blundering fool who had stupidly wounded the woman he loved and yet had not sense enough to know how he had done it

 at least civilisation has that much good in it he told himself that i could not wound a woman without knowing when and how but i ll find out i ll find out damn it if i have to crawl to her on my knees he did not know â how could he â that he was being made to suffer on account of a meddling old woman three thousand miles away

when mildred had gone in she instantly regretted the act and suffered in mind little less than landry himself after all it was not his fault he had possibly never thought of love in connection with her at all but she was conscious of no great pleasure in the thought she felt that she ought to be glad for of course it was impossible that she could be anything to him or he to her but nevertheless she was miserable and it was a miserable dinner that she ate that day in the afternoon she sat on the porch with her father and tried to be cheerful as was her wont but her cheerfulness had departed and she made but a sorry feint at it she wanted to be just to landry she wanted to make amends to him but she feared herself and was frightened if she even heard his step finally after several false alarms he did turn the corner of the house and start towards her oh if she could only fly of course he had seen her displeasure of the morning and would be sure to ask the cause of it and what could she say she wished he would nt be so fearfully direct he never hinted at a thing he always spoke straight out and there was no getting away from the point with him she had observed this before in him she bit her lips and waited because she dared not snub him again it was awful she could see his face now a sort of fascination held her eyes there were lines of pain about his mouth she had hurt him she knew and she did not know how to tell him why so the prayer went up from her soul that something might intervene to prevent their meeting

mildreds prayer was unexpectedly answered a wagon rattled up to the entrance and a man got out and stood for a moment talking to the driver then he turned and came hurriedly towards them landry had stopped and as the newcomer drew nearer turned his eyes first upon him and then upon mildred she felt the blood leave her face and in a moment she seemed to have lived the space of a century it was arthur heathcote

 awful of me to drop down on you in this way said heathcote after greeting them  but you know i ye been out this way before and i thought i d like to see the country again so here i am im so glad to see you miss osborne and you mr osborne  he lied very glibly but his face was red and he looked like a guilty schoolboy

osborne was frankly glad to see him but even mildred herself realised that her greeting was cold and formal

 thought maybe your people might put me up for a week or two of course i didnt know if they cant why ill be trotting along

 of course they can  said osborne heartily landry

landry came forward the two men were introduced each eyed the other as if taking stock of his strength and fighting ability

 wont you try to help us locate heathcote

 i shall be glad to said landry but his face belied him

they went into the house and the englishman was soon placed mrs hendrickson was overcome with joy at being able to oblige any friend of mr osbornes and they could and would put mr heathcote up for as long as he wanted to stay bo his luggage was brought in from the road and he settled himself like the thorough britisher he was at home wherever he took off his hat

after doing what he could for the new arrival landry came out of the house again but this time he did not go toward mildred he only bowed to her as he passed and went with set face out toward the barn

mildred could have wept from very grief and vexation she knew what he must think of her and her face burned he would believe that she had known of heathcotes proposed visit and had snubbed him that he might be conveniently out of the way oh the shame of it the meanness of her nature as he must see it she was glad that he had been proud enough to pass her by she could not respect a man who would stoop to a woman who had acted as contemptibly as she had appeared to act but then her thoughts took another turn he should not have thought it of her he had no grounds for believing her so low but then what did she care she didnt she knew she didnt care for she told herself soseveral times before arthur heathcote came out to talk to her

her feelings as she saw him approaching were a study even to herself she could not forget the bighearted englishmans simple kindness that wet september night when she had made the child the object of her impulsive charity she liked him but she was angry at his intrusion here she had been living so close to nature and now he had come smelling of civilisation â in her thoughts she unconsciously quoted landry â to break up her paradise perhaps her aunt had sent him maybe he knew about landry had he come to spy upon her actions  but she dismissed the thought as soon as it was formed that was not like heathcote but oh she wished he had not come however he was here and coming towards herr smiling now the sky that she had loved had lost its colour the sunset which she had looked at with landry beside her was devoid of glory everything seemed dull and gray to her and all because a foolish old woman had written a letter and an unwelcome lover had come at the wrong hour and a hardheaded girl had refused to listen to the dictates of her heart

 i am afraid miss mildred that you will think hardly of my racing out here

 i cannot blame you for wanting to see the country again i love it myself

 yes but i mean for coming out here after you

 surely that would not he fair unless you blamed me for coming before you  thats so but now youre laughing at me again indeed you are but you know i thought you wouldnt care if i just came

i am sure i dont

poor fellow he was helpless and inarticulate after that

of course you know why i came  you have already told me it was because you had been out here before and you wished to see the country again a very good reason for coming    oh come now heathcote protested  you know i was just telling a few then mildred you know why i came it was because i couldnt stay away from you i could nt take no for an answer 

 arthur she said sadly  you make it so hard for me

forgive me he broke in i dont want to persecute you really i did nt intend speaking until time for me to go away

 arthur she said again i do like you but wont you give up hoping or thinking that i will marry you i cannot i cannot

there was a decided set to arthur heathcotes chin as he replied  i will not give up hope until you are the wife of some other man but i wont persecute you i love you mildred and a love like mine is not to be daunted now lets not think any more of it while i am out here lets be good friends for i believe you when you say that you like me and we can have a pleasant unrestrained time if you will let me walk with you and ride with you you shall walk with me and you shall ride with me arthur and i wish i could say more

oh i have time he said and there was a shake in his voice in spite of the brave ring of it  and after that there is eternity then he laughed  oh i say i like your man landry although i cant understand him a cowboy who talks like a college man is something of a paradox you know

 that is not a strange thing every american is a paradox unless he happens to be an anglomaniac

 i like the paradoxes better its what we expect of americans i dont like this sudden turn for friendship and all that between us we havent got a soul now to whet our boys belligerent appetites against and whom have you 

oh we feel our loss as greatly as you do but then we have a little trouble on our hands

yes but thats only a brush inferiors never make good enemies a fellow could never have a real jolly fight with his valet he might kick the man but kicking a man is not fighting him

well you shouldnt complain at least england did find metal more attractive among the boers

 thats the reason she went to it like steel to the magnet

it was in this way that mildred and arthur talked on building up a wall of conversation behind which to hide â the girl with her torn heart and wounded pride the man hopeless in spite of his bravery saying bantering nothings while his face was white and drawn

landrys feelings were severely hurt when he supposed that mildred had merely made use of him and then tossed him away like a soiled glove it did not seem like her and his grief was not so much for himself as for the ideal he had had of her which was now shattered a man may lose faith in manhood and his nature suffer a severe wrench but for him to lose faith in womanhood which means to the average man one woman upon whom he has staked all his beliefs and hopes often proves the breaking of him

but hurt as he was it would not have been in landrys nature to sulk long he was too vigorous and direct and his love being stronger than his resentment he would eventually have gone to mildred and have had it out with her but it was reserved for heathcote unconsciously to hasten the event unconsciously yes not that he would not have done it knowingly had he been aware how matters stood

it was the morning after his arrival that he sought out landry where he was wandering disconsolately among the horses unable to conceal his unrest

i say mr landry  said heathcote im afraid im bothering you awfully you know but i want to see you for a moment

 here i am said landry not too pleasantly and then he added somewhat to soften the speech  and at your service

 i was thinking maybe you might help me to a mount i dont like to ask mr osborne you know as i dropped down on them rather unexpectedly and it seems mean to trouble them

landry in a moment was all alert  why i thought they were expecting you he said

 oh no neither of them knew anything about me until i turned up here

 i shall be glad to help you to a mount mr heathcote just come with me there was a sudden cordiality in landrys manner that quite took possession of heathcote in fact heathcote might have had all the horses on the ranch just at that moment with landrys joyous permission his troubles fell away from him as the black shadows fall from the mountains before the sun he was all life and heart again though he could not but blame himself for having doubted mildreds honesty even for a moment evidently he had offended her in some small way and he would go to her and find out what it was and make it all right his ideal was reinstated whole and without a blemish the goddess was again in her shrine and he was very happy

there was a great joy in heathcotes breast too for the mount with which landry provided him filled him with unspeakable admiration it was landrys own horse so generous was that young man she was a big roan rawboned and stronglimbed a small wellformed head was well set on her solid shoulders

 what a beauty what a beauty  said heathcote

 you ll find her as good as she is beautiful said landry with pardonable vanity

 my knees are really itching to be astride of her

 if you have nothing to do get on and try her

the next moment the englishman was in the saddle whence he beamed on landry the horse moved off at her easy gait this was too much for heathcote the pure air and the wide plain brings out the natural in a man and it was something of a reversion to primitive instincts when the delighted rider tossed his hand in the air and gave a whoop he would not have believed it possible had any one predicted it of him he felt the enthusiasm of a strong man for fine animals and dimly too something of the influence of the vast life about him he circled back to landry his face glowing and the gladness of a big unspoiled boy showing in his eyes

i say he exclaimed are you really going to let me ride her arent you depriving yourself now

 shes yours as long as you are here said landry  and im glad you like her

 mr landry said heathcote reaching down his hand as solemnly as if it were a ceremonial  if ever you come to england you shall have the finest horse in my stable

 thank you

the two men shook hands and were friends from that moment three things draw men close â to suffer to dare and to enjoy together and they found a fellowfeeling in their very gladness heathcote forgot the traditions of his people forgot to ask whence landry came whether he were cowboy stableman or what he only knew him for a good fellow they were two strong clean men face to face each drunk with the joy of living and loving what more was needed to make them friends

the englishman rode away towards the ranchhouse and his friend looked after him he saw a fine rider and a fine man such a one as might have taken any womans heart captive

 itll be a hard fight said landry musingly but it will be a square one and if i lose ill have the satisfaction of losing to a worthy fellow oh well â  and he fell athinking

it was because of all this that mildred osborne had the misfortune to grow very angry that morning

heathcote came riding toward her and she saw that he sat landrys horse resentment flashed instantly into her heart  landry has no right to deprive himself maybe he thinks it will please me then she stopped saying things to herself and said  goodmorning  in response to heathcotes bow

 your man landry â  he began

 pardon me mr heathcote she broke in but he is not my man landry mr landry is a gentleman and quite our equal she did nt know why she said it for she did not know anything about the antecedents of landry

  oh beg pardon miss mildred i might have known that americans are so eccentric you know but the fact of the matter is that i never stopped to think what landry was

i only knew that he was a fine fellow i was just going to say that he loaned me his horse dont you think she is a fine animal 

 she is and he is so attached to her that i really dont know what he ll do without her

 thats right and im a selfish beast ill go straight â 

 oh no no you wont do anything of the kind he would feel very much hurt

 oh but i cant help it its not fair to take such a mount from a fellow and he was turning as he spoke

please dont pleaded mildred  please dont for my sake that is she stammered  he would never forgive me for speaking

but he shant know that you have spoken

he was looking at her keenly and with a question in his eyes she blushed furiously under his gaze and fingered her dress nervously as she spoke

 perhaps you dont know but landry mr landry is very eccentric

 indeed 

 oh yes

if he would only stop looking at her in that way she knew that her face was guilty and that she was fast getting angry again both with herself and with her inquisitor

 then if you insist i shall not take the horse back i shall go for a spin wont you come with me 

i shall not ride this morning she returned

 is it wrong for me to remind you of your promise 

 i have not forgotten my promise but i shall not ride this morning

 i must bid you goodmorning then i cannot lose the pleasure of this horses gait even for so fair a lady as yourself and laughing he rode away leaving her there helplessly embarrassed and with the idea knocking at her consciousness that she had made something of a fool of herself

landry found her still sitting on the porch when he came up a little later while she would not own it to herself the girl had practically been waiting and wishing for him but now she was frightened at his approach

 may i sit down  he said after greeting her

 to be sure she answered you know we are all generosity here we give people our horses and let them sit on their own chairs

 the horse was nothing but a chair here is everything i have offended you wont you tell me how and forgive me 

 but you have not offended me landry why should you think so  she felt how deceitful she was even as she said it

i am so glad he said humbly  but you turned your back on me yesterday

 it was very rude of me was nt it but that was not on account of anything you had done i had received a letter â  she hesitated  â and it provoked me very much of course i had no right to take it out on you but then landry you dont know women very well do you 

 i dont know anything except that i am the happiest man on earth let s go for a ride he added abruptly

 no i dont want to ride since you havent your horse

 then lets walk its too glorious to sit still

he must have meant all he said for his face showed it

 ill walk with you and she ran into the house to get her hat why was the day suddenly bright again and why were her feet so light it was because she had righted a wrong she soberly told herself that was the reason too that she came out singing

 ive been so miserable said landry as they strolled along the cactusdotted land i â i â had thoughts

 a very rare thing for a young man she answered laughingly

but you dont know he went on gravely  i wronged you greatly in my mind

 i knew what you thought she said but you were wrong i am not that kind she had grown serious in an instant

i might have known that you were not i was blind then but i am wise now and because of my wisdom i know why mr heathcote has come here

 mr heathcote is a friend of the family

 mr heathcote loves you and so do i and i want to know my fate now mildred will you marry me 

she had known that it was coming and yet it was a great shock to her she could not look at him as she said tremulously  i cannot marry you mr landry

why not he asked simply do you love some one else  you have no right to ask that question but i do not mind answering you no but i cannot marry you first because i do not love you why i hardly know you

 then it has meant nothing to you â our companionship and it meant so much to me you speak of hardly knowing me and yet you have so filled my heart and life that i can hardly think of a time when i did not know and love you

oh landry please dont she cried piteously  i did so want to be friends with you her aunts letter and her aunts horror burned into her mind like a flame she stole a glance at his face and it was tender but sad so sad

in the moment a great hatred grew up within her for her aunt and all the conventions of her set and kind even if she had loved landry society had set a barrier between them here was her aunts cowboy with a vengeance the humour of the situation struck her and she burst out laughing the man looked at her with sorrow and indignation in his eyes but in a moment he understood for she was as quickly possessed by a passion of tears

 forgive me he said  i have hurt you i wont say any more about it â now he added firmly come lets go back

she did not answer she only wept the more for she felt that all she loved all she wanted all that in life was worth having was slipping away from her grasp but she could not check it there stood king convention  this was his decree

she dried her eyes as they went back toward the house he walking disconsolately by her side

she turned to him as they reached the porch  landry she said you will always be my friend 

 i shall always be your friend and lover he said taking her hand and then he turned away toward his own apartment

mildred hurried to her room and threw herself upon the bed the blessed tears came again to relieve her and then she sat up crying softly for fear the very walls would hear  landry landry you are worth some womans love but who are you 

it was strange that in landrys grief at mildreds refusal of him there was no anger at the girl herself he remembered her distress and her tears and felt only deep pity and a more overwhelming love for her

 she loves no one else she said and i believe her landry mused when he was alone well then why shouldnt she love me she doesnt know me thats true i might be a horsethief or a pickpocket for all she knows to the contrary shes right she has the right to know more about me and i was a blundering ass to ask her to take me for granted but can i tell her everything can i explain to her  a hard wrinkle came into the mans brow as he thought the secret is not mine wholly but i have lost faith in humanity on account of it now shall i lose the love of my life for this same reason great god is there no limit to what i must sufferâloss ignominy shame and now this 

he clenched his hands and the great beads broke out on his forehead then as was his wont when he wished to think he saddled a horse and went galloping away

the land was full of the brisk sweet smells of autumn the plain fell away in a gray barren line that held up a turquoise dome the little groundbirds scarcely discernible against the grass so like themselves skipped away before bis horses feet but landry saw nothing neither landscape sky nor birds he felt nothing not even the rush of the wind as he swept across the prairie

surrounded by the things which he knew and loved and was wont to observe he was as utterly alone with his own thoughts as if he had suddenly been lifted out of the life of this earth and placed where there were only himself and his soul he was doubly isolated in that his was the isolation both of great grief and deep thought on his face were all the marks of the struggle that was going on within him his eyes were cold and bright and his cheeks flushed though his hands held the reins firmly and there was not the quiver of a muscle in his face like a man turned to iron he rode and rode

every now and then unconsciously he dug his heel into the horses side as if moving swiftly though he was he could not keep pace with the hard hot gallop of his thoughts so he went for an hour and then without warning turned homeward again the strained look in his eyes was gone and his whole attitude was one of relaxed force but there was still on his face the expression of a man who has made a vital decision and who will carry out his plan to the last extreme he bent over and stroked the horses damp neck

 i will do it he said  he shall not take this from me

with him when a decision was once made there was no turning back as soon as he reached his room he sat down and wrote the following letter â  dear miss mildredâ i know now the folly i showed in asking you to marry me about whom you know absolutely nothing five years ago i should have known better but i have been away from civilisation so long that i have forgotten some of its demands and conventions i had thought that if two people cared for each other that was all and there were no other questions to be asked or answered i confess that i was wrong and that my theory would only do for a more primitive state of life than this to which you and i belong but i do not blame you because i blundered and so whether or not it affects the issue i am going to answer the questions which if you cared for me you must have asked

 i remember that you once repeated the remark that people only came out here on account of crime cupidity or consumption it seems proper that the world should usually take it for granted that the first of these most commonly drives a man to this life but it was not so in my case at least i am not a criminal the story is a long one and i should prefer telling it to you to writing it i should beg your permission to do so except that when i talk to you i lose my head and say the things that i do not want to say

 the secret which i disclose here is not as you will see entirely my own and i need not ask in mercy to all concerned that it go no further than the ear of your father who also has the right to know

in the first place my name is not landry that is it is not my surname but my mothers name by which i choose to be known out here my full name is landry thayer and i was born in philadelphia twentyeight years ago my mother died when i was young and all my boyish love was given to my elder brother john and to my father my first great grief came with the death of the latter who had always been a tender and indulgent parent to me

 i mourned for him sincerely but the buoyancy of youth soon overcame my sorrow and i turned to my brother now all that was left to me with the whole wealth of my affection he loved me in return and so it was a great wrench when finishing my course in the city schools i went away to the massachusetts institute of technology we were wealthy my brother managed the estates but i had my ambition i was determined to be one of the worlds workers and engineering took my fancy i wanted to build bridges i wanted to dig tunnels i am making irrigation ditches now but even that is part of my plan you will laugh at this wont you  but its straight

 well before i left for school i noticed that my brother cared for or seemed to care for a very beautiful frivolous girl who was at that time dominating philadelphia society and who had a dozen men in her train i did not like her and told my brother so he flew into a fury called me an impudent young cub and bade me never speak her name again on my knees and with tears in my eyes i begged his forgiveness i was younger then he barely forgave me and with a sore heart i went to school one day i received a card that cut me like a knife and when i came back he was married

i hated her  with all my heart i hated her she had taken from me all that i had â my brother he was cold and stern with me now where he had always been loving and kind before well i suppose that i was a young fool and precipitated matters but i did not exert myself to be agreeable to my sisterinlaw after a while she told my brother that i was a sullen young fellow and made her very unhappy the result was another scene and my brother who i believe loved his wife sincerely forbade me the house which he as the elder had inherited

 he packed me out bag and baggage and i went into lodgings but still i did not blame him and even when i went back to school i only felt that i was a jealous young fool who deserved my brothers anger and god knows i was jealous for his had been the only love outside a fathers that i had ever known at college there was an allowance ample for all my wants for i was not extravagant all went well and i grew enthusiastic over my work it is a great work after all i was looking forward with joy to my christmas vacation when i could go home and be reconciled to him it was then the blow fell upon me i received a letter from him my brother my only one saying since things are as they are would it not be better if we do not meet so i would be glad if you spent your vacations from home you do not know how it hurt me even now i feel the terrible searing of it my brother my own brother turned against me and asking me not to come to my fathers house  i had thought the other disagreement only temporary but this was final

 i was proud and i did not go back nor did i write to him occasionally in the papers i saw reports of the magnificence of his entertainments and i was glad for i loved and trusted him still though i hated her

then i heard that he had sailed for europe i was glad because he had always wanted to see the wonders of the old world  john has gone away i told my chum  im glad because he always wanted to see the things over there  its a pity said my chum  im sorry for his wife  i need not say what i did to jack alston only since he knows that i did not know then he has forgiven me and writes to me now and i love him he is building a bridge somewhere

 after jack had given me this cue i went and looked further the papers said that my brother had left suddenly without his wife and that there were rumors of irregularities in his handling of my fathers estate

 they were lies all lies and i knew it so i rushed home to refute them in my fathers house at the door out of which i had seen carried the man who had fathered us both i met that woman

  oh its you she said when the servant had taken her my card its awful about john isnt it not a thing left   you re a liar you re a liar  i cried  â and a thief too and a murderess  and i flung out of the hall and down the steps

  heavens the man is mad  i heard her say as i was going

 but the rest is hardly worth the telling my brother had gone from one excess to another entertaining speculating until he had been tempted to touch what was not his then my fortune â i blessed him for sparing me so long â had gone to make up the deficiency then he had left out of all my fathers estate save what that woman had there were scarcely five thousand dollars left i could not stand the grief of it she showed me a letter from him saying that had i not proved ungrateful â ungrateful  â it would have been better i do not believe he wrote it now

 with this and the money that i had left i came west because i could not bear the sight and sound of the things that had driven my brother to crime they did drive him they did drive him for i knew him when he was square a year later i heard that he was dead â had shot himself at monaco his widow is married

 that is why i hate civilisation and you are the first one who has ever called me back to it do not judge my brother too harshly he was not so much to blame as the devilish deceitful strenuous civilisation that drove him to his death

with the little money i have prospered some cripple creek was kind to me and this ranch calls me one of its masters mildred darling you know my story forgive me if i have given you more than usual of â  landry

this letter mildred received next morning from the hand of tod she dropped her tears upon it as she read then she arose and went to her father

papa she said landry has proposed to me and i â 

 landry 

 â and i refused him here is his letter

the old man got up the colour in his face rising in anticipation as it were of occasion

 whyâ then he began to read the letter as he read the anger died from his face and the teardrops fell on his ruddy wrinkled cheeks they fell as freely as the girls

do you love him he asked when he had finished

no answered mildred firmly and then i dont think i do

 i am almost sorry said her father for landryâah â landry is a very big man but i suppose its heathcote well â  heathcote snapped mildred i hate heathcote and she swept from the room

she hates heathcote  said mr osborne  what a remarkable girl yesterday it was landry

for some reason or other quite unrelated to love mildred had cried herself to sleep over landrys letter she thought it was because she pitied him in his sorrow when they met again she told him so and he was more miserable than ever because she gave him pity when he wanted love

they tried to resume their old relations but utterly without success there was always between them a subtle embarrassment the shadow of his refusal

so the days went by until the time for the roundup landry kept his promise to mildred and saw that arrangements were made for her to ride out to see the cattle when they were to be driven down into the valley heathcote had begged to be allowed to ride with the men and permission had been granted to him he was as happy as a boy although he had sacrificed his own inclination and forced landry to take back his horse for the work

it was noon of a monday when the men set out for the broad valley into which the cattle were to be driven down from the ranges with heathcote there were eleven of them in all â brawny rawboned fellows bronzed by the sun and wind hard riders hard swearers but faithful to their duty and fearless in the discharge of it it was near evening when they reached their destination the horses were unharnessed from the grubwagon as soon as it came up with them and after supper they camped for the night resting for the next days riding

they were up the following morning and with three men left at camp were away into the hills all day long they rode the ranges cleaning them out as with a great evermoving comb and the cattle streamed down into the valley it was an allday undertaking and not yet done when mildred came in the evening the buckboard brought her and her father and her pony jack trotted behind it was a wonderful sight to her and she was much grieved that landry insisted upon her and her fathers camping so far away from the herd that night it seemed to make of them only spectators when she wished to he part and parcel of it but landry knew as she did not the words of the songs the cowboy sings as he gallops by night round and round his cattle

stirred with the novelty of the situation mildred was up in the morning with the earliest of them it was a glorious day all goldenbrowns yellows and blues the mist hung heavy over the mountains but for miles along the plain the air was as clear as the water of a mountain stream it was one of those hot days which come to colorado even as late as november it was very still save for the calling of the men one to another as the drove of cattle eight hundred strong went milling round and round the valley all the night before the men had circled the herd singing their interminable songs to reassure them but today the animals were nervous the smell of water in the bottom of a dry wash which ran across the end of the valley at its entrance made them restive and every now and then one would break away and dash forward only to be followed by one of the boys and driven back to his fellows they snorted and bellowed and pushed one upon the other their horns crashed and waved a short bristling terrible forest and their brown or brindled sides gleamed in the sun it was hard work keeping them together

to the front and left of the churning herd landry was riding his face gloomy and sad behind him on the same side rode heathcote while directly opposite on her favourite pony was mildred near her landry had placed a cowboy to see that no ill came to her

he looked uneasily across at mildred and then glanced at the nervous steers

i wish she hadnt come he muttered  its the day and the place for a nasty stampede a big steer far to the front bellowed and sniffed the air landry rode quickly forward and the long thong of his quirt curled about the great fellows neck and the column moved on as before it was nearly seven oclock in the morning and while some of the men were busy keeping the cattle from breaking away others were preparing to cut out the beef steers for shipping and the late calves for branding

a wind sprang up and it seemed that the heat of the atmosphere was about to abate landry breathed freer and again his glance wandered over to the girl he loved he caught her eye and she smiled at him he felt as if she had laid a cooling hand upon his brow

mildred was a spectacle to call forth the admiration of a man who loved her even less than did landry her gray habit fitted snugly her girlish form and a soft felt hat with an eagle feather on the side sat jauntily on her brown head she was joyous with the movement and life about her and glad with a feeling of sufficiency which came to her as she turned her pony this way and that her father had felt some misgivings about her coming but she had pleaded so hard and had looked so beautiful as she begged that he had kissed her and told her to go while he remained with the grubwagon not far away he knew that with two such protectors as landry and heathcote she could hardly come to harm

she was going gaily along and the glow on her face made landrys heart leap then in a second it all happened a bunch of steers broke away toward the water one by one of the ringing multitude joined them until in a few minutes the whole herd had joined in the wild rush toward the boxcanon

 stampeded   was the one word that mildreds cowboy protector expelled from his lips as he galloped away from her side the cattle were racing like mad down the valley making a seething caldron of bubbling hacks

the girl saw what had happened her face went white but a sudden thought took her and digging her heel into the ponys side with set face she went flying after the maddened steers bending steadily to the right she had heard that in such a case the thing to do was first to try and turn them and then to get the cattle milling and she felt that she herself might help to do it but the cattlemen all forgetful of her had swept round to the left of the herd and were trying to turn them to the right for they knew just how far back lay the deep dry run and what it meant if their raging charges reached that they had seen such sights before when the cattle which made their life and the existence of the ranch possible went headlong into the steep cut and piled one upon the other a groaning bellowing quivering mass of struggling flesh they had seen the cut filled until the rear guard of the herd had passed over on a bridge of their dead fellows so it was no wonder that they forgot the girl and went galloping wildly to the left of the throng even heathcote became infected with the insanity of the men around him and the terrible whirl of the whole scene he put whip and spur to his horse and swept on with them on on they went to the left bearing the enraged steers to the right turning them ever from the ditch of death but mildred unconscious of what they were doing only knowing and feeling the thought that dominated her own soul raced up behind the herd still bearing to the right and on to her death let the steers but turn and they would sweep over her and she would be as utterly lost as a scrap of paper in the mad breath of the cyclone only one grayfaced man took in the situation landry had started with the men but two hundred yards down the valley he saw her and for the time that the glance took him his heart stood still  my god  he cried  what is the girl doing and then without further time for thought he cut straight across to the right behind the herd and went racing after her it was only a matter of time a trial of speed between him and the pony she rode a race between love and death down the valley the girl rode and he after her the distance between them was wide for he had to cross the whole width of the herd but he felt himself gaining at every leap of the roan mares brawny legs then did he thank god that heathcote had given him back his own good mount no other horse could have done it could have overtaken the lithe little pony galloping so madly ahead  great god  he said will they yet have time to turn before i reach her  and he called to his horse with a prayer that was half an oath the brown prairie burned under the roans feet mildred did not look back she rode as one rides who has a purpose and that purpose quickly to be accomplished they were nearing the cut now he could see a straggly tree or two which grew upon its sides  mildred mildred    he cried out but the wind blew his voice behind him and laughed in his face then landry swore deeply and the next moment uttered a prayer to heaven and struck his horse until the spurs drew blood from her foaming sides on on they pressed the cattle on the left the roan flew and landry was gasping and his breath came hard between shut teeth his eyes were wild as he came nearer nearer they were turning now and there were a hundred yards between them he swept up and stretched out his hand for the ponys bridle but just then the deep hole of a prairie dog reached out and caught the ponys off forefoot he stumbled mildred swayed in her saddle landrys hand forgot the goal to which it had started as he rode up to her side he threw his arm around her waist and dragged her willynilly from her saddle throwing her rudely but safe across the pommel of his own then his knees pressed the sides of the roan mare and she obedient turned sharply to the right they were just in time mildreds pony floundered and attempted to rise just then the herd swerved suddenly further to the right and in a moment the little beast who had so lately borne the girl was beaten beneath a hundred hoofs

with tears of excitement in his eyes and curses of pure joy that took the place of prayers and thanksgivings on his lips landry slowed his horse and rode back toward the grubwagon he looked down into mildreds face it was white as death itself could have painted it she had fainted he bent above her and a groan forced itself from the depths of his very soul  i have hurt her he cried but she will live she will live thank god 

he rode as swiftly as he could back to the wagon where her father was waiting mr osborne saw them coming mildred lying as one dead across the saddle he rose pale and trembling as landry drew up what have you done to my child  he said in a voice so low that it was scarcely audible

 i have brought her back to you said landry  she is hurt a little but she is safe take her  and putting the girl into her fathers arms he turned his horse and went swiftly back to his duty

with the help of the drivers the grubwagon was cleared and mildred was laid on a bed made of the mens coats nina was wringing her hands in the excess of helpless grief but hendrickson who had seen it all rode up knowing and helpful her shoulder was wrenched it was not a great affair and he set himself at once to put it in place and to bandage it

it is not so much he said to mr osborne  she is greatly shaken up hut she is young and will soon be well

but the old man only bent above his daughter crying  oh mildred mildred have i brought you out here for this 

on the girls face there was no sign of life but the set expression still lay about her lips  will she live  asked mr osborne

 oh yes said hendrickson she will live she is not greatly hurt it will be a little painful but she will live

 if she recovers from this i shall take her home at once her father said his anger at himself growing that he had allowed her to run into such great danger

she is a brave young woman said hendrickson  i am glad that landry saw her in time

 landry landry he has saved my daughter to me i wonder what i can do to reward him

the big ranchmanager smiled  i think your daughter will know better than you he said

osborne looked at him dully as if hardly comprehending  he is a big fellow he said i have always told her so

mildreds eyelids fluttered with returning consciousness

when mildred regained consciousness she found herself lying in the grubwagon with nina beside her the wagon had been substituted for the buckboard as being easier for her to recline in

 what has happened nina  she asked  i remember about the stampede and â and â mr landry but was i hurt was i injured in anyway   not unto death miss said nina solemnly but mr hendrickson he says your shoulder s out o place an while you was insensible he set it an he says youll soon be all right but the pony oh miss you should see the pony 

 it was killed 

 ah miss mildred killed was no name for it it was pulverized  what are they going to do with me now  asked the girl a shudder passing over her frame at the thought of the poor animal

 they re going to start to the ranchhouse with you as soon as you dare move

 tell them nina that i want to see the spot dont say pony whatever you do â the spot where it occurred

nina went upon her errand and mildred settled back with tears of pain and humiliation in her eyes

 i wanted to do something big because i felt strong and capable and i knew he looked at me with contempt and oh how it has turned out it only leaves me his debtor â his debtor and with repetition the thought did not seem so bitter  well he did his part he was very brave and noble even if i cannot love him i can respect him

then her father put his anxious face in at the door  so youve come around all right my dear hendrickson said you would really hes quite a surgeon are you in much pain 

my shoulder does hurt very much papa but that doesnt matter im sorry i gave you so much anxiety dont say a word my child i shall have you taken back at once to the ranchhouse but nina tells me that you want to see the spot where the accident occurred i dont believe i would if i were you my dear

 i want to see it papa and if they cannot take me i shall walk

 there there dont excite yourself my child you shall see it we will go by it on our way home

he signalled to the men and one galloped ahead while the other started the horses which had been harnessed to the wagon to await any turn which mildreds injury might take

as nina sat down beside her mistress mildreds face flushed and paled by turns and she looked into the maids eyes wistfully

 what is it miss mildred  asked nina gently

 nothing snapped mildred going all red again did i ask for anything 

 no miss but i thought you looked like you wanted something

 no she replied more gently but my shoulder does hurt so

 you poor dear child  said nina easing the wounded part

 i hope mildred went on that poor mr landry isnt suffering this way

deceitful is the human heart but its the eye that usually gives it away  and so nina saw nothing for at that moment her mistress eyes were closed in a spasm of pain

la miss she exclaimed  him asufferin why he was nt hurt at all 

the eyes suddenly flew open almost too suddenly for honesty and the sufferer cried eagerly wasnt he oh im so glad  and then a telltale look came into her eyes and they were closed again in pain

when the wagon had stopped at the spot to which mildred indicated she wished to go she raised the flap with her uninjured hand and looked out of the opening there was nothing there except the marks of many hoofs and a space covered with grass and sage

she knew at once what it was

 uncover it she said

no no mildred protested her father he had sent the man on for that purpose knowing what the sight would be

 i want to see him she persisted

 but miss said the man who had ridden on ahead  it aint a pleasant sight for a young lady

 thats why i want to see it

mildred 

 papa must i get out and do it myself  

mr osborne nodded to the men and they began to uncover the flat soft something that had once been the pony the hoofs of eight hundred cattle had beaten its flesh almost into the soil mildred gazed at it and i should have been like that she said thank you come papa and she lay down again very white poor pony poor little jack i rode him to his death but i hope his spirit will forgive me for i didnt mean to i wonder if horses have souls or spirits  she asked nina a bit later

and nina answered  im sure i dont know miss never havin studied such things

as soon as they were back at the ranchhouse where much ado was made both of mildred and of the event of the morning mr osborne came into his daughters room to see if she needed anything beyond ninas ministrations

papa she asked mr landry was very brave today wasnt he  not only brave but decisive my dear a moments delay would have lost you to me forever that man has the making of a general in him  do you think so 

 mildred my child you speak of it so apathetically the man saved your life and i want you to thank him with all your heart

 i was just going to suggest something of the kind send him to me as soon as he comes remember papa as soon as he comes

 yes my dear

 and now im going to try to sleep

she closed her eyes until her father had left the room then she opened them very wide and lay gazing into l space

poor jack she sighed and poor landry one i killed and the other i wounded well i shall see him tomorrow

but it was three days before landry saw her for when the message came he was still away with the cattle and the captain of the roundup could not or would not spare him

when he arrived and came into her room she was sitting at her window and rose to greet him one arm was in a sling but she extended the well hand to him

 it was good of you to come she said and she felt just how flat and commonplace the words must sound

 i could not do otherwise said landry a little stiffly although after he had dropped her hand his own had gripped convulsively as he looked upon her pain

i â i â went up to see the pony oh  she put her hand over her face as if to shut out the sight

landry flushed angrily

 who was fool enough to take you up there  he said

 i made them she answered

 i would rather you had nt seen it it wasnt a pretty sight

 but it was an instructive one it told me what i would have been like had you let my folly take its course

 i dont know about that i guess you were all right

 it told me too what you had done for me

 that was nothing any fellow that knew anything about horses and cattle â 

she waved him into silence and he stood abashed holding his hat like a scolded schoolboy

 i know i know she said  but what i want you to understand is that it was not all wantonness on my part my galloping after them as i did no hear me out for you cannot do not understand after i saw that they had stampeded i suddenly remembered what you had once told me of the method to be pursued and i was possessed with the idea of helping to do it so i raced after them in hopes that i could turn them or start them â what do you call it âgrinding or ringing

a shade of a smile came into the mans eyes but his lip quivered with a deeper emotion and the impulse was very strong upon him to take the poor little wounded girl into his arms and strain her to his breast but he remembered thursday and held himself back

 your ambition was very noble miss mildred he said and it sounded very mean to him after it was out though  god knows he told himself  i did not intend it so it was very foolish and reckless mildred went on  but then i did so want to see a roundup and when i saw those cattle making for the dry wash i knew what it meant and i wanted to help of course i did nt know how and i made a silly spectacle of myself but i did want to do something worthy and â and â i only made you risk your life

 that was nothing you were perfectly right miss mildred and no one blames you in the least it was such an accident as might happen anywhere there are no serious consequences attached to it save the pain you suffer but that will pass and thank god you were nt killed landry blurted it out before he could check himself but in a moment he saw his mistake and went on calmly  your father would never have forgiven us if you had been trampled out there

 landry i know i owe my life to you how can i thank you what can i do to pay the debt 

the young man threw up his head and there was a light in his eyes that she had never seen there before then with a bow that was his heritage from some old virginia grandfather he replied consider the debt cancelled miss mildred and turning hastily on his heel left the room

he is angry with me mildred murmured  i did everything but scorn him  and she sat down crying softly but bitterly

she was filled with both sorrow and anger she would not admit to herself that she loved landry and had done wrong to refuse him she attributed all her misery to her inability to show him her gratitude had the young rancher returned even then and renewed his question it is doubtful that she would have told him yes unconsciously perhaps but nevertheless dangerously she was playing with her own feelings and his

her mood of grief was succeeded by one of distinct pettishness i am sure she thought  i can t go on my knees to him to thank him for what he has done i do appreciate it and i have tried to tell him so what does he expect oh well i do hope papa will satisfy him and express all that i cannot

she knew perfectly that her father couldnt and wouldnt but it pleased her to he perverse even to try to deceive herself

some one knocked at the door and nina came in  please miss mildred she said  mr heathcote gave me these for you  these  was a bunch of brilliant red and white roses

 put them on the table nina

yes miss can i do anything for you 

 no go

evidently miss was cross and nina went

 i suppose he sent all the way to denver for these she said handling the flowers  i wish he wouldnt now if â  she blushed furiously all alone as she was and threw the offending flowers into one corner of the room where they lay the white and the red like a pale girl bleeding she sat down and brooded awhile and then relenting picked up the flowers and replaced them in a vase

woman is a strange creature and there is no accounting for her moods and this is hereby acknowledged or else one would be helpless before this one for suddenly mildred burst out laughing and flying to the couch hid her head in a pillow rising at last to exclaim  well i dont care if i do and to sit looking with dreamy eyes into the fire and a smile on her lips

meanwhile landry in passing out had encountered mr osborne who was in wait for him

my dear landry exclaimed the old man holding out both his hands  how can i ever thank you for the great thing you have done for me words are so poor

dont mention it said landry  it was nothing

 perhaps you may regard it as nothing but it was everything to me there was deep pathos in mr osbornes voice and great earnestness and landry looking at him said bitterly in his soul  perhaps i do regard it too lightly but aloud he said i am glad to have been able to serve you mr osborne

 i hope my daughter has thanked you

oh she has thanked me was the grim reply

 i fear she has hardly said all that she wishes to say or that she feels

she is like me there my dear boy i cant say what i feel just take it for granted and if ever i can do you a service no matter how great just call on me i am your servant

 dont mention it said landry hastily and he bolted

 that is a very remarkable young man said mr osborne gently i fear mildred has not fully expressed her gratitude to him i must see   so he went to mildred

he found her still musing before the fire with the smile on her face and a wrinkle between her brows when he told her his beliefs and fears she put her arm around his neck and drew him down to her

 you re a dear old papa she said and that was all the answer he ever got

and landry went off to be miserable by himself

it was not exactly anger that had driven landry from mildreds presence with high head and flashing eyes he felt that resentment against fate which a man feels when his sorrows are not the fault of any particular person he had left the presence of the woman he loved less because her inadequate thanks provoked him than from the fear that the words which were tugging at his heart would strain up and burst from his lips

all thats over now he told himself bitterly  i cant go to her now like the hero of a dime novel and ask her hand in return for her life it would be cowardly and it would be mean so be went moping miserably about all his enthusiasm in life dead or dormant

he consistently avoided mr osborne and mildred much to the formers surprise and the latters grief mr osborne knew landry so little as to think now that he had so great a claim that he would renew his suit and successfully for he believed that mildreds gratitude must ripen into love for her saviour

mildred frankly hoped that he would speak again but knowing him better she expected it less it was strange now that repression intensified her feelings she saw her lover but little but she thought of him only the more the vision of him was ever before her and she remembered with a pleasure so keen that it was almost pain the innumerable little acts of kindness and consideration that had unconsciously endeared him to her she missed their long rides together and all the details of their sweet companionship fearing that before she had held him too cheaply she now placed an unwarrantably high value upon him

so the days went on and still landry did not come to her when one day her father approached her with a letter in his hand his face was very grave and his voice shook as he said â  mildred i have just received a letter from your aunt

the girl looked up apprehensively

 your aunt writes me that she fears that i have not kept a fathers eye upon you and that you are being allowed to be too much in the company of a very low person â in fact as your aunt puts it a horrible cowboy

mildred was looking angrily at her father now but her anger was not for him

pray went on the old man  whom does she mean  

 she means the cowboy who saved my life a little while ago

she â sheâcannot mean landry  

 she does and she has written me before about it

 hum said mr osborne gently but with an annoyed look  your aunt is a very remarkable person i shall write to her i shall tell her his voice was rising that landry thayer is a gentleman and my friend and the equal of any man i ever knew

 oh papa and mildreds head was hidden on her fathers waistcoat somewhere in the region of the heart

he held her off and looked at her blushing face

 is it so   he asked

 yes and has been for a longtime but i did nt know

he took his daughter very gently in his arms and kissed her saying  i am very glad

meanwhile landry knowing nothing of the happiness in store for him and hoping nothing had determined to go further into the mountains for a shoot with heathcote that amiable young englishman still lingered and rode drove and shot with the joy that only a true sportsman can know the friendship between him and landry had increased and when the latter was not mooning about they were always together

mildred had been seeing almost as little of the one as she had of the other it was heathcotes plan to give her a respite from his importunities and maybe he thought she would come round to his way of thinking he had decided now on his return from his hunting trip to go directly east so the day before the start was to be made he came to her once more

she saw his purpose in his eyes and would have saved him this final humiliation but he would speak

 i hope im not boring you too much he said humbly but i have kept silent as long as i can and on my return i shall go directly east so i thought maybe you would nt mind giving me my answer now

she looked at him with shining eyes and he took a moments hope which was destined to be dashed immediately

 arthur my good friend she said  i will not keep you in suspense i cannot say to you what i said a little while ago for now i do love another i thank you for the honour you do me for it is an honour to be loved by such a man

he bowed and she gave him her hand he was turning away when suddenly a light broke through the gloom of his face and he came back to her eagerly

 i say he began awkwardly  it could nt be old landry you know 

 it is landry she said firmly

thats good thats good he said with a ring of honesty in his voice id rather him than anybody else except myself i congratulate you both he stood pumping her hand and smiling down at her though there lurked a sadness in his eyes

  there â there â is nothing to congratulate me about landry asked me before the stampede and then i did not know so i refused him he has not asked me since

heathcote gazed at her for a moment in silence and then he turned abruptly and left the room

 what are you going to do  she cried

but he did not answer and she sat down suddenly laughing and crying both together

there was no mistaking heathcotes purpose and mildred was filled with a great gladness while her heart quivered with fright landry would know he would know that she loved him and would come to her had she been unmaidenly to take this method to let him know

meanwhile heathcote was striding along at a great gait he burst into the door of the room where landry sat cleaning a gun

 you blooming ass cried heathcote snatching the rifle from his friends hands you blooming idiotic ass

all right said landry  whats the matter you re getting your hands full of oil

 why dont you go to her  said heathcote

landry suddenly stood up his nostrils dilated with excitement

 what do you mean  he asked

 she loves you blurted the other ive just asked for her hand its about the seventh time i think

shell never marry me old chap you re the man

how do you know 

landry was trembling like a leaf  never mind how i know im not telling secrets heathcote hadshown remarkable reticence it must be admitted you go to her and thank your god its you

i cant do it old man said the ranchman sadly taking his seat

 cant do it why what the â why man youve got to do it

i cant i cant and how i wish i could

heathcote stared at him with wide uncomprehending eyes

well i ll beâ look here will you tell me why

 dont you see heathcote that she has made it impossible for me to marry her or even to ask her why damn it man if i should take her now it would look as if i had bought that sweet girls life by an act of cheap heroism cant you see that in his excitement landry sprang up and seized his friends arm

 if any one else spoke of your act in that tone and that manner said heathcote slowly i should knock him down you did a great thing a big thing and you saved a womans life besides she loves you go to her

 i have told you why i cannot go heathcote put his hands upon his friends shoulders and looked him squarely in his eyes

 you re a damned fool he said  and all kinds of an idiot in the bargain but youre the biggest man ive ever met you may call me a meddler or what you please but i m not going to let you suffer and make a woman suffer simply because god did not choose to give you a fair amount of honest british vanity and he was out of the rooift in an instant

it was with strangely confused feelings that mildred saw the englishman coming back to her what was the matter why did not landry come to her was his pride after all stronger than his love for her her face burned with shame at the memory of the means she had taken to bring him back and the longing she had to hear his words of love again heathcote did not make matters better as he reached her he may have always been honest but it is true that he was seldom tactful

he wont come he blurted out

 who sent for him said mildred rising proudly i am sorry mr heathcote that you so little respected the confidence i gave you heranger was rising her face was blazing  an american gentleman she went on hotly  in a like circumstance would have known how to hold his tongue

 oh come now said heathcote shamefacedly i couldnt help it you know landrys awfully cut up because he couldnt come but hes got some bally idea about your liking him out of gratitude and his buying you by cheap heroism its all silly rot you know but say he paused in admiration  that fellows fine the anger had left mildreds face does he feel all you say she asked

 all that and more

she came down the steps and put her hand on heathcotes arm

 take me to him she said simply

 now that s something like he said beaming on her as if he were not sealing his own deathwarrant

he took her to landrys door and left her

landry sat alone with his head in his hands he looked up at her step then he sprang to his feet with a glad cry and rushed toward her she took a step toward him and only smiled with a great content as he folded her in his arms beyond the one glad cry that had seemed to burst like a flame from the lava crust of his heart he had said no word and mildred looking up saw that he was sobbing silently as only a strong reticent man can sob when he does give way poor landry she said stroking his head  its all right now and we wont misunderstand any more

later they went to mr osborne hand in hand but they had no need to ask his consent he was as happy in their love as they themselves

when mrs annesley was written to it is reported on good authority that she fainted at the first lines of the letter and could only be brought to with much trouble so that she could finish it when she found that landry thayer was something besides a cowboy she consented to let the maid cease fanning her when she found out that heathcote was to be best man she quite recovered and said bridling  well that will lend distinction to the affair and well â its very original anyway
