pointing the way griggs sutton elbert  novel
why dear what on earthâ

the question thus begun was never finished as to why the questioner felt impelled to begin the query only to drop it unceremoniously in its unfinished state it will presently appear

it was midday and a midsummer sun of the southern skies was beating down fiercely upon that loveliest of all southern cities belrose the very mention of whose name recalls to those who have seen it visions of a cleanly hustling business center wellregulated streets beautiful but not ostentatious suburban homes an amplitude of trees with rich green foliage rows of magnolias testifying by leaf and flower to the exuberance of the gifts of soil and air recalls that air of serenity that pervades the city at eventide as the hum of business grows less as night begins to deftly weave her robe of gloom as the glare of the electric lights comes forth to aid a shirking moon and the timid stars

but we must get back to the hot sultry day and not be tempted from our recital by the physical charms of the city of belrose the extreme heat of the day was indicated by swiftly moving fans and upraised parasols in the hands of the lady pedestrians on the streets by the holding of hats in their hands and coats on their arms on the part of the men and by the almost religious zeal with which shady spots were sought by those whose missions called upon them to wait

on the faces of all there was a halfencouraged halfresisted look of worriment one fat rotund man rather low of stature came toddling along his collar and his handkerchief drenched with perspiration while his good nature made a last grand stand against the efforts of the atmosphere to vex him beyond measure to a leaner companion walking by his side he said by gosh jim this is about the best time ill get dont you think

for what asked his companion

for croaking i guess its all settled where a rounder like me is to go when he pegs out i was just thinking that if i could drop out of belrose today and land at once in his satanic majestys big kitchen the change of atmosphere would not be so violent as to upset my delicate system see

among the vehicles passing along broadway was a phaeton occupied by two young women one of them being closely veiled the other was driving suddenly the young lady who was driving lowered the phaeton top and thus invited a more direct contact with the rays of the zealous sun

the lady with the veil had just arrived in belrose from more northerly regions and the heat oppressive to the native belrosans was doubly so to her imagine therefore her surprise at the seemingly purposeless lowering of the phaeton top which act on the part of her friend begot the unfinished query to which we have just listened but as we have said the question was not finished for at that instant the eye of the veiled lady wandered to the near street corner to the left just ahead of them and something there seemed to arouse in her a sharp deep interest abandoning the unfinished question the veiled lady propounded another

looking straight ahead she said quickly clotille be circumspect about it but let the horse walk slowly and look at that man standing on the near corner to your left who is he

clotille did as directed and said to be sure i see several men on the corner eina

oh i mean the man the man with his hat in one hand and a handkerchief in the other

clotille cautiously stole a second glance in the direction indicated a merry laugh with an undercurrent of satisfaction that did not escape einas acute ear and which in later days she so vividly recalled came from clotille somewhat to einas confusion

now clotille at what are you laughing is the gent in question belroses allconquering gallant and do you think that i have fallen a victim to his charms andâat sight too why clotille strange said eina in loving reproachful tones

oh be fair to me eina cannot your friend clotille indulge in a tiny laugh when eina of the cold heart when it comes to the sterner sex happens to see a strange handsome young man and takes so much as even a passing interest in him is it not time for me to sit up and take notice

eina changeth not clotille

my dear dear girl i do not misjudge you i know only too well of the steel casing about your heart said clotille dropping her playful tone

well back to that little laugh of yours clotille why did you laugh when i made my inquiry concerning the man with his hat in his hand  there was something behind that laugh clotille

let us take up things in their order eina we will come to the smile by and by but let us first deal with the man

all right the man then rejoined eina

the mans name is baug peppers

why clotille exclaimed eina almost rising from the buggy seat you must be mistaken no being with a head and face and eyes such as that man has could ever have so unpoetic a name baug peppers it is simply ridiculous said eina with evident warmth her sense of the eternal fitness of things being grievously outraged

well that is his name just the same said clotille

clotille you may think so he may think so but as assuredly as your name is clotille strange that mans real name is not baug peppers i know it is not

well we will waive that question for the time being now that you know what his name is at least said to be what have you further to say asked clotille

his mind has certainly written itself on his face he is brainy and true one can see that at a glance it seems to me that i have seen him before said eina

when where asked clotille

i dont just recall said eina

i will give you a few moments in which to recall just when and where you met him and will not disturb you with my chatter while you reflect said clotille

eina now leaned back in the phaeton and gave herself up to an earnest effort to recall just when where and under what circumstances she had seen this mr baug peppers before the thing that puzzled her most was that mr peppers was a man of such a striking personal appearance that people generally would be supposed to have no difficulty in recalling having seen or met him but here she was almost positive that she had seen him before and yet utterly unable to in any manner trace the impression

by and by eina said clotille i give it up every now and then it seems as though my mind is upon the point of grasping the solution as to his face whereupon it nimbly slips by and eludes me

now i will explain my smile said clotille

the impression created by that mans face is belroses standing mystery and is a most unique phenomenon to begin with the face seems to impress every one we belrosans all like to look at it it matters not how often we have seen it visitors invariably pay special attention to it and it always arouses the thought in them that they have seen it before or some face that greatly resembles it but we have yet to find the person who has stated that he has satisfied his own consciousness as to the identity of the other face suggested by this face so there comes into the minds of strangers and there lives in our minds a suggested personality that ever remains nameless

how very very queer said eina quietly still trying to condense the nebulous thought that had been sent floating through her mind by the face

at times continued clotille we have had conventions of national scope to assemble here and have entertained groups of delegates at social gatherings and it was at one time a source of much amusement to us to have our guests one after another go through the same series of questions and answers that you and i in the first instance indulged in today with regard to that face until the matter became so tiresome to baug that he began to avoid all social gatherings at which strangers were likely to be present

he knows then of the peculiar impression made by his face remarked eina

oh yes and he has gotten so that when introduced he quietly remarks before the stranger gets an opportunity to make the stereotyped comment which he knows is forthcoming of course you think you have seen me before or think you have seen someone that looks like me but for the life of you you cant tell where you saw me nor who it is that i resemble so let us pass all that by  said clotille

decidedly interesting and i eina rapona am going to try to find an answer to the puzzle somehow i feel that something great something tremendous lies behind this belrose phenomenon i am not a prophetess nor the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter but i venture the prediction that i shall furnish an explanation of this phenomenon and that upon discovery it will excite more interest than it does as a mystery mark my words i feel it i know not why i am not a sentimentalist at all but there is something great betokened by that mans face and some tremendous fact lies behind it eina remarked

had eina been observing clotilles face closely she ought to have been able to see that this resolve on her part was for some reason giving clotille a deep measure of satisfaction

well i must explain another little matter to you said clotille mr peppers has solemnly vowed that he will wed the girl that unravels this mystery now will you permit me to smile to my hearts content since you the queen of the antimarriage brigade have so diligently resolved upon earning your title to a husband asked clotille laughingly

dear me forewarned is forearmed that is a game in which at least two have a say you dont balk me clotille i must solve this riddle just the same do you hear

well eina you are welcome to your task but as to how you are going to even start about this matter i dont know if you succeed i shall crown you queen of detectives

oh say added clotille mr peppers in former days took a deep interest in some phases of politics and once formed part of a delegation that called upon a president of the united states and dont you know even the president singled him out and made the usual remarks to him after all as you say there may be something back of such a universal conception

indeed indeed i simply must know why it is that i feel within that i have seen this man before i simply must said eina

at last clotille and eina reached the cottage where the latter was to dwell there it sat crowning a hill far out on the outskirts of belrose commanding a splendid view of the city and of all the surrounding territory as eina entered the cottage yard she was thrilled with the beauty of the scene before her

oh clotille you are a born artist just look at that rich green grass at the lovely arrangement of the rose bushes at the starshaped beds from which those tiny flowers of every tint and hue peep at one so sweetly look at those pretty ferns they havent the petals of the flowers but they seem to know their beauty and are careful to display it

lifting her eyes to the beautifully shaped cottage she gazed at the profusion of honeysuckles that clambered over and fully covered the cottage walls

oh i share with you your love of the snug cottage you dear clinging honeysuckles it would seem to me that if i were dead and should pass this way this beautiful spot would awaken my soul and call me back to life again said eina her bosom heaving with the delight that surged up from her heart

tears of joy stood in clotilles eyes for upon her had fallen the whole task of choosing and arranging this home for her wealthy friend and she was therefore highly gratified that her friend seemed so well pleased

as they stood making a survey of the place the negro servant a tall aged man came walking around the house he had an erect soldierly carriage which was somewhat modified by the humble carrying of his hat in his hand and the deferential inclining of his head slightly forward a combination of dignity and humility his mustache beard and hair were white and his solemn face thus enveloped would have been a little awesome but for the kindly light that gleamed in his eyes

clotille whispered to eina saying that old man is as honest as a monk as solemn as an owl and as keen a lover of the humorous as you ever saw

indeed he does not look it said eina

when the servant had approached as near as an attitude of profound deference would permit clotille said uncle jack this is miss eina rapona who is to be your landlady

uncle jack bowed low and a look of pleasure came into his black face he was very sensitive on the point as to the class of people he was to serve and was a keen judge of what he called quality folks this pleased look was due to the fact that eina had stood the test of his keen intuition

clotille who had secured uncle jack to serve eina eyed him closely and was delighted at the signals of pleasure that her friend had caused to appear in the countenance of this veteran negro connoisseur of faces

it was very vital to clotilles plans that eina should please uncle jack for in the schemes that she had before her she had need of him

when clotille had escorted eina into the house and had gone from room to room showing how she had fitted it up for einas comfort she then left her friend and drove back toward belrose a smile of happiness on her lips the light of joy in her eyes

well sir it worked like a charm it worked like a charm such was the happy reflection that came and came again to or speaking more accurately that abode in clotilles mind

throughout the somewhat restless night which eina spent in her new home whether waking or sleeping the face of baug peppers the face of mystery with its elusive suggestiveness haunted her when on the morning following eina arose to greet the new day and threw open her blinds to let in the cheering light of the sun this face of mystery was still the uninvited but persistent guest of her mind could clotille but have known just how much einas thoughts were occupied with this new strange face that had suddenly thrust itself across the pathway of her life she would perhaps have felt inclined to regard it as a stroke of genius on her part to have hit upon such a successful plan for the furtherance of her purposes

incident to einas making belrose her home there were some business matters that had to be adjusted and clotille had arranged for eina to call that morning at the office of one seth molair when therefore the dainty breakfast prepared by uncle jack was over eina repaired to her room to attire herself for that business call of course eina would not have admitted it would have denied it to her own consciousness but it is nevertheless true that the possibility that she might meet the man with the mysterious face influenced her in the matter of her toilet

from her earliest youth the world had taken pains to inform eina over and over again as to how beautiful she was but hitherto she had been rather indifferent to the fact of natures rich endowment and none ever thought to call her vain

but as she now stood before her mirror taking an inventory of what might be termed her charms there was in her eyes in this privacy of her dressing room the plainest sort of hungering for the beautiful in herself

has the world judged aright am i beautiful asked eina of herself she lifted her bared rounded arms tapering so exquisitely at the wrists and gazed at them for a few seconds then lowered them eina now turned her attention to her face neither oval nor long perfectly proportioned her featuresâmouth nose ears foreheadâeach a work of art in itself and well did her wealth of hair black at a distance but brown at close range grace her head and well might her eyes those wondrously expressive beautiful black eyes matching well the long dark brown eyelashes and heavy eyebrowsâwell might her eyes the dominating center of a realm of beauty gleam with that subtle inexplicable charm that made a friend of every one who gazed into their soulful depths

gifted with a rare taste in choosing and blending those colors which best suited and accentuated her beauty eina when ready for her trip into the city was beyond all cavil a vision of loveliness

it is one uv my rights miss ter spress myself bout de looks uv de lady folks uv my famblys whar i wuks i doan wuk fur none but quality folks yer air de puttiest lady i evah wukked fur said uncle jack with a paternal pride in einas appearance as he drove her to the city

bubbling over with good humor uncle jack talked to eina as they rode along giving her scraps of history of belrose

when eina arrived at seth molairs office instead of being at once ushered into his presence as was to have been expected in view of the character of the business engagement that she had with him she was kept waiting in the anteroom for some considerable time

in the office in which eina sat there was a large magnificent mirror seth molair the occupant of the suite of rooms desiring to have an opportunity to study clients unobserved by them so arranged the chairs in his waitingroom that this mirror recorded likenesses at such an angle that he could by the use of a strong opera glass constructed in the partition between the two offices get a splendid view of people without their suspecting that he was observing them

the explanation of molairs prolonged delay in admitting eina was that he was both charmed and puzzled eina as we have seen had taken special pains with her toilet and molair was struck with the amazing beauty of the girl who impressed him as being undoubtedly the most beautiful woman upon whom his eyes had ever fallen he was sorely puzzled too as to einas nationality a consideration which in belrose as in all southern cities counted for a great deal

einas complexion had been the bane of many an artists life portrait painters having despaired of reproducing its beautiful tints defying as they did the power of the brush and pen she was light enough of complexion to pass among the whites for a white girl had just enough of the dark in her complexion to permit her to pass as a colored woman if she so elected while the underglow of red in her complexion coupled with her beautiful black eyes and the appearance of her hair suggested that indian blood was not altogether missing from her veins

of whatever nationality it would seem that the races of mankind have united to make this girl the composite beauty of the human family reflected molair

at length molair opened the door of his private office and bade eina to enter after a formal introduction the two settled down to the business on hand seth molair was noted for his dispatch in business matters but it must be confessed that in this particular instance he did not live up to his reputation he did not overly prolong the interview but simply proceeded with marked deliberation regarding it as a genuine treat to have the privilege to merely contemplate the exquisite beauty of the face before him

the question of einas nationality continued to give molair concern there were to be sure the european features and the stamp of european culture and spirit but there was that faint picturesque tinge of the dark that might or might not be due to a distant connection with the land that chose to make sable her sons and daughters molair resolved to discover einas racial affiliation before the interview was over and began to manoeuver to attain that end he had been told that in every light person having a vestige of negro blood in their veins there was a slight muddiness behind their ears pretending to have business across the room to the rear of eina molair managed to get behind her and to glance at her ears

no special mark there was his mental note as he gazed upon einas pretty neck and ears

molair had heard that at the roots of the finger nails there was always to be found a telltale sign that betrayed the presence of negro blood when all other indications failed but eina had on gloves which prevented a resort to that test however molair decided to overcome this obstacle excusing himself rather abruptly he entered his outer office closed the door and had the white girl who was his stenographer to come to him at the office window where he took a look at the roots of her finger nails and at his own having familiarized himself with the appearance of the finger nails of himself and his stenographer he reentered the office to plan for testing eina

when the time came for eina to sign the papers incident to their business transaction molair had her take a seat at a small table in the center of the room the table being just large enough to hold the papers to be signed but not large enough for the inkstand in addition thereto molair stood near her holding the inkstand in his hand and leaned over ostensibly to point out just where she was to sign in so doing in keeping with his plan he spilled the ink upon einas glove

clumsy clumsy clumsy i beg a thousand pardons said molair

eina looked up her mind in perfect accord with molairs suggestion that he was clumsy she gave him a reassuring smile however to drive away his embarrassment and said i should have taken off my gloves to write anyway so the fault is mine not yours

that is quite generous in you miss rapona but i do not pardon myself miss grainger called molair to his stenographer who now entered take that glove off of miss raponas hand step across the street to the store and bring us another pair

miss grainger approached to draw off the glove and molair at the risk of being thought rude stood so as to be able to see the finger nails as the glove left the hand in his conference with his stenographer he had told her of his plan and had asked her to be as deliberate as possible in getting the glove off of the finger tips that he might have as good an opportunity as possible to see the finger nails slowly the glove came off molairs eager eyes following every inch of its progress when at last the finger nails stood revealed and molairs keen gaze was directed towards them he heaved a sigh of relief and said heaven be praised the finger nail roots were normal

eina looked at molair inquiringly unable to account for his exclamation molair caught the meaning of the look but proffered no explanation when the papers had all been signed molair broached the question that had been uppermost in his mind feeling free to do so since miss rapona was able by any test to be classified as white

miss rapona began he the white people of the south are not individualists with the possibility of racial antagonisms on the one hand and social commingling on the other always confronting us we are more or less in a chronic state of spiritual war and just as in time of war you do not allow the individual soldiers personal liberty we withhold a great measure of personal liberty from all southern people white and colored and maintain certain welldefined customs

eina became all interest and waited breathlessly molairs deliverances

you are from boston where social freedomâ the thing that people are trying to say when they say social equalityâexists in the south social freedom is not permitted for reasons that i need not discuss just here whoever affiliates socially with the one race in the south is denied the social life of the other will you regard it as a piece of impertinence on my part to ask you as to where you are to cast your lot socially

you mean to say that there is no such thing as being allowed to treat all upon the score of individual merit remarked eina

exactly choice in the south lies not between individuals but between races moreover if you have once passed as a white person you will not be allowed to drop into the colored race on the other hand if you are once classed as a colored person you can never change to the white race where that fact is known replied molair

would you white people of the south accept me asked eina

pardon me but what is your blood asked molair

i am of english spanish and indian descent of course you know that the spaniards drew the dark in their complexion from the moors who of course are africans by both my spanish and indian blood which however is all but lost in the english strain i am connected with the colored races of the world

now let us see said molair we of the south place no ban upon intermarriage with the spanish people the glorious history of spain has baptized her slight swarthiness and we forget the moor as for the indians our president has advised their absorption into our blood according to prevailing standards you would find no barrier to your entrance into the white race

on the other hand there is the tinge of the dark in your complexion which will permit you to classify yourself as colored if you so desire there are hundreds of people right here in belrose even lighter than you are lighter than thousands of whites who are classed as colored

i find myself therefore in the unique position of being allowed to choose for myself my racial home for most people that is a thing entirely beyond their control said eina smiling sadly

before you make your choice miss rapona would you kindly allow me to canvass the whole situation with you asked molair speaking with evident earnestness

i know of nothing that would give me greater pleasure mr molair said eina much pleased at a prospective arrangement that would give her a glance into the heart of the south that willynilly had written itself into her bostons daily thought and nightly dream

molair paused awhile hesitating as to whether to say what he had in mind and searching for the best form in which to put what he would like to say

noting his embarrassment eina said feel free mr molair to speak your mind to me

i could miss rapona discuss these matters with you here but somehow when the deeper issues of life are involved i like to get away from this office be free from its atmosphere altogether here in an honorable way i hope i look after my personal interests by trying to faithfully serve my clients elsewhere i am an unfettered man the human being

why can you not come to my home asked eina

there is the rub for the present at least you wish to keep the question of your social alignment open it is well known in belrose that i make no professional visits my clients all come to me if i call to see you it will be surmised that i call to see you socially and if it became known to the colored people that i so visit you you can never thereafter reach their best social life perhaps said molair

why cannot i call at your home then asked eina

if you enter my home as a social visitor to my mother you take rank as a white person if you once assume rank as a white person you can never in the south drop into the life of the colored people unless you can show clear title to negro blood we dont allow it said molair

who stays with you at your home miss rapona asked molair

one jack morris uncle jack they call him replied eina

uncle jack why i know uncle jack and a truer soul never lived said molair

i was about to suggest mr molair that uncle jack might bring you to my home unobserved i feel that it means so much to be permitted to hear what you have to say said eina

that is about the only way in which all objections can be met said molair

so it was agreed that under the chaperonage of uncle jack molair was to clandestinely visit eina

by the way is the man with the face of mystery a colored man or a white man i did not think to ask clotille mused eina as sitting by the side of uncle jack she journeyed back to her home out from belrose

before molair pays the promised visit to eina with a view to influencing her social alignment it is perhaps expedient that we learn something of the influences that brought her to belrose something of the situation to play a vital part in which she had come so that as we stand with her in the momentous hour of her choice of race we may be the better prepared to sit in judgment on her course

in order that we may get into this position of vantage it is necessary for us to go back and catch up a thread that by and by merges into the situation presented at the point where this drama of human life first unfolds itself to your view

in the days of slavery two negro sisters with the doings more or less of whose descendants we shall have to deal were assigned diverse destinies the one of them choosing a mate within the negro race and becoming the maternal antecedent of a line of people of dark complexion while the other became the maternal founder of a line of people of mixed blood

when freedom came constantine gilbreath the white man involved in the alignment mentioned did not abandon nor suffer to depart the negro woman whose companion he had been in slavery but continued the relationship

among their children was letitia gilbreath who was born to them a few years after the close of the civil war upon the death of constantine gilbreath his fortune which was considerable was apportioned among the members of his negro family letitia gilbreath inherited from her father a marked commercial talent and love of gain which faculty she devoted to the increase of the holdings bequeathed to her and as a result grew to be a fairly wealthy woman as wealth went in the southland

miss letitia declined all offers of matrimony grew to be regarded as an eccentric old maid devoted her entire thought to her possessions and seemed to shut out from her heart all her fellowmen and women with two exceptions as follows a daughter of her mothers sister married and became the mother of a beautiful dark girl whose pretty face and black appealing eyes had somehow reached the soft spot in miss letitias heart she applied to her cousin mrs hannah strange for this beautiful dark child clotille reared and educated it she had resolved should the girl marry in a manner that pleased her to make a bridal present of onehalf of her fortune and to provide in her will that clotille should come into possession of the other half upon the testators death miss letitias fancy had likewise gone out for baug peppers as a boy and she had resolved upon him as a husband for clotille the fact that baug was very light of complexion counting greatly in his favor this in truth being a determining consideration

miss letitia herself a mulatto would have denied most vehemently that she was at all prejudiced as to color and would have cited the fact that her mother and her favorite adopted cousin were dark as proofs positive that she could not have color prejudice

but miss letitia was a great believer in the white people and the fact that they seemed to be growing farther and farther away from the negroes made her pessimistic as to the future of the colored people as a distinct racial element in american life she had become a convert to the theory that the only hope of the american negro lay in finally losing himself in the white race in being utterly absorbed she had no sympathy however for such negroes of light complexion as illegally affiliated with the white race or surreptitiously entered that race holding that all persons with the blood of the colored race in their veins should remain within the ranks of the negroes until the race as a whole was whitened

on the other hand she viewed it in the light of a shocking crime for two dark persons to marry each other holding that every newly born dark child but prolonged the agony she felt that providence now purposed to overrule the evil of miscegenation during the days of slavery and to thus bring good out of evil by making use of the light complexion contributed to the race to lighten its complexion from generation to generation until it finally lost its dark hue she was a believer in the white mans temperament traditions character and civilization and did not care to see these altered by a sudden infusion of negro blood but felt that by the time the negro race was ready to vanish through her gradual process of whitening that the race would be so fundamentally metamorphosed and the infusion so diluted that it would in no wise materially affect the base of the white mans makeup

miss letitia felt that she occupied unassailable ground as the white people could not reasonably object to her making use of the white blood which they pushed off to her side of the color line such was the basis of her choice of a husband for her cousin clotille

baug and clotille knew full well that they did not and would not love each other but knowing miss letitias hopes and plans they did not jar her by raising the issue before it had to be raised each desiring to keep the wealthy womans favor operating under this modus vivendi all seemed to be moving along nicely neither clotille nor baug desiring to make a move until one morning as clotille sat in her seat in the assembly room of clinton college noting the boys as they filed in to take their respective seats she observed in those ranks a tall handsome fellow of princely form whose frank open face intellectual brow and head of splendid shape demanded of her a second look and a third an acquaintanceship followed in the due course of events and the exchange of sentiments in the days that followed ripened their mutual admiration into love

one beautiful may day a day that clotille never forgot in that short distance from the baseball grounds to the girls dormitory conroe had poured into her ear the story of his love and had gained from her lips and from the depths of her tender dark eyes the information that he was loved in return but here is where the trouble aroseâconroe was dark

from the day that clotille discovered that her heart had gone out to conroe she began to plan to overcome miss letitias objections to him she saw clearly that her first step was to get baug peppers out of the way so long as baug was available as a possibility for a husband miss letitia clotille knew would be for him against the world

the next step as clotille viewed the matter was to convert the white people of belrose to a more kindly attitude toward the colored people for miss letitia was in her heart a worshipper of the whites of belrose felt that they were the most aristocratic people on earth if therefore belrose could be brought to the point of according the colored people the full measure of citizenship rights and privileges it would according to clotilles way of thinking operate to make miss letitia less pessimistic more hopeful of the colored mans future as a colored man and therefore less hostile to the marriage of dark couples

the elimination of baug and the providing of a healthy local atmosphere for the diseased mind of cousin letitia is my problem then reasoned clotille

now i dont know which is the harder task the marrying off of baug or the causing of cousin letitia to think that the door of hope has at last come open to the dark man said clotille to herself

time passed away conroe and clotille were graduated from college the former entering a medical school while the latter went to boston to perfect herself in music

in boston clotille met and studied eina and felt convinced that she had at last come upon the girl that could wrest from baug the control of his heart

eina who was an orphan grew to be fond of clotille and expressed a desire to come to belrose to live this was exactly what clotille desired and shortly after her return home she wrote telling eina to come

now that we have seen how eina came to belrose mr molair may proceed to pay his visit

slowly languidly and with ever reddening orb the sun was sinking toward its rest making way for that eventful night in the life of eina when molair was to visit her home and discuss with her the question of her racial alignment

hitherto eina had looked upon the human family as one but now was to make her choice of caste or have the choice made for her

according to what mr molair says i am to half die tonight to limit the full free rush of my soul to the one or the other group of my fellowbeings whether i will or not the choice must be made so reflected eina as she sat upon her porch waiting for the set of sun which was to bring to her door seth molair in charge of uncle jack

when there comes the time in the life of a human being that the fate of the eternal years seems crowded into a brief space for determination an effort on the part of the soul is put forth to burst out of its prison and ramble through the halls of nature in search of superior wisdom for a decision so eina looked out upon the landscape before her and said mother earth what have you to say to your daughter in this solemn hour

the slope that began a few hundred yards in front of her porch seemed to say follow me as it gradually fell away down to a valley in which there stood a few trees scattered here and there lining a small stream that flowed leisurely along en route to the far far distant sea

in her imagination the meditating eina followed the waters of this little stream passed with them under culverts through the city of belrose and into the ambrose river that skirted that city followed the waters by the cornfields on and on through the land of cotton then the land of sugarcane by the busy wharf by the quiet village on and on and on to the great great deep

as in her imagination the waters swept out into the mighty ocean eina shuddered folded her arms a little tighter as if it were she that was making the sweep into the boundless deep

no comfort comes to me in that line of thought said eina to herself now lifting her sad eyes to the evening sky in which the sun was all but set but no relief was there for the sun seemed to say i too must battle for my life eina gazed at the cloud through which the sun was feebly shooting his failing rays then looked at a heavier cloud hovering immediately beneath the fighting dying king of day ready to engulf him when his reign was over at last he sank into this dark cloud into which there then came a rift through which he shot a flood of parting brilliance as if to say i go down but go in the fullness of my powers i shall rise again the sun was set

the spirit of eina yet hungry for comfort now sought solace in the little yard before her rising from her chair she bent over the banister of her porch and in the gloaming looked from tree to tree and from flower to flower the trees moved their limbs only in the feeblest manner as if in respect for her meditation little birds flitted noiselessly by to their nests even the crickets in the grass seemed to seek to subdue their voices

oh this is too solemn i gain strength no where i must fight out lifes great battle alone said eina leaving the porch and entering her parlor

at length uncle jack arrived and with due pomp and ceremony escorted his distinguished companion into einas reception room

as molairs eye noted the carpet on the floor the furniture the pictures on the wall and all the little touches of art in the articles and arrangement of the room his sense of harmony was thoroughly pleased and he said inwardly no i make no mistake when i invite this lady of refined tastes to membership in the race to which she properly belongs by every consideration of right and blood

when the greetings of the day had been passed and a few moments occupied in conversation on general questions eina opened the discussion on the matter uppermost in the mind of each and to mr molairs surprise at once put him on the defensive

you have come tonight to ask me to choose my social atmosphere my spiritual home will you allow me to probe somewhat deeply into the matter and ask some questions that may appear impertinent asked eina

i do not shrink from any feature of the case i can in perfect coolness canvass the entire situation past present and prospective said molair

i am glad to hear you say that mr molair so very glad a matter so grave needs the very freest discussion i am so glad you will not take offense i have heard that the southern white people were so sensitive said eina

mr molair eina continued i believe the richest inheritance of a race to be its spirit did not slavery taint your racial spirit and do not all who enter your portals pass under the shadow of the blight

upon the great mass of mankind miss rapona environing influences have a marked effect but there are natures that rise superior to their environments just as the lily in all of its beauty and cleanliness rises from the slush and slime began molair in reply

my ancestors owned slaves but were not in any manner demoralized by the institution they were kind to their slaves did not resort to corporal punishment taught the sanctity of the marriage relation insisted on good moral conduct on the plantation never through sales separated a family and from time to time emancipated such slaves as showed that they had attained unto the full stature of industrious civilized moral beings in short to my ancestors whatever else it was to others slavery was a civilizing school and to deal honorably by those helpless people was a family principle sacredly transmitted from one generation to another

were not your people favorable to the war of secession which whatever its mainspring would have resulted in buttressing the institution of slavery asked eina

the institution of slavery was not of course of southern origin it was with us an inheritance from a worldwide custom we happened to get a larger dose of it than any other part of the world as our home was near the latitude of the original home of the enslaved race my family believed the institution wrong and harmful in the large but felt that the south could better work out the problem of getting rid of the institution alone rather than in connection with another section lacking the sympathetic consideration that flows from immediate touch with a problem responded molair

well you have stood your examination very well mr molair right gladly will i hear what you have to say said eina earnestly

truly miss rapona there is not a spark of prejudice behind what i am to say i confess to having strong pride of race but not to prejudice of course prejudice is here but thus far it has not inoculated me

eina nodded her acceptance of this assurance

miss rapona was there ever in all the world a more pitiable spectacle than that which the presence of the colored man in america constitutes today his return to africa is precluded by the fact that africa is projected on a lower economic and spiritual plane than that to which the negro is willing to fall back nor would the economic forces of the south quietly submit to a general exodus even if the negro desired so the negro is riveted here by the economic conditions within and without

in the south there is a pronounced feeling against the absorption of the race into the political and social fabric and he is a political and social ishmaelite with his hand against every one and every ones hand against him by the very logic of the situation the door of hope is closed to him there are no stars no moons no suns to light up his dark skies so far as the body politic is concerned and his spirit must struggle with all the darkness and briers and bogs of the spiritual jungle without the cheering light of hope which even when unrealized serves to make men better to work to eat to sleep to die is the utmost programme that organized society in the south offers this race

mr molair now paused for an instant as if to allow his words to sink into einas heart

but mr molair is there no hope asked eina

the one thing needed in the south is political cooperation between the better elements of whites and the negroes but the manner of the coming of emancipation enfranchisement and elevation to high public station seems to have riveted the negro into one party while the terror of being ruled by an alien and backward race have chained the real strength of the white race into an opposing party you can see at a glance the utter depths of the sentiments passions and interests involved and what labor it will require to emancipate both races i see no forces at work looking to the blending of the political interests of the white and colored people and so my voice at this stage of the storm is simply no land in sight as long as there is to be a bitter political war between the negroes and the whites of the south how can the condition change

on and on the discussion ran eina asking questions and molair seeking with the utmost candor to enlighten her from his viewpoint after the question had been fully canvassed molair said now miss rapona you have the situation before you two worlds call you tonight which will you enter

molair now stood up and bent his gaze upon the bowed head of the troubled girl before him in an absentminded sort of way eina looked up into molairs face while her thoughts ran out into the wide wide world to all that this strong vigorous young scion of the white race typified

as eina sat reflecting thus ran her thoughts here stands before me power an offshoot of that force that bade its flag keep pace with all the journeyings of the sun power and glory such as the anglosaxons can give await me centuries of power call unto me

over against this picture stands a tragic situation and present day weakness whatever else the future may hold in this tragic situation is my dear dear friend if i enter it i shall at least have the consolation to know that i do not personally deserve whatever of suffering comes to me is it better for the souls of men to be under a load that is crushing or wittingly or unwittingly a part of the crushing load

eina now arose and the two stood silent for a few moments each felt the awful gravity of the situation

just a personal word miss rapona before you decide permit me to testify to my respectful admiration of you drawn from my two interviews with you perhaps i seem to go too far but when nature has the conception that what is to be done must be done quickly it works in a hurry note the proverbial precociousness of the child that is not to dwell on earth very long i would much enjoy the cultivation of your acquaintance and feel that i would be blessed with your friendship simply of course if you choose to cast your lot with the colored people you dig between us that unfathomable southern gulf which is not on the maps but which is far deeper and wider than those that are said molair

on which side of this gulf is the man with the face of mystery was the thought that now came into einas mind was it fate that suggested it

lifting her perplexed and all but tearful gaze to molair she said give me time to decide

very well if you claim your place in the white race i hope to see you again if you choose to cast your lot with the colored peopleâfarewell âforever said molair his voice falling to a solemn whisper

eina shuddered goodnight she said lingering on the words with her hand to her cheek lost in meditation eina stood long on the spot where molair left her

out at night

you are a little late tonight seth said mrs molair as she received her sons greeting kiss

yes mother i have just left the home of the most beautiful the most attractive girl that ever i saw

mrs molairs heart gave a wild leap of joy over her life there was but the one dark shadow seth was her only child was unmarried seemed to have never thought of matrimony for himself and as a consequence of his course had raised the fear in her mind that their branch of the historic molair family was near its endâa thought that was far from pleasing to her more than anything else in the wide world this threatened extinction of the molair name gave her deep concern imagine therefore the rapture of her mother heart when she heard the cool impassive molair grow enthusiastic over the charms of a young woman

describe her to me seth said mrs molair laying aside a book which she had been reading and looking approvingly at the idol of her heart

on the night of seth molairs visit to eina his mother sat in the library awaiting his return as was her custom when he was you would really have to see her to get a proper idea of her beauty mother as rich as is the english language it really has no words that fittingly portray the charms of that girl

mrs molair felt like kissing seth rapturously so happy was she to find him as she thought thus enamored of one of the gentler sex

where on earth has she been seth that i have never seen her

oh she has just arrived

do your best at describing her requested mrs molair with enthusiasm

molair now attempted a description of eina and the picture that he drew served to stimulate mrs molairs interest in the girl

oh may it be that kind heaven has at last sent me a wife for my son was the inward prayer of mrs molair

but mother said molair a look of deep seriousness on his manly face there is danger that she will cast her lot with and pass as one of the colored people

the stars above exclaimed mrs molair holding up her hands in an attitude of horror and repugnance

really white she asked

her complexion is lighter than that of many whites whom we call our friends and she can pass the finger nail test all right replied molair

where does she come from

boston

that boston seth we must save this girl we must not allow a calamity like that to befall her

i have been to see her and sought to dissuade her i have not thus far succeeded however said molair

ill see her said mrs molair and when i have finished talking to her she will be in her right mind

it was agreed upon by seth and his mother that she was to go to see eina early the following morning

mrs molair now retired to bed but did not fall asleep her mind having been thrown into such a feverish state by the news which seth had brought the disappearance of many of the great names of the southland was traceable to alliances with attractive colored girls which alliances were of course denied the sanction of law thus throwing the progeny of great families beyond the pale of law thus far the molair family had made its escape and while mrs molair had the utmost confidence in seths character she could not be indifferent to the fate that had overtaken other family names that of the gilbreaths for example

if this girl can pass the test and can enter freely into the white race she might become my boys wife for evidently she has deeply impressed him if she abide in the colored race and a genuine attachment ripens between her and my only boy childâ such were the thoughts that coursed through mrs molairs mind rendering her night a sleepless one

on the following morning mrs molair was up with the sun and was soon speeding rapidly to einas home she rang the door bell and uncle jack responded

when he saw that it was mrs molair uncle jack called into service one of his most chesterfieldian bows then escorted her with much respectful dignity into einas parlor where she took a seat to await einas coming as she noted the beauty and taste of the appointments of einas home her heart warmed to the girl

only a sweet pure soul could produce an effect like this said mrs molair to herself

when eina appeared at the parlor door and mrs molair caught sight of her beautiful face flashing out in no uncertain way the nobility and loftiness of her soul mrs molair heaved a sigh of relief

if all else fails thank heaven here is no morganitic pitfall for seth unless mother nature who chiseled that girls brow is a miserable liar thought mrs molair as in her joy over the type she judged eina to be she rushed to and kissed her

eina could not of course understand the warmth of the greeting but felt honored for no less than in her own case the worth of mrs molair was written in her countenance and bearing

when seated mrs molair began miss rapona i am mrs molair the mother of seth i have come to take up the question of your social alignment

i am much pleased to meet you your son is a noble man at heart and in life i feel i am so glad that i met him since i see his mother i understand the source of his qualities said eina

seths father child was the finest man that ever lived said mrs molair her love for her deceased husband not allowing even seth to be classed above him

but her mother love now asserted itself and she said and so is seth

so we have two men each being the finest that ever lived said eina laughingly in thorough sympathy with mrs molairs praise of her husband and son in the background of her mind however there was a third candidate for this honor of being the finest but his case has not yet been heardâthe man with the face of mystery

child my son tells me that it is possible that you may ally yourself with the colored people have you ever associated with them before asked mrs molair

my association has all along been with the whites save in the case of one girl friend at whose instance i am here in the south said eina

there is a faint suggestion of the dark in your complexion no more however than what numerous of our best white people have how does that come asked mrs molair

i am of spanish indian and caucasian descent

have you any negro blood

the spaniards got their tinge of the dark through the moors they say and the moors are africans replied eina

my child you can pass for white we do not bar those races socially that have given marked evidence of governmental efficiency we dont draw the line on spaniards or a brave fighting people like the indians we dont object to that blood did not seth tell you about the handicaps affecting the colored race  asked mrs molair

he did

now let me tell you some things that seth could not tell you by the way where is your mother asked mrs molair

passed away died when i was an infant

father

gone too lived to see me fifteen years of age then left me

poor dear child do you think i am going to allow you to choose life in the southern underworld without doing my best to prevent it said mrs molair now more determined than ever to keep eina within the white race

let me talk to you as a mother to her daughter eina said mrs molair

you must i crave of you that honor

your character eina is formed your absolute devotion to all that is noble in life is written in that sweet face of yours in those glorious eyes our supreme mother nature has seen fit to link you with the motherhood side of the human family and you must view matters from that point you may be blessed with a home and daughters some day and life for a colored girl in the south is far from ideal

tell me just how and tell me frankly said eina earnestly leaning forward and resting her cheek upon her hand

a girl the future wife and mother has vital need of the atmosphere of protection respect and chivalric deference for upon her is the human race dependent for the direct infusion into the bone and marrow of the race all that is glorious civilization shows that this is only done where man accords protection to woman and allows only that which is glorious to be written upon the woman soul

are not colored men brave  can they not surround the women of their race with the desired atmosphere asked eina

mrs molair who had been sitting some little distance from eina now drew near and said child i am going to picture to you the most tragic situation in all this earth the white man of the south has taken the government into his hands exclusively a government is as influential in what it will not do as in what it will do it has been clearly demonstrated that our white government will not punish a white mob we declaim against it try to prevent it but we have not yet developed the capacity to punish the mob after it has succeeded in doing its work

the menace of the unpunishable mob stands before every colored man who seeks to hold a white man accountable for misconduct toward the female members of his family in court with the best sentiment of the white people appealed to i have no doubt but that the desire on the part of the colored man to protect his home would not be crushed out but the mob stands between him and the court thus the spirit of protection which in the white man is buttressed by the courts is in the negro confronted with the scowl of murder on the face of the mob

are not the colored men willing to pay even this price to accord their women protection asked eina

the colored women protect the men knowing the menace that confronts their men colored women swallow insults i dislike to dwell upon unpleasant incidents in our life here in the south and high heaven knows there are enough of them but a girl standing on the border line about to make choice of race should know all

oh do speak fully do mrs molair said eina

well one of the saddest cases that ever came to my ears was that of a colored lad in a neighboring county a white man uttered forbidden words to this boys sister the girl fled to her home and told her brother of what had been said to her borrowing from our southern code on such matters this boy went to the home of the white man drew a pistol spoke his mind very freely but did not kill

the next morning the white man armed himself went to this boys place of work called him out and shot him down that is what happened where a colored girl told and her brother took the matter in hand if that girl has another brother that is concerned in her protection do you think she will be so ready to sentence him to death by reporting insults

drawing near to eina mrs molair threw an arm around her neck and talked to her long and earnestly laying bare experiences that had been reported to her by the colored women of belrose at length she said now my daughter i exhort you to come into a race where men are encouraged to play the part of men will you not come

again there came into einas mind the face of the man of mystery

mrs molair i shall give earnest thought to all that you have said when the debate within my soul is over i will render my decision

mrs molair now arose and took a hurried leave to her mind there was no possible ground of debate as to whether it was best to be identified with the life of the white people of the south socially and the fact that eina with conditions made plain to her could stop to debate the question convinced her that eina must be suffering from some form of mental derangement

why good morning said mrs molair backing out of the door looking intently at eina as at one who had lost her reason

this is awful this is simply awfulthus murmured clotille strange as she stood upon einas porch stung dazed irresolute as the result of the reading of a little note from eina which uncle jack had handed her at the door instead of granting her admission to see her friend

the sympathetic uncle jack had surmised that all was not going well and his funereal countenance as he met clotille had been in keeping with the sombre news contained in the note although of course he knew nothing of its contents he now stood pitying in his heart the perturbed clotille and resolved to be of assistance to her if he could as eina was in the house within hearing distance uncle jack could not say what he desired so he resorted to a ruse to get an opportunity to whisper to clotille

wy miss clotille look at yer harniss who hitched up fur yer said uncle jack loudly moving off towards clotilles buggy and beckoning for her to follow going to the far side of the horse and having clotille do the same so that eina if peering through the window blinds might not see what was going on uncle jack tinkered with the harness while clotille read to him the little note from eina which ran as follows my own dear clotille

you know how dearly i love you and how i crave your companionship you will understand therefore that there is tremendous pressure on me from some source to prompt me to deny myself the boon of your companionship for some daysâjust how many t cannot say when we meet i will explain all for the time being i must have solitude must travel to the very heart of things and let my darkened soul catch for itself the light of life the world confuses me but i know that there is peace somewhere whatever else betides i am clotilles one friend eina 

i understand it all now dem molairs hez been wukin on her mistah molair wuz heah las night an missus molair wuz heah dis mornin shed fine blood an dey wants her in dare race i specks deys bout got her min sorter mixed up an she bout doan know whether ter be er white lady er er colored oman es dey puts it twouldent sprise me if dis heah same lady aint some queen er nuther passin roun under some sumed name said uncle jack nodding his head knowingly

oh is that it you think said clotille beginning to grasp the meaning of the note which had been handed her

but ill watch dem molairs trus dat ter me id goin ter slip baug peppers out heah an ef he gits er chance hell switch things back

clotille felt like hugging and kissing uncle jack in fact to tell the truth on the sad yet happy girl she did that very thing at the very moment when she felt her structure crumbling in a most unexpected manner here was dear old uncle jack to prop it up

nothing could be more damaging to clotilles hopes than for eina to cross over into the white race for then she would be far removed from the possibility of marrying baug and taking him out of her way

assured by uncle jack that he would watch over eina and seek to thwart the purposes of all who sought to have her turn her back on the colored world clotille rode home with a somewhat lighter heart than that which had throbbed in her body immediately after reading einas note

eina was puzzled she soon made the discovery that baug peppers affiliated with the colored people socially and her great desire to unravel the mystery of his face threw itself on the side of her entering the colored race

but does this man do himself justice to remain classified as a negro he could go elsewhere and pass for white easily would i not be doing right to become acquainted with him and persuade him for his own good to go to some other part of the world and pass as a white man  asked eina of herself

eina now decided to go deeply into this question of race and for the time being to withhold herself from social affiliation with either race she came to the conclusion that through the untutored uncle jack a child of nature she would seek to get at the real essence the ground work of the negro soul its basal philosophy of life she decided therefore to encourage uncle jack to talk to enter with zest into his chatter and to have him thus in artless fashion lay bare his soul

in keeping with this purpose one afternoon when uncle jacks work was done and he was sitting in a chair in the back yard under the shade of a tree with his legs crossed and a pipe in his mouth eina drew near dragging a chair with her she took a seat in front of uncle jack with a view to having him entertain her while she studied him and through him his kind

uncle jack one thing has always somewhat puzzled me when the civil war was going on why did you colored people stay in the fields and feed the armies that were fighting to keep you in slavery asked eina

wal miss i kaint speak fur de res uv de cullud folks i kin sorter splain ter yer bout myself i membah wal whut er fix i wuz in wen de war broke out suah dar wuz er mighty wrestlin in my heart yer see i alius predated good treatment er dog ull do dat wal my ole massa an ole missus sartainly treated me wal treated me wal miss i didunt hab none uv de hard times i heah udder cullud folks talkin er bout but bless yer life honey some uv um had um an had um bad too yer see i blonged ter quality white folks shuah nough ladies an gemmens an deys alius nice see uncle jack arose lowered his head respectfully to one side and said with humility miss eina i aint as ellerquent wid dis pipe ez i would be ef i had er chaw uv terbacky ef yer please ill go git me er chaw

eina excused him to prepare for a more eloquent delivery duly equipped uncle jack returned and resumed his story

i wuz splainin bout whut er fix i wuz in ven de war broke out ef evah i felt like cryin wen i didunt it wuz wen i wuz holdin massas sturrup ez he wuz mountin his war hoss ter ride ter de army

cry for what uncle jack asked eina

three things in one fust cause he wuz goin secon cause his goin kep me frum goin ter fight ergin him third cause my missus an her two dorters wuz so sad lak

how do you reconcile those sentiments uncle jack and how did his going affect your going it would seem that his going would have made your going the easier

yer doan understan cullud folks miss our hearts tek in de good frum evry sose my massa had been kin ter me so i hated ter see him leave i wanted ter be er free man an ter hep dem dat wuz tryin ter free me wid him leavin i couldnt go caus harm might er come ter my missus an her two dorters ef i could uv got er way fust ez i wuz tryin ter do de sponserbility uv de fambly would er been on him but ez he beat me ter it de sponserbility wuz on me an i had ter stay

but uncle jack somehow i thought that you were a soldier how do you account for your military carriage

hah hah laughed uncle jack his dark face beaming with pride no miss yer is er leetul wrong dare i aint got no miluntary kerridge an aint had none i seen ole genul grant ridin in one wunst but i nevah got so high ez ter hab er kerridge i aint nebbar had er miluntary kerridge

eina smiled at uncle jacks misapprehension of her remark but did not enlighten him as to her true meaning

uncle jack sat for a few seconds musing upon the exaggerated reports of his generalship that had evidently gone north to be picked up by miss eina

 goin back ter whar i lef off uncle jack resumed ole massa rode erway i stayed behin an looked atter der wimmins wid er eagle eye ole missus blieved in jack blieved in him wid all her soul i slep at her do wen eber de yankees wuz er round yes dey blieved in jack an fore god id er died lak a cur dog foe id er let any scoundrel tech er stran uv hair on enny uv urns head

uncle jack now paused and dropped his head tears came streaming down the old mans cheeks what is the matter inquired eina anxiously in broken tones he said i did wanter so bad ter han ole missus an her chillun back ter ole massa jesas he lef um wid me but wuk anpray pray an wuk ez hard ez i could dey jes wouldnt stay in de worl till ole massa got back dey took sick one by one an died oh ef i didnt pray an groan for de lawd ter spar um no botty evah did i wanted um ter live ter see ole massa ergin so dey could tell him how good an kin jack wuz but dey died dey died

uncle jacks chin fell over on his breast and the tears rolled down his black face with as much fluency as though those mourned were of his own family and their corpses were even then in the next room

eina arose and went into her room to think over what uncle jack had said

it would seem to me that a people with the kind of heart indicated by this old man cannot at base be bad mused eina i doubt whether anywhere in the world its kindliness of spirit can be duplicated she reflected

she determined after supper to probe deeper into uncle jacks heart

in due time uncle jack summoned eina to her supper which was so well prepared that it stimulated her rather feeble appetite as uncle jack stood by and observed that his cooking pleased eina a smile of deep satisfaction came upon his sober face

uncle jack you were once a slave but you seem to be as serene as an angel now how did you manage to get along your nature does not seem to have been at all soured

uncle jack dropped into a chair in the corner of the diningroom and said dare wuz er little sumpin dat i perscivered wen i wuz er kid dat heped me outen many er tight place began uncle jack i alius did have er way uv notussing things an puttin one an one togedder ez er boy i notussed dat dare warnt nevah no harm in er white man ef you could jes git him ter laf right good an hard ef yer will let me i will gib yer er sample uv how j could alius make my git by

when uncle jack had finished his narrative he dropped his head and seemed to be engaged in meditation of some humorous incident judging from the chuckle that now and then escaped eina sat waiting for him to share with her that which was amusing him but when it seemed that he was going to have all the laugh to himself she said now uncle jack that is hardly fair share with me at what are you laughing now

when uncle jack was through with his narrative he began to clear away the dishes eina remaining to keep him company the while when this task was over uncle jack said miss eina ef yer doan keer ill sing er hime an hab er prarr wid yer fo we goes ter our restin places

eina assented and the two now bowed while uncle jack prayed in his prayer there was manifest the simple faith of a child a belief in the miraculous power of god and his readiness to resort to the miraculous to uncle jack heaven was a reality just over the way and as he talked of it eina could catch the gleam of the gold on the streets hear the angel shouts and taste of the nectar flowing from the throne of god

uncle jacks plea for protection through the night and for light to souls that were gropin in de dark was freighted with all the eloquence of a plea born of a whole heart and when he arose the tears were streaming down einas cheeks

uncle jack very solemnly bade her good night evidently not desiring to say or do anything that would disturb the solemn frame of mind in which he now found himself and eina

de sperrit is on me an i mils let it stay long ez it will was uncle jacks thought

the next morning at breakfast eina said uncle jack tell me how you professed religion wont you

uncle jack was by no means a fool and soon divined that eina had some deep purpose in having him talk his thorough knowledge of conditions in the south the visits of seth molair and his mother einas letter to clotille together with that sad anxious look which eina was wearing on her face fully assured uncle jack as to the great battle that was being fought out in einas mind

true to his promise to clotille uncle jack planned to introduce the man with the face of mystery baug peppers as a factor in the contest

miss eina i got er leetul favor i wants ter ax uv yer please miss said uncle jack to eina

say on uncle jack it will have to be a very large favor for me to thing of refusing you

thankee miss thankee in belrose dare is er fine frien uv mine whut i wants ter come out an see whar i am wukin i wants him ter take supper wid me dis evenin an i wants ter know ef yer will let me eat him in de dinin room atter yer is done wid yer supper

whut is er kannerbull miss please miss 

a man who eats men you say you want to eat your friend in the diningroom

hah hah hah laughed uncle jack heartily dat is shuah er good one on me wal my frien is good nough ter eat

uncle jack i shall grant your request on one condition and that is that you allow me to be the waitress for the occasion

why laws a mussy miss why no miss me ter hab yer ter wait on me nevah while my name is jackson simpkins hezekiah morris will i gree ter dat plan

all right then uncle jack said eina seeming to yield

that evening when uncle jack and baug had sat down to eat supper eina appeared at the door having on the cap and apron of a waitress

uncle jack held up his hands in horror but baug who had caught sight of the beautiful eina said uncle jack please be civilized

eina looked so very pretty in her waitress attire that baug seemed to feel dimly that she was some sort of an angel whom uncle jack might drive away baugs admonition and a look of rebuke in einas eye quieted uncle jack

baug was not as a rule a hearty eater but on this occasion he caused the food to disappear from the plates time and time again in order that he might have the waitress reappear the oftener after baug had eaten about all that he could possibly eat desiring to get one more look at the waitress he slipped the biscuits out of the plate into his pocket and called for more

my uncle jack this is good cooking is there any way uncle jack i can get out to see you a little oftener i always thought a great deal of you uncle jack as you know now that you are getting old you need companionship said baug very solicitously at the close of the meal

uncle jack chuckled inwardly he knew that it was the comely waitress and not the aged uncle jack that baug felt needed companionship but he appeared not to know at what baug was aiming

dis place is kinder fur out an i mout move in closer whar you could see me ofner baug said uncle jack innocently enough

now uncle jack i wouldnt think of leaving a nice place like this no no stay here uncle jack said baug realizing that if uncle jack left that place there might not be an excuse for his calling at the house where this waitress was

all right baug ill stay i wont go i lak ter take yer advice then uncle jack added as if incidentally de girl dat waited on us wont be our waitress ennymore consoling himself with the thought that he was at least technically telling the truth as eina was not of course the family waitress

this information seemed to throw a chill over baugs bouyant spirits and he grew silent for a few moments uncle jack watching him slyly out of the corners of his eyes

by the way uncle jack i may be rather busy for a while and may not be able to come to see you as often as i thought i would a few moments ago said baug falling into the trap that the shrewd uncle jack had laid for him

a little later on uncle jack said baug ive got er good chance ter wuk at de place whar de waitress will be termorrow but as yer vises me ter stay heah ill stay said uncle jack resignedly

well now uncle jack i am not infallible it might be best for you to change i cant just say in fact it might not hurt you uncle jack to always work at the place where the waitress works for evidently she is a good judge of desirable places said baug it was as much as uncle jack could do to avoid laughing outright

wal ill tell yer whut ill do ill persuade de waitress ter stay on heah er while tell we can see further i knows i kin do dat

now that is sensible uncle jack that is sensible by the way have you a calendar dares one on de wall

let me see let me see well no no no i am not going to be so busy after all for awhile in fact i need a little rest i guess ill be out to see you often uncle jack often ill even come sometimes in the afternoon uncle jack

all right baug come wen yer kin

baug now took his departure and uncle jack went out to his stable to indulge in a hearty laugh

dat baug done et ernough fur two men ter night an de scamp is carryin way ernough biscuits in his pockits ter start er small size bakery i nevah seed er man so smote in my life fust he wanted ter come ter see me den couldent come den could fust i mustnt leave den mout den moutent all cordin to whar de waitress was goin ter be hah hah hah i jes twisted him roun my finger

summer has gone and the green of the trees has given way to the somber brown of the autumn the students of the various institutions of learning located in belrose for the education of colored youths there are several such have arrived and settled down to work

in fact thanksgiving day is here and there is a great stir in negro social circles anent the great annual football contest between the two leading institutions of learning society among the whites is also all agog over a game to be played between the leading university team of the south and the team of one of the norths great schools so the city is alive with tooting horns and college yells and flying ribbons and gay equippages carriages and buggies tandems and tallyhos bearing happy girls and pleasantlooking matrons all wearing their best baug peppers is on hand with an open barouche escorting eina looking her very loveliest

at one point in the city a congestion of vehicles occurred and baugs carriage had to halt it stopped just behind one occupied by seth molair and a lady who was the acknowledged beauty of the city among the whites

seth molair happening to look around saw eina whereupon he politely lifted his hat and bowed eina returned the bow with a smile

the dense crowd of white and colored people at this point having its eyes focussed upon the two carriages because of the beauty of the occupants saw the incident and it created a mild sensation it not being customary for white men to practice the amenities toward colored women

all eyes now turned towards eina known to the crowd as a colored girl because baug was her escort there she sat the very essence of the beautiful her black eyes sparkling and her rich complexion tinged with a peachs red so innocent so open so noble was her appearance that every suggestion of the sinister that arose because a white man had spoken to her died on the threshold of the mind tentatively entertaining it

as baug peppers drove through belrose that day his eye wandered from face to face and of course frequently back to eina and though belrose had turned out its loveliest creatures he found none to compare with her

when they entered the football grounds they found a great throng there and when the carriage halted eina stood up to gaze about her grace characterized the demeanor of the women their attire being all that the most fastidious taste could exact while the men too presented a splendid appearance there was everywhere an air of culture

oh who can doubt the future of this people who can be ashamed to be numbered with them when they gaze upon a scene like this  murmured eina

baug now stood up by einas side and the two presented so fine an appearance that when a squad of marchers passed that way one of the group shouted three cheers for peppers and the queen that is with him and the cheers were given with a hearty good will

eina noted the abundant good humor and the enthusiasm that characterized the throng and turning to baug she said a people so constituted that they have a well of happiness within themselves to which  they can repair when the outer world goes dry will live long on the earth

well spoken baug replied

amid the cheers of their respective partisans the two football teams trotted out on the field and lined up for the struggle each of the teams was composed very largely of men who were spending their last year in school and it was realized that the struggle was to be one of the most desperate ever played in the history of the two schools

moving about among the players was the stalwart form of conroe driscoll of late conroe had been urging clotille to set a time approximately for their wedding but as baug was not yet out of the way and as miss letitia was still pessimistic as to what the colored man would amount to as a colored man clotille anxious if possible to retain her cousins favor and obtain the fortune was not disposed as yet to yield to conroes pleadings

conroe had learned that his color formed the basis of miss letitias objections to him and the situation grieved him sorely

it is a downright shame for a dark man to have to battle for the hand of a dark girl it is an abomination was conroes comment on the situation

he felt assured that clotille loved him but was deeply stung that she should hold back for a moment on account of the fortune having brooded over his case a great deal the day of the football game found him in a rather desperate mood in fact he was largely disheartened and was rather indifferent in spirit as to whether he did or did not continue the battle of life afflicted as he was at such a vital point by a reflection of color prejudice or color handicap within his own race

of course there were thousands and thousands of colored people of light complexion who did not draw the color line but what advantage was this fact to conroe when the one mulatto who had charge of the girl of his choice did draw the line 

conroe bestowed upon the school which he was attending a wealth of devotion being profoundly grateful to it for having provided the way by means of which he could catch an inspiring glimpse of the upper realms of life even if he was not to be spared to enter those realms

it was his resolve therefore to yield every atom of his strength to the task of winning the victory for his team that day and it mattered little to him as to the price that should be exacted of him even unto his death

the ball was put into play and it was soon seen that the two teams were about evenly matched the first half of the game was played with honors about evenly divided neither side scoring but when the second half opened it was soon apparent that some mighty force was at work on conroes team and it was conroe himself in a manner that showed an utter disregard for his own safety and that sent chill after chill of fear to clotilles heart he played his part in the game with almost superhuman strength

the opposing team was quick to note where their danger lay and began to center their attacks on conroe in an effort to weaken him the fact that he invited the attacks of the entire opposing team did not daunt but seemed rather to please him when called upon to carry the ball it was a thrilling sight to all save clotille to see the manner in which he ploughed along with the opposition in its entirety clinging to him when the ball was in the enemys hands like a steam engine he broke through all opposition and tackled the one carrying the ball only to be heavily piled upon himself by the opposition team

how conroe craved a blow that would kill

others have died on the football ground and why may not i was the cry of his heart

conroes team was nearing the goal line of the opposition and the ball was given to him for a plunge a dash a crush a falling down the ball carried forward to the danger line and conroe lay gasping upon the ground water carriers rushed to him with their sponges and the doctors were summoned

two ribs broken it seems one doctor murmured to another

oh is he dead is he dead cried clotille dropping to her knees clasping her hands her heart the home of agony

when conroe regained consciousness he sprang to his feet and said i am all right

the doctor looked at him saw that he gave no sign of being pained and thought that he had possibly been mistaken the doctor suggested that he leave the game but conroe said oh go away lady doctor i am all right get to your places boys

the two teams now faced each other for the final play the time for the game was all but out and neither team had thus far scored the team whose goal line was now threatened saw no opportunity to score against conroes team but with grim determination they awaited this final assault resolved to use every atom of force in their beings to prevent the score

the captain had his doubts about conroes ability to handle the ball at this crisis owing to the manner in which he had been battered he turned to catch the gleam of conroes eye to see whether the latter felt equal to the task

see that i get that ball was the message that conroe flashed to the captain

the opposition team caught the exchange of significant glances and prepared for conroe the whistle blew the signals were called and conroe received the ball

in this happy hour across the goal line of the enemy oh heaven give me death give me death

with this prayer upon his lips conroe made the plunge like wild beasts of the forests the opposition swarmed about him trying to pull him down his whole body seemed to him one great pain and he felt as though a world was upon him but somehow he did not shrink his will appeared to have converted his muscles into iron supported by his team he slowly steadily pushed the struggling mass of humanity opposing him back and back and back inch by inch

the mighty throng held its breath

slowly doggedly with grim determination conroe backed by his resolute team continued to push his way until across the goal line he fell to the ground clutching the ball as with hooks of steel

a mighty shout broke out upon the air and men wild with enthusiasm rushed to the scene intending to carry conroe on their shoulders around the grounds

but when the struggling players had disentangled themselves it was found that conroe did not rise

eina had noted the desperate character of conroes playing and her womans intuition told her at once that his bearing was that of a soul struggling with some dark shadow

learning where conroe was taken for treatment eina called on him and by her warm unfeigned sympathy completely won his confidence to her he told the story of his baffled love how that clotille the girl of his choice was being withheld from him on account of his color

as conroe was a noble handsome fellow eina divined at once that the trouble was not to be found in him but somewhere in things external to him as she gazed upon his fine manly face listened to the sentiments of his heart and thought of his love for one of his own mould from whom he was being debarred by sinister influences in american life she then and there resolved to dedicate her life to the sweeping away of whatever barriers stood in the way of the happiness of her beloved clotille and the admirable conroe

here then was to be a battle royal within the colored race eina of the light complexion battling against miss letitia of the light complexion the two taking opposite views with regard to the destinies of two dark persons

eina had learned to esteem very highly uncle jacks philosophizings and now that she was about to plan for the purging of the atmosphere that there might be a larger measure of hope for a man of the dark hue and less of sentiment against him she thought that it would be well for her to go back into the past that its mistakes might be a guiding influence in any new movement projected

uncle jack said eina one day as she stood observing him as he washed the buggy do tell me how it is that you colored people and the white people have gotten so far apart here in the south from what i can learn there was less of personal freindship after the war than during and before it how was that

ef yerll wait tell im done dis buggy an let me hab er extry big chaw uv terbacky anll lets take seats out heah in de shade uv de big tree ill make it plain er nough fur er babe said uncle jack

after the buggy was washed eina arranged the chairs and suffered uncle jack to equip himself with his thought stimulator thus situated uncle jack launched into his subject

befo de war i uster heah de white men scussin frein de slaves an de one thing dat dey said kep um back wuz dey thort dat de cullud people couldent be kep at wuk cepin ez slaves dats one reasun dat love nor money could make mos uv de ristocrat white folks gree ter turn de slaves loose

whut is rich sile wid no plow ter turn it up  home uv weeds said uncle jack pausing to empty his mouth of accumulated tobacco juice

wal wen manserpation come we uns had sewul notions fust we thort ter joy our liburtee by restin er while jes ter see how it feel not ter be at wuk some time we wuz by our liburtee lak er leetul boy wid er new top we wanted ter play wid it ter see how it would do den ergin we uns felt dat we could joy our liburtee better on some udder plantation dan on ourn yer see it wuz mighty hard fur er feller ter stan whar he uster be beat an bellow lak er steer an feel he wuz er man dat ole creepy feelin would somehow come back an so lots uv de cullud people lef fur udder plantations jes ter git plum erway frum ole times den ergin er new man mout not feel so spry round yer as yer own massa

wal de legislachurs kep us free all right an we at las felt lak men dem days but de white people sez dat dem legislachurs treated dem almos ez bad ez i heahs de people uv new yawk an phillerdelphia an fran sancisco hez been treated by some white folks

just here a smile appeared on uncle jacks face that smile that was always the forerunner of some humorous experience

the next afternoon as eina was sitting upon her porch reading a belrose paper uncle jack was in her front yard looking from flower bed to flower bed to see just which of the flowers demanded his attention his kindly face was aglow with the love he felt as he moved about among these tender beautiful children of the soil

eina now keenly alive to anything bearing on racial friction had just come across a tribute to the famous ku klux klan and the laudatory character of the reference was so at variance with all that she had heard of the organization that she read the tribute through several times and then summoned uncle jack to read the article to him

as she proceeded to read she looked up and noted such a look of woe upon uncle jacks face that she became alarmed

why dear uncle jack what on earth is the matter

uncle jack was shivering from head to foot

fur de lawds sake doan doan talk erbout dem ku kluxes he groaned

why uncle jack

wal ill tell yer miss eina said uncle jack now taking his chew of tobacco out of his mouth and tossing it into the cuspidor saying as he did so wen i comes ter de ku kluxes i doan need nuthin to stimmerlate me

fust uv all doan yer blieve dat de white people had ter oggunize ter purteck dare wimmin folks nevah been done since de worl comminced dat is down mongst our white folks evah since i knowed er heered bout white folks er white omans cry hez been er army an genuls an cunnels an evah thing white folks doan no more have ter oggunize ter purteck dare wimmins dan dey do ter have ter go ter bed at night white men jes nachally doos dat i doan know who blonged ter de ku kluxes wen it fust started an i doan know whut it wuz started fur but i got jes two things ergin um said uncl jack

uncle jack now bowed his head and lifted his large hands to his face

did you have any personal experiences with the ku kluxes asked eina

uncle jacks answer was a groan

tell me about them said eina

wal began uncle jack de white folks alius laked me an i could git er fust rate farm any time er white farmer who wuzunt so good at de businiss wuz turnt erway frum er farm an it wuz rented ter me he didunt lak dat an ez de ku kluxes wuz ridin in dem days he got up er gang an come ter my house dey shot in my house an kilt my twoyearole boy an my oneyearold leetul gal an shot my ole oman through de head

uncle jack here arose and slowly tottered from the room out in the back yard under the tree the old man wept as a babe when more selfpossessed he returned to the room and resumed his narrative

dey shot me too an took me out ter beat me an hang me continued uncle jack atter dey had beat me dey wuz purseedin ter hang me wen er gang led by de white man i wuz rentin frum come up an kilt evah las one uv um an got me dare dead botties showed dat dey wuz all de wuss men erroun feelin dat dare wuk would be took fur ku klux wuk dey had come ter en my days

uncle jack paused awhile as if in meditation miss eina do yer think de bes white people will evah gree ter wuk long wid de cullud people in de same perlittercul yoke dat is de qusshun said uncle jack as much to himself as to eina

that is the question said eina lost in deep thought

eina thought long over what uncle jack had let fall in his talks and now decided that she would play the part of mediator and bring the better elements of white and colored people of belrose together out of which harmonious relationship there would spring more benign influences to smile upon the pathway of her friends conroe and clotille

in keeping with this purpose eina wrote the following note my dear mr peppers will you please call at my home at eight oclock this evening sharpen your wits for i have a serious puzzle for you to unfold cordially eina rapona

will i will a pig eat corn will a bee draw nectar from a flower will i call to see miss rapona i should say that i will said the happy baug upon receiving the beautifully written note that eina had sent him exactly at one minute to eight he was ringing the door bell of einas home eina was attired very simply on this occasion and by virtue of this very fact was all the more beautiful thought baug

after a brief conversation on current topics eina plunged into the matter for which she had summoned baug

i have asked you here to help me solve the race question for belrose said eina her beautiful eyes resting upon baug with a trustful glance

if eina had asked baug to blow up the universe accompanying the request with that look of confidence he would not have had the heart to have said that what she asked was impossible and yet he felt that he must get the stupendous nature of the task before her

some very able people say that the question is absolutely unsolvable said baug taking pains by his tone of voice to have himself excluded from the group of unbelievers

i am of the opinion that it is decidedly easy of solution at least so far as belrose is concerned said eina

let me hear you on that point miss rapona said baug his interest greatly heightened

years of development since emancipation have produced a group of cleanly cultured aspiring people in the colored race the first step in the solution is for this group to take charge of and guide the racial thought and life it can be done and the confidence of the people in your character and ability point to you as the one man to weld this controlling group and to link it on to the masses of the colored people said eina

the dearest compliment that was ever paid me in my life when i reflect on the source said baug feelingly

eina bowed her thanks and continued there is a thoroughly enlightened and humane class among our white neighbors that can be reached i think with the colored people properly guided and working in unison with the strength of the white people of the south you will soon have no problem

i really think that you have the whole matter in a nutshell miss rapona i am at your service in fact all of my thoughts have been turned in this direction i can hardly say for what i have been waiting an inspiring force i suppose said baug

now mr peppers in my opinion your yoke mate among the whites should be lawyer molair seth molair

miss rapona said baugin a subdued voice have you noticed how very often our minds have run in the same channel

pausing a moment and looking directly into einas face that he might at least at this juncture hint at the deeper emotions of his heart he asked slowly what do you think is the significance of this mental affinity

eina blushed slightly let us discuss the psychology of our agreeing after we have won our battle said eina in a tone that revealed the fact that the hour when personal questions between herself and baug were to be taken up would not be an unwelcome one

it was now agreed that baug was to proceed at once to the organizing of the colored people of belrose and the putting of all that was highest in their life in the lead abortive efforts extending over many years to have certain amendments to the federal constitution enforced by influences without the south had convinced many of the more thoughtful colored people that it was high time for them to inaugurate some movement within the south itself that would serve to ameliorate the situation baug experienced therefore but little trouble in harnessing the substantial forces within the negro race in his movement the mere prospect of an honorable way to close the long political war between the races which had kept the south in the background of national affairs and had operated against the negroes locally was hailed with delight

the next problem and the problem as baug viewed the matter was to win the aid of molair

now hello by the eternals this thing is worth thinking about indeed it is

indeed it is

such were the sentiments to which seth molair gave voice as barred alone in his inner office he laid down an anonymous letter which he had just finished reading as was his wont when he was dealing with a matter that took deep hold upon his mind molair now began to walk to and fro in his office snapping his thumb and second finger as he walked this his stenographer had found out was a sure sign of an intense mood on his part and it was her rule to never allow callers to see him as long as he gave these signs of absorption she had learned that only the gravest matters thus worked upon him and that he appreciated her thoughtfulness in seeing that he was not disturbed at such times

who could have written this letter asked molair stopping at his desk as he walked he picked up the envelope and looked at the post mark it was a belrose letter and had been mailed on the day previous the address on the envelope and the letter itself had been written on a typewriter

let me read this letter again said molair he now sat down spread the letter before him and studied it closely as he read it ran as follows mr seth molair belrose

dear sir you do not know me and perhaps never will let me now stand to you as the voice of destiny

you are doing wrong in all your life you have done nothing actively to make the life of the colored people unbearable this is wrong and i can soon show it to you

what we americans need is homogeneiety in our population in the last analysis we ought to be a people of one type there is no room for two or more diverse ethnic types it works for inharmony

at this point molair when he first read the letter was very much puzzled

the letter had opened as though it came from some bitter foe of the negro but this last remark seemed to point to amalgamation with quickened interest he had gone on with the letter

now how are we to get this homogeneiety

we cant get the negro out of america the economic forces of the nation particularly of the south and the well known love of the negro race for the land of his birth shut that idea out

we cant murder them the eternal ages would not suffice to rid us of the accumulated strain of brutality that would be necessary for the wanton slaughter of ten millions of largely lawabiding and inoffensive people

at this point molairs wrath had begun to mount and his eye had sought the end of the letter desiring to know the name of the author who having discarded emigration and annihilation molair felt must be on the eve of boldly suggesting amalgamation but the next two sentences cured this thought and intensely heightened his curiosity to know just what was to be suggested the letter continued nor can we for a moment tolerate the thought of amalgamation which would throw us into the ranks of the colored races and make us heir to all their disadvantages internal and external homogeneiety must not come that way

this person must be a crank of some sort molair had thought at this point

i offer two suggestions the letter continued either of which would work well i think first let us pass a law forbidding all people to marry save mulattoes and white people allowing mulattoes to marry mulattoes only and whites to marry whites only we have on our hands both the license system and the police power we can refuse to license black people to marry and can throw all of them in jail who try to marry contrary to law

molair here smiled and said the fool why the jails of the world would not hold the prisoners

he read on

you see our prison systems in the south are moneymaking affairs anyhow and it would be to our interest to have more convicts the men could be sent to the mines and fields and the women could be made to serve as cooks and washerwomen each home could have a little jail into which the cook could be put and the food to be cooked could be handed in to her that would solve the servant problem as fast as the blacks died out we could fill their places with foreigners

the second suggestion is as follows let us multiply the burdens of the colored people until the maternal instinct within the race becomes saturated with the thought that there is no hope for the colored people as such

i learn that already the most profitable line of advertisement in the negro journals is of face bleaches the weaklings in the race are deathly anxious to lose the black complexion

let us make the anxious more anxious and widen the circle of anxious ones until it embraces the millions yet untouched

we can heat the race so hot with the fires of race prejudice that without being conscious of it it will turn against its own color the black man will avoid marrying the black woman and the black woman the black man the decree of nature will go forth that through the process of natural selection the race must be whitened

the white man and the negro woman of the south are free the negro men do not molest the white men for the negroes are deterred by the mob and by state authorities with machine guns the results of these unions thrown into the negro race can help to whiten that race by this route we can produce a white race out of the negro race

but you will say i fancy i hear you saying it eventually we could not tell colored from white and that the colored could then glide into the white race imperceptibly

brand them get a little marker and stamp on the arm of every infant this is a colored person have the license clerks to force all men and women desiring to wed to appear before them in person and show their arms

you see in this way we will get the offensive black color out of our way and yet not have any of that blood in our race

we could require candidates for office to canvass with their sleeves rolled up so as to disclose a brand or the absence of it that we might know whether they were white or colored

now mr molair give up your attitude of kindliness let us i say continue to drive the black man and the black woman as possible mates farther and farther apart create such conditions as the whole negro race will rue the day that it was made black sear this thought into their souls write it in the marrow of their bones do this and through the white man the weak negro woman and the tendency of the race to so marry as to lighten its hue we will eventually be rid of the hated color black

tor the sake of a homogeneous country dont make life easier for the colored race and thus perpetuate the blacks as blacks

make it harder give the colored man the same rights as you do a white man and what incentive has he to desire to be white

such was the letter that had stirred such a deep interest in molair he hardly knew how to take the letter its professed tone was one of hostility to the negro race but he did not believe that a person with the sense to write the letter could really favor the policy of cruelty suggested the reasoning in the letter at some points seemed profound others were absolutely absurd the thing that interested molair most was the thought that the prejudice of the white race was operating in the direction at least of trying to create a stampede of the colored people away from their color

well it is a little unreasonable to set a mans house on fire and then tell him to stay there said molair to himself

well sir this prejudice is actually operating to draw into the white race more negro blood than would dream of getting there without its aid i see that clearly now

he continued his walking and reflecting

it is said he mused that a disease which a man fears and broods over is the more likely to overtake him are we not by our prejudices the greatest breeders of discontent in colordom in keeping with natures wellknown tendency to equip its children to cope with their environments where color is a handicap will its tendency not be to disappear the letter which had thus stirred the mind of seth molair had been penned by the moody conroe who had been told of einas purpose to use him and who now sought in this way to open to his view the possibilities of a policy of discouragement

when baug called at seth molairs office he found that the latter was at home sick with the smallpox and as the manner in which the dreaded disease was contracted might be expected to have some bearing on his decision in the matter of such vital concern to clotille and conroe it is perhaps well to state how the malady was acquired

one morning as molair sat in his office he received a letter from the son of a colored man whom his father had numbered among his slaves this young fellow was in jail charged with having committed a murder but his solemn protestations of innocence somehow impressed molair

the molairs had never ceased under freedom to exercise a paternal care over all those who had belonged to the family in the days of slavery extending this interest to their descendants thus though busy molair had felt constrained to go to the aid of the accused man to begin with there was a presumption in molairs mind in the mans favor for just as the negroes had great faith in their white folks the whites as a rule had great faith in their negroes

arriving in the town where the man was incarcerated molair repaired to the jail for a conference the jail was used very little for white prisoners the most of them being able to make bond and the jailer having as a rule nothing but negro prisoners to deal with paid practically no attention to sanitary conditions in the prison

as a result the place reeked with filth smallpox had developed there had been kept a secret by such prisoners as knew it and it was into this atmosphere loaded with poisonous germs that the kindhearted molair walked

molair assured himself as to the innocence of the accused man laid the foundations for a successful case turned the matter over to a local attorney whom he paid well and returned to belrose but not before the taint of smallpox had sunk into his system

deep was molairs mortification and chagrin at having the smallpox in view of its classification as a filth disease and the dark thought now and then obtruded itself upon him that such was his reward for troubling himself with the woes of a colored man

when eina heard of molairs illness uncle jack was deputized to go and find out what he could about it he returned bringing the news that it was smallpox with which molair was afflicted and that he contracted the disease trying to serve a colored man

uncle jack did not of course understand einas plans but he judged from the look of woe upon her beautiful face that in some way it was essential to their success that molair get well so he decided to take a hand in the matter himself

when his evenings work was done uncle jack with einas permission drove into belrose and halted his horse at the door of one of the nicest of the houses situated in a section of the city largely owned by the colored people ringing the door bell he brought to the door an aged colored woman a mrs lucy martin who greeted him cordially

why it is you jack i am so glad to see you

i is glad ter see yer lucy glad ter see yer responded uncle jack

the two sat down and uncle jack began looking around the room at the furnishings

yer got er tolerable nice house lucy tolerable nice an yer got it fixed up putty nice too said uncle jack

yes thanks to my boy seth molair i got a good start and have my little home and furnishings all paid for seth is a good dear boy said mrs martin

the old womans voice trembled and uncle jack took another and keener look at her

air yer sick lucy asked uncle jack

oh i havent been feeling so well here lately but nothing serious old age i reckon replied mrs martin somehow her appearance did not exactly suit uncle jack so he studied her for awhile then arose to go

jack said the woman dont you know better than to try to leave here without telling me what you came to tell me you cant fool me jack now out with it you came to tell me something you bad boy you

now lucy dats all right dont yer bother dats all right

no it isnt all right and you have got to tell me what is wrong i know you jack it is something serious i knew it as soon as you came to that door

wal lucy evah thing dat is lawful aint alius spedient yer see so i mus tell yer good night

jack said mrs martin you know me i am an old woman and you know i have a number of white and colored children and grandchildren in this place some one of my children must be sick tonight for you to be here now have pity on a poor old woman dont make me roam this town all night tell me so i can go straight to him or her

dat is jes why i doan want ter tell yer i sees dat yer constertution aint de bes an yer might not be ekal ter de tas

mrs martin did not hear the last part of this remark for she was busy getting up her nursing aprons and her favorite little remedies at length she had all that she was looking for and forgetting in her anxiety to tell her home people goodbye went at once with uncle jack to the buggy

when seated by uncle jacks side mrs martin said jack i havent been feeling right for a week or more i just knew that something was going on wrong now jack since you cant outdo me be a good boy and tell me who it is of my folks thats sick

wal ef i mus i mus but pon my honah i done all i could not ter tell its seth

seth poor poor seth what ails him asked mrs martin eagerly

smallpox

father have mercy that dirty filthy disease in my family why the thoughts of it are enough to kill poor seth its a wonder he isnt dead and buried i wish i could get hold of the dirty lousy scamp that gave it to him id wring his neck till heâheâwell i wouldnt kill him but hed be so near dead that he would enjoy life when he got back to it poor poor seth and they have been keeping it from me they knew i was ailing a little my poor poor boy mammy will be there soon rest easy mammy is coming seth

thus rambled lucy martin seth molairs black mammy as uncle jack whirled her along through the streets of belrose to seth molairs home

when molair had sufficiently recovered from his illness to resume his law practice baug called upon him for the purpose of inviting his cooperation in a movement that would give recognition to the colored citizens of belrose as a part of the citys governing force that would clarify the atmosphere that was giving worry to eina because of its baleful effects on miss letitia through whom it was blighting the lives of conroe and clotille inspired by the thought that eina was profoundly interested in the outcome of this conferenceâthis effort to win over to a cause one of the nations brightest minds baug was keyed up to the point of doing the best of which he was capable

before we take up your matter what objection have you to our white primaries molair asked of baug

you have heard of the irishmans comment on fredrick douglass have you not asked baug tell it

an irishman hearing douglass speak was very much impressed with his oratory and proceeded to compliment him being told that douglass was only half colored he remarked if half a naygur can speak like that what could a whole naygur do your race in england and america divides into two great almost evenly matched parties into active and corrective creative and critical forces your southern white primaries dominated by the one party invite in only onehalf of the soul of your race about onehalf of this racial soul already halved mark you may dominate your white primary and the verdict of this half of the half soul of the race is accepted without a serious try out before the whole soul said baug

here is a thoughtful colored man said molair to himself growing deeply interested to baug he said let me see if i catch the point of your douglass joke you think that for a full expression of the soul of our race we need two parties creative and critical that such opposite forces naturally flourish not in the same but in opposing parties just as the human family divides itself into sexes and when we have only one party just onehalf of the racial soul is at work the irishmans half naygur 

exactly mr molair it is true that you now and then let down your bars so that a white man of a political faith other than that of your dominant party can enter and vote but his connection with the other party forces him to come in quietly so that you still miss that unfettered ferment of the whole anglosaxon spirit that grand free play of all the forces of your racial soul that has in reality been the source of the political greatness of your race now just read this mr

molair said baug handing him a clipping from the leading daily paper of belrose

mr molair read as follows doubtless when the official conduct of this creature is laid bare it will reveal him as a grafter hypocrite and dirty whelp which would fit with his known character of a coarse revolting lying demagogue and disgusting barbarian who would never associate with gentlemen except by sufferance and to their annoyance

well what about it asked molair

that is said about one of your united states senators an output of your primary can you conceive of the whole soul of the white race being in travail and giving birth to such a man that is a product of your half soul you southern white people constantly say that senators like this are not truly representative of your people they do not represent your people at their highest but they do illustrate the fruit of your half soul system or rather your quarter soul system of elevating men

since you and our white primary system are in the ring what other lick have you for it asked molair

i am a patriot i love the south i would like to see the south take its oldtime place in the councils of the nation if we of the south continue to send our quarter soul products to compete with the whole soul products of other sections where the white race crowns its victors after a try out before the full racial strength we will always be behind i fear said baug earnestly

how does this in your judgment affect the colored people asked molair

let me repeat what your leading paper of belrose says about that senator

 doubtless when the official conduct of this creature is laid bare it will reveal him as a grafter hypocrite and dirty whelp which would fit with his known character of a coarse revolting lying demagogue and disgusting barbarian who would never associate with gentlemen except by sufferance and to their annoyance now if your quarter soul system produces that type of a man for a senator just think what your chances are for getting jailers sheriffs policemen prison guards and the like who armed with the states authority have over prisoners and the public the power of life and death said baug

how do the colored people of belrose fare at the hands of the police force asked molair

you know mr molair there was a time in england when a man would be hanged for a comparatively light offense but that was long long ago the police of belrose have turned the hand on the dial of civilization back back back to those dark days they have actually made it an offense punishable by death for a colored boy or man to run from an officer however slight the offense

is that really the case asked molair

mr molair said baug earnestly what else could you expect with your great men gone into hiding and your weaker spirits in the saddle elected to office without regard to the colored people they often oh often actually turn the government into an engine of oppression sheriffs sometimes connive at lynchings police often murder wantonly gubernatorial candidates finding that our hands are tied and that there are votes to be made by bitterly attacking us do not hesitate to so do the spirit of repression cultivated and kept at fever heat by the seekers for votes permeates the entire social atmosphere denying us a voice the government by the act of exclusion brands us with the mark of a cain and as we go forth we find increasingly the hand of man raised against us and i predict that with the negro denied a voice in the government this fact in itself will deepen and deepen the gulf between the races with the whites being governed by its weaker minds as i pointed out and with those weaker minds in charge of a race both helpless and contemned you may guess the rest

continuing baug said no class of colored people in belrose feel safe if you knew the extent of the maltreatment of all classes of colored people by some members of the police force it would amaze you brutal assaults and murder wanton wanton wanton murder of man after man has been committed and yet not even a reprimand has ever been given to those who have done the killing though witnesses of character white and colored have endeavored to bring the accused to trial

tell me exactly now what you desire of me molair said evidently deeply moved by what baug had said

those of us who abide in the negro race realize the disadvantages that come to us as a result of being a negligible quantity in the body politic the type of men that comes to the front has respect for the unit of power nothing else and so long as the negros face is a badge of weakness it will be just as difficult to maintain respect for his interests with that class as it is to keep an unmuzzled horse that is loose in a pasture from eating green grass spread out in abundance around him we desire to be a part of the government we desire that you make the race for the mayoralty of our city and appeal to the whole body of your fellow citizens white and colored for support when those who persecute us find that we have a voice in the making and the unmaking of officials we shall receive more humane treatment such mr molair is our request of you said baug

of course you know that you are asking me to cut myself off from all hope of preferment save that of a local nature if i take hold of you here on an independent basis i lose my party regularity you know what that means but that is not vital a molair is not dependent upon public station for a place in history he can make his own throne said molair to baug

i do not see the matter altogether in that light mr molair party and sectional lines are being less and less tightly drawn it is only a matter of a few years before the nation will again pick its presidents from our section and if such men as you are put forward as candidates you will find no happier more enthusiastic supporters than will be the colored people without any desire to offer flattery i know of no southerner better equipped than you to fill that high office

thank you said molair who really valued the good will of the colored people

continuing baug said that man white or black who can construct a political yoke in which the negroes and the best white people of the south may work together in harmony will deserve more than the presidency he will deserve a place in the ranks of the immortals alongside the two other great southerners thomas jefferson whose mind coined that slowburning fuse all men are created equal and abraham lincoln who issued the emancipation proclamation

it is quite a picture you dangle before my eyes but preferment beyond our city life or no preferment i have had recently a most touching example of selfsacrifice that ought to spiritually equip me for all time for unselfish service said molair

arising from his seat molair went to a window and looked out while he talked to baug to whom his back was now turned he dared not trust himself face to face with baug while he was discussing the subject which had now come into his mind for he was upon the verge of shedding tears

when he had regained sufficient control of his feelings to permit molair resumed the conversation saying yes mammy lucy that dear soul who in my infancy crooned above my cradle and rocked me to sleep with her lullaby songs who saw that my every boyish whim was gratified who washed and anointed my bruises and comforted my childish heart when beaten and humiliated in a fight i fled to the shelter of her apron who more than once with her sympathetic nature wooed disease from me and drew it upon herselfâmammy lucy taught me in its fullness the lesson of human love when hearing of my illness she came with her wan face and emaciated form and took my life from the altar of death and in its stead sweetly laid thereon her own with my heart green with the memory of her sublime selfrenunciation i am in a mood as a sort of atonement to forego vital interests of my own for the sake of the interests of others after molair had delivered himself thus he stood in silent meditation for awhile then turned and walked toward baug and said go your way this is a grave grave question i must have time for reflection i received a peculiar letter not long since that has put me to thinking on this question more deeply than ever before i know not now what my decision will be may heaven grant me light

in keeping with a suggestion from baug molair had decided to keep watch on the police force to find out just how the negro population was faring so we find him morning after morning sitting in the city court room which was usually filled for the most part with colored people of the lower order besotted men and slovenly women denizens of the slums constituted the great majority of those on trial drunkenness fights as the result of jealousy petty thefts and vagrancy were the charges as a rule lodged against the accused there happened to be in the group on this particular morning a nicely dressed colored boy with an open honest countenance and his appearance quickened in molair an interest in him that we may understand just how this boy whose fate played an important part in shaping molairs decision happened to be on trial as a vagrant it is necessary to drop back somewhat into his history

one day a few weeks previous to this trial about two oclock in the afternoon a crowd of people mostly colored had gathered around a merrygoround located on a vacant lot in belrose charlie douglass a colored boy driving a flour wagon passing near the assembled crowd caught sight of a neatly dressed little colored girl with a package of school books under her arms he halted his wagon dismounted and drew near to this girl ostensibly for the purpose of looking at the merrygoround but in reality to be near the little girl that had attracted his attention

in the assembled throng there was a drunken white man who was using profane language in the presence of a number of colored girls and women the little girl who had attracted charlies attention was in the group near the man using the objectionable language

charlie walked up to the man quietly and said to him very politely mister please dont talk that way so the girls and women can hear you

the drunken man turned to see who it was that accosted him enraged at the thought of a negro daring to criticise his conduct he drew a pocket knife opened it and rushed toward charlie

as the lad had taken pains to speak so politely he was taken by surprise by this sudden onslaught and had to run backward to avoid being cut as the man kept coming toward him charlie as soon as he could turn did so and ran with all the speed at his command the white man in hot pursuit

the girls and women shouted run boy run run boy run

the feet of the drunken man being somewhat unsteady he fell and thus gave charlie time to make his escape

dora mack the neatly dressed nice looking brownskinned little girl that had attracted charlies attention now made a hero of him she thought it was so nice in him to speak to the horrid man and the deft manner in which he ran backward and the speed that he made when he could get his back to the man were simply fine as dora viewed the matter on her way to and from school each day dora passed the place where charlie worked and now took occasion to greet him with a smile whenever she saw him he was a nice looking colored boy even when covered almost from head to foot with flour that is pretty little dora mack thought so

to charlies way of thinking dora was just the girl for him and he decided to try to stand a little higher in her favor the plan which he hit upon to advance himself in her esteem was to change his job from the handling of flour to one that would permit him to wear nice clothes all the time

dora is entitled to a boy that looks nice all the time thought charlie

thus much to his mothers chagrin charlie decided to give up his job realizing that her son who since the death of her husband was her main support was doing about as well in point of wages as a belrose colored boy was expected to do mrs douglass his mother strenuously opposed the change charlie tried to mollify her feelings by pouring into her lap all his little savings but even this did not heal the breach between them nevertheless charlie quit his job and dressed up to enjoy a few days vacation and to be able to walk as far toward her home with dora on her way from school as the fear of doras mother would allow him dora not being permitted as yet to receive company

this worked all right for a few days until charlies employer noticed that he was simply lounging around this employer had not been successful in getting as satisfactory a hand as charlie had been and he was therefore all the more vexed at him for causing his discomfort and loss by leaving he offered the boy an increase in wages to return to work but it was not more money that charlie wanted just now but a job that would permit the constant wearing of clothes nice enough for doras beau pretty tidy little doras beau

thinking that he might be doing charlie charlies mother and himself a service the employer told a policeman of charlies lounging place and suggested that it might serve as a good lesson to arrest him as a vagrant accordingly one day before dora came along the policeman put charlie under arrest and took him to the police station it was thus that he made his way into court where molair caught sight of and became interested in him

charlies mother being unable to pay his fine the boy was sentenced to the chain gang this was a most galling thought for him it having been the pride of his family that none of them in any of its branches had up to that time been arrested but that which pricked him to the very heart was the thought that dora must know of his incarceration and perhaps see him at work with the pick about his ankle

the carts in which the prisoners rode from the police court to the streets from which they were to clean the mud by scraping with hoes were brought around filled and started off to charlies dismay the carts stopped on one of the streets along which dora always journeyed to her home but her journey on this part of the street was only for a few blocks and charlie hoped that they would have cleaned off that part along which dora came before her hour for passing and would thus be out of sight from the point where she would have to turn the corner leaving that street

but the day was a little sultry and those in the chain gang were not disposed to work very rapidly charlie worked very hard doing about as much work as any three of the others in his eagerness to have the gang through with doras part of the street ere she came along but his course in working so rapidly displeased his easygoing fellowprisoners and they worked all the more slowly because of this fact

as time wore on it began to look as though they were not to do the amount of cleaning desired by charlie and desperation and despair settled over his young heart his wild nervous look his constant glancing around as if expecting something the dark brooding that his face revealed his working ahead of his companions attracted the attention of sherman elliott the white guard who unknown to charlie was keeping a special watch on him

glancing down the street charlie saw a group of high school children coming the pick which he had around his ankle was much worn his keen eye having noted this defect when choosing the one to put on he felt that the pick could be broken if one was but willing to stand the jar of the lick necessary moving to the curbing charlie dashed the pick against the stone and sundered it away charlie bounded thinking only of dora and desiring to be out of her sight as she passed the chain gang the guard who had been watching for this moment lifted his gun and fired wounding charlie in the back the boy fell forward on his face and a number of bystanders rushed to him to lift him up

dontâdont turn my face up dora dora dora murmured charlie

thinking that turning him over might perhaps hurt him the men followed his request and allowed him to lie with his face downward while they telephoned for an ambulance

she wont see she wont see murmured charlie faintly his face still toward the earth

slowly the smile of satisfaction over the fact that dora would not see and know him faded from charlies face and the little fellow passed into eternal silence if the passing dora looked upon his lifeless form he at least did not know it

sherman elliotts shot and the fact that there was not the slightest effort to molest him decided molairs course and he crossed the rubicon

in the campaign that followed seth molairs announcement as a candidate for the mayoralty there was a development in the political situation which neither molair nor baug had foreseen and which served to complicate matters far beyond their anticipation

the organization of the dominant party heretofore fearing no appeal to the larger sense of the community being confident that the one party sentiment would hold it in power regardless of the mental and moral calibre of its candidates had uniformly preferred to put forward men of the weaker mould who might be the more easily used as puppets but the moment it became known that seth molair was to try for the mayoralty independent of organization influences the organization saw at once that heroic action was required

the offices for years ahead had been parceled out but they now deemed it advisable to withhold the candidacy of the weakling whom they had designed for the mayors chair and to nominate a man of the molair type thus molair found himself pitted against a far stronger personality than either he or baug had calculated upon

the contest was truly one of the most exciting in the history of belrose it seemed that the cleansing testing developing influence of a genuine battle the very lifebreath of other sections had at last come to this hitherto complacent if stagnant so far as political thought was concerned city of belrose

when the campaign was at its height and it was discovered that the whites were so evenly divided that the negro vote constituted the balance of power it was agreed by organization influences that an effort should be made to draw the support of the negroes away from the molair ticket

in view of the long record of hostility to the negro voters on the part of the organization no hope was entertained of having large numbers of them to suddenly change and come to its rescue so money was furnished to an element of whites that manned the party under whose name the bulk of the colored people usually voted to the end that a ticket bearing the old name might be brought out to withhold negro support from molair

one hon thomas barksdale perennial candidate for the postmastership of belrose was commissioned to harness the negro voters to this decoy movement a group of negro ward politicians was summoned to a conference with the hon thomas barksdale and uncle jack hearing of the conference decided to be present at the appointed hour the committee of negroes put in its appearance at barksdales office

uncle jack who prided himself upon dealing with none but quality white folks looked with manifest disgust at the surroundings barksdales office was without carpet the desk antiquated the library of books disarranged the whole wearing an unkempt appearance

tilted back in a chair a great sickly soulless smile upon his face sat the hon thomas barksdale having upon his head a once high beaver hat upon which it would seem from its appearance some goliath of gath had sat and which some little david had subsequently tried to straighten his smile disclosed the ragged remnants of his teeth and at the same time allowed two slight streams of tobacco juice to ooze out of the corners of his mouth anointing the ends of his sandy mustache which shaped like the claws of a crab nestled near his jaws

when ready for the conference the hon thomas barksdale stood up bringing in bold relief his tall angular frame his illfitting prince albert coat his pantaloons baggy at the knees but a little shirky about reaching well down to this statesmans very broad foundation

we are all here i suppose said the hon thomas barksdale in that peculiar drawl common to the uncultivated whites

we is responded uncle jack who to the surprise of all assumed the role of spokesman

ive summoned you here to tell you colored folks that now is your chance said the hon thomas

oh thank you sah thank you sah said uncle jack effusively

the hon thomas drew near one of the group laid a hand on his shoulder familiarly closed an eye and with the index finger of his free hand began to wax eloquent

yes sir your day has come there is some of us who have fit bled and died standing up fur your people said he

yes sah yes sah said uncle jack jes ez yer says some uv yer hab fit fled and flied for us cullud folks

the hon mr barksdale opened his other eye to see if he was quite correct for he fancied he had caught a note of sarcasm in uncle jacks voice but uncle jacks countenance seemed so sober that the hon mr barksdale decided that he was mistaken he therefore closed the eye again and proceeded we set you all free you colored people and we are going to stand by you to the last

yes sah i hez heered yer riccord in de civul war scussed ergin an ergin but i alius heered dat yer had de riccord ez er runner an not as er stanner said uncle jack humbly enough

the hon mr barksdale brought his closed eye back into service dropped his hand from the mans shoulder and stepped back a little

now i can explain that record you see i knew that the yankees needed spies in the south and that is why i put on dresses during the war and there were things that i knew that nobody else knew and if i had got killed what would have become of my knowledge so whenever a fight came up just for the sake of my country i always sacrificed my keen desire to fight and ran so as to preserve my knowledge for the benefit of the country i hated to run but as i said i sacrificed my feelings for my country

takin dat view uv de mattah an jedgin frum de speed dat yer air said ter hab made in gittin out uv belrose wen de sojers come in yer wuz sartainly one uv de greatis dat is at leas one uv de swiftis paytruts dat de war purduced said uncle jack

uncle jack now subsided and allowed the hon thomas to submit his proposition when he had finished the appointed spokesman of the group who had been well groomed by baug said mr barksdale we have followed the lead of men of your station in life for several decades under your leadership we find the constitution nullified segregation practiced official maltreatment in full swing you have been powerless to influence the situation another class of the whites has been found to work with our leaders and we are going to see what they can save from the wreck we would to god the whites had consented sooner to work with us and had not left us to the mercies of those who sacked the state government escaped with the loot and left us with the odium goodbye

as the negroes filed out the hon thomas barksdale stood with his mouth wide open in astonishment uncle jack was the last to leave and the hon mr barksdale had so far recovered his selfpossession or had so much the farther lost it that he administered a kick to uncle jack

hah hah hah dats bout whut forty years uv servin hez brung our people frum de pie counter man er kick out said uncle jack

ill never believe it ill never believe it until i see it with these two eyes of mine and then ill doubt it said miss letitia

well cousin you will see seth molair haa pledged it and he is a man of his word responded clotille

yes but seth molair is just one man even if he is the mayor of belrose the idea of the white people of belrose tolerating colored men on the fire department they will never do it said miss letitia

cousin you are too hard i know two southern cities in which white people teach colored children in  the public schools i know three southern cities in which colored men are on the police force replied clotille

yes but that isnt belrose when the white people of belrose put colored men on the fire department i will know that the millenium is nigh at hand said miss letitia in such a manner that clotille knew that she desired the conversation to close

upon his election to the office of mayor seth molair had asked baug to name him some arm of the public service in which he would like to see colored men employed

baug had conferred with clotille and she had suggested the fire department clotille knew of miss letitias ardent admiration for fire fighters and felt that if colored men could be gotten on that department it would serve to make a deep impression upon the mind of her cousin and cause her to feel that after all that which seemed impossible could come to pass so when baug brought to clotille the assurance that a colored fire company would be established she conveyed the information to her cousin and we have seen how the latter received it

but even the doubting miss letitia could not hold out against a fact against the testimony of her own eyes when the necessary building had been erected and the company installed miss letitia would pass by the place several times a day to catch sight of what she regarded as one of the marvels of the age when she would awake in the morning her first act would be to attire herself and walk over to the colored fire companys enginehouse as if to see whether or not it had been carted away during the night though bitterly opposed to the use of bicycles on the part of women miss letitia bought one and learned to ride so that she might be able to follow up fires and see the colored firemen fight the flames

when at last miss letitia did see the colored firemen actually fighting the flames her enthusiasm knew no bounds and clotille felt that at last the pessimism with which her cousin was afflicted now had a chance to pass away

but this very success the establishment of harmonious political relations between the races resulting in the colored fire company had raised another difficulty miss letitia was so elated over the new company that the very thought of ever losing it affected her greatly she realized that it was the negros wise course in the matter of voting that had secured the company and she therefore became deeply concerned about the right to vote

oh i am so afraid that some of those old disfranchising laws will come here some day and upset all this nice work i will never feel safe until the supreme court has spoken against the discriminating laws in other states if that could be brought about i believe i could sleep at night

it was thus that clotille discovered that she had a new and grave problem on her hands

straight from the interview with her cousin in which this newfound impediment was discovered clotille rushed to einas home

eina eina my cousin i do believe is beginning to see the light but one more step needs to be taken before our road is perfectly clear

well in the name of the blessed virgin let us get that out of the way i do believe i would as soon contract to move a mountain as to get you and that conroe married said eina laughingly

now tell me the next step tell me quickly and let me get to work on it eina continued

we must wipe from the constitutions of certain southern states such of their laws as have the effect of disfranchising colored people on account of their racial connection said clotille

einas beautiful cheerful face took on a sober look at this announcement the great difficulties in the way of having the laws declared unconstitutional occurring to her

remembering a boston acquaintance eminent in the legal profession who had given long and careful study to the legal aspects of the suffrage question eina forthwith communicated with him inclosing an appropriate fee and in due course of mail received from him a statement outlining a course of procedure which in his judgment would beyond doubt force an unequivocal declaration from the supreme court

when eina received the plan she had clotille to call and confer with her over it a call that the perturbed clotille was happy indeed to be able to make the plan outlined involved the cooperation of an illiterate negro and after a thorough discussion of all the probabilities and possibilities in the case it was decided that uncle jack was the best equipped man of their acquaintance to carry through the plan with the least possible friction and personal danger the two girls therefore summoned him into the conference with them

uncle jack thought he was being summoned to tell some of his jokes so he came bringing his

chaw of terbacky an cuss spit daw and wearing a smile on his aged face he had mustered to the fore in his mind some of his most laughable anecdotes but the serious looks on the faces of the two young women chased away his smile and his jocular mood

as eina began to unfold to uncle jack the dire need of upsetting the laws in question he was emphatic in his approval nodding his head vigorously saying dats so dats so and giving every evidence of feeling highly honored that the young women had called him in to help consider so grave a matter

eina next explained the plan by means of which she hoped to have the case so brought as to force a decision though not a supreme court lawyer the gallant uncle jack assured eina that it was the best plan ever devised

now for the man said clotille

de lawyah uv cose i says baug quickly responded uncle jack

no not the lawyer we can get him all right we mean the colored man that will carry out this plan that i have explained and thus bring on the crisis said eina

i see i see uv cose yer wouldnt want me i is er illlittered man an couldnt hardly be spected ter bring de crisis ter yer all ez i wouldnt know it ef i seed it i aint nevah seed one

eina and clotille smiled at uncle jacks conception of a crisis while clotille said well you would be very likely to know this crisis when it came uncle jack and you are the very man that we have decided upon

uncle jack lifted his head back opened wide his eyes while his jaws fell slightly apart this serious piece of business was indeed a surprise to him

yer ladies jes wait heah er few minutes an ill come back an give yer er answer

so saying uncle jack arose and slowly left the room his frame having lost its erect carriage

after a short stay in the stable where he had stood with bowed head and folded arms reflecting uncle jack returned to the room where eina and clotille sat awaiting him

fur yer ladies ter understan de feelins dat i been goin through since yer all tole me whut yer wanted began uncle jack ill hab ter tell yer er leetul sperunce uv mine dat i had durin uv de war

from day to day uncle jack watched the movement of the sun as to its setting noted the shortening of the days the browning of the leaves upon the trees and finally their falling to the earth

wal de persimmons is erbout right now an de possums am fat an i spose its erbout time ter go

securing some one to fill his place for a short while uncle jack now took his departure omitting to state to any one where he was going or for what purpose

a short distance from the side of the roadway bisecting nelson county into eastern and western halves sitting at the end of an archway several hundred feet long which archway was made by two rows of well developed cedar trees sat a somewhat large country farmhouse uncle jack with some difficulty opened the large farm gate

times shuah doos change said he regaining his breath after his effort how well do i member how i uster fling dat gate open wen i wuz er lad

the old man looked wistfully down the tree made lane towards the house as he journeyed in that direction his mind was on the spirits of the departed who once occupied the old house but were now gone forever arriving at the front door he started to knock but changed his mind and went around to the rear

ill go in at de back door ez i did in ole times

in response to a knock on the rear door a small boy followed by a bevy of openmouthed children alive with curiosity opened the door and admitted uncle jack

 ton my soul ef it aint old jack morris said an aged woman sitting near the fire blazing in the open fireplace who had adjusted her spectacles and lifted her pipe from her mouth in order that she might the better survey the newcomer

the name that the woman called brought the whole army of children about uncle jacks legs in the home of his aunt melissa crutcher and her son the name of jack morris was a household word for jack was the son of her brother and as a youth had been uniformly kind to all and was dearly beloved by all both white and black

jack morris yer mean thing yer set down dare an let me look at yer said aunt melissa

uncle jack did as he was bidden and he and aunt melissa were soon exchanging reminiscences of old times

by and by horace crutcher aunt melissas son and uncle jacks cousin who was now the owner of the old plantation on which uncle jack was a slave came in and was no less delighted than the others at the presence of uncle jack

wal yer all wants ter know what ise heah fur dont yer said uncle jack

yer orter be heah ter lib tell yer die jack said aunt melissa

wal ise come ter be er man uv some portance in my ole days im tole by some whut knows dat dare is er place cut out in der histries fur me an i mus look atter dat putty soon but ise heah now ter hab er good ole time in evry way an den ter hab my funeril preached

at first it was thought that uncle jack was jesting but it was finally seen that he was in earnest and plans were set on foot to humor him in all his requests the crutcher boys were glad to lead him out one moonlight night in quest of the possums and they and uncle jack were a delighted set when at daybreak next morning they returned with the coveted animals aunt melissa crutcher had stepped aside some years since for her daughterinlaw as a cook but in this instance she bade her step aside and herself cooked the possum for uncle jack

sunday came the church members were out in force and engaged in covenant meeting the telling on the part of each of his christian experience and determination religious fervor ran high the old plantation melodies were sung with zest and a high degree of emotion was generated uncle jack wept and laughed by turns from sheer joy frequently exclaiming my soul is habin er feast uv good things

the funeral was duly announced and on the appointed day the people white and colored dropped their tasks and met at the negro church where both the white and negro pastors delivered eulogies concerning the whitehaired uncle jack who sat with bowed head in a corner of a front seat

when the funeral was over and his life had been duly set forth to the hearers the entire audience passed around and shook uncle jack by the hand

when uncle jack had returned to aunt melissas from the church she said now jack morris yer air bout ter go back ter belrose an i wouldnt lak ter die thinkin dat jack had turnt ter er fool now splain ter me dese goin ons dat yers been havin out heah wal aunt merlissa ef you will sen de chillun out i will splain things ter yer

for sometime miss letitia gilbreath had not been altogether pleased with the amount of attention that baug was giving to clotille she noted that his visits were fewer by far than what they had been and that when he did come his stay was invariably shorter than formerly she observed also that baug no longer accompanied clotille to public affairs leaving her to go with some girl friend

miss letitia decided to constitute herself a detective to find out just what the trouble was she was not long in discovering why baug was not oftener at clotilles house it was simply because he was giving his entire attention socially to one miss eina rapona

when miss letitia caught sight of the beautiful eina her heart somewhat sank within her she realized that after all there was a possible basis for a marked affinity between people of a similar mould and that the small fraction of the blood of the colored race possessed by each made an attachment between eina and baug more probable perhaps than between the light baug and the dark clotille against most girls clotille she felt had the advantage of a large prospective fortune but she discovered that eina was also a girl of wealth

miss letitia tried to arouse clotilles fears of losing baug that she might bestir herself to hold his affections but clotille was only too happy that eina had him in tow and was hauling him out of her way as for the rest of her problem she was now convinced that with belrose all right with the permanence of the belrose movement assured with unequal disfranchisement destined to be upset her cousin could be handled so that which was bringing worry to miss letitia was bringing happiness to clotille

unable to arouse clotille to action in her own behalf miss letitia decided to take up the cudgel herself and drive eina from the field at a time when clotille was away from home she opened her letter box and purloined what she regarded as ample ammunition with which to attack eina

mounting her bicycle miss letitia rode out to where she had learned that eina lived as soon as she had taken a seat in einas parlor she plunged into the object of her visit

you and my clotille are fast friends i believe said miss letitia

we surely are said eina her face aglow with the thought of the mutual love between herself and clotille

yes i think you are i know that being a friend you would not have her live and die a pauper said miss letitia

of course not i would do all in my power to see clotilles life full of comfort said eina

i felt that way about you and i knew that the harm you were doing clotille was being done because you did not understand just what was taking place

indeed you speak the truth when you say that i am in ignorance concerning any form of injury that i am doing clotille and pray please be frank and quick it pains me to have so acted at any time or place as to have impressed any one that clotilles interests needed protection from my aggression said eina rising and moving toward miss letitia in her eagerness to catch her every word

well clotille stands a good chance of being rich some day but it all depends upon whom she marries a respectable fortune awaits her if she marries baug peppers

who shouted eina

baug peppers slowly repeated miss letitia

einas head grew dizzy a weakness seized every muscle of her frame and she staggered to the nearest chair and fell into it up to that moment she had never in her life known what the depth of love was nor realized how madly she was in love with peppers her throat was dry her lips parched and her frame all a quiver

yes continued miss letitia baug and clotille have been picked out for each other for years and years

she did not tell me she did not tell me eina at last found strength to say

well clotille was always backwards about her rights but i am telling you

conroe

ill see her in her grave before ill let her marry that fellow said miss letitia

does she love baug asked eina

they love each other said miss letitia

eina now rallied and said miss gilbreath clotille is my friend my only my dearest friend if she had loved baug peppers she would have let me know you are in error somehow clotille would not clotille clotille could not play me false

miss letitia now unfolded a little package which she had kept in her hand saying you know clotilles handwriting read this letter will you notice the date too wont you

eina took the letter into her trembling hands and saw at once that it was unmistakably written in clotilles hand

it was addressed to my own dear baug breathed throughout the most fervent love and was evidently written in response to a letter of the same tenor that clotille had received there at the close of the letter were penned these significant words though our ambitions may cause us to not be seen in each others company you know me and i know you you are my baug and i know nothing in all the world other than to subscribe myself here and hereafter your clotille

einas mind now flashed back to baugs standing on broadway and seventh avenue the day of her arrival to clotilles significant laugh it all now looked to her to be a black black conspiracy to foster some secret ambition that baug and clotille cherished for the attainment of which she had apparently been made a tool

brood of vipers i drive you from my heart said eina

woman please leave my house never fear that i shall stand between clotille and that man please go cried eina

miss letitia arose to leave and on departing glanced a last time into einas face never in all her life had she seen such a picture of woe as she now left behind her but it moved her not

eina collapsed the moment miss letitia left and for a long while lay prone on the floor at length she crawled to her desk and penned the following note to baug baug peppers the engagement for this evening is off please do not ever again call at my house eina rapona

having dispatched this note eina in an aimless manner wandered from room to room in her cottage alternately wringing her hands and holding them to her throbbing temples

is life worth living

such was the question that the sad torn heart of eina now asked over and over again

i was young and wealthy and the world called me beautiful

i lived in boston and no door was closed in my face i met a colored girl and the colored blood in me called out unto her and we became friends

for her sake i left my home came to the land of the great shadow the land of the great shadow the land of the great shadow and cast my lot with her

her burdens were my burdens and i threw my soul into the work of clearing the pathway of life for her she deliberately interests me in a man with whom she was herself in love while pretending to love another

she puts near me a trusted servant who would be sure to bring this man into my life i can see it all now all i meet him i work with him iâiâiâwell here i am a brokenhearted girl faithâinâhumanity gone gone all gone

what is there in life when the heart is bleak money i have but what is that as a solace to the spirit

the world is large but what of it if your heart is chained to the one spot

i am young yet but more is the pity for the longer will i have this load to carry oh life what are you just as we reach out our hands to clutch you you go

what is the moon that we call so beautiful a driedup land what is the sun  a ball of fire that we dare not approach

where are our ancestors in us for we eat their dust

what was the fate of the one true man that came into the world crucified

whence came i  who knoweth

whither goeth man after death who hath returned to tell

is life worth living is death any better

the pathâofâgloryâleads butâtoâthe grave

when baug peppers received that little note unmistakably penned by eina he rushed pellmell to a livery stable called for and hired the fastest horse therein and went dashing toward einas home as fast as the fleet animal could carry him when at the end of what had seemed to be an age he came to einas house he found the blinds closed the doors barred and no one to respond to his repeated knockings

finding all efforts to get in touch with eina futile baug rushed around the house to the stable in quest of uncle jack

he read the note to uncle jack and asked him what on earth could possibly be the trouble

wal i been spectin jes dis said uncle jack deliberately

expecting it roared baug

expecting miss rapona to deny me the privilege of seeing her why her request is just about as reasonable as though she asked me not to breathe and you have been expecting it stormed baug

be cam baug be cam an heah me be cam be cam

uncle if you are going to talk please talk in keeping with the fitness of things dont dont say be cam there is a far more appropriate be that could be said by a less devout man that would better fit this occasionâno no that thought is wicked and  need heavens help right now said baug

yer see baug de lady keers fur yer

uncle jack dear uncle jack i love you but you lie you say i see that the lady cares for me that is exactly what i dont see

baug lak my white folks i doan take de lie frum nobody but beins yer is crazy ill take it ter day yer minds me uvâ

uncle jack ill murder you on the spotâno i love you too much for that but i will say i will never forgive you if you try to joke me now said baug tramping around impatiently his eye roving about the doors and windows of einas home hoping to catch a glimpse of her

yer see baug de lady hez come ter de conclusion dat she mu s know mo bout yer fo proceedin furder wid yer wen er oman takes dat cose shes gittin mighty deep in love things air putty bright fur yer old boy putty bright

if things are bright now i hope to heaven to never never see them dark said baug

yer see findin dat she laks yer she mus now wait till she kin git yer pedigrees kin fin out whar yer sprung frum said uncle jack

oh my stars then i am gone who on earth knows where i came from that has been the one shadow on my soul i cant blame the girl if thats the case how do i know but what my father was hanged oh i am done forever said baug growing even more alarmed if that be possible and ploughing his hand through his hair frantically

but now i may be barkin up de wrong tree sumpin else maybe de mattah yer had bettah go see miss clotille bettah see her said uncle jack gravely

baug acted on the suggestion and was soon on the way to clotilles house

when the news of einas attitude toward baug reached clotille through the latter clotille was both amazed and alarmed

clotille and baug now gave earnest thought to the devising of some plan for finding out at once what was the cause of all the trouble they were engaged in an earnest whispered conversation and miss letitia was sure that they were at last planning for their wedding

feeling that there was danger in delay miss letitia concluded to help bring matters to a head that very day

entering the parlor where baug and clotille were she said children it rejoices my heart to see you two so loving

clotille looked up to see if there were any indications of her cousins losing her mind

yes i think you all were born for each other baug handsome and intelligent clotille pretty talented and cultured and in sight and in reach of a great fortune whenever she fulfills the conditions

oh cousin letitia that is horrid horrid pray what on earth is the matter said clotille

no i am going to speak my mind today the reason things came so near going wrong was because i kept my mouth closed so long young people need to be guided you two would not have been together so long and lovingly today if i had not knocked the other one off of the track i did not want to do it but she had no right to come between you two and upset all our plans

a faint glimmer of the true state of affairs dawned upon clotille and baug and they both stood up looking eagerly to miss letitia for more light

now that looks nice you all will make a nice couple a light one and a dark one now let the other lady get a dark one said miss letitia

toâill cut any dark ones throatâi dont understand said baug

i have just told her that you and clotille were picked out for each other a long time ago

mercy mercy screamed clotille

she was hard to shake but i shook her i found some letters that baug returned to you when you all evidently broke up and i showed her one of them that letter settled things and she will never give you two any more trouble you young people must watch these designing women now and hereafter else they will ruin you continued miss letitia

oh woman in what a perfidious light you have placed me now let me tell you something for years i have loved a dark man conroe driscoll because you have fought with such bitterness my marrying a dark man he has used baugs name in his correspondence so that a discovery of his letters on your part would not give us trouble when conroe grew somewhat hopeless and didnt care whether he lived or died on the football field he returned to me my letters to him that they might not fall into other hands in case of his death it was evidently a letter of mine to conroe which you found and used

baug stood listening to what clotille and miss letitia had to say long enough to catch a clear idea of what caused his trouble and then with all the speed at his command hastened to his buggy and was soon at einas home again but his success at getting a hearing was no better this time than on his previous visit and he drove back dejectedly to clotille who was still weeping bitterly over the false light in which her cousin had put her

come baug i will settle it all said clotille rising and leading the way to the buggy

drive me quickly to conroes office

baug obeyed not knowing however what was clotilles plan

when they arrived at the office clotille said conroe go at once and get a marriage license conroe hesitated an instant and looked into baugs face for an explanation

yes for gods sake go and go quickly conroe not daring to hope that the sun had come to shine in his door took it for granted that it was baug who was to be thus favored of heaven therefore upon arriving at the office where licenses were issued he procured a license for baug peppers and eina rapona he returned to his office where he found that a justice of the peace summoned during his absence awaited to perform a marriage ceremony

conroe handed the license to the justice and clotille said we are ready

but where whereâerâi dont understand where is miss rapona asked conroe

you fool you you and clotille are to marry conroe shouted baug

slowly it percolated through conroes brain that he and not baug was the fortunate mortal and out of the office he dashed for another license in the meantime baug made himself the possessor of the license that conroe had mistakenly procured and surreptitiously slipped the paper into his pocket not knowing what strange turn events might take that day and desiring to be prepared not only for the worst but also for the best

it was remarkable how much quicker conroe made the second trip to the license office than he did the first although he would have testified on oath that his first trip was made with as much speed as was consistent with dignity but you see in his own case he abandoned all considerations of dignity

soon conroe driscoll and clotille strange were proclaimed man and wife

let us all go to see eina now and take this justice along as a witness said clotille

the suggestion was accepted and the party procured a carriage which ere long pulled up to einas gate clotille rushed to the house leaving the others behind hoping to prepare the way for them it happened that she had retained the key to einas door that she had when in charge of the preparations for einas coming and had been thoughtful enough to get it before leaving home

she opened the door and rushed in but eina had gone

conroe driscoll and baug peppers are in absolute disagreement as to the character of the first night after einas disappearance happy in the possession of clotille as his bride conroe positively asserts that the world was never more beautiful than on that night according to his account the moon was full and in jovial mood the clouds to vex her reign were thin and few and even they in passing beneath her throne were tinged with glory and made resplendent in the heavens the milky way like a diamond studded bridal veil hovered near the moon as if to be in easy reach of this beautiful woman of the night traveling toward some consort divine the stars both great and small twinkled their merriest as if in an effort to keep pace with their happy queen now this is conroes version of that night set forth according to the emotions that surged within him as he stood out in the open and thanked the far off eternal forces which despite all obstacles had swept clotille into his arms

as for baug he vehemently asserts that the light of the moon was wearisome to the soul that the winking and blinking stars were but so many tiny mockers of his grief that all of natures antics on that night were out of keeping with the eternal fitness of things save where the dark shadows and sullen corners were to be found where the light of the moon and stars came not

it is perhaps the discontented man of the world that bears watching so we shall for the time being excuse ourselves from the company of the happy conroe and follow the meanderings of the rather desperate baug

without set purpose baug left his gate that night and began to walk aimlessly through the streets of belrose passing through the heart of the city moving in an opposite direction to that in which eina had lived baug walked far beyond the corporate limits his journeyings bringing him to the ambrose river leisurely flowing along fresh from lapping the shores of belrose

upon the bridge spanning the river baug looked down upon the sombre face of the waters then toward the gloomsteeped trees lining the banks of the stream then toward the hills that rose in the distance and seemed to bank themselves against the sky returning his gaze to the waters baug said dark wooing waters one day your smileless face may draw me to your bosom but not now not now i have a great battle to fightâand win to live to live and not to die is my task

when far across the river baug following the roadway reached the crest of a high hill and saw near the roadside a huge boulder he paused climbed upon the rock and sat with his face toward sleeping belrose determined to abide there until he had worked out some satisfactory plan for searching for the missing eina

what made the situation doubly agonizing to baug was the fact that eina according to uncle jack had resolved to die to the negro race

if that girl passes for white what a terrible situation confronts me as a colored man i never attend their churches theatres or social gatherings nor they ours we are two distinct worlds meeting in business relations through the day and retiring within our respective racial castles at night if on the streets of belrose i happen to meet eina and accost her socially while she is passing for white any crowd of white belrosans seeing it will be ready to mob me terrible terrible terrible predicament mused baug

if i should pass for white and make the search for eina in the social circles of the whites and perchance should be discovered death would assuredly await me though my heart would only be in quest of eina he continued then the thought occurred to him that his face of mystery having always attracted the marked attention of all who had met him would perhaps be in the way of such a course

as a sort of rest from the strain of trying to decide upon a line of procedure baugs mind now reverted to his various talks with eina and there came back to him to both gladden and to further sadden his heart einas sunny smile the glory of her eyes the memory of the thrill of her low sweet tones the noble sentiments to which from time to time she had given voice

as baug sat thus meditating on his seemingly hopeless plight glancing down the road he saw in the moonlight the dim outline of a human form it proved to be that of the everfaithful uncle jack who knowing the intensity of baugs attachment for eina had felt that it was at least well to keep in touch with him

from the moment that he had caught sight of the look of desperation that overspread baugs face when he had intimated to him einas determination to withdraw from the negro race uncle jack had been on baugs trail managing however to keep at such a distance as to be unobserved during the time that he had been following baug uncle jack had been canvassing in his mind a matter of deep moment he knew that the ruling desire of baugs heart now was to find eina and he felt able to indicate the manner in which this might be done but the carrying out of his plan might jeopardize his own life in view of this possible danger he had thought long and deeply

having at last reached a conclusion uncle jack emerged from the shadow of the trees by the roadside where he had stopped to rest and keep watch on baug as he drew near baug whose soul just now craved solitude for the first time in life was not glad to see him many a time had baug in days gone by sought uncle jack in order that he might dispel feelings of gloom by drawing on his rich store of humorous experiences but at this time he felt more like listening to a funeral discourse than to a joke uncle jack however very soon turned baugs distaste at his presence into unbounded joy

in a tone that smacked of impatience baug said uncle jack what on earth has brought you way out here at such a time as this a man of your years should take better care of himself uncle jack knowing baugs frame of mind elected to ignore the tone of irritation and said in an humble manner baug miss eina is done gone ez yer knows an i wants ter fin her cordin ter whut i learns she lef under er misunderstandin

yes a very very gross one uncle jack the idea of her supposing that clotille was in love with me and i with clotille

now i wants ter fin miss eina an git all dis cleared up

of course everybody wants to find her uncle jack but how in the name of common sense is that to be done is the question

now dat is whut i wants ter talk wid yer erbout i got er plan dat will shuah bring her ter whar yer kin splain matters ter her

baug leaped down from his boulder slapped uncle jack upon the shoulder and said uncle jack you are the very man im looking for upon my word and honor i would rather have your company than to own a south african gold mine now out with your plan uncle jack

did yer evah talk ter miss eina bout de cullud folks bein disfrankshied

baugs mind became very alert and very exact very much disposed to dwell on details how bafflled love does sharpen ones wits said he oh yes many a time lets see i think i can almost recall the words in which i expressed my views on that i said to her something like this governments have a psychological influence over their citizens the reverence which makes a government possible writes itself large upon the citizens mind who often unconsciously seeks to reflect in himself the spirit of his state wherever therefore you find a state discriminating against a given class the citizen assumes a like attitude toward the object of discrimination in an effort to reflect the attitude of the state in the very nature of things therefore matters where state action is one great fountain of psychological poison must grow worse instead of better yes state discrimination is a virus calculated to carry unfairness into the very marrow and bone of the nation

wal whut yer said made er deep pression on her mind an she got all wrapped up in takin dat iqusshun ter de spreme coat she wuz plannin er case thout yer knowin it ter tes de law yer wuz ter be kep out uv de plannin so dat yer wouldent be rested for cunspeericy fur she wanted yer fur de lawyer

oh bosh uncle jack i thought you had a plan for finding miss eina

jes hole yer hosses mistah baug jes hole yer hosses an doan be so ready ter fly off said uncle jack reassuringly

miss eina kinder thort yer wuz er great man an she wanted ter heah yer argify dat case in de spreme coat she said dat ef dat case wuz evah called up dare she would be dare ef she lived she said dat ef she wuz dead an dare wuz enny such thing ez er dead pusson visitin bout she would shuah be dare now baug uncle jack knows folksâwhite folks cullud folks an de mixed folks uncle jack knows um i tell yer shuah ez yer is bawn ef yer git er case in de spreme coat to tes dem disfrankshieing laws miss eina will be on han ter hear yer argify baug i tell yer i knows

now uncle jack said baug enthusiastically you go ahead with that test case you hear do everything just as you were told by miss eina keep me way out of the thing if telling me will keep me from being the attorney do you hear uncle jack

with this line of procedure agreed upon the two men sat throughout the night chatting baug listening with hungry ears to little scraps of remarks that eina had from time to time let fall in uncle jacks presence remarks indicating that she took more than a passing interest in him more than once uncle jack was in imminent danger of being hugged by baug over some remark of einas that he reported

by and by the moon went down the east took on its golden flush and the hazy light of morning appeared vehicles began to pass and when one came along that afforded an opportunity for a ride baug accosted the driver who readily consented to convey him and uncle jack to belrose

while baug was fully resolved upon carrying out the plan that uncle jack had laid before him there was the possibility of ill effects that he desired if possible to avoid he realized fully that the good will of his southern white neighbors was a consideration second only in importance to having it agreed that the race with which he was identified was to be dealt with according to the fundamental principle of the government equality before the law he had inaugurated in belrose the harmonious working together of the white and colored people in local political matters and he would have regretted much anything that rendered him personally unacceptable as an ambassador of peace

of course he had all along been deeply concerned about the fundamental rights of his people was anxious to have the point that had so greatly interested eina settled but he had hitherto hoped that that possibly irritating duty might fall to some other hands had hoped this not out of cowardice but from a desire to reserve himself for a task of equal importance that of friendly adjustment

moreover baug felt that an attempt on his part to overthrow even by peaceable means what he deemed the unequal suffrage system might jeopardize his life as he desired above all things just now to live to see eina again he thought it wise to sound molair that he might indirectly gain an idea as to whether it was best to prosecute his work in this direction from some point in the north or from belrose

calling upon mr molair at his home after business hours were over baug was ushered into his library when molair entered he greeted baug with a smile and a warm clasp of the hand

beginning the conversation baug said mr molair i regard you as typical of the best that southern white civilization has produced and through you i want today to hear the voice of the best south

i thank you for your compliment but i dare not claim to be the best of the south which southernerlike i put ahead of the world you see the heights are too dizzy replied molair

passing by molairs parrying of his compliment baug said i am more than anxious that the political war along racial lines between your and my people should come to a close and would regret the necessity of any step that would put us more at variance but the vital needs of the colored people with which needs my own personal fortunes have become inextricably involved demand that i make an effect to have our supreme court upset such laws as do not bear equally upon the people of both races in the event that i pursue this course what do you think would be the attitude of the southern white people of your type

molair smiled and cast his eyes around the walls of the library arising he went to the end of a row of oil paintings of persons and said to baug come and look he lead baug from painting to painting in that room then escorted him to other rooms where there were paintings when the tour of inspection was over he said you have just seen the likenesses of molairs for centuries back so far as i am concerned if with a thousand years of civilization back of him a molair cannot hold his own in an equal contest with the grandson of an uncivilized african i say let him go to the wall i scorn the idea of a weak test for a white man and a severe one for the negro it is a rank injustice to the white man when you remember that mother nature coddled made life easy for africa but was stern and penurious with england you can see the danger that will come to the southern white man if we indulge him while making exactions of the negro

the sooner the standard of voting for the white man is made as high as that for the colored man the better for the white man indulgence leads to decay not to advancement said molair his whole attitude signifying abhorrence of the notion of coddling any section of the white race

i am glad to hear you speak thus mr molair in the event that my course is questioned i trust that you will give voice to such sentiments as you have just expressed

the interview now came to a close and baug took his departure with a much lighter heart with great zest he entered upon the task of raising the funds necessary to fight through the test case to be inaugurated by uncle jack according to secret plans laid out by eina

baug withheld action on uncle jacks part looking toward the testing of the law in question until such a time as he should feel able to take care of the financial end of the matter

ah that was a dreary dreary wait and while baug in thus waiting and chafing while he waits let us take advantage of the opportunity to catch a glimpse of other friends of ours

if the marriage of clotille and conroe could have been postponed until baug was disposed of and until the conception had been fully developed in miss letitias mind that the harmonious relations between the races in belrose were to continue it might have been that the wedding would not have so excited the wrath of miss letitia but as it was her rage was boundless when on the day following her marriage clotille returned to her cousins home for the purpose of pleading her cause miss letitia slammed the door in her face as for conroe she despised him utterly

the black varmint i feel like wringing his old head off the idea of him poking his old black face into our family such was the comment miss letitia passed upon conroe

having felt assured that clotille would marry in a manner to please her miss letitia had drawn up her will leaving her fortune to her but she now resolved upon changing all this and proceeded at once to seth molairs office for the purpose of having him draw up another will

well what has the former beneficiary done to displease you if i am not asking too much inquired molair in an effort to draw miss letitia out not being altogether pleased with that fanatical look in her eye

she has turned out to be a fool snapped out the angry miss letitia

gone mad asked molair in surprise

worse than that

oh said molair afraid to pursue the subject any further as it seemed to involve some moral turpitude

yes i would have rather seen her in her grave a thousand times than for her to have turned out like she did said miss letitia

too bad too bad but you can console yourself with the fact that you set her a good example and taught her the right way

i havent set her any example at all i am a miss but i taught her the right way all right the crazy thing

oh she is really crazy then remarked molair

crazy of course she is crazy as crazy as any lunatic in the asylum

well we ought to have her put up then said molair

i wish you could send her to the penitentiary and hang the black ape

molair was considerably puzzled as to just what the nature of the case was and he was disposed to drop the discussion but miss letitia never tired of letting people know just what she thought of the matter

yes sir as many yellow girls as that fellow could have got and some of them almost white tooâthe idea of him as black as he is marrying clotille its a shame it has almost broken my heart

black as he is who in the thunder is this clotille that you object to her marrying a black man is she white asked molair

white of course not there is where the outrage comes in she is black the idea of two black people marrying each other in america when they have got a chance to marry lighter

molair now laid down his pen and looked intently at miss letitia it beginning to dawn upon him as to what the true situation was

do you mean to say that you are going to disinherit this dark girl because she has decided to marry a man with a complexion similar to her own asked molair

that is exactly what i am going to do sir i shall cut her off without a penny who wants to always be a problem who wants some one else to always have his foot on your neck america hasnt got enough of the grace of god in her heart to treat a black man as she would a white man her life is a living lie and i want every drop of the despised blood sucked into her veins i want her to eat up the race she hates you have set the colored mans house on fire you pour oil on it every day and keep it burning dont rats leave a sinking ship dont lice crawl off of the scalp of a dying person dont we bury corpses sure ill disinherit that girl for marrying so as to perpetuate the black face the seed of discord ill cut her off without a copper and wish that i could will for her to beg bread from door to door so help me moses

molair reflected awhile and then said now i am a southern white man and believe in the preservation of both races i do not care even in a professional way to be connected with your notion of the absorption of the blood of your race into ours

aha aha said miss letitia rising you disfranchise you ostracize you jim crow you lynch you burn a man because he is colored then hold up your hands in holy horror because he seeks by honorable means to get away from being colored if you want a man to stay colored why in the name of god dont you treat him right as colored that fool clotille has gone back on me but dont you forget the leaven is at work and if you dont treat the colored people right in every way in the ages to come you are not going to have any colored people

drawing near to molair miss letitia pointed her finger at him and said you tell the negrohater among the whites to keep on building the fires of prejudice keep on jim crowing negroes keep on disfranchising keep on painting the sky as black as midnight aha keep on millions have crossed into your race already and millions are to follow yes millions are to follow put that in your pipe great sir and smoke it we will all be white one day and it wont be by intermarriage either

with her head thrown high in the air miss gilbreath swept majestically out of molairs office

when miss letitia had gone molair sat with knitted brow toying with his pencil giving earnest thought to the situation presented by her attitude

indirect amalgamation is this womans game i see but i want no amalgamation direct or indirect immediate or remote i want no incorporation of the negro blood into our race even after that blood has been so diluted as to lose its power of pigmentation i dont want negro blood in the blood of our race even though it be in the proportion to the waters of lake erie to those of the atlantic and pacific oceans combined such were molairs thoughts as he contemplated miss letitias course

now what am i to do to balk this game we toss all mulattoes to the negroes we cannot pass a law forbidding them to intermarry with the negroes and forcing them to intermarry among themselves and if we did force them to intermarry among themselves exclusively would we not soon have a large white race of them ready for surreptitious disappearance into our ranks reflected molair

reaching for his telephone molair called up the more prominent members of the belrose bar and asked them as an act of professional courtesy to him to refuse to draw up a will for one letitia gilbreath colored who might call upon them for such service molair had divined that miss letitia was of that class of colored people of an aristocratic turn of mind whose sympathies were with the more aristocratic element of whites and he felt assured that she would not call upon the negro attorneys nor the more humble white lawyers for service but upon the white lawyers of eminence locally so correctly had he gauged miss letitia that she entered no law office but that his message had preceded her everywhere therefore she met with a polite but positive refusal to do the work that she desired done

thoroughly enraged miss letitia returned to her home vowing that she would draw the will herself and to that end began the purchase of law books and the study of law it was an interesting sight to behold her with her eye glasses sitting high upon her nose poring over authorities on wills

yes sir ill have me a will that will disinherit a driscoll to the tenthousandth generation and i wont consult them poor white lawyers nor the colored ones either ill draw the will myself if it takes me a lifetime to get it straight was miss letitias emphatic boasting evidence that a brighter day was ahead molair decided to branch out in every needful direction where he had cause to think that he would effect a result that would serve as oil on the hinges of the door of hope the one thing in the south that had caused molairs heart to quake with fear because of the ocean of possibilities bound up in it was the bad negro element with its power to summon from their sleep long discarded savage instincts molair therefore now gave thought to this bad negro question

thus one morning as the ministers of the colored churches of belrose were in the midst of their weekly meeting in one of their church edifices molair unexpectedly put in his appearance as white men now very rarely attended negro meetings the coming of molair was a genuine surprise

as an act of courtesy to the mayor the suspension of the regular order was moved that the body might hear whatever the mayor might have to say

molair went forward and said members of the conference a matter of deep concern brings me to you this morning on the faces of all there came the most intent expression as a result of this remark

what on earth can it be now was the thought of the colored men who like the whites were ever on the alert always apprehensive as to what was to come next

since i have been your mayor i have been passing over belrose noting the condition of your people  many very many of you are going up up up and i am proud of this very evident progress applause but side by side with this upward movement on the part of many there is i have observed an appalling downward movement evidently hope and selfrespect have broken loose in a number of your race and they are sinking sinking to awful depths just think of what is called hells half acre and that settlement surrounding the building known as the ark i doubt that this side of the hell of which you preach you will find such terrible degradation elsewhere

the slums of new york a voice interposed yes yes butâ at any rate let us keep our minds on belrose just now applause now as to how much my people the southern white people have contributed to this degeneracy by tolerating things that smacked of hostility to your race i have not come this morning to argue nor am i unmindful of the fact that a measure of the aloofness of your upper classes toward this decaying element is in part due perhaps to the fact that it has been preached to them that the bad negro keeps the good negro back thus taught the less spiritual among you have perhaps grown to hate your submerged fellows

that doctrine has had its effect spoke up one i have come here to assure you as the mayor of belrose that i shall stand for exact justice the impartial enforcement of the law and the encouragement of all elements of our population to look upward and not downward so now you good negro belrosans need not regard yourselves as having any personal problems because of your race so far as i can remedy matters prolonged applause now i have a favor to ask of you you are going to find i think that the aspiring negro will have much less of a problem concerning himself so far as we whites are concerned in this coming new day of hopefulness nay even before it is full upon you can we not have you turn your thoughts not away from your rights but more toward these congested centers of vice populated by your people they breed disease hold down real estate values mar the beauty of our city and they do you inestimable damage in the eyes of northern visitors who are daily in our midst

this last remark went home with great force the maintaining of the respect and sympathy of the north the author of freedom and enfranchisement was a matter of deep concern to the negroes as molair knew and he had in him enough of the politician to pull on that chord for what he deemed a worthy purpose

continuing mr molair said is this not peculiarly your problem ties of blood link you to these denizens of an earthly hell we may build a glorious structure here in belrose but from these depths can come the volcanic fires of evil in ferment that will overturn all that we create

as a result of molairs talk a meeting was arranged between the white and colored ministers and plans inaugurated for a vigorous crusade for the redemption of the centers of vice hopeful of the mitigation of this menace to the peace of both races that in an evil moment might summon base passions that would overturn the work of ten thousand selfsacrificing lives molair now turned his thoughts in another direction

recognizing the fact that the outside world whether the south so willed or not could by needlessly stirring up resentments within its borders materially affect that wholesome atmosphere which he was now desirous of creating molair decided to accept an urgent invitation to a private interview which had been extended to him a short while back by the president of the united states who had heard of the belrose movement with a view therefore to enlisting the presidents cooperation in a policy that would aid him much in his work of atmosphere making molair took his journey to washington and the white house

mr molair you have no idea of the profound satisfaction that we of the north have that a man of your type has caught hold of the outstretched hand of the better element of colored people said the president grasping molairs hand warmly

thank you mr president said molair simply preferring to have the president declare himself fully before having much to say himself

now i think that you people of the south have misunderstood me greatly as to my attitude toward the colored race and i would like to lay bare my heart to you said the president

i trust that you will mr president there should be the utmost candor in this matter

well to begin with the great bulk of the colored people voted for me their taxes help to pay my salary and as commanderinchief of the army and navy i bear a direct relation to their patriotism which is a part of our reliance for the defense of the flag

all very true said molair

i am a proud man permit me to say to this extentâi do not wish any man or set of men to do any more for me than i do for them i do not like being even to an infinitesimal extent a pauper living off of the unrequited bounty of others as president as the head of the nation therefore i have simply tried to give official recognition to this element of our population said the president

continuing the president said i am no special friend of the negroes and if the necessity ever arises i will show you that i am not i do not believe that the colored people should have special favors because they are colored nor on the other hand should they have special burdens because of their color

america is a great darwinian field dedicated by fate to the cause of genuine democracy the rule of the united judgment of men here we are to have the wild grand play of universally and absolutely unfettered forces and out of the strenuous struggling the fittest are to survive and the final man is to be evolved i believe simply in giving the colored man the same chance in this great darwinian field that other men are given no more no less now what have you to say to that

absolutely nothing mr president said molair so far as i am concerned i ask nothing for me and mine that i begrudge to the colored man what i have come to ask of you is along another line your party i fear has sometimes been a little insincere in some of its utterances has made declarations for political effect simply hereafter confine your party utterances to just such things as you really mean to do for heavens sake dont make our race question a political football the issues are too grave

inflame the masses of the south by meaningless baits to the negro voter if you choose but remember that this course vitally affects the welfare of the race concerning which interest is professed for out of this inflamed mass we have to draw policemen constables sheriffs legislators and juries if we of the south can just get rid of that part of the entanglement which is only political byplay the insincere part of the programme not much trouble will be caused by what your earnest highminded men and women have to advise

in great detail molair now went into the southern situation and cited move after move the insincerity of which was subsequently demonstrated but which was in the public eye long enough to do great harm to the south and the negro

the showing made a marked impression on the president who now said i regard your request mr molair as a reasonable one and i pledge you my support in trying to have my party deal sacredly with this question say nothing but what it means now mr molair will you agree to do as much in the south in cases where there has been absolutely no cause to fear the negro a hue and cry of negro domination has often been raised by men in your section cannot both sections rise to the plane where we will not make a football out of this helpless unarmed race mr molair

yes yes i will do all that i can responded molair aware of the great task before him

the interview now came to a close and as molair left the white house he said to himself when political byplay is eliminated north and south much that produces pessimistic letitia gilbreaths will then disappear with the president working to that end in the north and the house of molair committed to that policy in the south who will say that we shall not win

from washington molair now journeyed to the city of new york in quest of a former belrose boy a boon companion of his younger days who had plunged into the commercial life of the great metropolis and won for himself the title of multimillionaire as molair drew near the magnificent fifth avenue mansion of this former belrose boy herbert rogan he paused for a moments meditation

yes ill go it is not for myself i know herberts heart is yet warm with love for the south we never forget said molair

reaching rogans home molair was admitted by a servant and escorted to the waiting room while sitting here his eye quietly wandered around the room noting the evidences of great wealth everywhere abundant

why hello seth if you were only the hundredth part of a lady i would kiss you i am so glad to see you boy said rogan with great cordiality

no more glad to see me than i am to see you herbert said molair soberly but feelingly

the genuine warmth of the greeting of his boyhood friend who had become one of the worlds richest men deeply touched molair for he had somewhat feared that great riches might have to some degree affected the warm open southern heart of herbert

the two now retired to herberts private den where they could engage in a hearttoheart

well rogan began molair i disagreed radically with your course in coming north hunting for the golden fleece but you came and now here i am at your feet

no no molair it is i who am at your feet how often have i recalled your words to me urging me to not enter the mad mad american race for wealth i did not heed your voice and have gained my millions i hope that i escaped the drain on my soul which you feared and if i have i owe it to the exhortation that you gave me to take care of the herbert that was within me so i say i am at your feet

i am so glad that the warmhearted patriotic southern heart is not dead in you herbert for just now we have need of you said molair

a mere suggestion that the south needed him was sufficient at any time to quicken rogans interest and he said out with it seth i am ready for the bugle blast at any moment

now my mission is this herbert we of the south have been cruel to our poor whites in the days of slavery we kept them back by making use of slave labor in those days there sprang up an animosity between the sleek wellfed negro slave and the poor whites who accused the negroes of keeping them poor by working for nothing this element of whites has been emancipated by the freer conditions of labor that came after the war is fast finding itself and is marching to the front to take charge of affairs it has discovered its power and is going to use it

you have sized the situation up exactly it was partly because i saw the coming of this regime that i fled the south molair i saw that our day was over that the day of the common man was on in the south but go on interposed rogan

now there came over from slavery resumed molair the inherited feeling of the poor white toward the negro which feeling is accentuated by the fact that the negro is yet his industrial rival here then is a veritable gold mine for the demagogue in return for office he tosses to this element the negro hobbled gagged or quartered according as he thinks will most please this element

a sad sad situation said rogan

now our hope is to free the south from that man whose chief stock in trade is hatred of a weak and despised class we may not convert or deter the demagogue but we can lift our people beyond his reach

a stupendous task a long drawn out struggle said rogan

that is true very true the fact that in the south we have a double school system adds to the size of the problem of education i have come to ask you herbert to devote some of your millions to the education of our neglected white population

without indicating whether molairs request met with favor or disfavor rogan arose and said come with me to my office seth

on the way to the office rogan was silent his mind was once more in dixie he was playing by the side of the babbling brooks gathering daffodils from her fields chasing lightning bugs in the gloaming speeding over her country roads in buggies seated by the side of dixies fair daughters listening to the plantation melodies of the negroes surging from their warm emotional hearts turning his head from molair he dashed away a tear

when the men entered the office rogan opened his safe took out his books and recounted his holdings to molair demonstrating to him that he was far wealthier than what the outside world estimated

finally rogan said now there is my fortune molair i say to you in all sincerity that i stand ready as far as is within my power to respond to any call that you may make our poor struggling section with the most complicated problem of all of human history must have culture must have culture

molair was deeply touched by the confidence in his consideration and judgment shown by the most unusual offer of herbert and it was with difficulty that he could keep back the tears

now seth since that point is settled there is a matter in which i am interested to which i would like to call your attention said rogan

say on herbert i do hope that i can help you

i have watched with great interest your recent efforts to bring political peace between the white and colored people of the south i hope that you will succeed the war of spirits in the south is fast affecting the whole country it is bringing to the north hundreds of thousands of negroes utterly unprepared for northern life and the suffering among them is something fierce in some sections they have aroused a hostility far more intense than anything we have in the south so the coming of the unprepared is bad for themselves and bad for their race

moreover politicians hostile to the economic needs of the south use these negroes to make politically hostile states that could at one time be relied upon to now and then join hands with the south if you will study the distribution of the colored population and take into account the normal alignment of white voters it will be apparent that the colored people can in normal times practically veto all of the souths national aspirations and absolutely forbid policies suitable to the economic needs of the south in close elections they are the balance of power from our viewpoint this is an unpleasant fact but it is nevertheless a fact now the negro is naturally a home lover a patriot if you can honorably do so make terms with him in the south and word will come northward that will break up this solid mass of hostility to the south said rogan

yes yes another serious complication but in belrose we have learned to get together and before many years you may expect to find the colored people working enthusiastically for a southern man for president said molair

now that political and philanthropic forces gave promise of turning their faces in the right direction so far as the south was concerned molair returned to belrose feeling assured that the outlook was bright for the killing of the destructive germs to be found in minds on the order of that of miss letitia

but as we shall now shortly see fate had a far different way of curing miss letitias pessimism

one evening about the set of sun the city of belrose was aroused by the ringing of the central fire bell the people of the city wherever they chanced to be paused to count the strokes of the gong that they might with the aid of the signal consult their charts and thus locate the fire

near rudolfs such was the startling piece of information that passed from lip to lip

rudolfs was by all odds the finest store in the city and perhaps the finest in the south as for mr rudolf himself he was a man of genial personality a patriotic citizen anxious for the citys growth and he possessed in a marked degree the spirit of philanthropy as a consequence he had won the esteem and affection of the entire population of belrose without regard to class or race

so when it was noised abroad that the fire was near rudolfs great anxiety was created and there was a universal rush for the scene of the conflagration

the first engine to arrive on the scene was that of the colored company

the building which was on fire was not rudolfs but the one across the alley from it

the firemen went gallantly to work to combat the flames but the fire continued to make rapid headway like so many great hungry tongues the flames leapt out of the windows of the burning structure and seemed to knowingly lick at the rudolf building across the way

as conroe stood looking at the menacing raging flames many thoughts came surging to his mind

all belrose is out tonight and all belrose will talk of what is done here the south knows of our fathers knows how that in peace and war they followed the call of duty we can this night demonstrate that we are the sons of our fathers reflected conroe

the only way to save the rudolf is to mount its walls and fight the flames from the roof but that is a great risk thought conroe

further and further out reached the tongues of fire their failure to reach the rudolf seeming to enrage them and each effort appeared to be more strenuous than its predecessor

the rudolf is doomed was the thought in the minds of all

a ladder a ladder shouted conroe a ladder was brought and placed beside the wall of the rudolf conroe put one foot and a hand on the ladder turned to his comrades and shouted men there is danger on this wall i will not order you to go but who will volunteer to follow me

two men hurried to his side and amid the cheers of thousands they ascended the ladder and ranged themselves on the wall

of course miss letitia was there for when had she missed a fire since there had been colored firemen

my aint that grand aint that inspiring now aint that grand such were the exclamations arising from miss letitia as with hat thrown back on her head her face wearing a rapt expression she gazed upon the three men fighting the flames when gusts of smoke would engulf the men she would stand with clenched fists the picture of distress but when they again stood out in bold relief in the glare of the flames she would heave a sigh of relief

look out look out look out down come down

such were the cries that came like a mighty roar from the throats of thousands of people who had seen the wall of the burning building spring and get ready for a fall the men on the wall of the rudolf did not comprehend the meaning of the shout so kept on fighting the flames

down come down the multitude continued to shout

miss letitia had seen the danger and had madly struggled through the crowd until she reached the ladder planted against the wall

dont woman for gods sake dont shouted the throng while one man put a restraining hand upon her shoulder

let me alone ill not let these brave fellows die said miss letitia springing up the ladder with the agility of a lad

mounting the roof miss letitia screamed men come down the wall is about to fall seeing that they heard her miss letitia turned and began the descent

the men made a rush toward the ladder but it was too late full against the rudolf the wall of the burning building came with mighty force

a roar of horror arose from the throats of the assembled thousands but miss letitia and the firemen who had gone with the wall heard it not

their ears had become attuned to the music or the noises of another world

i have sinned i have sinned

with the tears pouring down her cheeks and her frame shaking with the emotions that swept through her being with cyclonic force clotille stood thus addressing baug who had called to express his profound sorrow over the loss of his friend and her husband conroe

bear up be brave said baug comfortingly

how can i baug when conroe is dead and i must bear the responsibility of his death

clotille you are in no wise responsible for conroes sad end he died a death that any one might well envyâdied in the line of duty

ah but you dont know baug baug this commercial age sent a part of its atmosphere into my heart i thought too much of a fortune when i found it standing between me and conroe i should have spurned it at once should never have dallied with it i always meant to spurn it if it sought finally to block our pathway but i waited too long too long

clotille sobbed so violently that she had to pause

resuming she said the fact that i dallied with this fortune allowed it to postpone my acceptance of conroe caused him to feel that i greatly desired it it was largely in the hope of softening cousin letitias heart that he gave up his profession and entered the fire department and nowânowâpoor conroe is deadâdeadâand shall never more open his lips to cheer my heart with a message of love

take a seat said baug leading clotille to a chair

when she was more composed she said it has been discovered that cousin letitia did not carry out her purpose to disinherit me an unfinished will which she was trying to draw herself was found by the side of the one which she had made in my favor but was planning to alter so her death has brought me her fortune

clotille lifted her eyes to baugs face and said if anyone had told me two days ago that i could despise money i would have denied it but today i despise it i despise it with all my heart before god i shall never touch a penny of my cousins money for myself it is blood money it is blood money clotille now broke forth into weeping afresh followed by a long period of silence at last she said come baug let us look at him

the two now entered the room where conroes body lay in a coffin ready for its journey to its narrow home baug looked down upon the face of his friend so serene in death and murmured happy boy free at last

baug in this sacred presence i want you to promise me that you will take onehalf of this money that will come to me and use it to help bring to the colored man a mans chance as a colored man i want to see to it that no other dark couple has the struggle that conroe and i had

i shall not use the other half but why i retain it will appear later will you do this for me it will be something of an atonement for my sin said clotille softly sadly earnestly

baug extended his hand across the bier to grasp the outstretched hand of clotille and the two looked into the face of conroe who seemed to smile his assent

baug said clotille i will do as you say and will consecrate the fund to the lifting of the shadow

in a corner of the part of the belrose depot designated for the use of colored patrons uncle jack and baug sat awaiting the coming of the train that was to bear the former to the state of alabama for the purpose of inaugurating a test of the clause of the recently adopted state constitution that provided for the elimination of the illiterate negro voter without affecting to the same degree the illiterate white voter

i would not have you think uncle jack that i am using you for a personal service purely it is true that the pressing of this case will in all likelihood bring me once more under the same roof with eina under circumstances that will permit my speaking to her without inviting mob violence but beyond that what we are doing is in keeping with a vital need of the hour

it is often asserted uncle jack that our rights came to us amid the lingering passions of war and should not be taken as the sober sense of the american people if we can get an authoritative expression from our highest court in this sober day of peace it will count for so much said baug

uv cose i doan zackly understan de full uv de high falutin pints yer make baug but i hez my idees on de qusshun i aint goin into dis heah testin businiss jes ter bring yer an miss eina nigh ter each udder while dat is part uv whut i am atter but i hez had time ter thort out dis thing an heah is my thorts

dey says dat abe linktum said dat ameriky coulden be kep part one thing an part er nudder an i sees dat dis whole country is one day goin ter drink outen one spoon bout de cullud man ez er cullud man it is my lookout ter see ef dis one spoon is ter be er brass spoon er er silvah one

den ergin er ill littered white man is my orrival i got ter work wid him got ter go ter law wid him an sometimes got ter sass an ter fight wid him perhaps now ef yer let er ill littered white man vote an doan let me vote yer give him dat much ekvantage uv me now i doan want er ekvantage uv nobotty but in jestice ter myself i doan want nobotty ter git er ekvantage uv me

well uncle jack i am glad that you see in your way the deep issues involved of course i dont know just what your plan is as it was miss raponas desire that i not know but i am sure that she consulted some eminent authority before she advised you as to the course to pursue all i have to say to you uncle jack is that i love you as dearly as i ever could have loved a father had i known one and i want no harm to come to you be careful of yourself

the tremor in baugs voice warned uncle jack that the conversation was taking too serious a turn so he decided to have a hearty laugh in an effort to cheer somewhat baugs spirit

doan be uneasy baug i knows de white people putty well an knows how ter not git in too tight er fix said uncle jack

i hope so certainly uncle jack i crave to have these laws overthrown i crave to see eina but i want dear old uncle jack to live too said baug feelingly

speakin uv tight fixes minds me uv er time wunst wen i wuz er gardenin fur a white fambly began uncle jack determined to have a last laugh with baug before they separated my room wuz out in de yard an de cook staid in de main house ovah de dinin room wal hard times kinder struck de country an throwed er lot er men out uv wuk dis heah cook wuz er good gal all right but she pinched off er leetul ter help her beau keep frum gittin hungry durin uv de hard times dis beau had er way uv creepin ter dis gals room jes fo breakfas an havin her bring him up sumpin ter eat

wal de white man got er good cow hide an creeped up de stairs atter dis cullud feller kaint yer magine how his eyes bucked wen dat white man come in dat room an seed him eatin his grub de cullud feller managed by skummishin roun to git tween de white man an de door an down de stairs he run de white man right atter him

de cullud feller thort he would run right outen de back gate but it wuz shet so he kep right on roun de hous hopin ter gain ernough distance ter git time ter open de gate wen he passed de nex time but wen he retched de gate de secon time de white man wuz still pushin him mighty close

at length the alabama train was called out and uncle jack was escorted by baug to the gate leading to the train a hearty hand shake a steady looking into each others eyes and uncle jack was off peace be to his good intentions whatever may betide his bones

as was its wont the election at the oak cliff precinct a few miles out from the city of birmingham ala was proceeding orderly the voters arriving depositing their ballots and quietly returning to their several homes an hour or so before the time for the polls to close uncle jack who had taken up his residence in that state and section came sauntering up to the door of the small storeroom in which the election was being held

the allday watching on the part of the election officials of the depositing of ballots in an unexciting election had been a rather tedious affair and as they caught sight of uncle jack a smile of pleasant anticipation appeared upon their faces they thought to beguile away the time with a few anecdotes from uncle jack who during his residence there had from time to time enlivened groups of white and colored men with his humorous stories to such an extent as to establish his reputation as an entertainer

come in uncle jack come in said the election judge sitting immediately behind the table on which stood the ballot box

uncle jack did as bidden and took a seat that was proffered him

say old fellow tell us something said the election judge who had extended the invitation tilting back his chair a merry twinkle in his eye the other election officials joined in the request and uncle jack yielded to the demand

it is er great wonder ter me how times do change frum whut i kin fin out dey now got yer white folks doin whut yer all once had us doin began uncle jack judging that this was a precursor of some humorous incident uncle jack was asked encouragingly to explain himself

a hearty laugh followed uncle jacks joke come give me your hand uncle that is a good one said the man behind the election box uncle jack approached the man as if to grasp the proffered hand but when over the box dropped therein a ballot which he had all the while kept concealed watching for an opportunity to cast it

what have you done you are not a registered voter angrily spoke the election judge who had invited the hand shake

take that you scoundrel trying to overthrow the law of the sovereign state of alabama said the election judge shooting his fist with great force squarely into uncle jacks face

the old man tottered back then fell his head striking the wall of the narrow room with great force being badly injured by the fall uncle jack was rendered unconscious and could not rise a wagon was summoned and the wounded man placed therein he was rapidly conveyed to birmingham where he was turned over to the united states marshal on the charge of illegal voting medical aid had been summoned as soon as birmingham was reached but an examination of the fracture of uncle jacks skull caused by the fall revealed the fact that he had but a short while to live

the news of uncle jacks exploit reached the newspaper offices and a bevy of reporters ever on the lookout for the fulfillment of that standing dream of a negro uprising rushed down to see him to get an interview if possible but uncle jack was found to be in no condition to be interviewed he remained unconscious throughout the night but on the morrow his mind became clearer

uncle jack was apprised of the fact that he did not have long to live and was asked whether he had any statement he desired to make he signied his willingness to talk and the reporters and jail officials gathered in his room in the hospital ward to hear his dying statement his dark sober face and whitened hair inspired a feeling of awe in those who gazed upon him as he sat propped up in bed

uncle jack began all uv my days gemmens i hez been er cullud man dat tried ter git er long wid de white folks i alius jes nachally laked white folks i laked de gran way dey walked an talked i laked de way dey wernt skeert uv no botty i laked um fur feelin lak purtectin de wimmin folks ter make er long story short i jes nachally laked white folks

uncle jacks eyes now closed and seeing that his little strength was rapidly failing he was laid down again ever and anon he would look from one face to another as if hunting for some look of sympathy but those about his bedside all happened to be out of sympathy with his aspirations

gemmen could yerâlet some cullud pusson come in im lonesome said uncle jack feebly

the jail cook who was a colored man was summoned and when uncle jack caught sight of him with his white cap and apron and looked into his large dark face he smiled contentedly

the day had been cloudy but the clouds now stepped from the face of the sun and its rays struggled through the iron bars to the floor near the foot of uncle jacks couch with his eyes fastened on these few streams of light and a happy smile upon his face uncle jack at heart the friend of all men breathed his last

time wore on days weeks months and a few short years which seemed to baug an eternity passed away

in the chamber of the supreme court of the united states on the morning set for the hearing of the suit brought according to plans mapped out by baug to have declared null and void the clauses of the constitution of a certain southern state intended to grant to illiterate whites privileges denied to illiterate negroes on the same general level baug peppers sat in such a manner as to have a commanding view of each entrance and of the audience he was on hand early in fact was the first to arrive and was determined to thoroughly scrutinize the face of every woman to be seen in the court room that day for he felt that here was his one last certain opportunity to find eina rapona

as the hour for the hearing of the case drew near the audienceroom began to fill and baug was kept busy looking from face to face in the hope of beholding the one face at length the room was filled every seat being taken save one that had been reserved for the wife of the chinese minister

baugs heart grew heavy the question as to whether the great american nation was to make good her grant of equality of citizenship to the race of darker hue was now to be argued by him and he felt the need of being in the best possible mood to present the case but with no eina present the weight of ten thousand worlds seemed to be upon him

although baug knew that the one vacant seat was for the wife of the chinese minister the fact that any seat was yet empty was a slight source of comfort the drowning mans straw presently there was a rustling of silks down an aisle as a lady clothed in the chinese garb and thickly veiled came straight to the one vacant seat all hope now departed from baug and despair settled over his soul

poor poor millions in need of an advocate this day upon a broken reed upon a lacerated heart upon a crushed spirit upon a dead man who yet breathes your hope at this hour is made to depend but i will do my best i will do my best

so reflected baug as he sat awaiting the filing in of the justices at length the justices marched in walked to their respective seats and the famous case was ready to be called baug now left his seat and took his place among the lawyers connected with the case

just behind where baug had been sitting was clotille holding in her lap chubby little conroe who had entered the world shortly after his fafathers death baug had been in the direct line of vision between the lady with the chinese garb and clotille so that this lady did not see clotille and the boy until baug arose to leave

she has fainted she has fainted said a woman near the lady of the chinese garb and two or three neighboring women rushed to her assistance in their efforts to resuscitate her they lifted the veil from her face and when clotille who had observed the lady faint caught sight of the face thus revealed she uttered a slight scream and rushed across the room it was the long lost eina

eina was soon restored to consciousness and insisting that there was no danger of a recurrence of the trouble retained her seat

see my little boy yonder conroe jr that was all a mistake whispered clotille who then returned to her seat and with a mothers pride stood her little boy in her lap so that eina might see him

all this while baug had been busy conferring with the lawyers and had not seen what was transpiring behind him so absentminded was he that one of his associate attorneys said to another what a dullard how can a race of people amount to anything so long as it commits the leadership to such stupid fellows as this

baug having been looking around all the morning from force of habit now took another last look at the audience einas veil was now lifted and as baug caught sight of her beautiful face of those eyes that had ever been with him night and day he grew dizzy and clutched the railing near which he sat

every vestige of despair now left baugs face the shadows lifted from his spirit and with the wine of a great love stirring his heart he felt that he could that day plead the cause of a hundred million people

as baug arose to speak practically every person in the audience was inclined to turn to his neighbor and ask who is that fellow it seems as though i have seen him before

one of the justices turned pale trembled violently from head to foot and eyed baug with every symptom of an overpowering fear one lady remarked to clotille that justice with the very bald head seems afraid of that fellow wonder why he doesnt look dangerous

when baug uttered his first words this justice arose and in a voice quaking with fear said for good and sufficient cause and in the name of high heaven i move the adjournment of this court for a few moments to decide in private a momentous question of procedure

the strange request and the very evident agitation of the justice created a sensation in the court room the motion was allowed by the court and the justices retired the terror stricken justice looking back eyeing baug all the way as he passed out

justice morrow we will hear from you said the chief justice addressing the frightened justice

i wish to know sir if it is to be the policy of this court to permit men long since dead to practice before it are we going to recognize spiritualism to that extent

the justices looked amazed

explain yourself said the chief justice

when i was a lad said justice morrow a certain american statesman visited my home played with me as a boy and gave me my first great impulse for the public service he worked upon every fiber of my being and his principles have shaped my innermost thoughts he afterwards becameof our nation and wrought well both in domestic and international affairs his name is indellibly written in the life of the nation his likeness adorns all our walls his picture is in all of our school books show me the palatial residenceâor the humble hovel for that matter that lacks his likeness sirs he died years ago but he lives vividly in my mind for he made me sirs said justice morrow rising he is out yonder now and though long dead is opening this case this morning he cant fool me i see he calls himself baug peppers but he is none other than

it was thought best to humor justice morrow so baug was summoned before the justices for his satisfaction

have i ever seen you before  asked justice morrow of baug knitting his brow and directing toward him his most piercing look taking pains however to stand some distance away and put as many justices as possible between himself and baug

i do not know sir practically every man i have met in my life has said that it seems as though he has seen me before but i have yet to see one who could tell me when or where said baug

who is your father asked justice morrow putting a little greater distance between baug and himself

i know not he may have been hanged for aught i know said baug

sir you are the spirit of said justice morrow backing still farther away

the chief justice took baug in hand and said you say every one seems to nave seen or met you before

yes replied baug

no one is able to state when or where

absolutely no one said baug

gentlemen i tell you i am right interposed justice morrow now ready to leave the room entirely it is too uncanny i like my supreme court duties but not well enough to hobnob with the dead he said

by the way i think i have the solution said the chief justice dont you recall gentlemen thathad a son who was the very image of his father and was disinherited evidently this colored man is an offspring of that boy because of this mans membership in the colored race people have not thought to associate him with s family the universality of the impression is due to the wide circulation ofs likeness being white and having occupied the position that he did the profound respect for the office has hitherto prevented the minds of the people from crossing over and making the comparison that would have explained all it has been the case of a human puzzle picture trace that disinherited son and i predict that you will find your journeys end in this man with the mysterious face

justice morrow was somewhat mollified by this explanation but decided to keep his eye on baug just the same the justices now returned to the audience room and baug resumed his speech in that short conference another great shadow had been lifted from baugs soul he had found what he regarded as a clue to his parentage a possible solution to the mystery of his face

with that shadow lifted and inspired by the presence of eina whom he hoped to meet after his speech was over baug made a plea of such power that the opinion of the chief justice that s blood coursed in his veins was fully confirmed

in the course of baugs pleading one remark particularly had seemed to catch the fancy of the justices and the audience as well sirs said he if anglosaxon blood lacks a champion on the other side of this case let me for a moment step across the line and take up a cudgel in its defense in its name i repudiate the thought of asking a handicap for the colored man in its race with him i bring to you the message the true white southerner would have me deliver i want no laws of indulgence for me and mine i spurn the thought of a lower test for anglosaxon blood if my son with a thousand years of civilization behind him cannot stand up in an equal fight with the greatgrandson of a heathen and a savage if he must be pampered and coddled with special laws then i say with all my soul let him go to the wall 

when the argument in the great case was over and the justices began to file out scores in the audience pressed forward to grasp baugs hand to congratulate him upon his effort as that audience had listened to and had been swayed by his eloquence and the brilliance of his intellect it was the common thought that regardless of what the decision of the supreme court might or might not be no human code could be made effective against the baug peppers type of men

as for baug he could not show proper appreciation of the attentions being showered upon him at the conclusion of his speech for keeping his eyes on eina who neither came forward nor yet moved to go out now that she knew the truth with regard to baug and clotille she did not care to share a hand shake with him with the rest of the throng but desired him all to herself for a talk and yet she was not conscious of one word that she had to say she simply craved to be alone with him clotille divining what was now to happen was only too glad to hurry away so that she might no longer be in baug and einas way

baug excused himself from his more enthusiastic admirers who had continued to remain behind and got very busy arranging his papers soon the room was cleared of all save himself and eina and baug now moved in her direction disfranchisement constitutions supreme courts the belrose movement now all faded from baugs mind as he once more stood in the presence of the queen of his heart

are you ready to go miss rapona  asked baug simply

yes said eina glancing up into baugs face with such ineffable sweetness as to tax his power of self control to the utmost

eina was proud of the work baug had done that day the two walked out of the room and hailed a passing cab into which they entered and were whirled along toward the private residence where eina had taken up her abode when she came to washington to be in attendance upon the famous case neither baug nor eina for a time had one word to say that larger vocabulary of sacred silence was now employed by these two hearts in their communing the one with the other

at length feeling it incumbent upon him to say something baug remarked oh that uncle jack might have been with us today

why did you not bring him  asked eina

poor dear uncle jack is dead

dead uncle jack dead my dear heavenly father sobbed eina weeping bitterly

it by no means improved her feelings when she found out that he died as the result of an effort to serve her cause baug finding that eina had kept herself absolutely out of touch with all that pertained to belrose now told of conroes heroic death of the spread of the belrose movement throughout the south of the happy results that came from the harmonious cooperation of the better element of the two races of seth molairs great popularity throughout the nation and the honors of a national character that evidently awaited him for having pointed the way for the peaceful adjustment of the race question in belrose which adjustment stood as a model of procedure for other communities eina heard with interest all that baug had to say but there was ever before her the kindly face of uncle jack

at length they arrived at einas temporary home and she excused herself to dispense with her chinese attire when she reappeared she was wearing the dress that she had worn the last time prior to the break that she was in baugs company as much as to say to him let us begin where we left off

but baug who took the hint was utterly unwilling for any such arrangement as he recalled matters at the time of the break he was daily trying to muster enough courage to enable him to reach the asking point with a fair prospect of getting to that much desired state with a few more weeks of effort on his part and considerable more encouragement from eina but in the time of his enforced separation from eina he had vowed before his maker that he would not return to this intermediate state this sort of purgatory but would at once make a straight dash for the heaven of his happiness the securing of an acknowledgement from eina that she loved him and would become his wife

baug arose to meet eina as she entered and she read in his determined face his purpose to force an issue into einas beautiful eyes there cameâwhether she so willed it or notâa thrilling look of surrendering love that drove from baugs mind as far too feeble the words with which he was to make known the state of his heart

glad oh so glad that her weary aching heart so long exiled might now beat undisturbedly against baugs great strong breast eina yielded herself to his embrace

eina eina whispered baug every atom of my soul loves you could you do you love me tell me that we shall evermore be one will you be myâwife

there is nothing else for me to do baug you have all the heart there is in me said eina her beautiful embarrassed eyes scanning the floor

baug gently turned her face so that he might read in her eyes the full measure of her love

and in the mutual gaze that followed which only genuine lovers can understand all earthly troubles vanished

when on national decoration days loving hands are spreading flowers on the graves of the dead who perished during the civil war clotille and conroe driscoll jr baug and eina and little clotille peppers go forth to decorate the graves of conroe and uncle jack while seth molair forgets not to adorn with the most lovely flowers the grave of aunt lucy who though a colored woman lies buried in the plot of ground that holds the body of his father and awaits the coming of that of molairs mother and himself

in that one family plot southern at that there is no color line
