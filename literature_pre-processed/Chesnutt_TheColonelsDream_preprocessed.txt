colonels dream the chesnutt charles waddell  novel
two gentlemen were seated one march morning in â in the private office of french and company limited on lower broadway mr kirby the junior partnerâa man of thirtyfive with brown hair and mustache cleancut handsome features and an alert manner was smoking cigarettes almost as fast as he could roll them and at the same time watching the electric clock upon the wall and getting up now and then to stride restlessly back and forth across the room

mr french the senior partner who sat opposite kirby was an older manâa safe guess would have placed him somewhere in the debatable ground between forty and fifty of a good height as could be seen even from the seated figure the upper part of which was held erect with the unconscious ease which one associates with military training his closely cropped brown hair had the slightest touch of gray the spacious forehead deepset gray eyes and firm chin scarcely concealed by a light beard marked the thoughtful man of affairs his face indeed might have seemed austere but for a sensitive mouth which suggested a reserve of humour and a capacity for deep feeling a man of wellbalanced character one would have said not apt to undertake anything lightly but sure to go far in whatever he took in hand quickly responsive to a generous impulse and capable of a righteous indignation a good friend a dangerous enemy more likely to be misled by the heart than by the head of the salt of the earth which gives it savour

mr french sat on one side mr kirby on the other of a handsome broadtopped mahogany desk equipped with telephones and push buttons and piled with papers account books and letter files in orderly array in marked contrast to his partners nervousness mr french scarcely moved a muscle except now and then to take the cigar from his lips and knock the ashes from the end

nine fifty ejaculated mr kirby comparing the clock with his watch only ten minutes more

mr french nodded mechanically outside in the main office the same air of tense expectancy prevailed for two weeks the office force had been busily at work preparing inventories and balance sheets the firm of french and company limited manufacturers of crashes and burlaps and kindred stuffs with extensive mills in connecticut and central offices in new york having for a long time resisted the siren voice of the promoter had finally faced the alternative of selling out at a sacrifice to the recently organised bagging trust or of meeting a disastrous competition expecting to yield in the end they had fought for positionâwith brilliant results negotiations for a sale upon terms highly favourable to the firm had been in progress for several weeks and the two partners were awaiting in their private office the final word should the sale be completed they were richer men than they could have hoped to be after ten years more of business stress and struggle should it fail they were heavy losers for their fight had been expensive they were in much the same position as the player who had staked the bulk of his fortune on the cast of a die not meaning to risk so much they had been drawn into it but the game was worth the candle

nine fiftyfive said kirby five minutes more

he strode over to the window and looked out it was snowing and the march wind blowing straight up broadway from the bay swept the white flakes northward in long feathery swirls mr french preserved his rigid attitude though a close observer might have wondered whether it was quite natural or merely the result of a supreme effort of will

work had been practically suspended in the outer office the clerks were also watching the clock every one of them knew that the board of directors of the bagging trust was in session and that at ten oclock it was to report the result of its action on the proposition of french and company limited the clerks were not especially cheerful the impending change meant for them at best a change of masters and for many of them the loss of employment the firm for relinquishing its business and good will would receive liberal compensation the clerks for their skill experience and prospects of advancement would receive their discharge what else could be expected the principal reason for the trusts existence was economy of administration this was stated most convincingly in the prospectus there was no suggestion in that model document that competition would be crushed or that monopoly once established labour must sweat and the public groan in order that a few captains or chevaliers of industry might double their dividends mr french may have known it or guessed it but he was between the devil and the deep seaâa victim rather than an accessoryâhe must take what he could get or lose what he had

nine fiftynine 

kirby as he breathed rather than spoke the words threw away his scarcely lighted cigarette and gripped the arms of his chair spasmodically his partners attitude had not varied by a hairs breadth except for the scarcely perceptible rise and fall of his chest he might have been a wax figure the pallor of his countenance would have strengthened the illusion

kirby pushed his chair back and sprung to his feet the clock marked the hour but nothing happened kirby was wont to say thereafter that the ten minutes that followed were the longest day of his life but everything must have an end and their suspense was terminated by a telephone call mr french took down the receiver and placed it to his ear

its all right he announced looking toward his partner our figures acceptedâresolution adoptedâsettlement tomorrow we are

the receiver fell upon the table with a crash mr french toppled over and before kirby had scarcely realised that something was the matter had sunk unconscious to the floor which fortunately was thickly carpeted

it was but the work of a moment for kirby to loosen his partners collar reach into the recesses of a certain drawer in the big desk draw out a flask of brandy and pour a small quantity of the burning liquid down the unconscious mans throat a push on one of the electric buttons summoned a clerk with whose aid mr french was lifted to a leathercovered couch that stood against the wall almost at once the effect of the stimulant was apparent and he opened his eyes

i suspect he said with a feeble attempt at a smile that i must have faintedâlike a womanâperfectly ridiculous

perfectly natural replied his partner you have scarcely slept for two weeksâbetween the business and philâand youve reached the end of your string but its all over now except the shouting and you can sleep a week if you like youd better go right up home ill send for a cab and call dr moffatt and ask him to be at the hotel by the time you reach it ill take care of things here today and after a good sleep youll find yourself all right again

very well kirby replied mr french i feel as weak as water but im all here it might have been much worse youll call up mrs jerviss of course and let her know about the sale

when mr french escorted to the cab by his partner and accompanied by a clerk had left for home kirby rang up the doctor and requested him to look after mr french immediately he then called for another number and after the usual delay first because the exchange girl was busy and then because the line was busy found himself in communication with the lady for whom he had asked

its all right mrs jerviss he announced without preliminaries our terms accepted and payment to be made in cash and bonds as soon as the papers are executed when you will be twice as rich as you are today

thank you mr kirby  and i suppose i shall never have another happy moment until i know what to do with it money is a great trial i often envy the poor

kirby smiled grimly she little knew how near she had been to ruin the active partners had mercifully shielded her as far as possible from the knowledge of their common danger if the worst happened she must know of course if not then being a woman whom they both likedâshe would be spared needless anxiety how closely they had skirted the edge of disaster she did not learn until afterward indeed kirby himself had scarcely appreciated the true situation and even the senior partner since he had not been present at the meeting of the trust managers could not know what had been in their minds

but kirbys voice gave no hint of these reflections he laughed a cheerful laugh if the world only knew he rejoined it would cease to worry about the pains of poverty and weep for the woes of wealth

indeed it would she replied with a seriousness which seemed almost sincere is mr french there i wish to thank him too

no he has just gone home

at this hour she exclaimed and at such a time what can be the matter  is phil worse  

no i think not mr french himself had a bad turn for a few minutes after we learned the news

faces are not yet visible over the telephone and kirby could not see that for a moment the ladys grew white but when she spoke again the note of concern in her voice was very evident

it was nothingâserious

oh no not at all merely overwork and lack of sleep and the suspenseâand the reaction he recovered almost immediately and one of the clerks went home with him

has dr moffatt been notified she asked

yes i called him up at once hell be at the mercedes by the time the patient arrives

there was a little further conversation on matters of business and kirby would willingly have prolonged it but his news about mr french had plainly disturbed the ladys equanimity and kirby rang off after arranging to call to see her in person after business hours

mr kirby hung up the receiver with something of a sigh

a fine woman he murmured i could envy french his chances though he doesnt seem to see themâthat is if i were capable of envy toward so fine a fellow and so good a friend its curious how clearsighted a man can be in some directions and how blind in others

mr french lived at the mercedes an uptown apartment hotel overlooking central park he had scarcely reached his apartment when the doctor arrivedâa tall fair fat practitioner and one of the best in new york a gentleman as well and a friend of mr french

my dear fellow he said after a brief examination youve been burning the candle at both ends which at your age wont do at all no indeed i no indeed youve always worked too hard and youve been worrying too much about the boy wholl do very well now with care youve got to take a restâits all you need you confess to no bad habits and show the signs of none and you have a fine constitution im going to order you and phil away for three months to some mild climate where youll be free from business cares and where the boy can grow strong without having to fight a raw eastern spring you might try the riviera but im afraid the sea would be too much for phil just yet or southern californiaâbut the trip is tiresome the south is nearer at hand theres palm beach or jekyll island or thomasville asheville or aikenâsomewhere down in the pine country it will be just the thing for the boys lungs and just the place for you to rest start within a week if you can get away in fact youve got to get away

mr french was too weak to resistâboth body and mind seemed strangely relaxedâand there was really no reason why he should not go his work was done kirby could attend to the formal transfer of the business he would take a long journey to some pleasant quiet spot where he and phil could sleep and dream and ride and drive and grow strong and enjoy themselves for the moment he felt as though he would never care to do any more work nor would he need to for he was rich enough he would live for the boy phils education his health his happiness his establishment in lifeâthese would furnish occupation enough for his wellearned retirement

it was a golden moment he had won a notable victory against greed and craft and highly trained intelligence and yet a year later he was to recall this recent past with envy and regret for in the meantime he was to fight another battle against the same forces and others quite as deeply rooted in human nature but he was to fight upon a new field and with different weapons and with results which could not be foreseen

but no premonition of impending struggle disturbed mr frenchs pleasant reverie it was broken in a much more agreeable manner by the arrival of a visitor who was admitted by judson mr frenchs man the visitor was a handsome cleareyed fairhaired woman of thirty or thereabouts accompanied by another and a plainer woman evidently a maid or companion the lady was dressed with the most expensive simplicity and her graceful movements were attended by the rustle of unseen silks in passing her upon the street any man under ninety would have looked at her three times the first glance instinctively recognising an attractive woman the second ranking her as a lady while the third had there been time and opportunity would have been the long lingering look of respectful or regretful admiration

how is mr french judson she inquired without dissembling her anxiety

hes much better mrs jerviss thank you maam im very glad to hear it and how is phil 

quite bright maam youd hardly know that hed been sick hes gaining strength rapidly he sleeps a great deal hes asleep now maam but wont you step into the library  theres a fire in the grate and ill let mr french know you are here

but mr french who had overheard part of the colloquy came forward from an adjoining room in smoking jacket and slippers

how do you do he asked extending his hand it was mighty good of you to come to see me

and im awfully glad to find you better she returned giving him her slender gloved hand with impulsive warmth i might have telephoned but i wanted to see for myself i felt a part of the blame to be mine for it is partly for me you know that you have been overworking

it was all in the game he said and we have won but sit down and stay awhile i know youll pardon my smoking jacket we are partners you know and i claim an invalids privilege as well

the ladys fine eyes beamed and her fair cheek flushed with pleasure had he only realised it he might have claimed of her any privilege a woman can properly allow even that of conducting her to the altar but to him she was only thus far as she had been for a long time a very good friend of his own and of phils a former partners widow who had retained her husbands interest in the business a wholesome handsome woman who was always excellent company and at whose table he had often eaten both before and since her husbands death nor despite kirbys notions was he entirely ignorant of the ladys partiality for himself

doctor moffatt has ordered phil and me away for three months he said after mrs jerviss had inquired particularly concerning his health and phils

three months she exclaimed with an accent of dismay but youll be back she added recovering herself quickly before the vacation season opens

oh certainly we shall not leave the country

where are you going

the doctor has prescribed the pine woods i shall visit my old home where i was born we shall leave in a day or two

you must dine with me tomorrow she said warmly and tell me about your old home i havent had an opportunity to thank you for making me rich and i want your advice about what to do with the money and im tiring you now when you ought to be resting

do not hurry he said it is almost a pleasure to be weak and helpless since it gives me the privilege of a visit from you

she lingered a few moments and then went she was the embodiment of good taste and knew when to come and when to go

mr french was conscious that her visit instead of tiring him had had an opposite effect she had come and gone like a pleasant breeze bearing sweet odours and the echo of distant music her shapely hand when it had touched his own had been soft but firm and he had almost wished as he held it for a moment that he might feel it resting on his still somewhat fevered brow when he came back from the south he would see a good deal of her either at the seaside or wherever she might spend the summer

when mr french and phil were ready a day or two later to start upon their journey kirby was at the mercedes to see them off

youre taking judson with you to look after the boy  he asked

no replied mr french judson is in love and does not wish to leave new york he will take a vacation until we return phil and i can get along very well alone

kirby went with them across the ferry to the jersey side and through the station gates to the waiting train there was a flurry of snow in the air and overcoats were comfortable when mr french had turned over his hand luggage to the porter of the pullman they walked up and down the station platform

im looking for something to interest us said kirby rolling a cigarette theres a mining proposition in utah and a trolley railroad in oklahoma when things are settled up here ill take a run out and look the ground over and write to you

my dear fellow said his friend dont hurry why should i make any more money  i have all i shall ever need and as much as will be good for phil if you find a good thing i can help you finance it and mrs jerviss will welcome a good investment but i shall take a long rest and then travel for a year or two and after that settle down and take life comfortably

thats the way you feel now replied kirby lighting another cigarette but wait until you are rested and youll yearn for the fray the first million only whets the appetite for more

all aboard 

the word was passed along the line of cars kirby took leave of phil into whose hand he had thrust a fivedollar bill to buy popcorn on the train he said kissed the boy and wung his expartners hand warmly

goodbye he said and good luck youll hear from me soon were partners still you and i and mrs jerviss

and though mr french smiled acquiescence and returned kirbys hand clasp with equal vigour and sincerity he felt as the train rolled away as one might feel who after a long sojourn in an alien land at last takes ship for home the mere act of leaving new york after the severance of all compelling ties seemed to set in motion old currents of feeling which moving slowly at the start gathered momentum as the miles rolled by until his heart leaped forward to the old southern town which was his destination and he soon felt himself chafing impatiently at any delay that threatened to throw the train behind schedule time

hell be back in six weeks declared kirby when mrs jerviss and he next met i know him well he cant live without his club and his counting room it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks

and im sure hell not stay away longer than three months said the lady confidently for i have invited him to my house party

a privilege said kirby gallantly for which many a man would come from the other end of the world

but they were both mistaken for even as they spoke he whose future each was planning was entering upon a new life of his own from which he was to look back upon his business career as a mere period of preparation for the real end and purpose of his earthly existence

the hack which the colonel had taken at the station after a twodays journey broken by several long waits for connecting trains jogged in somewhat leisurely fashion down the main street toward the hotel the colonel with his little boy had left the main line of railroad leading north and south and had taken at a certain way station the one daily train for clarendon with which the express made connection they had completed the fortymile journey in two or three hours arriving at clarendon at noon

it was an auspicious moment for visiting the town it is true that the grass grew in the street here and there but the sidewalks were separated from the roadway by rows of oaks and elms and chinatrees in early leaf the travellers had left new york in the midst of a snowstorm but here the scent of lilac and of jonquil the song of birds the breath of spring were all about them the occasional stretches of brick sidewalk under their green canopy looked cool and inviting for while the chill of winter had fled and the sultry heat of summer was not yet at hand the railroad coach had been close and dusty and the noonday sun gave some slight foretaste of his coming reign

the colonel looked about him eagerly it was all so like and yet so differentâshrunken somewhat and faded but yet like a woman one loves carried into old age something of the charm of youth the old town whose ripeness was almost decay whose quietness was scarcely distinguishable from lethargy had been the home of his youth and he saw it strange to say less with the eyes of the lad of sixteen who had gone to the war than with those of the little boy to whom it had been in his tenderest years the great wide world the only world he knew in the years when with his black boy peter whom his father had given to him as a personal attendant he had gone forth to field and garden stream and forest in search of childish adventure yonder was the old academy where he had attended school the yellow brick of its walls had scaled away in places leaving the surface mottled with pale splotches the shingled roof was badly dilapidated and overgrown here and there with dark green moss the cedar trees in the yard were in need of pruning and seemed from their rusty trunks and scant leafage to have shared in the general decay as they drove down the street cows were grazing in the vacant lot between the bank which had been built by the colonels grandfather and the old red brick building formerly a store but now occupied as could be seen by the row of boxes visible through the open door by the postoffice

the little boy an unusually handsome lad of five or six with blue eyes and fair hair dressed in knickerbockers and a sailor cap was also keenly interested in the surroundings it was saturday and the little twowheeled carts drawn by a steer or a mule the pigs sleeping in the shadow of the old wooden markethouse the lean and sallow pinelanders and listless negroes dozing on the curbstone were all objects of novel interest to the boy as was manifest by the light in his eager eyes and an occasional exclamation which in a clear childish treble came from his perfectly chiselled lips only a glance was needed to see that the child though still somewhat pale and delicate from his recent illness had inherited the characteristics attributed to good blood features expression bearing were marked by the signs of race but a closer scrutiny was required to discover in the blueeyed goldenhaired lad any close resemblance to the shrewd dark man of affairs who sat beside him and to whom this little boy was for the time being the sole object in life

but for the child the colonel was alone in the world many years before when himself only a boy he had served in the southern army in a regiment which had fought with such desperate valour that the honour of the colonelcy had come to him at nineteen as the sole survivor of the group of young men who had officered the regiment his father died during the last year of the civil war having lived long enough to see the conflict work ruin to his fortunes the son had been offered employment in new york by a relative who had sympathised with the south in her struggle and he had gone away from clarendon the old family mansionâit was not a very imposing structure except by comparison with even less pretentious housesâhad been sold upon foreclosure and bought by an ambitious mulatto who only a few years before had himself been an object of barter and sale entering his uncles office as a clerk and following his advice reinforced by a sense of the fitness of things the youthful colonel had dropped his military title and become plain mr french putting the past behind him except as a fading memory he had thrown himself eagerly into the current of affairs fortune favoured one both capable and energetic in time he won a partnership in the firm and when death removed his relative took his place at its head

he had looked forward to the time not very far in the future when he might retire from business and devote his leisure to study and travel tastes which for years he had subordinated to the pursuit of wealth not entirely for his life had been many sided and not so much for the money as because being in a game where dollars were the counters it was his instinct to play it well he was winning already and when the bagging trust paid him for his share of the business a sum double his investment he found himself at some years less than fifty relieved of business cares and in command of an ample fortune

this change in the colonels affairsâand we shall henceforth call him the colonel because the scene of this story is laid in the south where titles are seldom ignored and where the colonel could hardly have escaped his own even had he desired to do soâthis change in the colonels affairs coincided with that climacteric of the mind from which without ceasing to look forward it turns at times in wistful retrospect toward the distant past which it sees thenceforward through a mellowing glow of sentiment emancipated from the counting room and ordered south by the doctor the colonels thoughts turned easily and naturally to the old town that had given him birth and he felt a twinge of something like remorse at the reflection that never once since leaving it had he set foot within its borders for years he had been too busy his wife had never manifested any desire to visit the south nor was her temperament one to evoke or sympathise with sentimental reminiscence he had married rather late in life a new york woman much younger than himself and while he had admired her beauty and they had lived very pleasantly together there had not existed between them the entire union of souls essential to perfect felicity and the current of his life had not been greatly altered by her loss

toward little phil however the child she had borne him his feeling was very different his young wife had been after all but a sweet and pleasant graft upon a sturdy tree little phil was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone upon his only child the colonel lavished all of his affection already to his fathers eye the boy gave promise of a noble manhood his frame was graceful and active his hair was even more brightly golden than his mothers had been his eyes more deeply blue than hers while his features were a duplicate of his fathers at the same age as was evidenced by a faded daguerreotype among the colonels few souvenirs of his own childhood little phil had a sweet temper a loving disposition and endeared himself to all with whom he came in contact

the hack after a brief passage down the main street deposited the passengers at the front of the clarendon hotel the colonel paid the black driver the quarter he demandedâtwo dollars would have been the new york priceâran the gauntlet of the dozen pairs of eyes in the heads of the men leaning back in the splintbottomed armchairs under the shade trees on the sidewalk registered in the book pushed forward by a clerk with curled mustaches and pomatumed hair and accompanied by phil followed the smiling black bellboy along a passage and up one flight of stairs to a spacious welllighted and neatly furnished room looking out upon the main street

when the colonel and phil had removed the dust and disorder of travel from their appearance they went down to dinner after they had eaten the colonel still accompanied by the child left the hotel and following the main street for a short distance turned into another thoroughfare bordered with ancient elms and stopped for a moment before an old gray house with high steps and broad piazzaâa large squarebuilt twostoried house with a roof sloping down toward the front broken by dormer windows and buttressed by a massive brick chimney at either end in spite of the gray monotone to which the paintless years had reduced the once white weatherboarding and green venetian blinds the house possessed a certain stateliness of style which was independent of circumstance and a solidity of construction that resisted sturdily the disintegrating hand of time heartpine and liveoak mused the colonel like other things southern live long and die hard the old house had been built of the best materials and its woodwork dowelled and mortised and tongued and grooved by men who knew their trade and had not learned to scamp their work for the colonels grandfather had built the house as a town residence the family having owned in addition thereto a handsome country place upon a large plantation remote from the town

the colonel had stopped on the opposite side of the street and was looking intently at the home of his ancestors and of his own youth when a neatly dressed coloured girl came out on the piazza seated herself in a rockingchair with an air of proprietorship and opened what the colonel perceived to be even across the street a copy of a womans magazine whose circulation as he knew from the advertising rates that french and co had paid for the use of its columns touched the million mark not wishing to seem rude the colonel moved slowly on down the street when he turned his head after going a rod or two and looked back over his shoulder the girl had risen and was reentering the house her disappearance was promptly followed by the notes of a piano slightly out of tune to which some oneâpresumably the young womanâ was singing in a high voice which might have been better had it been better trained  i dreamt that i dweelt in maarble halls with vassals and serfs at my siiide

the colonel had slackened his pace at the sound of the music but after the first few bars started forward with quickened footsteps which he did not relax until little phils weight increasing momentarily brought home to him the consciousness that his stride was too long for the boys short legs phil who was a thoroughbred and would have dropped in his tracks without complaining was nevertheless relieved when his fathers pace returned to the normal

their walk led down a hill and very soon to a wooden bridge which spanned a creek some twenty feet below the colonel paused for a moment beside the railing and looked up and down the stream it seemed narrower and more sluggish than his memory had pictured it above him the water ran between high banks grown thick with underbrush and overarching trees below the bridge to the right of the creek lay an open meadow and to the left a few rods away the ruins of the old eureka cotton mill which in his boyhood had harboured a flourishing industry but which had remained since shermans army laid waste the country the melancholy ruin the colonel had seen it last when twentyfive years or more before he left clarendon to seek a wider career in the outer world the clear water of the creek rippled harmoniously down a gentle slope and over the site where the great dam at the foot had stood while birds were nesting in the vines with which kindly nature had sought to cloak the dismantled and crumbling walls

mounting the slope beyond the bridge the colonels stride now carefully accommodated to the childs puny step they skirted a low brick wall beyond which white headstones gleamed in a mass of verdure reaching an iron gate the colonel lifted the latch and entered the cemetery which had been the object of their visit

is this the place papa asked the little boy

yes phil but it is farther on in the older part

they passed slowly along under the drooping elms and willows past the monuments on either handâhere resting on a low brick wall a slab of marble once white now gray and mossgrown from which the hand of time had well nigh erased the carved inscription here a family vault built into the side of a mound of earth from which only the barred iron door distinguished it here a pedestal with a timeworn angel holding a broken fragment of the resurrection trumpet here a prostrate headstone and there another bending to its fall and among them a profusion of rose bushes on some of which the early roses were already bloomingâscarcely a wellkept cemetery for in many lots the shrubbery grew in wild unpruned luxuriance nor yet entirely neglected since others showed the signs of loving care and an effort had been made to keep the walks clean and clear

father and son had traversed half the width of the cemetery when they came to a spacious lot surrounded by large trees and containing several monuments it seemed less neglected than the lots about it and as they drew nigh they saw among the tombs a very black and seemingly aged negro engaged in pruning a tangled rose tree near him stood a dilapidated basket partially filled with weeds and leaves into which he was throwing the dead and superfluous limbs he seemed very intent upon his occupation and had not noticed the colonels and phils approach until they had paused at the side of the lot and stood looking at him

when the old man became aware of their presence he straightened himself up with the slow movement of one stiff with age or rheumatism and threw them a tentatively friendly look out of a pair of faded eyes

howdy do uncle said the colonel will you tell me whose graves these are that you are caring for

yas suh said the old man removing his battered hat respectfullyâthe rest of his clothing was in keeping a picturesque assortment of rags and patches such as only an old negro can get together or keep togetherâdis hyuh lot suh blongs ter de fambly dat i useter blong ter âde ol french fambly suh de fines fambly in beaver county

why papa cried little phil he means

hush phil go on uncle

yas suh de fines fambly in claendon suh dis hyuh headstone hyuh suh an de little stone at de foot repesents de grave er ol ginal french wat fit in de revolution wah suh and dis hyuh one nex to it is de g tave er my ol marster majah french wat fit in de mexican wah and died endyoin de wah wid de yankees suh

you must have been very fond of them to take such good care of their graves said the colonel much moved but giving no sign

well suh i blonged ter de fambly an i ain got no chick ner chile er my own livin an dese hyuh dead folks pears mo closer ter me dan anybody ese de cullud folks don wase much time wid a ole man wat ain got nothin an dese hyuh new wite folks wat is come up sence de wah ain got no use fer niggers now dat dey don blong ter nobody no mo so wen i ain got nothin ese ter do i comes roun hyuh whar i knows evybody and evybody knows me an trims de rose bushes an pulls up de weeds and keeps de grass down jes lak i spose mars henryd a had it done ef hed a lived hyuh in de ole home stidder way off yandah in de norf whar he so busy makin money dat he done fergot all bout his own folks

 what is your name asked the colonel who had been looking closely at the old man

peter suhâpeter french most er de niggers change dey names after de wah but i kept de ole fambly name i wuz raise by it wuz good nuff fer me suh dey ain none better

oh papa said little phil unable to restrain himself longer he must be some kin to us he has the same name and belongs to the same family and you know you called him uncle

the old negro had dropped his hat and was staring at the colonel and the little boy alternately with dawning amazement while a look of recognition crept slowly into his rugged old face

look a hyuh suh he said tremulously is itâit cant beâbut deres de eyes an de nose an de shape er de headâwhy it must be my young mars henry 

yes said the colonel extending his hand to the old man who grasped it with both his own and shook it up and down with unconventional but very affectionate vigour and you are my boy peter who took care of me when i was no bigger than phil here

this meeting touched a tender chord in the colonels nature already tuned to sympathy with the dead past of which peter seemed the only survival the old mans unfeigned delight at their meeting his retention of the family name a living witness of its former standing his respect for the dead his family pride which to the unsympathetic outsider might have seemed grotesque were proofs of loyalty that moved the colonel deeply when he himself had been a child of five or six his father had given him peter as his own boy peter was really not many years older than the colonel but prosperity had preserved the one while hard luck had aged the other prematurely peter had taken care of him and taught him to paddle in the shallow water of the creek and to avoid the suckholes had taught him simple woodcraft how to fish and how to hunt first with bow and arrow and later with a shotgun through the golden haze of memory the colonels happy childhood came back to him with a sudden rush of emotion

those were good times peter when we were young he sighed regretfully good times i have seen none happier

yas suh yas suh deed dem wuz good ole times sho dey wuz suh sho dey wuz member dem constalk fiddles we use ter make an dem elderberrywood whistles

yes peter and the robins we used to shoot and the rabbits we used to trap 

an dem watermillions suhâummm ummmm

yes returned the colonel with a shade of pensiveness there had been two sides to the watermelon question peter and he had not always been able to find ripe watermelons early in the season and at times there had been painful consequences the memory of which came back to the colonel with surprising ease nor had they always been careful about boundaries in those early days there had been one occasion when an irate neighbour had complained and major french had thrashed henry and peter bothâpeter because he was older and knew better and henry because it was important that he should have impressedupon him early in life that of him to whom much is given much will be required and that what might be lightly regarded in peters case would be a serious offence in his future masters the lesson had been well learned for throughout the course of his life the colonel had never shirked responsibility but had made the performance of duty his criterion of conduct to him the line of least resistance had always seemed the refuge of the coward and the weakling with the twenty years preceding his return to clarendon this story has nothing to do but upon the quiet background of his business career he had lived an active intellectual and emotional life and had developed into one of those rare natures of whom it may be truly said that they are men and that they count nothing of what is human foreign to themselves

but the serenity of peters retrospect was unmarred by any passing cloud those who dwell in darkness find it easier to remember the bright places in their lives

yas suh yas suh dem watermillions he repeated with unction i kin tase em now dey wuz de hes watermillions dat evuh growed suhâdey doan raise none lack em dese days no mo an den dera chinquapin bushes down by de swamp i member dem chinquapin bushes whar we killt dat water moccasin dat day he wuz bout ten foot long

yes peter he was a whopper then there were the bullace vines in the woods beyond the tanyard 

sho nuff suh an de minnows we use ter ketch in de creek an dem perch in de mill pon 

for years the colonel had belonged to a fishing club which preserved an icecold stream in a northern forest for years the choicest fruits of all the earth had been served daily upon his table yet as he looked back today no shining trout that had ever risen to his fly had stirred his emotions like the diaphanous minnows caught with a crooked pin in the crooked creek no luscious fruit had ever matched in sweetness the sour grapes and bitter nuts gathered from the native woodsâby him and peter in their faroff youth

yas suh yas suh peter went on an member dat time you an young mars jim wilson went huntin and fishin up de country tergether an got tied er waitin on yoseves an wit back fer me ter come up ter wait on yer and cook fer yer an ole marster say he did n dare ter let me go way off yander wid twro keerliss boys lak youall wid guns an boats fer fear i mought git shot er drownded  

it looked peter as though he valued you more than me more than his own son

and what have you been doing all these years peter asked the colonel

peters story was not a thrilling one it was no tale of inordinate ambition no odyssey of a perilous search for the prizes of life but the bald recital of a mere struggle for existence peter had stayed by his master until his masters death then he had worked for a railroad contractor until exposure and overwork had laid him up with a fever after his recovery he had been employed for some years at cutting turpentine boxes in the pine woods following the trail of the industry southward until one day his axe had slipped and wounded him severely when his wound was healed he was told that he was too old and awkward for the turpentine and that they needed younger and more active men

so wen i got my laig kyoed up said the old man concluding his story i come back hyuh whar i wuz bon suh and whar my wite folks use ter live an whar my friens use ter be but my wite folks wuz all in de graveyad an most er my friens wuz dead er moved away an i fins it kinder lonesome suh i goes out an picks cotton in de fall an i does arrants an little jobs roun de house fer folks wat ll hire me an wen i ain got nothin ter eat i kin gor oun ter de ole house an wok in de gyahden er chop some wood an git a meal er vittles fom ole mis nichols whos ben mighty good ter me suh shes de barbuhs wife suh wat bought ouah ole house dey got mo dan any yuther colored folks roun hyuh but dey heps de po suh dey heps de po

which speaks well for them peter im glad that all the virtue has not yet gone out of the old house

the old mans talk rambled on like a sluggish stream while the colonels more active mind busied itself with the problem suggested by this unforeseen meeting peter and he had both gone out into the world and they had both returned he had come back rich and independent what good had freedom done for peter in the colonels childhood his fathers butler old madison had lived a life which compared to that of peter at the same age was one of ease and luxury how easy the conclusion that the slaves lot had been the more fortunate  but no peter had been better free there were plenty of poor white men and no one had suggested slavery as an improvement of their condition had peter remained a slave then the colonel would have remained a master which was only another form of slavery the colonel had been emancipated by the same token that had made peter free peter had returned home poor and broken not because he had been free but because nature first and society next in distributing their gifts had been niggardly with old peter had he been better equipped or had a better chance he might have made a better showing the colonel had prospered because having no peters to work for him he had been compelled to work for himself he would set his own success against peters failure and he would take off his hat to the memory of the immortal statesman who in freeing one race had emancipated another and struck the shackles from a nations mind

while the colonel and old peter were thus discussing reminiscences in which little phil could have no share the boy with childish curiosity had wandered off down one of the shaded paths when a little later the colonel looked around for him he saw phil seated on a rustic bench in conversation with a lady as the boy seemed entirely comfortable and the lady not at all disturbed the colonel did not interrupt them for a while but when the lady at length rose holding phil by the hand the colonel fearing that the boy who was a child of strong impulses prone to sudden friendships might be proving troublesome left his seat on the flattopped tomb of his revolutionary ancestor and hastened to meet them

i trust my boy hasnt annoyed you he said lifting his hat

not at all sir returned the lady in a clear sweet voice some haunting tone of which found an answering vibration in the colonels memory on the contrary he has interested me very much and in nothing more than in telling me his name if this and my memory do not deceive me you are henry french 

yes and you areâyou are laura treadwell  how glad i am to meet you  i was coming to call this afternoon

im glad to see you again we have always remembered you and knew that you had grown rich and great and feared that you had forgotten the old townâand your old friends

not very rich nor very great lauraâmiss treadwell

 let it be laura she said with a faint colour mounting in her cheek which had not yet lost its smoothness as her eyes had not faded nor her step lost its spring

and neither have i forgotten the old home nor the old friendsâsince i am here and knew you the moment i looked at you and heard your voice

and what a dear little boy exclaimed miss treadwell looking down at phil he is named philipâafter his grandfather i reckon

after his grandfather we have been visiting his grave and those of all the frenches and i found them hauntedâby an old retainer who had come hither he said to be with his friends

old peter i see him now and then keeping the lot in order there are few like him left and there were never any too many but how have you been these many years and where is your wife  did you bring her with you 

i buried her returned the colonel a little over a year ago she left me little phil

he must be like her replied the lady and yet he resembles you

he has her eyes and hair said his father he is a good little boy and a lad of taste see how he took to you at first sight i can always trust phils instincts he is a born gentleman

he came of a race of gentlemen she said im glad it is not to die out there are none too many left âin clarendon you are going to like me arent you phil asked the lady

i like you already replied phil gallantly you are a very nice lady what shall i call you 

call her miss laura philâit is the southern fashion âa happy union of familiarity and respect already they come back to me lauraâone breathes them with the air âthe gentle southern customs with all the faults of the old system lauraâit carried the seeds of decay within itself and was doomed to perishâa few of us at least had a good time an aristocracy is quite endurable for the aristocrat and slavery tolerable for the mastersâand the peters when we were young before the rude hand of war had shattered our illusions we were very happy laura

yes we were very happy

they were walking now very slowly toward the gate by which the colonel had entered with little phil between them confiding a hand to each

and how is your mother asked the colonel she is living yet i trust

yes but ailing as she has been for fifteen yearsâever since my father died it was his grave i came to visit

you had ever a loving heart laura said the colonel given to duty and selfsacrifice are you still living in the old place

the old place only it is older and shows itâlike the rest of us

she bit her lip at the words which she meant in reference to herself but which she perceived as soon as she had uttered them might apply to him with equal force despising herself for the weakness which he might have interpreted as a bid for a compliment she was glad that he seemed unconscious of the remark

the colonel and phil had entered the cemetery by a side gate and their exit led through the main entrance miss laura pointed out as they walked slowly along between the elms the graves of many whom the colonel had known in his younger days their names woven in the tapestry of his memory needed in most eases but a touch to restore them for while his intellectual life had ranged far and wide his business career had run along a single channel his circle of intimates had not been very large nor very variable nor was his memory so overlaid that he could not push aside its later impressions in favour of those graven there so deeply in his youth

nearing the gate they passed a small open space in which stood a simple marble shaft erected to the memory of the confederate dead a wealth of fresh flowers lay at its base the colonel took off his hat as he stood before it for a moment with bowed head but for the mercy of god he might have been one of those whose deaths as well as deeds were thus commemorated

beyond this memorial impressive in its pure simplicity and between it and the gate in an obtrusively conspicuous spot stood a florid monument of granite marble and bronze of glaring design and strangely out of keeping with the simple dignity and quiet restfulness of the surroundings a monument so striking that the colonel paused involuntarily and read the inscription in bronze letters on the marble shaft above the granite base   sacred to the memory of joshua fetters and elizabeth fetters his wife

lifes work well done lifes race well run lifes crown well won then comes rest a beautiful sentiment if somewhat trite said the colonel  but an atrocious monument

 do you think so   exclaimed the lady  most people think the monument fine but smile at the sentiment

in matters of taste returned the colonel the majority are always wong but why smile at the sentiment is it for some reason inappropriate to this particular case  fettersâfettersâthe name seems familiar who was fetters laura

he was the speculator she said who bought and sold negroes and kept dogs to chase runaways old mr fettersâyou must remember old josh fetters  when i was a child my coloured mammy used him for a bogeyman for me as for her own children

look out honey shed say ef you ain good ole mr fettuhs ll ketch you

yes he remembered now fetters had been a character in clarendonânot an admirable character scarcely a good character almost a bad character a necessary adjunct of an evil system and like other parasites worse than the body on which he fed doing the dirty work of slavery and very naturally despised by those whose instrument he was but finding consolation by taking it out of the negroes in the course of his business the colonel would have expected fetters to lie in an unmarked grave in his own back lot or in the potters field had he so far escaped the ruin of the institution on which he lived as to leave an estate sufficient to satisfy his heirs and also pay for this expensive but vulgar monument 

the memorial was erected as you see from the rest of the inscription by his beloved and affectionate son that either loved the other no one suspected for bill was harshly treated and ran away from home at fifteen he came back after the war with money which he lent out at high rates of interest everything he touched turned to gold he has grown rich and is a great man in the state he was a large contributor to the soldiers monument but did not choose the design let us be thankful for that it might have been like his fathers bill fetters rich and great he mused who would have dreamed it  i kicked him once all the way down main street from the schoolhouse to the bankâand dodged his angry mother for a whole month afterward

no one suggested miss laura would venture to cross him now too many owe him money

he went to school at the academy the colonel went on unwinding the thread of his memory and the rest of the boys looked down on him and made his life miserable well laura in fetters you see one thing that resulted from the warâthe poor white boy was given a chance to grow and if the product is not as yet altogether admirable taste and culture may come with another generation

it is to be hoped they may said miss laura and character as well mr fetters has a son who has gone from college to college and will graduate from harvard this summer they say he is very wild and spends ten thousand dollars a year i do not see how it can be possible

the colonel smiled at her simplicity

i have been he said at a college football game where the gate receipts were fifty thousand dollars and half a million was said to have changed hands in bets on the result it is easy to waste money

it is a sin she said that some should be made poor that others may have it to waste

there was a touch of bitterness in her tone the instinctive resentment the colonel thought of the bom aristocrat toward the upstart who had pushed his way above those no longer strong enough to resist it did not occur to him that her feeling might rest upon any personal ground it was inevitable that with the incubus of slavery removed society should readjust itself in due time upon a democratic basis and that poor white men first and black men next should reach a level representing the true measure of their talents and their ambition but it was perhaps equally inevitable that for a generation or two those who had suffered most from the readjustment should chafe under its seeming injustice

the colonel was himself a gentleman and the descendant of a long line of gentlemen but he had lived too many years among those who judged the tree by its fruit to think that blood alone entitled him to any special privileges the consciousness of honourable ancestry might make one clean of life gentle of manner and just in ones dealings in so far as it did this it was something to be cherished but scarcely to be boasted of for democracy is impatient of any excellence not bom of personal effort of any pride save that of achievement he was glad that fetters had got on in the world it justified a fine faith in humanity that wealth and power should have been attained by the poor white lad over whom with a boys unconscious brutality he had tyrannised in his childhood he could have washed for bill a better taste in monuments and better luck in sons if rumour was correct about fetterss boy but these perhaps were points where blood did tell there was something in blood after all nature might make a great man from any sort of material hence the virtue of democracy for the world needs great men and suffers from their lack and welcomes them from any source but fine types were a matter of breeding and were perhaps worth the trouble of preserving if their existence were compatible with the larger good he wondered if bill ever recalled that progress down main street in which he had played so conspicuous a part or still bore any resentment toward the other participants 

could your mother see me he asked as they reached the gate if i went by the house

she would be glad to see you mother lives in the past and you would come to her as part of it she often speaks of you it is only a short distance you have not forgotten the way

they turned to the right in a direction opposite to that from which the colonel had reached the cemetery after a few minutes walk in the course of which they crossed another bridge over the same winding creek they mounted the slope beyond opened a gate climbed a short flight of stone steps and found themselves in an enchanted garden where lilac bush and jessamine vine reared their heads high tulip and daffodil pushed their way upward but were all dominated by the intenser fragrance of the violets

old peter had followed the party at a respectful distance but seeing himself forgotten he walked past the gate after they had entered it and went somewhat disconsolately on his way he had stopped and was looking back toward the houseâclarendon was a great place for looking back perhaps because there was little in the town to which to look forwardâwhen a white man wearing a tinned badge upon his coat came up took peter by the arm and led him away despite some feeble protests on the old mans part

at the end of the garden stood a frame house with a wade columned porch it had once been white and the windows closed with blinds that still retained a faded tint of green upon the porch in a comfortable arm chair sat an old lady wearing a white cap under which her white hair showed at the sides and holding her hands upon which she wore black silk mits crossed upon her lap on the top step at opposite ends sat two young peopleâone of them a rosycheeked girl in the bloom of early youth with a head of rebellious brown hair she had been reading a book held open in her hand the other was a longlegged lean shy young man of apparently twentythree or twentyfour with black hair and eyes and a swarthy complexion from the jackknife beside him and the shavings scattered around it was clear that he had been whittling out the piece of pine that he was adjusting with some nicety to a wooden model of some mechanical contrivance which stood upon the floor beside him they were a strikingly handsome couple of ideally contrasting types

mother said miss treadwell this is henry french âcolonel frenchâwho has come back from the north to visit his old home and the graves of his ancestors i found him in the cemetery and this is his dear little boy philipânamed after his grandfather

the old lady gave the colonel a slender white hand thin almost to transparency

henry she said in a silvery thread of voice i am glad to see you you must excuse my not risingâi cant walk without help you are like your father and even more like your grandfather and your little boy takes after the family she drew phil toward her and kissed him

phil accepted this attention amiably meantime the young people had risen

this said miss treadwell laying her hand affectionately on the girls arm is my niece graciellaâmy brother toms child tom is dead you know these eight years and more and so is graciellas mother and she has lived with us

graciella gave the colonel her hand with engaging frankness im sure were awfully glad to see anybody from the north she said are you familiar with new york

i left there only day before yesterday replied the colonel

and this said miss treadwell introducing the young man who when he unfolded his long legs rose to a rather imposing height this is mr ben dudley

the son of malcolm dudley of mink run i suppose  im glad to meet you said the colonel giving the young mans hand a cordial grasp

his nephew sir returned young dudley my uncle never married

oh indeed  i did not know but he is alive i trust and well 

alive sir but very much broken he has not been himself for years

you find things sadly changed henry said mrs treadwell they have never been the same since the surrender our people are poor now right poor most of them though we ourselves were fortunate enough to have something left

we have enough left for supper mother interposed miss laura quickly to which we are going to ask colonel french to stay

i suppose that in new york every one has dinner at six and supper after the theatre or the concert said graciella inquiringly

the fortunate few returned the colonel smiling into her eager face  who can afford a seat at the opera and to pay for and digest two meals all in the same evening

and now colonel said miss treadwell im going to see about the supper mother will talk to you while i am gone

 i must be going said young dudley

wont you stay to supper ben asked miss laura

no miss laura id like to but uncle wasnt well today and i must stop by the drug store and get some medicine for him dr price gave me a prescription on my way in goodbye sir he added addressing the colonel will you be in town long

i really havent decided a day or two perhaps a week i am not bound at present by any business tiesâam footloose as we used to say when i was young i shall follow my inclinations

then i hope sir that youll feel inclined to pay us a long visit and that i shall see you many times

as ben dudley after this courteous wish stepped down from the piazza graciella rose and walked with him along the garden path she was tall as most women but only reached his shoulder

say graciella he asked wont you give me an answer

im thinking about it ben if you could take me away from this dead old town with its lazy white people and its trifling niggers to a place where theres music and art and life and societyâwhere theres something going on all the time id like to marry you but if i did so now youd take me out to your rickety old house with your daffy old uncle and his dumb old housekeeper and i should lose my own mind in a week or ten days when you can promise to take me to new york ill promise to marry you ben i want to travel and to see things to visit the art galleries and libraries to hear patti and to look at the millionaires promenading on fifth avenueâ and ill marry the man wholl take me there

uncle malcolm cant live forever graciellaâthough i wouldnt wish his span shortened by a single dayâand ill get the plantation and then you know he added hesitating we mayâwe may find the money

graciella shook her head compassionately no ben youll never find the money there isnt any its all imaginationâmoonshine the war unsettled your uncles brain and he dreamed the money

its as true as im standing here graciella replied ben earnestly that theres moneyâgoldâsomewhere about the house uncle couldnt imagine paper and ink and ive seen the letter from my uncles uncle ralphâ ill get it and bring it to you some day the money will turn up and then may be ill be able to take you away meantime some one must look after uncle and the place theres no one else but me to do it things must grow better some timeâthey always do you know

they couldnt be much worse returned graciella discontentedly

oh theyll be betterâtheyre bound to be theyll just have to be and youll wait for me wont you graciella

oh i suppose ill have to youre around here so much that every one else is scared away and there isnt much choice at the best all the young men worth having are gone away already but you know my ultimatumâ i must get to new york if you are ready before any one else speaks you may take me there

youre hard on a poor devil graciella i dont believe you care a bit for me or you wouldnt talk like that dont you suppose i have any feelings even if i aint much account aint i worth as much as a trip up north

why should i waste my time with you if i didnt care for you returned graciella begging the question  heres a rose in token of my love

she plucked the flower and thrust it into his hand

its full of thorns like your love he said ruefully as he picked the sharp points out of his fingers

 faithful are the wounds of a friend  returned the girl see psalms xxvii 

take care of my cotton press graciella ill come in tomorrow evening and work on it some more ill bring some cotton along to try it with

youll probably find some excuseâyou always do  dont you want me to come  he asked with a trace of resentment  i can stay away if you dont

oh you come so often that iâi suppose id miss you if you didnt  one must have some company and half a loaf is better than no bread

he went on down the hill turning at the corner for a lingering backward look at his tyrant graciella bending her head over the wall followed his movements with a swift tenderness in her sparkling brown eyes

 i love him better than anything on earth she sighed but it would never do to tell him so hed get so conceited that i couldnt manage him any longer and so lay that hed never exert himself i must get away from this town before im old and grayâill be seventeen next week and an old maid in next to no timeâand ben must take me away but i must be his inspiration hed never do it by himself ill go now and talk to that dear old colonel french about the north i can learn a great deal from him and he doesnt look so old either she mused as she went back up the walk to where the colonel sat on the piazza talking to the other ladies

the colonel spent a delightful evening in the company of his friends the supper was typically southern and the cook evidently a good one there was smothered chicken light biscuit fresh eggs poundcake and tea the tablecloth and napkins were of fine linen that they were soft and smooth the colonel noticed but he did not observe closely enough to see that they had been carefully darned in many places the silver spoons were of fine oldfashioned patterns worn very thinâso thin that even the colonel was struck by their fragility how charming he thought to prefer the simple dignity of the past to the vulgar ostentation of a more modem time he had once dined off a golden dinner service at the table of a multimillionaire and had not enjoyed the meal half so much the dining room looked out upon the garden and the perfume of lilac and violet stole in through the open windows a softfooted shapely welltrained negro maid in white cap and apron waited deftly upon the table a woman of serious countenanceâso serious that the colonel wondered if she were a presentday type of her race and if the responsibilities of freedom had robbed her people of their traditional lightheartedness and gaiety

after supper they sat out upon the piazza the lights within were turned down low so that the moths and other insects might not be attracted sweet odours from the garden filled the air through the elms the stars brighter than in more northern latitudes looked out from a sky of darker blue so bright were they that the colonel looking around for the moon was surprised to find that luminary invisible on the green background of the foliage the fireflies glowed and flickered there was no strident steam whistle from factory or train to assault the ear no rumble of passing cabs or street cars far away in some distant part of the straggling town a sweettoned bell sounded the hour of an evening church service

to see you is a breath from the past henry said mrs treadwell you are a fine strong man now but i can see you as you were the day you went away to the war in your new gray uniform on your fine gray horse at the head of your company you were going to take peter with you but he had got his feet poisoned with poison ivy and couldnt walk and your father gave you another boy and peter cried like a baby at being left behind i can remember how proud you were and how proud your father was when he gave you his swordâyour grandfathers sword and told you never to draw it or sheath it except in honour and how when you were gone the old gentleman shut himself up for two whole days and would speak to no one he was glad and sorryâglad to send you to fight for your country and sorry to see you goâfor you were his only boy

the colonel thrilled with love and regret his father had loved him he knew very well and he had not visited his tomb for twentyfive years how far away it seemed too the time when he had thought of the confederacy as his country and the sword his grandfathers sword had been for years stored away in a dark closet his father had kept it displayed upon the drawingroom wall over the table on which the family bible had rested

mrs treadwell was silent for a moment

times have changed since then henry we have lost a great deal although we still have enoughâyes we have plenty to live upon and to hold up our heads among the best

miss laura and graciella behind the colonels back exchanged meaning glances how well they knew how little they had to live upon

that is quite evident said the colonel glancing through the window at the tasteful interior and i am glad to see that you have fared so well my father lost everything

we were more fortunate said mrs treadwell we were obliged to let belleview go when major treadwell diedâthere were debts to be paid and we were robbed as wellâbut we have several rentable properties in town and an estate in the country which brings us in an income but things are not quite what they used to be

mrs treadwell sighed and nodded miss laura sat in silenceâa pensive silence she too remembered the time gone by but unlike her mothers life her own had only begun as the good times were ending her mother in her youth had seen something of the world the daughter of a wealthy planter she had spent her summers at saratoga had visited new york and philadelphia and new orleans and had taken a voyage to europe graciella was young and beautiful her prince might come might be here even now if this grand gentleman should chance to throw the handkerchief but she laura had passed her youth in a transition period the pleasures neither of memory nor of hope had been hersâ except such memories as came of duty well performed and such hopes as had no root in anything earthly or corruptible

graciella was not in a reflective mood and took up the burden of the conversation where her grandmother had dropped it her thoughts were not of the past but of the future she asked many eager questions of new york was it true that ladies at the waldorfastoria always went to dinner in lowcut bodices with short sleeves and was evening dress always required at the theatre did the old knickerbocker families recognise the vanderbilts were the rockefellers anything at all socially did he know ward mc allister at that period the beau brummel of the metropolitan smart set was fifth avenue losing its preeminence  on what days of the week was the art museum free to the public  what was the fare to new york and the best quarter of the city in which to inquire for a quiet select boarding house wdiere a southern lady of refinement and good family might stay at a reasonable price and meet some nice people  and would he recommend stenography or magazine work and which did he consider preferable as a career which such a young lady might follow without injury to her social standing

the colonel with some amusement answered these artless inquiries as best he could they came as a refreshing foil to the sweet but melancholy memories of the past they were interesting too from this very pretty but very ignorant little girl in this backward little southern town she was a flash of sunlight through a soft gray cloud a vigorous shoot from an old mosscovered stumpâshe was life young life the vital principle breaking through the cumbering envelope and asserting its right to reach the sun

after a while a couple of very young ladies friends of graciella dropped in they were introduced to the colonel who found that he had known their fathers or their mothers or their grandfathers or their grandmothers and that many of them were more or less distantly related a little later a couple of young men friends of graciellas friendsâalso very young and very selfconsciousâmade their appearance and were duly introduced in person and by pedigree the conversation languished for a moment and then one of the young ladies said something about music and one of the young men remarked that he had brought over a new song graciella begged the colonel to excuse them and led the way to the parlour followed by her young friends

mrs treadwell had fallen asleep and was leaning comfortably back in her armchair miss laura excused herself brought a veil and laid it softly across her mothers face

the night air is not damp she said and it is pleasanter for her here than in the house she wont mind the music she is accustomed to it

graciella went to the piano and with great boldness of touch struck the bizarre opening chords and then launched into the grotesque words of the latest new york coon song one of the first and worst of its kind and the other young people joined in the chorus

it was the first discordant note at home the colonel subscribed to the opera and enjoyed the music a plantation song of the olden time as he remembered it borne upon the evening air when sung by the tired slaves at the end of their day of toil would have been pleasing with its simple melody its plaintive minor strains its notes of vague longing but to the colonels senses there was tonight no music in this hackneyed popular favourite in a metropolitan music hall gaudily bedecked and brilliantly lighted it would have been tolerable from the lips of a blackface comedian but in this quiet place upon this quiet night and in the colonels mood it seemed like profanation the song of the coloured girl who had dreamt that she dwelt in marble halls and the rest had been less incongruous it had at least breathed aspiration

mrs treadwell was still dozing in her armchair the colonel beckoning miss laura to follow him moved to the farther end of the piazza where they might not hear the singers and the song

it is delightful here laura i seem to have renewed my youth i yield myself a willing victim to the charm of the old place the old ways the old friends

you see our best side henry night has a kindly hand that covers our defects and the starlight throws a glamour over everything you see us through a haze of tender memories when you have been here a week the town will seem dull and narrow and sluggish you will find us ignorant and backward worshipping our old idols and setting up no new ones our young men leaving us and none coming in to take their place had you and men like you remained with us we might have hoped for better things

and perhaps not laura environment controls the making of men some rise above it the majority do not we might have followed in the wellworn rut but let us not spoil this delightful evening by speaking of anything sad or gloomy this is your daily life to me it is like a scene from a play over which one sighs to see the curtain fallâall enchantment all light all happiness

but even while he spoke of light a shadow loomed up beside them the coloured woman who had waited at the table came around the house from the back yard and stood by the piazza railing

miss laura  she called softly and appealingly kin you come hyuh a minute  

what is it catherine

kin i speak just a word to you maam its somethin particlarâmighty particular maam

excuse me a minute henry said miss laura rising with evident reluctance

she stepped down from the piazza and walked beside the woman down one of the garden paths the colonel as he sat there smokingâwith miss lauras permission he had lighted a cigarâcould see the light stuff of the ladys gown against the green background though she was walking in the shadow of the elms from the murmur which came to him he gathered that the black woman was pleading earnestly passionately and he could hear miss lauras regretful voice as she closed the interview  i am sorry catherine but it is simply impossible i would if i could but i cannot

the woman came back first and as she passed by an open window the light fell upon her face which showed signs of deep distress hardening already into resignation or despair she was probably in trouble of some sort and her mistress had not been able doubtless for some good reason to help her out this suspicion was borne out by the fact that when miss laura came back to him she too seemed troubled but since she did not speak of the matter the colonel gave no sign of his own thoughts

you have said nothing of yourself laura he said wishing to divert her mind from anything unpleasant tell me something of your own lifeâit could only be a cheerful theme for you have means and leisure and a perfect environment tell me of your occupations your hopes your aspirations

there is little enough to tell henry she returned with a sudden courage  but that little shall be the truth you will find it out if you stay long in town and i would rather you learned it from our lips than from others less friendly my mother isâmy motherâa dear sweet woman to whom i have devoted my life but we are not well off henry our parlour carpet has been down for twentyfive years surely you must have recognised the pattern the house has not been painted for the same length of time it is of heart pine and we train the flowers and vines to cover it as much as may be and there are many others like it so it is not conspicuous our rentable property is three ramshackle cabins on the alley at the rear of the lot for which we get four dollars a month each when we can collect it our country estate is a few acres of poor land which we rent on shares and from which we get a few bushels of com an occasional load of firewood and a few barrels of potatoes as for my own life i husband our small resources i keep the house and wait on mother as i have done since she became helpless ten years ago i look after graciella i teach in the sunday school and i give to those less fortunate such help as the poor can give the poor

how did you come to lose belleview asked the colonel after a pause i had understood major treadwell to be one of the few people around here who weathered the storm of war and emerged financially sound

he did and he remained soâuntil he met mr fetters who had made money out of the war while all the rest were losing father despised the slavetraders son but admired his ability to get along fetters made his acquaintance flattered him told him glowing stories of wealth to be made by speculating in cotton and turpentine father was not a business man but he listened fetters lent him money and father lent fetters money and they had transactions back and forth and jointly father lost and gained and we had no inkling that he had suffered greatly until at his sudden death fetters foreclosed a mortgage he held upon belleview mother has always believed there was something wrong about the transaction and that father was not indebted to fetters in any such sum as fetters claimed but we could find no papers and we had no proof and fetters took the plantation for his debt he changed its name to sycamore he wanted a postoffice there and there were too many belleviews

does he own it still 

yes and runs itâwith convict labour the thought makes me shudder i we were rich when he was poor we are poor and he is rich but we trust in god who has never deserted the widow and the fatherless by his mercy we have lived and as mother says held up our heads not in pride or haughtiness but in selfrespect for we cannot forget what we were

nor what you are laura for you are wonderful said the colonel not unwilling to lighten a situation that bordered on intensity you should have married and had children the south needs such mothers as you would have made unless the men of clarendon have lost their discernment unless chivalry has vanished and the fire died out of the southern blood it has not been for lack of opportunity that your name remains unchanged

miss lauras cheek flushed unseen in the shadow of the porch

ah henry that would be telling but to marry me one must have married the family for i could not have left themâthey have had only me i have not been unhappy i do not know that i would have had my life different

graciella and her friends had finished their song the piano had ceased to sound and the visitors were taking their leave graciella went with them to the gate where they stood laughing and talking the colonel looked at his watch by the light of the open door

it is not late he said if my memory is true you too played the piano when youâwhen i was young

it is the same piano henry and like our life here somewhat thin and weak of tone but if you think it would give you pleasure i will playâas well as i know how

she readjusted the veil which had slipped from her mothers face and they went into the parlour from a pile of timestained music she selected a sheet and seated herself at the piano the colonel stood at her elbow she had a pretty back he thought and a still youthful turn of the head and still plentiful glossy brown hair her hands were white slender and well kept though he saw on the side of the forefinger of her left hand the telltale marks of the needle

the piece was an arrangement of the wellknown air from the opera of maritana  scenes that are brightest may charm awhile hearts which are lightest and eyes that smile

yet oer them above us though nature beam with none to love us how sad they seem  

under her sympathetic touch a gentle stream of melody flowed from the oldtime piano scarcely stronger toned in its decrepitude than the spinet of a former century a few moments before under graciellas vigorous hands it had seemed to protest at the dissonances it had been compelled to emit now it seemed to breathe the notes of the old opera with an almost human love and tenderness it too mused the colonel had lived and loved and was recalling the memories of a brighter past

the music died into silence mrs treadwell was awake

laura she called

miss treadwell went to the door

i must have been nodding for a minute i hope colonel french did not observe itâit would scarcely seem polite he hasnt gone yet 

 no mother he is in the parlour

i must be going said the colonel who came to the door i had almost forgotten phil and it is long past his bedtime

miss laura went to wake up phil who had fallen asleep after supper he was still rubbing his eyes when the lady led him out

wake up phil said the colonel its time to be going tell the ladies good night

graciella came running up the walk

why colonel french she cried you are not going already i made the others leave early so that i might talk to you

my dear young lady smiled the colonel i have already risen to go and if i stayed longer i might wear out my welcome and phil would surely go to sleep again but i will come another timeâi shall stay in town several days

yes do come if you must go rejoined graciella with emphasis i want to hear more about the north and about new york society andâoh everything good night philip good night colonel french

beware of the steps henry said miss laura the bottom stone is loose

they heard his footsteps in the quiet street and phils light patter beside him

hes a lovely man isnt he aunt laura said graciella

he is a gentleman replied her aunt with a pensive look at her young niece

of the old school piped mrs treadwell

and philip is a sweet child said miss laura

a chip of the old block added mrs treadwell i remember

yes mother you can tell me when ive shut up the house interrupted miss laura put out the lamps graciellaâtheres not much oilâand when you go to bed hang up your gown carefully for it takes me nearly half an hour to iron it

and you are right good to do it good night dear aunt laura good night grandma

mr french had left the hotel at noon that day as free as air and he slept well that night with no sense of the forces that were to constrain his life and yet the events of the day had started the growth of a dozen tendrils which were destined to grow and reach out and seize and seize and hold him with ties that do not break

the constable who had arrested old peter led his prisoner away through alleys and quiet streetsâthough for that matter all the streets of clarendon were quiet in midafternoonâto a guardhouse or calaboose constructed of crumbling red brick with a rusty barred iron door secured by a heavy padlock as they approached this structure which was sufficiently forbidding in appearance to depress the most lighthearted the strumming of a banjo became audible accompanying a mellow negro voice which was singing to a very ragged ragtime air words of which the burden was something like this  wats de use er my wokin so hahd 

i got a oman in de white mans yahd

wen she cook chicken she save me a wing wen dey low im wokin i ain doin a thing 

the grating of the key in the rusty lock interrupted the song the constable thrust his prisoner into the dimly lighted interior and locked the door

keep over to the right he said curtly thats the niggers side

but mistah haines asked peter excitedly is i got to stay here all night  i ain done nuthin

no thats the trouble you aint done nuthin fer a month but loaf aroun you aint got no visible means of suppot so youre took up for vagrancy

but i does wok wen i kin git any wok ter do the old man expostulated an ef i kin jus git wod ter de right wite folks ill be outer here in half a hour deyll go my bail

they cant go yo bail tonight fer the squires gone home ill bring you some bread and meat an some whiskey if you want it and youll be tried tomorrow mornin

old peter still protested

you niggers are always kickin said the constable who was not without a certain grim sense of humour and not above talking to a negro when there were no white folks around to talk to or to listen  i never see people so hard to satisfy you ain got no home an here ive give you a place to sleep an youre kickin you doan know from one day to another where youll git yo meals an i offer you bread and meat and whiskeyâan youre kickin you say you cant git nothin to do an yit with the prospect of a reglar job befo you tomorrerâyoure kickin i never see the beat of it in all my bon days

when the constable chuckling at his own humour left the guardhouse he found his way to a nearby barroom kept by one clay jackson a place with an evil reputation as the resort of white men of a low class most crimes of violence in the town could be traced to its influence and more than one had been committed within its walls

has mr turner been in here demanded haines of the man in charge

the bartender with a backward movement of his thumb indicated a door opening into a room at the rear here the constable found his manâa burly bearded giant with a red face a cunning eye and an overbearing manner he had a bottle and a glass before him and was unsociably drinking alone

howdy haines said turner hows things how many have you get this time 

ive got three rounded up mr turner an ill take up another befo night thatll make foâfifty dollars fer me an the res fer the squire

thats good rejoined turner have a glass of liquor how much do you spose the squirell fine bud  well replied haines drinking down the glass of whiskey at a gulp i reckon about twentyfive dollars you can make it fifty just as easy said turner  niggers are all just a passell o black fools bud would a ben out now if it had nt ben for me i bought him fer six months i kept close watch of him for the first five and then along tods the middle er the las month i let on id got keerliss an he run away course i put the dawgson imanfollowed im here where his woman is an got you after im and now hes good for six months more the woman is a likely gal an a good cook said haines shed be wuth a good eal to you out at the stockade

thats a shore fact replied the other an i need another good woman to help aroun if wed a thought about it an give her a chance to hide bud and feed him befo you took im up we could a filed a charge aginst her for harborin imwell i kin do it nex time fer hell run away aginâ they always do buds got a vile temper

yes but lies a good fieldhand and ill keep his temper down have somethin mo

 ive got to go back now and feed the prisners said haines rising after he had taken another drink an ill stir bud up so hell raise hâ an tomorrow morning ill make another charge against him thatll fetch his fine up to fifty and costs

which will give im to me till the cotton crop is picked and several months more to work on the jackson swamp ditch if fetters gits the contract you stand by us here haines an help me git all the hans l can out o this county and ill give you a job at sycamo when yor times up here as constable go on and feed the niggers an stir up bud and ill be on hand in the mornin when court opens

when the lesser of these precious worthies left his superior to his cups he stopped in the barroom and bought a pint of rotgut whiskeyâa cheap brand of rectified spirits coloured and flavoured to resemble the real article to which it bore about the relation of vitriol to lye he then went into a cheap eating house conducted by a negro for people of his own kind where he procured some slices of fried bacon and some soggy corn bread and with these various purchases wrapped in a piece of brown paper he betook himself to the guardhouse he unlocked the door closed it behind him and called peter the old man came forward

here peter said haines take what you want of this and give some to them other fellows and if theres anything left after youve got what you want throw it to that sulky black hound over yonder in the corner

he nodded toward a young negro in the rear of the room the bud johnson who had been the subject of the conversation with turner johnson replied with a curse the constable advanced menacingly his hand moving toward his pocket quick as a flash the negro threw himself upon him the other prisoners from instinct or prudence or hope of reward caught him pulled him away and held him off until haines pale with rage rose to his feet and began kicking his assailant vigorously with the aid of welldirected blows of his fists he forced the negro down who unable to regain his feet finally whether from fear or exhaustion lay inert until the constable having worked off his worst anger and not deeming it to his advantage seriously to disable the prisoner in whom he had a pecuniary interest desisted from further punishment

 i might send you to the penitentiary for this he said panting for breath but ill send you to hâ instead youll be sold back to mr fetters for a year or two tomorrow and in three months ill be down at sycamore as an overseer and then ill learn you to strike a white man you

the remainder of the objurgation need not be told but there was no doubt from the expression on hainess face that he meant what he said and that he would take pleasure in repaying in overflowing measure any arrears of revenge against the offending prisoner which he might consider his due he had stirred bud up very successfullyâmuch more so indeed than he had really intended he had meant to procure evidence against bud but had hardly thought to carry it away in the shape of a black eye and a swollen nose

when the colonel set out next morning for a walk down the main street he had just breakfasted on boiled brook trout fresh laid eggs hot muffins and coffee and was feeling at peace with all mankind he was alone having left phil in charge of the hotel housekeeper he had gone only a short distance when he reached a door around which several men were lounging and from which came the sound of voices and loud laughter stopping he looked with some curiosity into the door over which there was a faded sign to indicate that it was the office of a justice of the peaceâa pleasing collocation of words to those who could divorce it from any technical significance âjustice peaceâthe seed and the flower of civilisation

an unwashed dingyfaced young negro clothed in rags unspeakably vile which scarcely concealed his nakedness was standing in the midst of a group of white men toward whom he threw now and then a shallow and shifty glance the air was heavy with the odour of stale tobacco and the floor dotted with discarded portions of the weed a white man stood beside a desk and was addressing the audience now gentlemen heres lot number three a likely young nigger who answers to the name of sam brown not much to look at but will make a good field hand if looked after right and kept away from liquor used to workin when in the chain gang where hes been off and on since he was ten years old amount of fine an costs thirtyseven dollars an a half a musical nigger too who plays the banjo an sings jus like aâlike a blackbird what am i bid for this prime lot

the negro threw a dull glance around the crowd with an air of detachment which seemed to say that he was not at all interested in the proceedings the colonel viewed the scene with something more than curious interest the fellow looked like an habitual criminal or at least like a confirmed loafer this must be one of the idle and worthless blacks with so many of whom the south was afflicted this was doubtless the method provided by law for dealing with them

 one year answered a voice

 nine months said a secon six months came a third bid from a tall man with a buggy whip under his arm

are you all through gentlemen  six months labour for thirtyseven fifty is mighty cheap and you know the law allows you to keep the labourer up to the mark are you all done sold to mr turner for mr fetters for s lx months

the prisoners dull face showed some signs of apprehension when the name of his purchaser was pronounced and he shambled away uneasily under the constables vigilant eye

the case of the state against bud johnson is next in order bring in the prisoner

the constable brought in the prisoner handcuffed and placed him in front of the justices desk where he remained standing he was a short powerfully built negro seemingly of pure blood with a wellrounded head not unduly low in the brow and quite broad between the ears under different circumstances his countenance might have been pleasing at present it was set in an expression of angry defiance he had walked with a slight limp there were several contusions upon his face and upon entering the room he had thrown a defiant glance around him which had not quailed even before the stern eye of the tall man turner who as the agent of the absent fetters had bid on sam brown his face then hardened into the blank expression of one who stands in a hostile presence

bud johnson said the justice you are charged with escaping from the service into which you were sold to pay the fine and costs on a charge of vagrancy what do you pleadâguilty or not guilty

the prisoner maintained a sullen silence

 ill enter a plea of not guilty the record of this court shows that you were convicted of vagrancy on december th and sold to mr fetters for four months to pay your fine and costs the four months wont be up for a week mr turner may be sworn

turner swore to buds escape and his pursuit haines testified to his capture

have you anything to say asked the justice whats de use er my sayin anything muttered the negro it wont make no diffence i didn do nothin in de fus place ter be fine fer an run away cause dey did n have no right ter keep me dere guilty twentyfive dollars an costs you are also charged with resisting the officer who made the arrest guilty or not guilty  since you dont speak ill enter a plea of not guilty mr haines may be sworn

haines swore that the prisoner had resisted arrest and had only been captured by the display of a loaded revolver the prisoner was convicted and fined twentyfive dollars and costs for this second offense

the third charge for disorderly conduct in prison was quickly disposed of and a fine of twentyfive dollars and costs levied

you may consider yoself lucky said the magistrate  that mr haines didnt prefer a mo serious charge against you many a nigger has gone to the gallows for less and now gentlemen i want to clean this case up right here how much time is offered for the fine and costs of the prisoner bud johnson amounting to seventyfive dollars fine and thirtythree dollars and fiftyfo cents costs  youve heard the evidence an you see the nigger ef there aint much competition for his sendees and the time is a long one hell have his own stubbornness an deviltry to thank for it hes strong and healthy and able to do good work for any one that can manage him

there was no immediate response turner walked forward and viewed the prisoner from head to foot with a coldly sneering look

well bud he said i reckon well hafter try it agin i have never yet allowed a nigger to git the better o me an moreover i never will ill bid eighteen months squire an thats all hes worth with his keep

there was no competition and the prisoner was knocked down to turner for fetters for eighteen months

lock im up till im ready to go bill said turner to the constable an just leave the irons on him ill fetch em back next time i come to town

the unconscious brutality of the proceeding grated harshly upon the colonels nerves delinquents of some kind these men must be who were thus dealt with but he had lived away from the south so long that so sudden an introduction to some of its customs came with something of a shock he had remembered the pleasant things and these but vaguely since his thoughts and his interests had been elsewhere and in the sifting process of a healthy memory he had forgotten the disagreeable things altogether he had found the pleasant things still in existence faded but still fragrant fresh from a land of labour unions and of struggle for wealth and power of strivings first for equality with those above and this attained for a point of vantage to look down upon former equals he had found in old peter only the day before a touching loyalty to a family from which he could no longer expect anything in return fresh from a land of womens clubs and womens claims he had reveled last night in the charming domestic life of the old south so perfectly preserved in a quiet household things southern as he had already reflected lived long and died hard and these things which he saw now in the clear light of day were also of the south and singularly suggestive of other things southern which he had supposed outlawed and discarded fong ago now mr haines bring in the next lot said the squire

the constable led out an old coloured man clad in a quaint assortment of tattered garments whom the colonel did not for a moment recognise not having from where he stood a full view of the prisoners face

 gentlemen i now call yor attention to lot number fo left over from befo the wah not much for looks but respectful and obedient and accustomed for some time past to eat very little can be made useful in many ways âcan feed the chickens take care of the children or would make a good skeercrow what i am bid gentlemen for ol peter french the amount due the cot is twentyfo dollahs and a half

there was some laughter at the squires facetiousness turner who had bid on the young and strong men turned away unconcernedly

youd a made a good auctioneer squire said the onearmed man

thank you mr pearsall how much am i offered for this bargain

 hed be dear at any price said one

its a great risk observed a second

ten yeahs said a third

youre takin big chances mr bennet said another hell die in five and youll have to bury him

i withdraw the bid said mr bennet promptly

two yeahs said another

the colonel was boiling over with indignation his interest in the fate of the other prisoners had been merely abstract in old peters case it assumed a personal aspect he forced himself into the room and to the front

may i ask the meaning of this proceeding he demanded

well suh replied the justice i dont know who you are or what right you have to interfere but this is the sale of a vagrant nigger with no visible means of suppot perhaps since youre interested youd like to bid on im are you from the noth likely

yes

 i thought suh that you looked like a nothen man that bein so doubtless youd like somethin on the uncle tom order old peters fine is twenty dollars and the costs fo dollars and a half the prisoners time is sold to whoever pays his fine and allows him the shortest time to work it out when his times up he goes free

and what has old peter done to deserve a fine of twenty dollarsâmore money than he perhaps has ever had at any one time

deed it is mars henry deed it is exclaimed peter fervently

peter has not been able replied the magistrate to show this cot that he has reglar employment or means of suppot and he was therefore tried and convicted yesterday evenin of vagrancy under our state law the fine is intended to discourage laziness and to promote industry do you want to bid suh  im offered two yeahs gentlemen for old peter french  does anybody wish to make it less

ill pay the fine said the colonel let him go

i beg yo pahdon suh but that wouldnt fulfil the requiments of the law hed be subject to arrest again immediately somebody must take the responsibility for his keep

ill look after him said the colonel shortly

 in order to keep the docket straight said the justice i should want to note yo bid how long shall i say

say what you like said the colonel drawing out his pocketbook

you dont care to bid mr turner  asked the justice

not by a damn sight replied turner with native elegance i buy niggers to work not to bury

i withdraw my bid in favour of the gentleman said the twoyear bidder

thank you said the colonel

remember suh said the justice to the colonel  that you are responsible for his keep as well as entitled to his labour for the period of your bid how long shall i make it

as long as you please said the colonel impatiently

sold said the justice bringing down his gavel for life toâwhat name suh

frenchâhenry french

there was some manifestation of interest in the crowd and the colonel was stared at with undisguised curiosity as he paid the fine and costs which included two dollars for two meals in the guardhouse and walked away with his purchaseâa purchase which his father had made upon terms not very different fifty years before

 one of the old frenches i reckon said a bystander come back on a visit

yes said another old ristocrats roun here well they ought to take keer of their old niggers they got all the good out of em when they were young but theyre not runnin things now

an hour later the colonel driving leisurely about the outskirts of the town and seeking to connect his memories more closely with the scenes around him met a buggy in which sat the man turner after the buggy tied behind one another to a rope like a coffle of slaves marched the three negroes whose time he had bought at the constables sale among them of course was the young man who had been called bud johnson the colonel observed that this negros face when turned toward the white man in front of him expressed a fierce hatred as of some wild thing of the woods which finding itself trapped and betrayed would go to any length to injure its captor

turner passed the colonel with no sign of recognition or greeting

bud johnson evidently recognised the friendly gentleman who had interfered in peters case he threw toward the colonel a look which resembled an appeal but it was involuntary and lasted but a moment and when the prisoner became conscious of it and realised its uselessness it faded into the former expression

what the mans story was the colonel did not know nor what were his deserts but the events of the day had furnished food for reflection evidently clarendon needed new light and leading men even black men with something to live for and with work at living wages would scarcely prefer an enforced servitude in ropes and chains and the punishment had scarcely seemed to fit the crime he had observed no great zeal for work among the white people since he came to town such work as he had seen done was mostly performed by negroes if idleness were a crime the negroes surely had no monopoly if it

furnished with money for his keep peter was ordered if again molested to say that he was in the colonels service the latter since his own plans were for the present uncertain had no very clear idea of what disposition he would ultimately make of the old man but he meant to provide in some way for his declining years he also bought peter a neat suit of clothes at a clothing store and directed him to present himself at the hotel on the following morning the interval would give the colonel time to find something for peter to do so that he would be able to pay him a wage to his contract with the county he attached little importance he had already intended since their meeting in the cemetery to provide for peter in some way and the legal responsibility was no additional burden to peter himself to whose homeless old age food was more than philosophy the arrangement seemed entirely satisfactory

colonel frenchs presence in clarendon had speedily become known to the public upon his return to the hotel after leaving peter to his own devices for the day he found several cards in his letter box left by gentlemen who had called during his absence to see him

the daily mail had also come in and the colonel sat down in the office to read it there was a club notice and several letters that had been readdressed and forwarded and a long one from kirby in reference to some detail of the recent transfer before he had finished reading these a gentleman came up and introduced himself he proved to be one john mc lean an old schoolmate of the colonel and later a comradeinarms though the colonel would never have recognised a rather natty major in his own regiment in this shabby middleaged man whose shoes were run down at the heel whose linen was doubtful and spotted with tobacco juice the major talked about the weather which was cool for the season about the civil war about politics and about the negroes who were very trifling the major said while they were talking upon this latter theme there was some commotion in the street in front of the hotel and looking up they saw that a horse attached to a loaded wagon had fallen in the roadway and having become entangled in the harness was kicking furiously five or six negroes were trying to quiet the animal and release him from the shafts while a dozen white men looked on and made suggestions

an illustration said the major pointing through the window toward the scene without of what weve got to contend with six niggers cant get one horse up without twice as many white men to tell them how thats why the south is behind the noth the niggers in one way or another take up most of our time and energy you folks up there have half your work done before we get ourn started

the horse pulled this way and that in obedience to the conflicting advice of the bystanders only became more and more intricately entangled he had caught one foot in a manner that threatened with each frantic jerk to result in a broken leg when the colonel leaving his visitor without ceremony ran out into the street leaned down and with a few welldirected movements released the threatened limb

now boys he said laying hold of the prostrate animal give a hand here

the negroes and after some slight hesitation one or two white men came to the colonels aid and in a moment the horse trembling and blowing was raised to its feet the driver thanked the colonel and the others who had befriended him and proceeded with his load

when the flurry of excitement was over the colonel went back to the hotel and resumed the conversation with his friend if the new franchise amendment went through said the major the negro would be eliminated from politics and the people of the south relieved of the fear of nigger domination could give their attention to better things and their section would move forward along the path of progress by leaps and bounds of himself the major said little except that he had been an alternate delegate to the last democratic national nominating convention and that he expected to run for coroner at the next county election

if i can secure the suppot of mr fetters in the primaries he said my nomination is assured and a nomination is of cose equivalent to an election but i see there are some other gentlemen that would like to talk to you and i wont take any mo of yo time at present

mrblake he said addressing a gentleman with short sidewhiskers who was approaching them have you had the pleasure of meeting colonel french

no suh said the stranger i shall be glad to have the honour of an introduction at your hands

colonel french mr blakeâmr blake colonel french you gentlemen will probably like to talk to one another because you both belong to the same party i reckon mr blake is a new man roun heahâcome down from the mountains not mo than ten yeahs ago an fetched his politics with him but since he was bom that way we dont entertain any malice against him moover hes not a black and tan republican but a lily white

yes sir said mr blake taking the colonels hand  i believe in white supremacy and the elimination of the nigger vote if the national republican party would only ignore the coloured politicians and give all the offices to white men well soon build up a strong white republican party if i had the postoffice here at clarendon with the encouragement it would give and the aid of my clerks and subodinates i could double the white republican vote in this county in six months

the major had left them together and the lily white ere he in turn made way for another caller suggested delicately that he would appreciate any good word that the colonel might be able to say for him in influential quartersâeither personally or through friends who might have the ear of the executive or those close to himâin reference to the postmastership realising that the present administration was a business one in which sentiment played small part he had secured the endorsement of the leading business men of the county even that of mr fetters himself mr fetters was of course a democrat but preferred since the office must go to a republican that it should go to a lily white

i hope to see mo of you sir he said and i take pleasure in introducing the honourable henry clay appleton editor of our local newspaper the anglosaxon he and i may not agree on free silver and the tariff but we are entirely in harmony on the subject indicated by the title of his newspaper mr appleton not only furnishes all the news thats fit to read but he represents this county in the legislature along with mr fetters and he will no doubt be the next candidate for congress from this district he can tell you all thats worth knowin about clarendon

the colonel shook hands with the editor who had come with a twofold intentâto make the visitors acquaintance and to interview him upon his impressions of the south incidentally he gave the colonel a great deal of information about local conditions these were not he admitted ideal the town was backward it needed capital to develop its resources and it needed to be rid of the fear of negro domination the suffrage in the hands of the negroes had proved a ghastly and expensive joke for all concerned and the public welfare absolutely demanded that it be taken away even the white republicans were coming around to the same point of view the new franchise amendment to the state constitution was receiving their unqualified support

that was a fine chivalrous deed of yours this morning sir he said at squire reddicks office it was just what might have been expected from a southern gentleman for we claim you colonel in spite of your long absence

yes returned the colonel i dont know what i rescued old peter from it looked pretty dark for him there for a little while i shouldnt have envied his fate had he been bought in by the tall fellow who represented your colleague in the legislature the law seems harsh

well admitted the editor i suppose it might seem harsh in comparison with your milder penal systems up north but you must consider the circumstances and make allowances for us we have so many idle ignorant negroes that something must be done to make them work or else theyll steal and to keep them in their place or they would run over us the law has been in operation only a year or two and is already having its effect ill be glad to introduce a bill for its repeal as soon as it is no longer needed

you must bear in mind too colonel that niggers dont look at imprisonment and enforced labour in the same way white people do they are not conscious of any disgrace attending stripes or the ball and chain the state is poor our white children are suffering for lack of education and yet we have to spend a large amount of money on the negro schools these convict labour contracts are a source of considerable revenue to the state they make up in fact for most of the outlay for negro educationâwhich i approve of though im frank to say that so far i dont see much good thats come from it this convict labour is humanely treated mr fetters has the contract for several counties and anybody who knows mr fetters knows that theres no kinderhearted man in the south

the colonel disclaimed any intention of criticising he had come back to his old home for a brief visit to rest and to observe he was willing to learn and anxious to please the editor took copious notes of the interview and upon his departure shook hands with the colonel cordially

the colonel had tactfully let his visitors talk while he listened or dropped a word here and there to draw them out one fact was driven home to him by every one to whom he had spoken fetters dominated the county and the town and apparently the state his namewas on every lip his influence was indispensable to every political aspirant his acquaintance was something to boast of and his good will held a promise of success and the colonel had once kicked the honourable mr fetters then plain bill in presence of an admiring audience all the way down main street from the academy to the bank bill had been to all intents and purposes a poor white boy who could not have named with certainty his own grandfather the honourable william was undoubtedly a man of great ability had the colonel remained in his native state would he have been able he wondered to impress himself so deeply upon the community would blood have been of any advantage under the changed conditions or would it have been a drawback to one who sought political advancement

when the colonel was left alone he went to look for phil who was playing with the children of the landlord in the hotel parlour commending him to the care of the negro maid in charge of them he left the hotel and called on several gentlemen whose cards he had found in his box at the clerks desk their stores and offices were within a short radius of the hotel they were all glad to see him and if there was any initial stiffness or shyness in the attitude of any one it soon became the warmest cordiality under the influence of the colonels simple and unostentatious bearing if he compared the cut of their clothes or their beards to his own to their disadvantage or if he found their views narrow and provincial he gave no sign â their hearts were warm and their welcome hearty

the colonel was not able to gather from the conversation of his friends that clarendon or any one in the townâalways excepting fetters who did not live in the town but merely overshadowed itâwas especially prosperous there were no mills or mines in the neighbourhood except a few grist mills and a sawmill the bulk of the business consisted in supplying the needs of an agricultural population and trading in their products the cotton was baled and shipped to the north and reimported for domestic use in the shape of sheeting and other stuffs the corn was shipped to the north and came back in the shape of corn meal and salt pork the staple articles of diet beefsteak and butter were brought from the north at twentyfive and fifty cents a pound respectively there were cotton merchants and corn and feed merchants there were drygoods and grocery stores drug stores and saloonsâand more saloonsâand the usual proportion of professional men since clarendon was the county seat there were of course a court house and a jail there were churches enough if all filled at once to hold the entire population of the town and preachers in proportion the merchants of whom a number were jewish periodically went into bankruptcy the majority of their customers did likewise and thus a fellowfeeling was promoted and the loss thrown back as far as possible the lands of the large farmers were mostly mortgaged either to fetters or to the bank of which he was the chief stockholder for all that could be borrowed on them while the small farmers many of whom were coloured were practically tied to the soil by ropes of debt and chains of contract

every one the colonel met during the afternoon had heard of squire reddicks good joke of the morning that he should have sold peter to the colonel for life was regarded as extremely clever some of them knew old peter and none of them had ever known any harm of him and they were unanimous in their recognition and applause of the colonels goodheartedness moreover it was an index of the colonels views he was one of them by descent and early associations but he had been away a long time and they hadnt really known how much of a yankee he might have become by his whimsical and kindly purchase of old peters timeâor of old peter as they smilingly put it he had shown his appreciation of the helplessness of the negroes and of their proper relations to the whites

whatll you do with him colonel  asked one gentleman an ole nigger like peter couldnt live in the col noth youll have to buy a place down here to keep im they wouldn let you own a nigger at the noth

the remark with the genial laugh accompanying it was sounding in the colonels ears as on the way back to the hotel he stepped into the barber shop the barber who had also heard the story was bursting with a desire to unbosom himself upon the subject knowing from experience that white gentlemen in their intercourse with coloured people were apt to be in the local phrase sometimey or uncertain in their moods he first tested with a few remarks about the weather the colonels amiability and finding him approachable proved quite talkative and confidential

while the barber babbled on with his shrewd flattery which was sincere enough to carry a reasonable amount of conviction the colonel listened with curiously mingled feelings he recalled each plank each pane of glass every inch of wall in the old house no spot was without its associations how many a brilliant scene of gaiety had taken place in the spacious parlour where bright eyes had sparkled merry feet had twinkled and young hearts beat high with love and hope and joy of living and not only joy had passed that way but sorrow in the front upper chamber his mother had died vividly he recalled as with closed eyes he lay back under the barbers skilful hand their last parting and his own poignant grief for she had been not only his mother but a woman of character who commanded respect and inspired affection a beautiful woman whom he had loved with a devotion that bordered on reverence

romance too had waved her magic wand over the old homestead his memory smiled indulgently as he recalled one scene in a corner of the broad piazza he had poured out his youthful heart one summer evening in strains of passionate devotion to his first love a beautiful woman of thirty who was visiting his mother and who had told him between smiles and tears to be a good boy and wait a little longer until he was sure of his own mind even now he breathed in memory the heavy odour of the magnolia blossoms which overhung the long wooden porch bench or jogging board on which the lady sat while he knelt on the hard floor before her he felt very young indeed after she had spoken but her caressing touch upon his hair had so stirred his heart that his vanity had suffered no wound why the family had owned the house since they had owned the cemetery lot it was hallowed by a hundred memories and nowwill you have oil on yo hair suh or bay rum  nichols exclaimed the colonel i should like to buy back the old house what do you want for it

why colonel stammered the barber somewhat taken aback at the suddenness of the offer i hadn rally thought bout sellin it you see suh ive had it now for twenty years and it suits me an my childen has growed up in itâan it kind of has associations suh in principle the colonel was an ardent democrat he believed in the rights of man and extended the doctrine to include all who bore the human form but in feeling he was an equally pronounced aristocrat a servants rights he would have defended to the last ditch familiarity he would have resented with equal positiveness something of this ancestral feeling stirred within him now while nicholss position in reference to the house was in principle equally as correct as the colonels own and superior in point of timeâsince impressions like photographs are apt to grow dim with age and nicholss were of much more recent dateâthe barbers display of sentiment only jarred the colonels sensibilities and strengthened his desire

i should advise you to speak up nichols said the colonel i had no notion of buying the place when i came in and i may not be of the same mind tomorrow name your own price but nows your time

the barber caught his breath such dispatch was unheardof in clarendon but nichols a keeneyed mulatto was a man of thrift and good sense he would have liked to consult his wife and children about the sale but to lose an opportunity to make a good profit was to fly in the face of providence the house was very old it needed shingling and painting the floors creaked the plaster on the walls was loose the chimneys needed pointing and the insurance was soon renewable he owned a smaller house in which he could live he had been told to name his price it was as much better to make it too high than too low as it was easier to come down than to go up the wouldbe purchaser was a rich man the diamond on the third finger of his left hand alone would buy a small house

i think suh he said at a bold venture that fo thousand dollars would be bout right

ill take it returned the colonel taking out his pocketbook heres fifty dollars to bind the bargain ill write a receipt for you to sign

the barber brought pen ink and paper and restrained his excitement sufficiently to keep silent while the colonel wrote a receipt embodying the terms of the contract and signed it with a steady hand

have the deed drawn up as soon as you like said the colonel as he left the shop and when it is done ill give you a draft for the money

yes suh thank you suh thank you colonel

the barber had bought the house at a tax sale at a time of great financial distress twenty years before for five hundred dollars he had made a very good sale and he lost no time in having the deed drawn up

when the colonel reached the hotel he found phil seated on the doorstep with a little bowlegged black boy and a little white dog phil who had a large heart had fraternised with the boy and fallen in love with the dog

papa he said i want to buy this dog his name is rover he can shake hands and i like him very much this little boy wants ten cents for him and i did not have the money i asked him to wait until you came may i buy him 

certainly phil here boy

the colonel threw the black boy a silver dollar phil took the dog under his arm and followed his father into the house while the other boy his glistening eyes glued to the coin in his hand scampered off as fast as his limbs would carry him he was back next morning with a pretty white kitten but the colonel discouraged any further purchases for the time being

my dear laura said the colonel when he saw his friend the same evening i have been in clarendon two days and i have already bought a dog a house and a man

miss laura was startled i dont understand she said

the colonel proceeded to explain the transaction by which he had acquired for life the services of old peter

i suppose it is the law miss laura said but it seems hardly right i had thought we were well rid of slavery white men do not work any too much old peter was not idle he did odd jobs when he could get them he was polite and respectful and it was an outrage to treat him so i am glad youâhired him

yesâhired him moreover laura i have bought a house

a house then you are going to stay i am so glad we shall all be so glad what house

the old place i went into the barber shop the barber complimented me on the family taste in architecture and grew sentimental about his associations with the house this awoke my associations and the collocation jarredâi was selfish enough to want a monopoly of the associations i bought the house from him before i left the shop

but what will you do with it asked miss laura puzzled you could never live in it againâafter a coloured family

why not it is no less the old house because the barber has reared his brood beneath its roof there were always negroes in it when we were thereâthe place swarmed with them hammer and plane soap and water paper and paint can make it new again the barber i understand is a worthy man and has reared a decent family his daughter plays the piano and sings  i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls with vassals and serfs by my side i heard her as i passed there yesterday

miss laura gave an apprehensive start

there were negroes in the house in the old days he went on unnoticing and surely a good old house gone farther astray than ours might still be redeemed to noble ends i shall renovate it and live in it while i am here and at such times as i may return or if i should tire of it i can give it to the town for a school or for a hospital âthere is none here i should like to preserve so far as i may the old associationsâmy associations the house might not fall again into hands as good as those of nichols and i should like to know that it was devoted to some use that would keep the old name alive in the community

i think henry said miss laura that if your visit is long enough you will do more for the town than if you had remained here all your life for you have lived in a wider world and acquired a broader view and you have learned new things without losing your love for the old

the deed for the house was executed on friday nichols agreeing to give possession within a week the lavishness of the purchase price was a subject of much remark in the town and nicholss good fortune was congratulated or envied according to the temper of each individual the colonels action in old peters case had made him a name for generosity his reputation for wealth was confirmed by this reckless prodigality there were some small souls of course among the lower whites who were heard to express disgust that so far only  niggers  had profited by the colonels visit the anglosaxon which came out saturday morning gave a large amount of space to colonel french and his doings indeed the two compositors had remained up late the night before setting up copy and the pressman had not reached home until three oclock the kerosene oil in the office gave out and it was necessary to rouse a grocer at midnight to replenish the supplyâso far had the advent of colonel french affected the life of the town

the anglosaxon announced that colonel henry french formerly of clarendon who had won distinction in the confederate army and since the war achieved fortune at the north had returned to visit his birthplace and his former friends the hope was expressed that colonel french who had recently sold out to a syndicate his bagging mills in connecticut might seek investments in the south whose vast undeveloped resources needed only the fructifying flow of abundant capital to make it blossom like the rose the new south the anglosaxon declared was happy to welcome capital and enterprise and hoped that colonel french might find in clarendon an agreeable residence and an attractive opening for his trained business energies that something of the kind was not unlikely might be gathered from the fact that colonel french had already repurchased from william nichols a worthy negro barber the old french mansion and had taken into his sendee a former servant of the family thus foreshadowing a renewal of local ties and a prolonged residence

the conduct of the colonel in the matter of his old servant was warmly commended the romantic circumstances of their meeting in the cemetery and the incident in the justices court which were matters of public knowledge and interest showed that in colonel french should he decide to resume his residence in clarendon his fellow citizens would find an agreeable neighbour whose sympathies would be with the south in those difficult matters upon which north and south had so often been at variance but upon which they were now rapidly becoming one in sentiment

the colonel whose active mind could not long remain unoccupied was busily engaged during the next week partly in making plans for the renovation of the old homestead partly in correspondence with kirby concerning the winding up of the loose ends of their former business thus compelled to leave phil to the care of some one else he had an excellent opportunity to utilise peters services when the old man proud of his new clothes and relieved of any responsibility for his own future first appeared at the hotel the colonel was ready with a commission

now peter he said im going to prove my confidence in you and test your devotion to the family by giving you charge of phil you may come and get him in the morning after breakfastâyou can get your meals in the hotel kitchenâand take him to walk in the streets or the cemetery but you must be very careful for he is all i have in the world in other words peter you are to take as good care of phil as you did of me when i was a little boy

ill look aftuh im mars henry lak he wuz a lump er pyo gol me an him will git along fine wont we little mars phil

yes indeed replied the child i like you uncle peter and ill be glad to go with you

phil and the old man proved excellent friends and the colonel satisfied that the boy would be well cared for gave his attention to the business of the hour as soon as nichols moved out of the old house there was a shaking of the dry bones among the mechanics of the town a small army of workmen invaded the premises and repairs and improvements of all descriptions went rapidly forward âmuch more rapidly than was usual in clarendon for the colonel let all his work by contract and by a system of forfeits and premiums kept it going at high pressure in two weeks the house was shingled painted inside and out the fences were renewed the outhouses renovated and the grounds put in order

the stream of ready money thus put into circulation by the colonel soon permeated all the channels of local enterprise the barber out of his profits began the erection of a row of small houses for coloured tenants this gave employment to masons and carpenters and involved the sale and purchase of considerable building material general trade felt the influence of the enhanced prosperity groceries drygoods stores and saloons did a thriving business the ease with which the simply organised community responded to so slight an inflow of money and energy was not without a pronounced influence upon the colonels future conduct

when his house was finished colonel french hired a housekeeper a coloured maid a cook and a coachman bought several horses and carriages and having sent to new york for his books and pictures and several articles of furniture which he had stored there began housekeeping in his own establishment succumbing willingly to the charm of old associations and entering more fully into the social life of the town he began insensibly to think of clarendon as an established residence where he would look forward to spending a certain portion of each year the climate was good for phil and to bring up the boy safely would be henceforth his chief concern in life in the atmosphere of the old town the ideas of race and blood attained a new and larger perspective it would be too bad for an old family with a fine history to die out and phil was the latest of the line and the sole hope of its continuance

the colonel was conscious somewhat guiltily conscious that he had neglected the south and all that pertained to itâexcept the market for burlaps and bagging which several southern sales agencies had attended to on behalf of his firm he was aware too that he had felt a certain amount of contempt for its poverty its quixotic devotion to lost causes and vanished ideals and a certain disgusted impatience with a people who persistently lagged behind in the march of progress and permitted a handful of upstart blatant selfseeking demagogues to misrepresent them in congress and before the country by intemperate language and persistent hostility to a humble but large and important part of their own constituency but he was glad to find that this was the mere froth upon the surface and that underneath it deep down in the hearts of the people the currents of life flowed if less swiftly not less purely than in more favoured places

the town needed an element which he could in a measure supply by residing there if for only a few weeks each year and that element was some point of contact with the outer world and its more advanced thought he might induce some of his northern friends to follow his example there were many for whom the mild climate in winter and the restful atmosphere at all seasons of the year would be a boon which correctly informed people would be eager to enjoy

of the extent to which the influence of the treadwell household had contributed to this frame of mind the colonel was not conscious he had received the freedom of the town and many hospitable doors were open to him as a single man with an interesting little motherless child he did not lack for the smiles of fair ladies of which the town boasted not a few but mrs treadwells home held the first place in his affections he had been there first and first impressions are vivid they had been kind to phil who loved them all and insisted on peters taking him there every day the colonel found pleasure in miss lauras sweet simplicity and openness of character to which graciellas vivacity and fresh young beauty formed an attractive counterpart and mrs treadwells plaintive minor note had soothed and satisfied colonel french in this emotional indian summer which marked his reaction from a long and arduous business career

in addition to a pronounced attractiveness of form and feature miss graciella treadwell possessed a fine complexion a clear eye and an elastic spirit she was also well endowed with certain other characteristics of youth among them ingenuousness which if it be a fault experience is sure to correct and impulsiveness which even the school of hard knocks is not always able to eradicate though it may chasten to the good points of graciella could be added an untroubled conscience at least up to that period when colonel french dawned upon her horizon and for some time thereafter if she had put herself foremost in all her thoughts it had been the unconscious egotism of youth with no definite purpose of selfseeking the things for which she wished most were associated with distant places and her longing for them had never taken the form of envy of those around her indeed envy is scarcely a vice of youth it is a weed that flourishes best after the flower of hope has begun to wither graciellas views of life even her youthful romanticism were sane and healthful but since she had not been tried in the furnace of experience it could only be said of her that she j belonged to the class always large but shifting like the sands of the sea who have never been tempted and therefore do not know whether they would sin or not

it was inevitable with such a nature as graciellas in such an embodiment that the time should come at some important crisis of her life when she must choose between different courses nor was it likely that she could avoid what comes sometime to all of us the necessity of choosing between good and evil her liking for colonel french had grown since their first meeting he knew so many things that graciella wished to know that when he came to the house she spent a great deal of time in conversation with him her aunt laura was often busy with household duties and graciella as the least employed member of the family was able to devote herself to his entertainment colonel french a comparatively idle man at this period found her prattle very amusing

it was not unnatural for graciella to think that this acquaintance might be of future value she could scarcely have thought otherwise if she should ever go to new york a rich and powerful friend would be well worth having should her going there be delayed very long she would nevertheless have a tie of friendship in the great city and a source to which she might at any time apply for information her fondness for colonel frenchs society was however up to a certain time entirely spontaneous and coloured by no ulterior purpose her hope that his friendship might prove valuable was an afterthought

it was during this happy period that she was standing one day by the garden gate when colonel french passed by in his fine new trap driving a spirited horse and it was with perfect candour that she waved her hand to him familiarly

would you like a drive he called

wouldnt i  she replied wait till i tell the folks

she was back in a moment and ran out of the gate and down the steps the colonel gave her his hand and she sprang up beside him

they drove through the cemetery and into the outlying part of the town where there were some shaded woodland stretches it was a pleasant afternoon cloudy enough to hide the sun graciellas eyes sparkled and her cheek glowed with pleasure while her light brown hair blown about her face by the breeze of their rapid motion was like an aureole

colonel french she said as they were walking the horse up a hill are you going to give a house warming

why he said i hadnt thought of it ought i to give a house warming

you surely ought everybody will want to see your house while it is new and bright you certainly ought to have a house warming

very well said the colonel i make it a rule to shirk no plain duty if i ought to have a house warming i will have it and you shall be my social mentor what sort of a party shall it be

why not make it she said brightly just such a party as your father would have had you have the old house and the old furniture give an oldtime party

in fitting up his house the colonel had been animated by the same feeling that had moved him to its purchase he had endeavoured to restore as far as possible the interior as he remembered it in his childhood at his fathers death the furniture had been sold and scattered he had been able through the kindly interest of his friends to recover several of the pieces others that were lost past hope had been reproduced from their description among those recovered was a fine pair of brass andirons and his fathers mahogany desk which had been purchased by major treadwell at the sale of the elder frenchs effects

miss laura had been the first to speak of the desk

henry she had said the house would not be complete without your fathers desk it was my fathers too but yours is the prior claim take it as a gift from me

he protested and would have paid for it liberally and when she would take nothing declared he would not accept it on such terms

you are selfish henry she replied with a smile you have brought a new interest into our lives and into the town and you will not let us make you any return

but i am taking from you something you need he replied and for which you paid when major treadwell bought it it was merely secondhand furniture sold under the hammer now it has the value of an antiqueâ it is a fine piece and could be sold in new york for a large sum

you must take it for nothing or not at all she replied firmly

it is highway robbery he said and could not make up his mind to yield

next day when the colonel went home after having been down town an hour he found the desk in his library the treadwell ladies had corrupted peter who had told them when the colonel would be out of the house and had brought a cart to take the desk away

when the house was finished the interior was simple but beautiful it was furnished in the style that had been prevalent fifty years before there were some modem additions in the line of comfort and luxuryâsoft chairs fine rugs and a few choice books and picturesâfor the colonel had not attempted to conform his own tastes and habits to those of his father he had some visitors mostly gentlemen and there was as graciella knew a lively curiosity among the ladies to see the house and its contents

the suggestion of a house warming had come originally from mrs treadwell but graciella had promptly made it her own and conveyed it to the colonel

a bright idea he replied  by all means let it be an oldtime partyâsay such a party as my father would have given or ray grandfather and shall we invite the old people well replied graciella judicially dont have them so old that they cant talk or hear and must be fed with a spoon if there were too many old or not enough young people i shouldnt enjoy myself

 i suppose i seem awfully old to you said the colonel parenthetically

oh i dont know replied graciella giving him a frankly critical look when you first came i thought you were rather oldâyou see you are older than aunt laura but you seem to have grown youngerâits curious but its trueâand now i hardly think of you as old at all the colonel was secretly flattered the wisest man over forty likes to be thought young

very well he said you shall select the guests

at an oldtime party continued graciella thoughtfully  the guests should wear oldtime clothes in grandmothers time the ladies wore long flowing sleeves

and hoopskirts said the colonel

and their hair down over their ears

or in ringlets

yes it is all in grandmothers bound volume of the ladies book said graciella i was reading it only last week

my mother took it returned the colonel

then you must have read letters from a pastry cook by n p willis when they came out

no said the colonel with a sigh i missed that i âi wasnt able to read then

graciella indulged in a brief mental calculation

why of course not she laughed you werent even born when they came out  but theyre fine ill lend you our copy you must ask all the girls to dress as their mothers and grandmothers used to dress make the requirement elastic because some of them may not have just the things for one particular period im all right we have a cedar chest in the attic full of old things wont i look funny in a hoop skirt

youll look charming in anything said the colonel

it was a pleasure to pay graciella compliments she so frankly enjoyed them and the colonel loved to make others happy in his new york firm mr french was always ready to consider a request for an advance of salary kirby had often been obliged to play the wicked partner in order to keep expenses down to a normal level at parties debutantes had always expected mr french to say something pleasant to them and had rarely been disappointed

the subject of the party was resumed next day at mrs treadwells where the colonel went in the afternoon to call

an oldtime party declared the colonel should have oldtime amusements we must have a fiddler a black fiddler to play quadrilles and the virginia reel

i dont know where youll find one said miss laura

ill ask peter replied the colonel he ought to know

peter was in the yard with phil lawd mars henry said peter fiddlers is mighty scace dese days but i reckon ole poleon campbell kin make you shake yo feet yit ef ole man rheumatiz ain ketched holt er im too tight

and i will play a minuet on your new piano said miss laura  and teach the girls beforehand how to dance it there should be cards for those who do not dance

so the party was arranged miss laura graciella and the colonel made out the list of guests the invitations were duly sent out for an oldtime party with oldtime costumesâany period between  and  permissibleâand oldtime entertainment

the announcement created some excitement in social circles and like all of colonel frenchs enterprises at that happy period of his homecoming brought prosperity in its train dressmakers were kept busy making and altering costumes for the ladies old archie christmas the mulatto tailor sole survivor of a once flourishing craftâ mr cohens universal emporium supplied the general public with readymade clothing and twice a year the travelling salesman of a new york tailoring firm visited clarendon with samples of suitings and took orders and measurementsâold archie christmas who had not made a full suit of clothes for years was able by making and altering mens garments for the colonels party to earn enough to keep himself alive for another twelve months old peter was at archies shop one day and they were talking about old timesâgood old timesâfor to old men old times are always good times though history may tell another tale

yo boss is a godsen ter dis town declared old archie he sho is de wite folks says de young niggers is triflin cause dey don larn how to do nothin but what is dere fer em to do  i kin member when dis town was full er black an yallercarpenters an jiners blacksmiths wagon makers shoemakers tinners saddlers an cabnet makers now all de funicher de shoes de wagons de buggies de tinware de hoss shoes de nails to fasten em on widâyas an fo de lawd even de clothes dat folks wears on dere backs is made at de norf an dere ain nothin lef fer de ole niggers ter do let lone de young ones yo boss is de right kin i hopes hell stay roun here till you an me dies

i hopes wid you said peter fervently i sho does yas indeed i does

peter was entirely sincere never in his life had he worn such good clothes eaten such good food or led so easy a life as in the colonels service even the old times paled by comparison with this new golden age and the long years of poverty and hard luck that stretched behind him seemed to the old man like a distant and unpleasant dream

the party came off at the appointed time and was a distinct success graciella had made a raid on the cedar chest and shone resplendent in crinoline curls and a patterned muslin together with miss laura and ben dudley who had come in from mink run for the party she was among the first to arrive miss lauras costume which belonged to an earlier date was in keeping with her quiet dignity ben wore a suit of his uncles which the care of old aunt viney had preserved wonderfully well from moth and dust through the years the men wore stocks and neckcloths bellbottomed trousers with straps under their shoes and frock coats very full at the top and buttoned tightly at the waist old peter in a long blue coat with brass buttons acted as butler helped by a young negro who did the heavy work miss lauras servant catherine had rallied from her usual gloom and begged the privilege of acting as ladys maid poleon campbell an oldtime negro fiddler whom peter had resurrected from some obscure cabin oiled his rheumatic joints tuned his fiddle and rosined his bow and under the inspiration of good food and drink and liberal wage played through his whole repertory which included such ancient favourites as fishers hornpipe soldiers joy chicken in the breadtray and the campbells are coming miss laura played a minuet which the young people danced major mc lean danced the highland fling and some of the ladies sang oldtime songs and war lyrics which stirred the heart and moistened the eyes

little phil in a childs costume of  copied from the ladies book was petted and made much of for several hours until he became sleepy and was put to bed

 graciella said the colonel to his young friend during the evening our party is a great success it was your idea when it is all over i want to make you a present in token of my gratitude you shall select it yourself it shall be whatever you say

graciella was very much elated at this mark of the colonels friendship she did not dream of declining the proffered token and during the next dance her mind was busily occupied with the question of what it should beâ a ring a bracelet a bicycle a set of books  she needed a dozen things and would have liked to possess a dozen others

she had not yet decided when ben came up to claim her for a dance on his appearance she was struck by a sudden idea colonel french was a man of affairs in new york he must have a wide circle of influential acquaintances old mr dudley was in failing health he might die at any time and ben would then be free to seek employment a way from clarendon what better place for him than new york with a position there he would be able to marry her and take her there to live

this she decided should be her request of the colonel âthat he should help her lover to a place in new york

her conclusion was really magnanimous she might profit by it in the end but ben would be the first beneficiary it was an act of selfdenial for she was giving up a definite and certain good for a future contingency

she was therefore in a pleasant glow of selfcongratulatory mood when she accidentally overheard a conversation not intended for her ears she had run out to the diningroom to speak to the housekeeper about the refreshments and was returning through the hall when she stopped for a moment to look into the library where those who did not care to dance were playing cards

beyond the door with their backs turned toward her sat two ladies engaged in conversation one was a widow a wellknown gossip and the other a wife known to be unhappily married they were no longer young and their views were marked by the cynicism of seasoned experience

oh theres no doubt about it said the widow he came down here to find a wife he tried a yankee wife and didnt like the breed and when he was ready for number two he came back south

he showed good taste said the other

that depends said the widow upon whom he chooses he can probably have his pick

no doubt rejoined the married lady with a touch of sarcasm which the widow who was still under forty chose to ignore

i wonder which is it said the widow i suppose its laura he spends a great deal of time there and shes devoted to his little boy or pretends to be

dont fool yourself replied the other earnestly and not without a subdued pleasure in disabusing the widows mind dont fool yourself my dear a man of his age doesnt marry a woman of laura treadwells believe me its the little one

but she has a beau theres that tall nephew of old mr dudleys hes been hanging around her for a year or two he looks very handsome tonight

ah well shell dispose of him fast enough when the time comes hes only a poor stick the last of a good stock run to seed why shes been pointedly setting her cap at the colonel all the evening hes perfectly infatuated he has danced with her three times to once with laura

 its sad to see a man make a fool of himself sighed the widow who was not without some remnants of beauty and a heart still warm and willing children are very forward nowadays

theres no fool like an old fool my dear replied the other with the cheerful philosophy of the miserable who love company these fair women are always selfish and calculating and shes a bold piece my husband says colonel french is worth at least a million a young wife who understands her business could get anything from him that money can buy

what a pity my dear said the widow with a spice of malice seeing her own opportunity what a pity that you were older than your husband  well it will be fortunate for the child if she marries an old man for beauty of her type fades early

old poleons fiddle to which one of the guests was improvising an accompaniment on the colonels new piano had struck up camptown races and the rollicking lilt of the chorus was resounding through the house

 gwine ter run all night gwine ter run all day ill bet my money on de bobtail nag oh whos gwine ter bet on de bay  

ben ran out into the hall graciella had changed her position and was sitting alone perturbed in mind

come on graciella lets get into the virginia reel its the last one

graciella obeyed mechanically ben on the contrary was unusually animated he had enjoyed the party better than any he had ever attended he had not been at many

colonel french who had entered with zest into the spirit of the occasion participated in the reel every time graciella touched his hand it was with the consciousness of a new element in their relations until then her friendship for colonel french had been perfectly ingenuous she had liked him because he was interesting and good to her in a friendly way now she realised that he was a millionaire eligible for marriage from whom a young wife if she understood her business might secure the gratification of every wish

the serpent had entered eden graciella had been tendered the apple she must choose now whether she would eat

when the party broke up the colonel was congratulated on every hand he had not only given his guests a delightful evening he had restored an ancient landmark had recalled to a people whose life lay mostly in the past the glory of days gone by and proved his loyalty to their cherished traditions

ben dudley walked home with graciella miss laura went ahead of them with catherine who was cheerful in the possession of a substantial reward for her services

youre not sayin much tonight said ben to his sweetheart as they walked along under the trees

graciella did not respond

youre not sayin much tonight he repeated

yes returned graciella abstractedly it was a lovely party

ben said no more the house warming had also given him food for thought he had noticed the colonels attentions to graciella and had heard them remarked upon colonel french was more than old enough to be graciellas father but he was rich graciella was poor and ambitious bens only assets were youth and hope and priority in the field his only claim

miss laura and catherine had gone in and when the young people came to the gate the light still shone through the open door

graciella he said taking her hand in his as they stood a moment will you marry me

still harping on the same old string she said withdrawing her hand im tired now ben too tired to talk foolishness

very well ill save it for next time good night sweetheart

she had closed the gate between them he leaned over it to kiss her but she evaded his caress and ran lightly up the steps

good night ben she called

good night sweetheart he replied with a pang of foreboding

in after years when the colonel looked back upon his residence in clarendon this seemed to him the golden moment there were other times that stirred deeper emotionsâthe lust of battle the joy of victory the chagrin of defeatâmoments that tried his soul with tests almost too hard but thus far his new career in clarendon had been one of pleasant experiences only and this unclouded hour was its fitting crown

whenever the colonel visited the cemetery or took a walk in that pleasant quarter of the town he had to cross the bridge from which was visible the site of the old eureka cotton mill of his boyhood and it was not difficult to recall that it had been before the war a busy hive of industry on a narrow and obscure street little more than an alley behind the cemetery there were still several crumbling tenements built for the mill operatives but now occupied by a handful of abjectly poor whites who kept body and soul together through the doubtful mercy of god and a small weekly dole from the poormaster the mill pond while not widespreading had extended back some distance between the sloping banks and had furnished swimming holes fishing holes and what was more to the point at present a very fine head of water which as it struck the colonel more forcibly each time he saw it offered an opportunity that the town could ill afford to waste shrewd minds in the cotton industry had long ago conceived the idea that the south by reason of its nearness to the source of raw material its abundant water power and its cheaper labour partly due to the smaller cost of living in a mild climate and the absence of labour agitation was destined in time to rival and perhaps displace new england in cotton manufacturing many southern mills were already in successful operation but from lack of capital or lack of enterprise nothing of the kind had ever been undertaken in clarendon although the town was the centre of a cottonraising district and there was a mill in an adjoining county men who owned land mortgaged it for money to raise cotton men who rented land from others mortgaged their crops for the same purpose

it was easy to borrow money in clarendonâon adequate securityâat ten per cent and mr fetters the magnate of the county was always ready the colonel had learned to accommodate the needy who could give such security he had also discovered that fetters was acquiring the greater part of the land many a farmer imagined that he owned a farm when he was actually merely a tenant of fetters occasionally fetters foreclosed a mortgage when there was plainly no more to be had from it and bought in the land which he added to his own holdings in fee but as a rule he found it more profitable to let the borrower retain possession and pay the interest as nearly as he could the estate would ultimately be good for the debt if the debtor did not live too longâworry might be counted upon to shorten his daysâand the loan with interest could be more conveniently collected at his death to bankrupt an estate was less personal than to break an individual and widows and orphans still in their minority did not vote and knew little about business methods

to a man of action like the colonel the frequent contemplation of the unused water power which might so easily be harnessed to the car of progress gave birth in time to a wish to see it thus utilised and the further wish to stir to labour the idle inhabitants of the neighbourhood in all work the shiftless methods of an older generation still survived no one could do anything in a quarter of an hour nearly all tasks were done by negroes who had forgotten how to work or by white people who had never learned but the colonel had already seen the reviving effect of a little money directed by a little energy and so he planned to build a new and larger cotton mill where the old had stood to shake up this lethargic community toput its people to work and to teach them habits of industry efficiency and thrift this he imagined would be pleasant occupation for his vacation as well as a true missionary enterpriseâa contribution to human progress such a cotton mill would require only an inconsiderable portion of his capital the body of which would be left intact for investment elsewhere it would not interfere at all with his freedom of movement for once built equipped and put in operation under a competent manager it would no more require his personal oversight than had the new england bagging mills which his firm had conducted for so many years

from impulse to action was for the colonels temperament an easy step and he had scarcely moved into his house before he quietly set about investigating the title to the old mill site it had been forfeited many years before he found to the state for nonpayment of taxes there having been no demand for the property at any time since it had never been sold but held as a sort of lapsed asset subject to sale but open also so long as it remained unsold to redemption upon the payment of back taxes and certain fees the amount of these was ascertained it was considerably less than the fair value of the property which was therefore redeemable at a profit

the owners however were widely scattered for the mill had belonged to a jointstock company composed of a dozen or more members colonel french was pleasantly surprised upon looking up certain musty public records in the court house to find that he himself was the owner by inheritance of several shares of stock which had been overlooked in the sale of his fathers property retaining the services of judge bullard the leading member of the clarendon bar he set out quietly to secure options upon the other shares this involved an extensive correspondence which occupied several weeks for it was necessary first to find and then to deal with the scattered representatives of the former owners

in engaging judge bullard the colonel had merely stated to the lawyer that he thought of building a cottonmill but had said nothing about his broader plan it was very likely he recognised that the people of clarendon might not relish the thought that they were regarded as fit subjects for reform he knew that they were sensitive and quick to resent criticism if some of them might admit now and then among themselves that the town was unprogressive or declining there was always some extraneous reason givenâthe war the carpetbaggers the fifteenth amendment the negroes perhaps not one of them had ever quite realised the awful handicap of excuses under which they laboured effort was paralysed where failure was so easily explained

that the condition of the town might be due to causes within itselfâto the general ignorance selfsatisfaction and lack of enterprise had occurred to only a favoured few the younger of these had moved away seeking a broader outlook elsewhere while those who remained were not yet strong enough nor brave enough to break with the past and urge new standards of thought and feeling

so the colonel kept his larger purpose to himself until a time when greater openness would serve to advance it thus judge bullard not being able to read his clients mind assumed very naturally that the contemplated enterprise was to be of a purely commercial nature directed to making the most money in the shortest time

some day colonel he said with this thought in mind you might get a few pointers by running over to carthage and looking through the excelsior mills they get more work there for less money than anywhere else in the south last year they declared a forty per cent dividend i know the superintendent and will give you a letter of introduction whenever you like

the colonel bore the matter in mind and one morning a day or two after his party set out by train about eight oclock in the morning for carthage armed with a letter from the lawyer to the superintendent of the mills

the town was only forty miles away but a cow had been caught in a trestle across a ditch and some time was required for the train crew to release her another stop was made in the middle of a swamp to put off a light mulatto who had presumed on his complexion to ride in the white peoples car he had been successfully spotted but had impudently refused to go into the stuffy little closet provided at the end of the car for people of his class he was therefore given an opportunity to reflect during a walk along the ties upon his true relation to society another stop was made for a gentleman who had sent a negro boy ahead to flag the train and notify the conductor that he would be along in fifteen or twenty minutes with a couple of lady passengers a hot journal caused a further delay these interruptions made it eleven oclock a threehours run before the train reached carthage

the town was much smaller than clarendon it comprised a public square of several acres in extent on one side of which was the railroad station and on another the court house one of the remaining sides was occupied by a row of shops the fourth straggled off in various directions the whole wore a neglected air bales of cotton goods were piled on the platform apparently just unloaded from wagons standing near several white men and negroes stood around and stared listlessly at the train and the few who alighted from it

inquiring its whereabouts from one of the bystanders the colonel found the nearest hotelâa twostory frame structure with a piazza across the front extending to the street line there was a buggy standing in front its horse hitched to one of the piazza posts steps led up from the street but one might step from the buggy to the floor of the piazza which was without a railing

the colonel mounted the steps and passed through the door into a small room which he took for the hotel office since there were chairs standing against the walls and at one side a table on which a register lay open the only person in the room beside himself was a young man seated near the door with his feet elevated to the back of another chair reading a newspaper from which he did not look up

the colonel who wished to make some inquiries and to register for the dinner which he might return to take looked around him for the clerk or some one in authority but no one was visible while waiting he walked over to the desk and turned over the leaves of the dogeared register he recognised only one nameâthat of mr william fetters who had registered there only a day or two before

no one had yet appeared the young man in the chair was evidently not connected with the establishment his expression was so forbidding not to say arrogant and his absorption in the newspaper so complete that the colonel not caring to address him turned to the right and crossed a narrow hall to a room beyond evidently a parlour since it was fitted up with a faded ingrain carpet a centre table with a red plush photograph album and several enlarged crayon portraits hung near the ceilingâof the kind made free of charge in chicago from photographs provided the owner orders a frame from the company no one was in the room and the colonel had turned to leave it when he came face to face with a lady passing through the hall

are you looking for some one she asked amiably having noted his air of inquiry

why yes madam replied the colonel removing his hat i was looking for the proprietorâor the clerk

 why she replied smiling  thats the proprietor sitting there in the office im going in to speak to him and you can get his attention at the same time

their entrance did not disturb the young mans reposeful attitude which remained as unchanged as that of a graven image nor did he exhibit any consciousness at their presence

i want a clean towel mr dickson said the lady sharply

the proprietor looked up with an annoyed expression

 huh  he demanded in a tone of resentment mingled with surprise

a clean towel if you please

the proprietor said nothing more to the lady nor deigned to notice the colonel at all but lifted his legs down from the back of the chair rose with a sigh left the room and returned in a few minutes with a towel which he handed ungraciously to the lady then still paying no attention to the colonel he resumed his former attitude and returned to the perusal of his newspaper âcertainly the most unconcerned of hotel keepers thought the colonel as a vision of spacious lobbies liveried porters and obsequious clerks rose before his vision he made no audible comment however but merely stared at the young man curiously left the hotel and inquired of a passing negro the whereabouts of the livery stable a few minutes later he found the place without difficulty and hired a horse and buggy

while the stable boy was putting the harness on the horse the colonel related to the liveryman whose manner was energetic and businesslike and who possessed an open countenance and a sympathetic eye his experience at the hotel

oh yes was the reply thats lee dickson all over that hotel used to be kep by his mother she was a widow woman an ever since she died a couple of months ago lees been playin the big man spendin the old ladys money and enjoyin himself did you see that hossnbuggy hitched in front of the hotel 

yes

well thats lees buggy he hires it from us we send it up every mornin at nine oclock when lee gits up when hes had his breakfas he comes out an gits in the buggy an drives to the barbershop nex door gits out goes in an gits shaved comes out climbs in the buggy an drives back to the hotel then he talks to the cook comes out an gits in the buggy an drives halfway long that side of the square about twro hunded feet to the grocery sto and orders half a pound of coffee or a pound of lard or whatever the hotel needs for the day then comes out climbs in the buggy and drives back when the mail comes in if hes expectin any mail he drives cross the square to the postoffice an then drives back to the hotel theres other lazy men roun here but lee dickson takes the cake however its money in our pocket as long as it keeps up

i shouldnt think it would keep up long returned the colonel  how can such a hotel prosper  

it dont replied the liveryman but its the best in town

i dont see how there could be a worse said the colonel

there couldntâits reached bed rock

the buggy was ready by this time and the colonel set out with a black driver to find the excelsior cotton mills they proved to be situated in a desolate sandhill region several miles out of town the day was hot the weather had been dry and the road was deep with a yielding white sand into which the buggy tires sank the horse soon panted with the heat and the exertion and the colonel dressed in brown linen took off his hat and mopped his brow with his handkerchief the driver a taciturn negroâmost of the loquacious funloving negroes of the colonels youth seemed to have disappearedâflicked a horsefly now and then with his whip from the horses sweating back

the first sign of the mill was a straggling group of small frame houses built of unpainted pine lumber the barren soil which would not have supported a firm lawn was dotted with scraggy bunches of wiregrass in the open doorways through which the flies swarmed in and out grown men some old some still in the prime of life were lounging pipe in mouth while old women pottered about the yards or pushed back their sunbonnets to stare vacantly at the advancing buggy dirty babies were tumbling about the cabins there was a lean and listless yellow dog or two for every baby and several slatternly black women were washing clothes on the shady sides of the houses a general air of shiftlessness and squalor pervaded the settlement there was no sign of joyous childhood or of happy youth

a turn in the road brought them to the mill the distant hum of which had already been audible it was a twostory brick structure with many windows altogether of the cheapest construction but situated on the bank of a stream and backed by a noble water power

they drew up before an open door at one corner of the building the colonel alighted entered and presented his letter of introduction the superintendent glanced at him keenly but after reading the letter greeted him with a show of cordiality and called a young man to conduct the visitor through the mill

the guide seemed in somewhat of a hurry and reticent of speech nor was the noise of the machinery conducive to conversation some of the colonels questions seemed unheard and others were imperfectly answered yet the conditions disclosed by even such an inspection were to the colonel a revelation through air thick with flying particles of cotton pale anaemic young women glanced at him curiously with lackluster eyes or eyes in which the gleam was not that of health or hope or holiness wizened children who had never known the joys of childhood worked side by side at long rows of spools to which they must give unremitting attention most of the women were using snuff the odour of which was mingled with the flying particles of cotton while the floor was thickly covered with unsightly brown splotches

when they had completed the tour of the mills and returned to the office the colonel asked some questions of the manager about the equipment the output and the market which were very promptly and courteously answered to those concerning hours and wages the replies were less definite and the colonel went away impressed as much by what he had not learned as by what he had seen

while settling his bill at the lively stable he made further inquiries

lord yes said the liveryman in answer to one of them  i can tell you all you want to know about that mill talk about nigger slaveryâthe niggers never were worked like white women and children are in them mills they work em from twelve to sixteen hours a day for from fifteen to fifty cents them triflin old pinelanders out there jus lay aroun and raise children for the mills and then set down and chaw tobacco an live on their childrens wages its a sin an a shame an there ought to be a law aginst it

the conversation brought out the further fact that vice was rampant among the millhands

an it aint surprisin said the liveryman with indignation tempered by the easy philosophy of hot climates shut up in jail all day an half the night never breathin the pyo air or baskin in gods bright sunshine with no books to read an no chance to learn who can blame the por things if they have a little joy in the only way they know

who owns the mill asked the colonel

it belongs to a company was the reply but old bill fetters owns a majority of the stockâdurn him

the colonel felt a thrill of pleasureâhe had met a man after his own heart

 you are not one of fetterss admirers then  he asked

not by a dum sight returned the liveryman promptly when i look at them white gals that ought to be rosycheeked an brighteyed an plump an hearty an happy an them po little childen that never get a chance to go fishin or swimmin or to learn anything i allow i wouldn mind if the durned old mill would catch fire an burn down they work children there from slx years old up an half of em die of consumption before theyre grown its a durned outrage an if i ever go to the legislatur for which i mean to run ill try to have it stopped

i hope you will be elected said the colonel what time does the train go back to clarendon

four oclock if shes on timeâbut it may be five do you suppose i can get dinner at the hotel

oh yes  i sent word up that i lowed you might be back so theyll be expectin you

the proprietor was at the desk when the colonel went in he wrote his name on the book and was served with an execrable dinner he paid his bill of half a dollar to the taciturn proprietor and sat down on the shady porch to smoke a cigar the proprietor having put the money in his pocket came out and stepped into his buggy which was still standing alongside the piazza the colonel watched him drive a stones throw to a barroom down the street get down go in come out a few minutes later wiping his mouth with the back of his hand climb into the buggy drive back step out and reenter the hotel

it was yet an hour to train time and the colonel to satisfy an impulse of curiosity strolled over to the court house which could be seen across the square through the trees requesting leave of the clerk in the county recorders office to look at the records of mortgages he turned the leaves over and found that a large proportion of the mortgages recently recordedâamong them one on the hotel propertyâhad been given to fetters

the whistle of the train was heard in the distance as the colonel recrossed the square glancing toward the hotel he saw the landlord come out drive across the square to the station and sit there until the passengers had alighted to a drummer with a sample case he pointed carelessly across the square to the hotel but made no movement to take the baggage and as the train moved off the colonel looking back saw him driving back to the hotel

fetters had begun to worry the colonel he had never seen the man and yet his influence was everywhere he seemed to brood over the country round about like a great vampire bat sucking the lifeblood of the people his touch meant blight as soon as a fetters mortgage rested on a place the property began to run down for why should the nominal owner keep up a place which was destined in the end to go to fetters the colonel had heard grewsome tales of fetterss convict labour plantation he had seen the operation of fetterss cottonmill where white humanity in its fairest and tenderest form was stunted and blighted and destroyed and he had not forgotten the scene in the justices office

the fighting blood of the old frenches was stirred the colonels means were abundant he did not lack the sinews of war clarendon offered a field for profitable investment he would like to do something for humanity something to offset fetters and his kind who were preying upon the weaknesses of the people enslaving white and black alike in a great city what he could give away would have been but a slender stream scarcely felt in the rivers of charity poured into the ocean of want and even his considerable wealth would have made him only a small stockholder in some great aggregation of capital in this backward old town away from the great centres of commerce and scarcely feeling their distant pulsebeat except when some daring speculator tried for a brief period to corner the cotton market he could mark with his own eyes the good he might accomplish it required no great stretch of imagination to sec the town a few years hence a busy hive of industry where no man and no woman obliged to work need be without employment at fair wages where the trinity of peace prosperity and progress would reign supreme where men like fetters and methods like his would no longer be tolerated the forces of enlightenment set in motion by his aid and supported by just laws should engage the retrogade forces represented by fetters communities like men must either grow or decay advance or decline they could not stand still clarendon was decaying fetters was the parasite which by sending out its roots toward rich and poor alike struck at both extremes of society and was choking the life of the town like a rank and deadly vine

the colonel could if need be spare the year or two of continuous residence needed to rescue clarendon from the grasp of fetters the climate agreed with phil who was growing like a weed and the colonel could easily defer for a little while his scheme of travel and the further disposition of his future

so when he reached home that night he wrote an answer to a long and gossipy letter received from kirby about that time in which the latter gave a detailed account of what was going on in the colonels favourite club and among their mutual friends and reported progress in the search for some venture worthy of their mettle the colonel replied that phil and he were well that he was interesting himself in a local enterprise which would certainly occupy him for some months and that he would not visit new york during the summer unless it were to drop in for a day or two on business and return immediately

a letter from mrs jerviss received about the same time was less easily disposed of she had learned from kirby of the chivalrous manner in which mr french had protected her interests and spared her feelings in the fight with consolidated bagging she had not been able she said to thank him adequately before he went away because she had not known how much she owed him nor could she fittingly express herself on paper she could only renew her invitation to him to join her house party at newport in july the guests would be friends of hisâshe would be glad to invite any others that he might suggest she would then have the opportunity to thank him in person

the colonel was not unmoved by this frank and grateful letter and he knew perfectly well what reward he might claim from her gratitude had the letter come a few weeks sooner it might have had a different answer but now after the first pang of regret his only problem was how to refuse gracefully her offered hospitality he was sorry he replied not to be able to join her house party that summer but during the greater part of it he would be detained in the south by certain matters into which he had been insensibly drawn as for her thanks she owed him none he had only done his duty and had already been thanked too much

so thoroughly had colonel french entered into the spirit of his yet undefined contest with fetters that his life in new york save when these friendly communications recalled it seemed far away and of slight retrospective interest every one knows of the blind spot in the field of vision new york was for the time being the colonels blind spot that it might reassert its influence was always possible but for the present new york was of no more interest to him than canton or bogota having revelled for a few pleasant weeks in memories of a remoter past the reaction had projected his thoughts forward into the future his life in new york and in the clarendon of the presentâthese were mere transitory embodiments he lived in the clarendon yet to be a clarendon rescued from fetters purified rehabilitated and no compassionate angel warned him how tenacious of life that which fetters stood for might beâthat survival of the spirit of slavery under which the land still groaned and travailedâthe growth of generations which it would take more than one generation to destroy

in describing to judge bullard his visit to the cotton mill the colonel was not sparing of his indignation

the men he declared with emphasis who are responsible for that sort of thing are enemies of mankind ive been in business for twenty years but i have never sought to make money by trading on the souls and bodies of women and children i saw the little darkies running about the streets down there at carthage they were poor and ragged and dirty but they were out in the air and the sunshine they have a chance to get their growth to go to school and learn something the white children are worked worse than slaves and are growing up dulled and stunted physically and mentally our folks down here are mighty shortsighted judge well wake them up well build a model cotton mill and run it with decent hours and decent wages and treat the operatives like human beings with bodies to nourish minds to develop and souls to save fetters and his crowd will have to come up to our standard or else well take their hands away

judge bullard had looked surprised when the colonel began his denunciation and though he said little his expression when the colonel had finished was very thoughtful and not altogether happy

it was the week after the colonels house warming

graciella was not happy she was sitting erect and graceful as she always sat on the top step of the piazza ben dudley occupied the other end of the step his model stood neglected beside him and he was looking straight at graciella whose eyes avoiding his were bent upon a copy of jane eyre held open in her hand there was an unwonted silence between them which ben was the first to break

will you go for a walk with me he asked

im sorry ben she replied but i have an engagement to go driving with colonel french

bens dark cheek grew darker and he damned colonel french softly beneath his breath he could not ask graciella to drive for their old buggy was not fit tow be seen and he had no money to hire a better one the only reason why he ever had wanted money was because of her if she must have money or the things that money alone would buy he must get money or lose her as long as he had no rival there was hope but could he expect to hold his own against a millionaire who had the garments and the manners of the great outside world

i suppose the colonels here every night as well as every day he said and that you talk to him all the time

no ben he isnt here every night nor every day his old darky peter brings phil over every day but when the colonel comes he talks to grandmother and aunt laura as well as to me

graciella had risen from the step and was now enthroned in a splintbottomed armchair an attitude more in keeping with the air of dignity which she felt constrained to assume as a cloak for an uneasy conscience

graciella was not happy she had reached the parting of the ways and realised that she must choose between them and yet she hesitated every consideration of prudence dictated that she choose colonel french rather than ben the colonel was rich and could gratify all her ambitions there could be no reasonable doubt that he was fond of her and she had heard it said by those more experienced than she and therefore better qualified to judge that he was infatuated with her certainly he had shown her a great deal of attention he had taken her driving he had lent her books and music he had brought or sent the new york paper every day for her to read

he had been kind to her aunt laura too probably for her nieces sake for the colonel was kind by nature and wished to make everyone about him happy it was fortunate that her aunt laura was fond of philip if she should decide to marry the colonel she would have her aunt laura come and make her home with them she could give philip the attention with which his stepmothers social duties might interfere it was hardly likely that her aunt entertained any hope of marriage indeed miss laura had long since professed herself resigned to old maidenhood

but in spite of these rosy dreams graciella was not happy to marry the colonel she must give up ben and ben discarded loomed up larger than ben accepted she liked ben she was accustomed to ben ben was young and youth attracted youth other things being equal she would have preferred him to the colonel but ben was poor he had nothing and his prospects for the future were not alluring he would inherit little and that little not until his uncles death he had no profession he was not even a good farmer and trifled away with his useless models and mechanical toys the time he might have spent in making his uncles plantation productive graciella did not know that fetters had a mortgage on the plantation or bens prospects would have seemed even more hopeless

she felt sorry not only for herself but for ben as wellâ sorry that he should lose herâfor she knew that he loved her sincerely but her first duty was to herself conscious that she possessed talents social and otherwise it was not her view of creative wisdom that it should implant in the mind tastes and in the heart longings destined never to be realised she must discourage benâ gently and gradually for of course he would suffer and humanity as well as friendship counselled kindness a gradual breaking off too would be less harrowing to her own feelings

i suppose you admire colonel french immensely said ben with assumed impartiality

 oh i like him reasonably well she said with an equal lack of candour his conversation is improving he has lived in the metropolis and has seen so much of the world that he can scarcely speak without saying something interesting its a liberal education to converse with people who have had opportunities it helps to prepare my mind for life at the north

you set a great deal of store by the north graciella anybody would allow to listen to you that you didnt love your own country

i love the south ben as i loved aunt lou my old black mammy ive laid in her arms many a day and i most cried my eyes out when she died but that didnt mean that i never wanted to see any one else nor am i going to live in the south a minute longer than i can help because its too slow and new york isnt allâi want to travel and see the world the south is away behind she had said much the same thing weeks before but then it had been spontaneous now she was purposely trying to make ben see how unreasonable was his hope

ben stood as he obscurely felt upon delicate ground graciella had not been the only person to overhear remarks about the probability of the colonels seeking a wife in clarendon and jealousy had sharpened bens perceptions while it increased his fears he had little to offer graciella he was not well educated he had nothing to recommend him but his youth and his love for her he could not take her to europe or even to new yorkâat least not yet

and at home graciella went on seriously at home i should want several housesâa town house a country place a seaside cottage when we were tired of one we could go to another or live in hotelsâin the winter in florida at atlantic city in the spring at newport in the summer they say long branch has gone out entirely ben had a vague idea that long branch was by the seaside and exposed to storms gone out to sea he asked absently he was sick for love of her and she was dreaming of watering places

no ben said graciella compassionately poor ben had so little opportunity for schooling he was not to blame for his want of knowledge but could she throw herself away upon an ignoramus its still there but has gone out of fashion

oh excuse me im not posted on these fashionable things

ben relapsed into gloom the model remained untouched he could not give graciella a house he would not have a house until his uncle died graciella had never seemed so beautiful as today as she sat dressed in the cool white gown which miss lauras slender fingers had done up and with her hair dressed after the daintiest and latest fashion chronicled in the ladies fireside journal no wonder he thought that a jaded old man of the world like colonel french should delight in her fresh young beauty

but he would not give her up without a struggle she had loved him she must love him still and she would yet be his if he could keep her true to him or free from any promise to another until her deeper feelings could resume their sway it could not be possible after all that had passed between them that she meant to throw him over nor was he a man that she could afford to treat in such a fashion there was more in him than graciella imagined he was conscious of latent power of some kind though he knew not what and something would surely happen sometime somehow to improve his fortunes and there was always the hope the possibility of finding the lost money

he had brought his greatuncle ralphs letter with him as he had promised graciella when she read it she would see the reasonableness of his hope and might be willing to wait at least a little while any delay would be a point gained he shuddered to think that he might lose her and then the day after the irrevocable vows had been taken the treasure might come to light and all their life be spent in vain regrets graciella was skeptical about the lost money even mrs treadwell whose faith had been firm for years had ceased to encourage his hope while miss laura who at one time had smiled at any mention of the matter now looked grave if by any chance he let slip a word in reference to it but he had in his pocket the outward and visible sign of his inward belief and he would try its effect on graciella he would risk ridicule or anything else for her sake

graciella he said i have brought my uncle malcolms letter along to convince you that uncle is not as crazy as he seems and that theres some foundation for the hope that i may yet be able to give you all you want i dont want to relinquish the hope and i want you to share it with me

he produced an envelope once white now yellow with time on which was endorsed in ink once black but faded to a pale brown and hardly legible the name of malcolm dudley esq mink run and in the lower lefthand corner by hand of viney

the sheet which ben drew from this wrapper was worn at the folds and required careful handling graciella moved by curiosity had come down from her throne to a seat beside ben upon the porch she had never had any faith in the mythical gold of old ralph dudley the people of an earlier generationâher aunt laura perhapsâmay once have believed in it but they had long since ceased to do more than smile pityingly and shake their heads at the mention of old malcolms delusion but there was in it the element of romance strange things had happened and why might they not happen again and if they should happen why not to ben dear old shiftless beni she moved a porch pillow close beside him ana as they bent their heads over the paper her hair mingled with his and soon her hand rested unconsciously upon his shoulder

it was a voice from the grave said ben for my greatuncle ralph was dead when the letter reached uncle malcolm ill read it aloudâthe writing is sometimes hard to make out and i know it by heart my dear malcolm i have in my hands fifty thousand dollars of government money in gold which i am leaving here at the house for a few days since you are not at home and i cannot wait i have confided in our girl viney whom i can trust she will tell you when she gives you this where i have put the moneyâi do not write it lest the letter should fall into the wong hands there are many to whom it would be a great temptation i shall return in a few days and relieve you of the responsibility should anything happen to me write to the secretary of state at richmond for instructions what to do with the money in great haste your affectionate uncle ralph dudley

graciella was momentarily impressed by the letter of its reality there could be no doubtâit was there in black and white or rather brown and yellow

it sounds like a letter in a novel she said thoughtfully there must have been something

there must be something graciella for uncle ralph was killed the next day and never came back for the money but uncle malcolm because he dont know where to look cant find it and old aunt viney because she cant talk cant tell him where it is

why has she never shown him asked graciella there is some mystery he said which she seems unable to explain without speech and then she is queerâas queer in her own way as uncle is in his now if youd only marry me graciella and go out there to live with your uncommonly fine mind youd find itâ you couldnt help but find it it would just come at your call like my dog when i whistle to him

graciella was touched by the compliment or by the serious feeling which underlay it and that was very funny about calling the money and having it cornel she had often heard of people whistling for their money but had never heard that it cameâthat was bens idea there really was a good deal in ben and perhaps after all but at that moment there was a sound of wheels and whatever graciellas thought may have been it was not completed as colonel french lifted the latch of the garden gate and came up the walk toward them any glamour of the past any rosy hope of the future vanished in the solid brilliancy of the present moment old ralph was dead old malcolm nearly so the money had never been found would never come to light there on the doorstep was a young man shabbily attired without means or prospects there at the gate was a fine horse in a handsome trap and coming up the walk an agreeable welldressed gentleman of wealth and position no dead romance could in the heart of a girl of seventeen hold its own against so vital and brilliant a reality

thank you ben she said adjusting a stray lock of hair which had escaped from her radiant crop i am not clever enough for that it is a dream your greatuncle ralph had ridden too long and too far in the sun and imagined the treasure which has driven your uncle malcolm crazy and his housekeeper dumb and has benumbed you so that you sit around waiting waiting w then you ought to be working working  no ben i like you ever so much but you will never take me to new york with your uncle ralphs money nor will you ever earn enough to take me with your own you must excuse me now for here comes my cavalier dont hurry away aunt laura will be out in a minute you can stay and work on your model ill not be here to interrupt you good evening colonel french  did you bring me a herald i want to look at the advertisements

yes my dear young lady there is wednesdaysâit is only two days old how are you mr dudley

tolable sir thank you ben was a gentleman by instinct though his heart was heavy and the colonel a favoured rival

by the way said the colonel i wish to have an interview with your uncle about the old mill site he seems to have been a stockholder in the company and we should like his signature if he is in condition to give it if not it may be necessary to appoint you his guardian with power to act in his place

hes all right sir in the morning if you come early enough replied ben courteously you can tell what is best to do after youve seen him

thank you replied the colonel ill have my man drive me out tomorrow about ten say if youll be at home you ought to be there you know

very well sir ill be there all day and shall expect you

graciella threw back one compassionate glance as they drove away behind the colonels highstepping brown horse and did not quite escape a pang at the sight of her young lover still sitting on the steps in a dejected attitude and for a moment longer his reproachful eyes haunted her but graciella prided herself on being above all things practical and having come out for a good time resolutely put all unpleasant thoughts aside

there was good horseflesh in the neighbourhood of clarendon and the colonels was of the best some of the roads about the town were goodânot very well kept roads but the soil was a sandy loam and was selfdraining so that driving was pleasant in good weather the colonel had several times invited miss laura to drive with him and had taken her once but she was often obliged to stay with her mother graciella could always be had and the colonel who did not like to drive alone found her a vivacious companion whose naive comments upon life were very amusing to a seasoned man of the world she was as pretty too as a picture and the colonel had always admired beautyâwith a tempered admiration

at graciellas request they drove first down main street past the postoffice where she wished to mail a letter they attracted much attention as they drove through the street in the colonels new trap graciellas billowy white gown added a needed touch of maturity to her slender youthfulness a big straw hat shaded her brown hair and she sat erect and held her head high with a vivid consciousness that she was the central feature of a very attractive whole the colonel shared her thought and looked at her with frank admiration

you are the cynosure of all eyes he declared  i suppose im an object of envy to every young fellow in town

graciella blushed and bridled with pleasure i am not interested in the young men of clarendon she replied loftily they are not worth the trouble

not evenâben asked the colonel slyly

oh she replied with studied indifference mr dudley is really a cousin and only a friend he comes to see the family

the colonels attentions could have but one meaning and it was important to disabuse his mind concerning ben nor was she the only one in the family who entertained that thought of late her grandmother had often addressed her in an unusual way more as a woman than as a child and only the night before had retold the old story of her own sister mary who many years before had married a man of fifty he had worshipped her and had died after a decent interval leaving her a large fortune from which the old lady had deduced that on the whole it was better to be an old mans darling than a young mans slave she had made no application of the story but graciella was astute enough to draw her own conclusions

her aunt laura too had been unusually kind she had done up the white gown twice a week had trimmed her hat for her and had worn old gloves that she might buy her niece a new pair and her aunt had looked at her wistfully and remarked with a sigh that youth was a glorious season and beauty a great responsibility poor dear good old aunt laura when the expected happened she would be very kind to aunt laura and repay her so far as possible for all her care and sacrifice

it was only a short time after his visit to the excelsior mills that colonel french noticed a falling off in the progress made by his lawyer judge bullard in procuring the signatures of those interested in the old mill site and after the passing of several weeks he began to suspect that some adverse influence was at work this suspicion was confirmed when judge bullard told him one day with some embarrassment that he could no longer act for him in the matter

im right sorry colonel he said i should like to help you put the thing through but i simply cant afford it other clients whose business i have transacted for years and to whom i am under heavy obligations have intimated that they would consider any further activity of mine in your interest unfriendly to theirs

i suppose said the colonel your clients wish to secure the mill site for themselves nothing imparts so much value to a thing as the notion that somebody else wants it of course i cant ask you to act for me further and if youll make out your bill i ll hand you a check

i hope said judge bullard therell be no illfeeling about our separation

oh no responded the colonel politely not at all business is business and a mans own interests are his first concern

 im glad you feel that way replied the lawyer much relieved he had feared that the colonel might view the matter differently

some men you know he said might have kept on and worked against you while accepting your retainer there are such skunks at the bar

there are black sheep in every fold returned the colonel with a cold smile it would be unprofessional i suppose to name your client so ill not ask you

the judge did not volunteer the information but the colonel knew instinctively whence came opposition to his plan and investigation confirmed his intuition judge bullard was counsel for fetters in all matters where skill and knowledge were important and fetters held his note secured by mortgage for money loaned for dirty work fetters used tools of baser metal but like a wise man he knew when these were useless and was shrewd enough to keep the best lawyers under his control

the colonel after careful inquiry engaged to take judge bullards place one albert caxton a member of a good old family a young man and a capable lawyer who had no ascertainable connection with fetters and who in common with a small fraction of the best people regarded fetters with distrust and ascribed his wealth to usury and to what in more recent years has come to be known as graft to a man of colonel frenchs business training opposition was merely a spur to effort he had not run a race of twenty years in the commercial field to be worsted in the first heat by the petty boss of a southern backwoods county why fetters opposed him he did not knowr perhaps he wished to defeat a possible rival or merely to keep out principles and ideals which would conflict with his own methods and injure his prestige but if fetters wanted a fight fetters should have a fight

colonel french spent much of his time at young caxtons office instructing the new lawyer in the details of the mill affair caxton proved intelligent zealous and singularly sympathetic with his clients views and plans they had not been together a week before the colonel realised that he had gained immensely by the change

the colonel took a personal part in the effort to procure signatures among others that of old malcolm dudley and on the morning following the drive with graciella he drove out to mink run to see the old gentleman in person and discover whether or not he was in a condition to transact business

before setting out he went to his deskâhis fathers desk which miss laura had sent to himâto get certain papers for old mr dudleys signature if the latter should prove capable of a legal act he had laid the papers on top of some others which had nearly filled one of the numerous small drawers in the desk upon opening the drawer he found that one of the papers was missing

the colonel knew quite well that he had placed the paper in the drawer the night before he remembered the circumstance very distinctly for the event was so near that it scarcely required an exercise not to say an effort of memory an examination of the drawer disclosed that the piece forming the back of it was a little lower than the sides possibly thought the colonel the paper had slipped off and fallen behind the drawer

he drew the drawer entirely out and slipped his hand into the cavity at the back of it he felt the comer of a piece of paper projecting upward from below the paper had evidently slipped off the top of the others and fallen into a crevice due to the shrinkage of the wood or some defect of construction

the opening for the drawer was so shallow that though he could feel the end of the paper he was unable to get such a grasp of it as would permit him to secure it easily but it was imperative that he have the paper and since it bore already several signatures obtained with some difficulty he did not wish to run the risk of tearing it

he examined the compartment below to see if perchance the paper could be reached from there but found that it could not there was evidently a lining to the desk and the paper had doubtless slipped down between this and the finished panels forming the back of the desk to reach it the colonel procured a screw driver and turning the desk around loosened with some difficulty the screws that fastened the proper panel and soon recovered the paper with it however he found a couple of yellow timestained envelopes addressed on the outside to major john treadwell

the envelopes were unsealed he glanced into one of them and seeing that it contained a sheet folded small presumably a letter he thrust the two of them into the breast pocket of his coat intending to hand them to miss laura at their next meeting they were probably old letters and of no consequence but they should of course be returned to the owners

in putting the desk back in its place after returning the panel and closing the crevice against future accidents the colonel caught his coat on a projecting point and tore a long rent in the sleeve it was an old coat and worn only about the house and when he changed it before leaving to pay his call upon old malcolm dudley he hung it in a back corner in his clothes closet and did not put it on again for a long time since he was very busily occupied in the meantime the two old letters to which he had attached no importance escaped his memory altogether

the colonels coachman a young coloured man by the name of tom had complained of illness early in the morning and the colonel took peter along to drive him to mink run as well as to keep him company on their way through the town they stopped at mrs treadwells where they left phil who had he declared some important engagement with graciella

the distance was not long scarcely more than five miles ben dudley was in the habit of traversing it on horseback twice a day when they had passed the last straggling cabin of the town their way lay along a sandy road flanked by fields green with corn and cotton broken by stretches of scraggy pine and oak growing upon land once under cultivation but impoverished by the wasteful methods of slavery land that had never been regenerated and was now no longer tilled negroes were working in the fields birds were singing in the trees buzzards circled lazily against the distant sky although it was only early summer a languor in the air possessed the colonels senses and suggested a certain charity toward those of his neighbours âand they were most of themâwho showed no marked zeal for labour

work he murmured is best for happiness but in this climate idleness has its compensations what in the end do we get for all our labour

fifty cents a day an fin yosef suh said peter supposing the soliloquy addressed to himself dats wat dey pays roun hyuh

when they reached a large clearing which peter pointed out as their destination the old man dismounted with considerable agility and opened a rickety gate that was held in place by loops of rope evidently the entrance had once possessed some pretensions to elegance for the huge hewn posts had originally been faced with dressed lumber and finished with ornamental capitals some fragments of which remained and the one massive hinge hanging by a slender rusteaten nail had been wrought into a fantastic shape as they drove through the gateway a green lizard scampered down from the top of one of the posts where he had been sunning himself and a rattlesnake lying in the path lazily uncoiled his motley brown length and sounding his rattle wiggled slowly off into the rank grass and weeds that bordered the carriage track

the house stood well back from the road amid great oaks and elms and unpruned evergreens the lane by which it was approached was partly overgrown with weeds and grass from which the mares fetlocks swept the dew yet undried by the morning sun

the old dudley mansion as it was called was a large twostory frame house built in the colonial style with a lowpitched roof and a broad piazza along the front running the full length of both stories and supported by thick round columns each a solid piece of pine timber gray with age and lack of paint seamed with fissures by the sun and rain of many years the roof swayed downward on one side the shingles were old and cracked and mossgrown several of the second story windows were boarded up and others filled with sashes from which most of the glass had disappeared

about the house for a space of several rods on each side of it the ground was bare of grass and shrubbery rough and uneven lying in little hillocks and hollows as though recently dug over at haphazard or explored by some vagrant drove of hogs at one side beyond this barren area lay a kitchen garden enclosed by a paling fence the colonel had never thought of young dudley as being at all energetic but so illkept a place argued shiftlessness  in a marked degree

when the carriage had drawn up in front of the house the colonel became aware of two figures on the long piazza at one end in a massive oaken armchair sat an old manâseemingly a very old man for he was bent and wrinkled with thin white hair hanging down upon his shoulders his face of a highbred and strongly marked type emphasised by age had the hawklike contour that is supposed to betoken extreme acquisitiveness his faded eyes were turned toward a woman dressed in a homespun frock and a muslin cap who sat bolt upright in a straightbacked chair at the other end of the piazza with her hands folded on her lap looking fixedly toward her visavis neither of them paid the slightest attention to the colonel and when the old man rose it was not to step forward and welcome his visitor but to approach and halt in front of the woman

viney he said sharply i am tired of this nonsense i insist upon knowing immediately where my uncle left the money

the woman made no reply but her faded eyes glowed for a moment like the ashes of a dying fire and her figure stiffened perceptibly as she leaned slightly toward him

show me at once you hussy he said shaking his fist or youll have reason to regret it ill have you whipped his cracked voice rose to a shrill shriek as he uttered the threat

the slumbrous fire in the womans eyes flamed up for a moment she rose and drawing herself up to her full height which was greater than the old mans made some incoherent sounds and bent upon him a look beneath which he quailed

yes viney good viney he said soothingly i know it was wong and ive always regretted it always from the very moment but you shouldnt bear malice servants the bible says should obey their masters and you should bless them that curse you and do good to them that despitefully use you but i was good to you before viney and i was kind to you afterwards and i know youve forgiven me good viney noblehearted viney and youre going to tell me arent you   he pleaded laying his hand caressingly upon her arm

she drew herself away but seemingly mollified moved her lips as though in speech the old man put his hand to his ear and listened with an air of strained eagerness wellnigh breathless in its intensity

try again viney he said thats a good girl your old master thinks a great deal of you viney he is your best friend 

again she made an inarticulate response which he nevertheless seemed to comprehend for brightening up immediately he turned from her came down the steps with tremulous haste muttering to himself meanwhile seized a spade thatstood leaning against the steps passed by the carriage without a glance and began digging furiously at one side of the yard the old woman watched him for a while with a selfabsorption that was entirely oblivious of the visitors and then entered the house

the colonel had been completely absorbed in this curious drama there was an air of weirdness and unreality about it all old peter was as silent as if he had been turned into stone something in the atmosphere conduced to somnolence for even the horses stood still with no signs of restlessness the colonel was the first to break the spell

 whats the matter with them peter  do you know  

deys bofe plumb stracted suhâclean outn dey minsâdey ben dat way fer yeahs an yeahs an yealis

thats mr dudley i suppose

 yas suh dats ole mars macom dudley de uncle er young mistah ben dudley wat hangs roun miss gracella so much

 and who is the woman  

shes a bright mulattah oman suh wat use ter blong ter de family befo de wah an has kep house fer ole mars macom ever sence he lows dat she knows whar old mars rafe dudley his uncle hid a million dollahs endyoin de wah an huh tongues paralyse so she cant tell imâan hes ben tryin ter fin out fer de las twentyfive years i woked out hyuh one summer on plantation an i seen em gwine on like dat many an many a time dey don nobody roun hyuh pay no tention to em no mo evybodys so use ter seein em

the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of ben dudley who came around the house and advancing to the carriage nodded to peter and greeted the colonel respectfully

wont you light and come in  he asked

the colonel followed him into the house to a plainly furnished parlour there was a wide fireplace with a fine old pair of brass andirons and a few pieces of old mahogany furniture incongruously assorted with half a dozen splintbottomed chairs the floor was bare and on the walls half a dozen of the old dudleys looked out from as many oil paintings with the smooth glaze that marked the touch of the travelling artist in the days before portrait painting was superseded by photography and crayon enlargements

ben returned in a few minutes with his uncle old malcolm seemed to have shaken off his aberration and greeted the colonel with grave politeness

i am glad sir he said giving the visitor his hand to make your acquaintance i have been working in the gardenâthe flowergardenâfor the sake of the exercise we have negroes enough though they are very trifling nowadays but the exercise is good for my health i have trouble at times with my rheumatism and with myâmy memory he passed his hand over his brow as though brushing away an imaginary cobweb

ben tells me you have a business matter to present to me

the colonel somewhat mystified after what he had witnessed by this sudden change of manner but glad to find the old man seemingly rational stated the situation in regard to the mill site old malcolm seemed to understand perfectly and accepted with willingness the colonels proposition to give him a certain amount of stock in the new company for the release of such rights as he might possess under the old incorporation the colonel had brought with him a contract properly drawn which was executed by old malcolm and witnessed by the colonel and ben

i trust sir said mr dudley that you will not ascribe it to any discourtesy that i have not called to see you i knew your father and your grandfather but the cares of my estate absorb me so completely that i never leave home i shall send my regards to you now and then by my nephew i expect in a very short time when certain matters are adjusted to be able to give up to a great extent my arduous cares and lead a life of greater leisure which will enable me to travel and cultivate a wider acquaintance when that time comes sir i shall hope to see more of you

the old gentleman stood courteously on the steps while ben accompanied the colonel to the carriage it had scarcely turned into the lane when the colonel looking back saw the old man digging furiously the condition of the yard was explained he had been unjust in ascribing it to bens neglect

i reckon suh remarked peter dat wen he fin dat million dollahs mistah benll marry miss gracella an take huh ter new yok

perhapsâand perhaps not said the colonel to himself he added musingly old malcolm will start on a long journey before he finds the million dollars the watched pot never boils buried treasure is never found  by those who seek it but always accidentally if at all

on the way back they stopped at the treadwells for phil phil was not ready to go home he was intensely interested in a longeared mechanical mule constructed by ben dudley out of bits of wood and leather and controlled by certain springs made of rubber bands by manipulating which the mule could be made to kick furiously since the colonel had affairs to engage his attention and phil seemed perfectly contented he was allowed to remain with the understanding that peter should come for him in the afternoon

little phil had grown very fond of old peter who seemed to lavish upon the child all of his love and devotion for the dead generations of the french family the colonel had taught phil to call the old man uncle peter after the kindly southern fashion of slavery days which denying to negroes the forms of address applied to white people found in the affectionate terms of relationshipâmammy auntie and uncleâdesignations that recognised the respect due to age and yet lost when applied to slaves their conventional significance there was a strong sympathy between the intelligent child and the undeveloped old negro they were more nearly on a mental level leaving out of course the factor of peters experience than could have been the case with one more generously endowed than peter who though by nature faithful had never been unduly bright little phil became so attached to his old attendant that between peter and the treadwell ladies the colonels housekeeper had to give him very little care

on sunday afternoons the colonel and phil and peter would sometimes walk over to the cemetery the family lot was now kept in perfect order the low fence around it had been repaired and several leaning headstones straightened up but guided by a sense of fitness and having before him the awful example for which fetters was responsible the colonel had added no gaudy monument nor made any alterations which would disturb the quiet beauty of the spot or its harmony with the surroundings in the northern cemetery where his young wife was buried he had erected to her memory a stately mausoleum in keeping with similar memorials on every hand but here in this quiet graveyard where his ancestors slept their last sleep under the elms and the willows display would have been out of place he had however placed a wroughtiron bench underneath the trees where he would sit and read his paper while little phil questioned old peter about his grandfather and his greatgrandfather their prowess on the hunting field and the wars they fought in and the old man would delight in detailing in his rambling and disconnected manner the past glories of the french family it was always a new story to phil and never grew stale to the old man if peter could be believed there wore never white folks so brave so learned so wise so handsome so kind to their servants so just to all with whom they had dealings phil developed a very great fondness for these dead ancestors whose graves and histories he soon knew as well as peter himself with his lively imagination he found pleasure as children often do in looking into the future the unoccupied space in the large cemetery lot furnished him food for much speculation

papa he said upon one of these peaceful afternoons theres room enough here for all of us isnt thereâyou and me and uncle peter

yes phil said his father theres room for several generations of frenches yet to sleep with their fathers

little phil then proceeded to greater detail here he said  next to grandfather will be your place and here next to that will be mine and here next to me will beâ but no he said pausing reflectively that ought to be saved for my little boy when he grows up and dies that is when i grow up and have a little boy and he grows up and grows old and dies and leaves a little boy andâbut where will uncle peter be

nem mine me honey said the old man dey can put me somewhar ese hit doan mattuh bout me

 no uncle peter you must be here with the rest of us for you know uncle peter pm so used to you now that i should want you to be near me then

old peter thought to humour the lad put me down hyuh at de foot er de lot little mars phil unner dis ellum tree

oh papa exclaimed phil demanding the colonels attention uncle peter and i have arranged everything you know uncle peter is to stay with me as long as i live and when he dies he is to be buried here at the foot of the lot under the elm tree where hell be near me all the time and near the folks that he knows and that know him

all right phil you see to it youll live longer  but papa if i should die first and then uncle peter and you last of all youll put uncle peter near me wont you papa

why bless your little heart phil of course your daddy will do whatever you want if hes here to do it but youll live phil please god until i am old and bent and whitehaired and you are a grown man with a beard and a little boy of your own

 yas suh echoed the old servant an till ole peters bones is long sence crumble inter dus none er de frenches ain never died till dey was done growed up

on the afternoon following the colonels visit to mink run old peter when he came for phil was obliged to stay long enough to see the antics of the mechanical mule and had not that artificial animal suddenly refused to kick and lapsed into a characteristic balkiness for which there was no apparent remedy it might have proved difficult to get phil away

there philip dear never mind said miss laura well have ben mend it for you when he comes next time and then you can play with it again

peter had brought with him some hooks and lines and he and phil after leaving the house followed the bank of the creek climbing a fence now and then until they reached the old mill site upon which work had not yet begun they found a shady spot and seating themselves upon the bank baited their lines and dropped them into a quiet pool for quite a while their patience was unrewarded by anything more than a nibble by and by a black cat came down from the ruined mill and sat down upon the bank at a short distance from them

i reckon well haf ter move honey said the old man we aint gwine ter have no luck fishin gins no ole black cat

but cats dont fish uncle peter do they 

law chile youll never know wat dem critters kin do tel yous watched em long ez i has keep yo eye on dat one now

the cat stood by the stream in a watchful attitude suddenly she darted her paw into the shallow water and with a lightninglike movement drew out a small fish which she took in her mouth and retired wnth it a few yards up the bank

jes look at dat ole devil said peter playin wid dat fish jes lack it wuz a mouse i shell be comin down heah terreckly tellin us ter go way fum her fishin grouns

they moved down the stream and were soon having better luck

uncle peter said phil while they were on their way home there couldnt be any hants at all in the graveyard where my grandfather is buried could there  graciella read a lot of the tombstones to me one day and they all said that all the people were good and were resting in peace and had gone to heaven tombstones always tell the truth dont they uncle peter

 happen so honey happen so de french tombstones does an as ter de res i ain gwine to spute em nohow fer ef i did de folks under em mought come back an hant me jes fer spite

by considerable effort and a moderate outlay the colonel at length secured a majority of interest in the eureka mill site and made application to the state through caxton for the redemption of the title the opposition had either ceased or had proved ineffective there would be some little further delay but the outcome seemed practically certain and the colonel did not wait longer to set in motion his plans for the benefit of clarendon

im told that fetters says hell get the mill anywaysaid caxton and make more money buying it under foreclosure than by building a new one hes ready to lend on it now

oh damn fetters  exclaimed the colonel elated with his victory he had never been a profane man but strong language came so easy in clarendon that one dropped into it unconsciously the mill will be running on full time when fetters has been put out of business weve won our first fight and ive never really seen the fellow yet

as soon as the title was reasonably secure the colonel began his preparations for building the cotton mill the first step was to send for a new england architect who made a specialty of mills to come down and look the site over and make plans for the dam the mill buildings and a number of model cottages for the operatives as soon as the estimates were prepared he looked the ground over to see how far he could draw upon local resources for material

there was good brick clay on the outskirts of the town where bricks had once been made but for most of the period since the war such as were used in the town had been procured from the ruins of old buildingsâit was cheaper to clean bricks than to make them since the construction of the railroad branch to clarendon the few that were needed from time to time were brought in by train not since the building of the opera house block had there been a kiln of brick made in the town inquiry brought out the fact that in case of a demand for bricks there were brickmakers thereabouts and in accordance with his general plan to employ local labour the colonel looked up the owner of the brickyard and asked if he were prepared to take a large contract

the gentleman was palpably troubled by the question well colonel he said i dont know id sposed you were goin to impot yo bricks from philadelphia no mr barnes returned the colonel i want to spend the money here in clarendon there seems to be plenty of unemployed labour

yes there does till you want somethin done then there aint so much i spose i might find half a dozen niggers round here that know how to make brick and theres several more that have moved away that i can get back if i send for them if you raly think you want yor brick made here ill try to get them out for you theyll cost you though as much if not more than youd have to pay for machinemade bricks from the noth

the colonel declared that he preferred the local product well im shore i dont see why said the brickmaker theyll not be as smooth or as uniform in colour theyll be clarendon brick returned the colonel and i want this to be a clarendon enterprise from the ground up

well said barnes resignedly if you must have homemade brick i suppose ill have to make em ill see what i can do

colonel french then turned the brick matter over to caxton who in the course of a week worried barnes into a contract to supply so many thousand brick within a given time

i dont like that there time limit said the brickmaker but i reckon i can make them brick as fast as you can get anybody roun here to lay em

when in the course of another week the colonel saw signs of activity about the old brickyard he proceeded with the next step which was to have the ruins of the old factory cleared away

well colonel said major mc lean one day when the colonel dropped into the hotel where the major hung out a good part of the time i spose youre goin to hire white folks to do the work over there

why replied the colonel i hadnt thought about the colour of the workmen therell be plenty i guess for all who apply so long as it lasts

youll have trouble if you hire niggers said the major youll find that they wont work when you want em to theyre not reliable they have no sense of responsibility as soon as they get a dollar theyll lay off to spend it and leave yo work at the mos critical point

well now major replied the colonel i havent noticed any unnatural activity among the white men of the town the negroes have to live or seem to think they have and ill give em a chance to turn an honest penny by the way major i need a superintendent to look after the work it dont require an expert but merely a good manâgentleman preferredâwhom i can trust to see that my ideas are carried out perhaps you can recommend such a person

the major turned the matter over in his mind before answering he might of course offer his own services the pay would doubtless be good but he had not done any real work for years his wife owned their home his daughter taught in the academy he was drawn on jury nearly every term was tax assessor now and then and a judge or clerk of elections upon occasion nor did he think that steady employment would agree with his health while it would certainly interfere with his pleasant visits with the drummers at the hotel

id be glad to take the position myself colonel he said but i realy wont have the time the campaign will be hummin in a month or so an my political duties will occupy all my leisure but ill bear the matter in mind an see if i can think of any suitable person

the colonel thanked him he had hardly expected the major to offer his services but had merely washed for the fun of the thing to try the experiment what the colonel really needed was a good foremanâhe had used the word superintendent merely on the majors account as less suggestive of work he found a poor white roan however green by name who seemed capable and energetic and a gang of labourers under his charge was soon busily engaged in clearing the mill site and preparing for the foundations of a new dam when it was learned that the colonel was paying his labourers a dollar and a half a day there was considerable criticism on the ground that such lavishness would demoralise the labour market the usual daily wage of the negro labourer being from fifty to seventyfive cents but since most of the colonels money soon found its way through the channels of trade into the pockets of the white people the criticism soon died a natural death

once started in his career of active benevolence the colonels natural love of thoroughness combined with a philanthropic zeal as pleasant as it was novel sought out new reforms they were easily found he had begun with wise foresight at the foundations of prosperity by planning an industry in which the people could find employment but there were subtler needs mental and spiritual to be met education for instance so important to real development languished in clarendon there was a select private school for young ladies attended by the daughters of those who could not send their children away to school a few of the town boys went away to military schools the remainder of the white youth attended the academy which was a thoroughly democratic institution deriving its support partly from the public school fund and partly from private subscriptions there was a coloured public school taught by a negro teacher neither school had so far as the colonel could learn attained any very high degree of efficiency at one time the colonel had contemplated building a schoolhouse for the children of the mill hands but upon second thought decided that the expenditure would be more widely useful if made through the channels already established if the old academy building were repaired and a wing constructed for which there was ample room upon the grounds it would furnish any needed additional accommodation for the children of the operatives and avoid the drawing of any line that might seem to put these in a class apart there were already lines enough in the townâ the deep and distinct colour line theoretically allpervasive but with occasional curious exceptions the old line between the rich white folks or aristocratsâno longer rich most of them but retaining some of their former wealth and clinging tenaciously to a waning prestigeâand the poor whites still at a social disadvantage but gradually evolving a solid middle class with reinforcements from the decaying aristocracy and producing now and then some ambitious and successful man like fetters to emphasise these distinctions was no part of the colonels plan to eradicate them entirely in any stated time was of course impossible human nature being what it was but he would do nothing to accentuate them his mill hands should become like the mill hands in new england towns an intelligent selfrespecting and therefore respected element of an enlightened population and the whole town should share equally in anything he might spend for their benefit

he found much pleasure in talking over these fine plans of his with laura treadwell caxton had entered into them with the enthusiasm of an impressionable young man brought into close contact with a forceful personality but in miss laura the colonel found a sympathy that was more than intellectualâthat reached down to sources of spiritual strength and inspiration which the colonel could not touch but of which he was conscious and of which he did not hesitate to avail himself at second hand little phil had made the house almost a second home and the frequent visits of his father had only strengthened the colonels admiration of lauras character he had learned not from the lady herself how active in good works she was a lady bountiful in any large sense she could not be for her means as she had so frankly said upon his first visit were small but a little went a long way among the poor of clarendon and the life after all is more than meat and the body more than raiment and advice and sympathy were as often needed as other kinds of help he had offered to assist her charities in a substantial way and she had permitted it now and then but had felt obliged at last to cease mentioning them altogether he was able to circumvent this delicacy now and then through the agency of graciella whose theory was that money was made to spend

laura he said one evening when at the house will you go with me tomorrow to visit the academy  i wish to see with your eyes as well as with mine what it needs and what can be done with it it shall be our secret until we are ready to surprise the town

they went next morning without notice to the principal the school was well ordered but the equipment poor the building was old and sadly in need of repair the teacher was an exconfederate officer past middle life well taught by the methods in vogue fifty years before but scarcely in harmony with modern ideals of education in spite of his perfect manners and unimpeachable character the professor as he was called was generally understood to hold his position more by virtue of his need and his influence than of his fitness to instruct he had several young lady assistants who found in teaching the only career open in clarendon to white women of good family

the recess hour arrived while they were still at school when the pupils marched out in orderly array the colonel seizing a moment when miss treadwell and the professor were speaking about some of the children whom the colonel did not know went to the rear of one of the schoolrooms and found without much difficulty high up on one of the walls the faint but still distinguishable outline of a pencil caricature he had made there thirty years before if the wail had been whitewashed in the meantime the lime had scaled down to the original plaster only the name which had been witten underneath was illegible though he could reconstruct with his minds eye and the aid of a few shadowy strokesâbill fetters sneakâin angular letters in the printed form

the colonel smiled at this survival of youthful bigotry yet even then his instinct had been a healthy one his boyish characterisation of fetters schoolboy was not an inapt description of fetters manâmortgage shark labour contractor and political boss bill seeking official favour had reported to the professor of that date some boyish escapade in which his schoolfellows had taken part and it was in revenge for this meanness that the colonel had chased him ignominiously down main street and pilloried him upon the schoolhouse wall fetters the man a goliath whom no david had yet opposed had fastened himself upon a week and disorganised community during a period of great distress and had succeeded by devious ways in making himself its master and as the colonel stood looking at the picture he was conscious of a faint echo of his boyish indignation and sense of outraged honour already fetters and he had clashed upon the subject of the cotton mill and fetters had retired from the field if it were written that they should meet in a lifeanddeath struggle for the soul of clarendon he would not shirk the conflict

laura he said when they went away i should like to visit the coloured school will you come with me

she hesitated and he could see with half an eye that her answer was dictated by a fine courage

why certainly i will go why not it is a place where a good work is carried on

no laura said the colonel smiling you need not go on second thought i should prefer to go alone she insisted but he was firm he had no desire to go counter to her instincts or induce her to do anything that might provoke adverse comment miss laura had all the fine glow of courage hut was secretly relieved at being excused from a trip so unconventional

so the colonel found his way alone to the schoolhouse an unpainted frame structure in a barren sandy lot upon a street somewhat removed from the centre of the town and given over mainly to the humble homes of negroes that his unannounced appearance created some embarrassment was quite evident but his friendliness toward the negroes had already been noised abroad and he was welcomed with warmth not to say effusion by the principal of the school a tall stalwart and dark man with an intelligent expression a deferential manner and shrewd but guarded eyesâthe eyes of the jungle the colonel had heard them called and the thought came to him was it some ancestral jungle on the distant coast of savage africa or the wilderness of another sort in which the black people had wandered and were wandering still in free america  the attendance was not large at a glance the colonel saw that there were but twentyfive pupils present

what is your total enrolment he asked the teacher well sir was the reply we have seventyfive or eighty on the roll but it threatened rain this morning and as a great many of them havent got good shoes they stayed at home for fear of getting their feet wet

the colonel had often noticed the black children paddling around barefoot in the puddles on rainy days but there was evidently some point of etiquette connected with attending school barefoot he had passed more than twentyfive children on the streets on his way to the schoolhouse

the building was even worse than that of the academy and the equipment poorer still upon the colonel asking to hear a recitation the teacher made some excuse and shrewdly requested him to make a few remarks they could recite he said at any time but an opportunity to hear colonel french was a privilege not to be neglected

the colonel consenting goodhumouredly was introduced to the school in very flowery language the pupils were sitting the teacher informed them in the shadow of a great man a distinguished member of the grand old aristocracy of their grand old native state had gone to the great north and grown rich and famous he had returned to his old home to scatter his vast wealth where it was most needed and to give his fellow townsmen an opportunity to add their applause to his worldwide fame he was present to express his sympathy with their feeble efforts to rise in the world and he wanted the scholars all to listen with the most respectful attention

colonel french made a few simple remarks in which he spoke of the advantages of education as a means of forming character and of fitting boys and girls for the work of men and women in former years his people had been charged with direct responsibility for the care of many coloured children and in a larger and indirect way they were still responsible for their descendants he urged them to make the best of their opportunities and try to fit themselves for useful citizenship they would meet with the difficulties that all men must and with some peculiarly their own but they must look up and not down forward and not back seeking always incentives to hope rather than excuses for failure before leaving he arranged with the teacher whose name was taylor to meet several of the leading coloured men with whom he wished to discuss some method of improving their school and directing their education to more definite ends the meeting was subsequently held

what your people need said the colonel to the little gathering at the schoolhouse one evening is to learn not only how to read and write and think but to do these things to some definite end we live in an age of specialists to make yourselves valuable members of society you must learn to do well some particular thing by which you may reasonablyâexpect to earn a comfortable living in your own home among your neighbours and save something for old age and the education of your children get together take advice from some of your own capable leaders in other places find out what you can do for yourselves and i will give you three dollars for everyone you can gather for an industrial school or some similar institution take your time and when youre ready to report come and see me or write to me if i am not here

the result was the setting in motion of a stagnant pool who can measure the force of hope  the town had been neglected by mission boards no able or ambitious negro had risen from its midst to found an institution and find a career the coloured school received a grudging dole from the public funds and was left entirely to the supervision of the coloured people it would have been surprising had the money always been expended to the best advantage

the fact that a white man in some sense a local man who had yet come from the far north the land of plenty with feelings friendly to their advancement had taken a personal interest in their welfare and proved it by his presence among them gave them hope and inspiration for the future they had long been familiar with the friendship that curbed restricted and restrained and concerned itself mainly with their limitations they were almost hysterically eager to welcome the cooperation of a friend who in seeking to lift them up was obsessed by no fear of pulling himself down or of narrowing in some degree the gulf that separated themâwho was willing not only to help them but to help them to a condition in which they might be in less need of help the colonel touched the reserves of loyalty in the negro nature exemplified in old peter and such as he who knows had these reserves been reached sooner by strict justice and patient kindness that they might not long since have helped to heal the wounds of slavery 

and now laura said the colonel when we have improved the schools and educated the people we must give them something to occupy their minds we must have a library a public library

that will be splendid she replied with enthusiasm a public library continued the colonel housed in a beautiful building in a conspicuous place and decorated in an artistic mannerâa shrine of intellect and taste at which all the people rich and poor black and white may worship

miss laura was silent for a moment and thoughtful but henry she said with some hesitation do you mean that coloured people should use the library

why not he asked do they not need it most perhaps not many of them might wish to use it but to those who do should we deny the opportunity consider their teachersâif the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch

yes henry that is the truth but i am afraid the white people wouldnt wish to handle the same books

very well then we will give the coloured folks a library of their own at some place convenient for their use we need not strain our ideal by going too fast where shall i build the library

the vacant lot she said between the postoffice and the bank

the very place he replied it belonged to our family once and i shall be acquiring some more ancestral property the cows will need to find a new pasture

the announcement of the colonels plan concerning the academy and the library evoked a hearty response on the part of the public and the anglosaxon hailed it as the dawning of a new era with regard to the colonels friendly plans for the negroes there was less enthusiasm and some difference of opinion some commended the colonels course there were others good men and patriotic men who would have died for liberty in the abstract men who sought to walk uprightly and to live peaceably with all but who by much brooding over the conditions surrounding their life had grown hopelessly pessimistic concerning the negro

the subject came up in a little company of gentlemen who were gathered around the colonels table one evening after the coffee had been served and the havanas passed around

your zeal for humanity does you infinite credit colonel french said dr mackenzie minister of the presbyterian church who was one of these prophetic souls but i fear your time and money and effort will be wasted the negroes are hopelessly degraded they have degenerated rapidly since the war

how do you know doctor you came here from the north long after the war what is your standard of comparison  

i voice the unanimous opinion of those who have known them at both periods

i dont agree with you and i lived here before the war there is certainly one smart negro in town nichols the coloured barber owns five houses and overreached me in a bargain before the war he was a chattel and taylor the teacher seems to be a very sensible fellow

yes said dr price who was one of the company taylor is a very intelligent negro nichols and he have learned how to live and prosper among the white people

they are exceptions said the preacher who only prove the rule no colonel french for a long time i hoped that there was a future for these poor helpless blacks but of late i have become profoundly convinced that there is no place in this nation for the negro except under the sod we will not assimilate him we cannot deport him

and therefore o man of god must we exterminate him

it is gods will we need not stain our hands with innocent blood if we but sit passive and leave their fate to time they will die away in discouragement and despair already disease is sapping their vitals like other weak races they will vanish from the pathway of the strong and there is no place for them to flee when they go hence it is to go forever it is the law of life which god has given to the earth to coddle them to delude them with false hopes of an unnatural equality which not all the power of the government has been able to maintain is only to increase their unhappinesss to a doomed race ignorance is euthanasia and knowledge is but pain and sorrow

it is his will that the fittest should survive and that those shall inherit the earth who are best prepared to utilise its forces and gather its fruits

my dear doctor what you say may all be true but with all due respect i dont believe a word of it i am rather inclined to think that these people have a future that there is a place for them here that they have made fair progress under discouraging circumstances that they_will not disappear from our midst for many generations if ever and that in the meantime as we make or mar them we shall make or mar our civilisation no society can be greater or wiser or better than the average of all its elements our ancestors brought these people here and lived in luxury some of themâor went into bankruptcy more of themâon their labour after three hundred years of toil they might be fairly said to have earned their liberty at any rate they are here they constitute the bulk of our labouring class to teach them is to make their labour more effective and therefore more profitable to increase their needs is to increase our protifs in supplying them ill take my chances on the golden rule i am no lover of the negro as negroâi do not know but i should rather see him elsewhere i think our land would have been far happier had none but white men ever set foot upon it after the red men were driven back but they are here through no fault of theirs as we are they were bom here we have given them our languageâ which they speak more or less corruptly our religionâ which they practise certainly no better than we and our bloodâwhich our laws make a badge of disgrace perhaps we could not do them strict justice without a great sacrifice upon our own part but they are men and they should have their chanceat least some chance

i shall pray for your success sighed the preacher

with god all things are possible if he will them but i can only anticipate your failure

the colonel is growing so popular with his ready money and his cheerful optimism said old general thornton another of the guests that well have to run him for congress as soon as he is reconverted to the faith of his fathers

colonel french had more than once smiled at the assumption that a mere change of residence would alter his matured political convictions his friends seemed to look upon them so far as they differed from their own as a mere veneer which would scale off in time as had the multiplied coats of whitewash over the pencil drawing made on the schoolhouse wall in his callow youth

you see the old general went on its a social matter down here rather than a political one with this ignorant black flood sweeping up against us the race question assumes an importance which overshadows the tariff and the currency and everything else for instance i had fully made up my mind to vote the other ticket in the last election i didnt like our candidate nor our platform there was a cleancut issue between sound money and financial repudiation and i was tired of the domination of populists and demagogues all my better instincts led me toward a change of attitude and i boldly proclaimed the fact i declared my political and intellectual independence at the cost of many friends even roy own soninlaw scarcely spoke to me for a month when i went to the polls old sam brown the triflingest nigger in town whom i had seen sentenced to jail more than once for stealingâold sam brown was next to me in the line

well ginl he said im glad you is got on de right side at las an is gwine to vote our ticket

this was too much i could stand the other party in the abstract but not in the concrete i voted the ticket of my neighbours and my friends we had to preserve our institutions if our finances went to smash call it prejudiceâcall it what you likeâits human nature and youll come to it colonel youll come to itâand then well send you to congress

i might not care to go returned the colonel smiling

you could not resist sir the unanimous demand of a determined constituency upon the rare occasions when in this state the office has had a chance to seek the man it has never sought in vain

time slipped rapidly by and the colonel had been in clarendon a couple of months when he went home one afternoon and not finding phil and peter went around to the treadwells as the most likely place to seek them

henry said miss laura philip does not seem quite well today there are dark circles under his eyes and he has been coughing a little

the colonel was startled had his growing absorption in other things led him to neglect his child  phil needed a mother this dear thoughtful woman whom nature had made for motherhood had seen things about his child that he the childs father had not perceived to a mind like colonel frenchs this juxtaposition of a motherly heart and a motherless child seemed very pleasing

he despatched a messenger on horseback immediately for dr price the colonel had made the doctors acquaintance soon after coming to clarendon and out of abundant precaution had engaged him to call once a week to see phil a physician of skill and experience a gentleman by birth and breeding a thoughtful student of men and manners and a good story teller he had proved excellent company and the colonel soon numbered him among his intimate friends he had seen phil a few days before but it was yet several days before his next visit

dr price owned a place in the country several miles away on the road to mink run and thither the messenger went to find him he was in his town office only at stated hours the colonel was waiting at home an hour later when the doctor drove up to the gate with ben dudley in the shabby old buggy to which ben sometimes drove his one good horse on his trips to town

i broke one of my buggy wheels going out home this morning explained the doctor and had just sent it to the shop when your messenger came i would have ridden your horse back and let the man walk in but mr dudley fortunately came along and gave me a lift

he looked at phil left some tablets with directions for their use and said that it was nothing serious and the child would be all right in a day or two

what he needs colonel at his age is a womans care but for that matter none of us ever get too old to need that

ill have tom hitch up and take you home said the colonel when the doctor had finished with phil unless youll stay to dinner

no thank you said the doctor im much obliged but i told my wife id be back to dinner ill just sit here and wait for young dudley whos going to call for me in an hour theres a fine mind colonel thats never had a proper opportunity for development if hed had half the chance that your boy will he would make his mark did you ever see his uncle malcolm

the colonel described his visit to mink run the scene on the piazza the interview with mr dudley and peters story about the hidden treasure

is the old man sane he asked

his mind is warped undoubtedly said the doctor but ill leave it to you whether it was the result of an insane delusion or notâif you care to hear his storyâor perhaps youve heard it  

no i have not returned the colonel but i should like to hear it

this was the story that the doctor told when the last century had passed the halfway mark and had started upon its decline the dudleys had already owned land on mink run for a hundred years or more and were one of the richest and most conspicuous families in the state the first great man of the family general arthur dudley an ardent patriot had won distinction in the war of independence and held high place in the councils of the infant nation his son became a distinguished jurist whose name is still a synonym for legal learning and juridical wisdom in ralph dudley the son of judge dudley and the immediate predecessor of the demented old man in whom now rested the title to the remnant of the estate the family began to decline from its eminence ralph did not marry but led a life of ease and pleasure wasting what his friends thought rare gifts and leaving his property to the management of his nephew malcolm the orphan son of a younger brother and his uncles prospective heir malcolm dudley proved so capable a manager that for year after year the large estate was left almost entirely in his charge the owner looking to it merely for revenue to lead his own life in other places

the civil war gave ralph dudley a career not upon the field for which he had no taste but in administrative work which suited his talents and imposed more arduous tasks than those of actual warfare valour was of small account without arms and ammunition a commissariat might be improvised but gunpowder must be manufactured or purchased

ralphs nephew malcolm kept bachelors hall in the great house the only women in the household were an old black cook and the housekeeper known as viney âa negro corruption of laviniaâa tall comely young light mulattress with a dash of cherokee blood which gave her straighter blacker and more glossy hair than most women of mixed race have and perhaps a somewhat different temperamental endowment her duties were not onerous compared with the toiling field hands she led an easy life the household had been thus constituted for ten years and more when malcolm dudley began paying court to a wealthy widow

this lady a mrs todd was a war widow who had lost her husband in the early years of the struggle war while it took many lives did not stop the currents of life and weeping widows sometimes found consolation mrs todd was of clarendon extraction and had returned to the town to pass the period of her mourning men were scarce in those days and mrs todd was no longer young malcolm dudley courted her proposed marriage and was accepted

he broke the news to his housekeeper by telling her to prepare the house for a mistress it was not a pleasant task but he was a resolute man the woman had been in power too long to yield gracefully some passionate strain of the mixed blood in her veins broke out in a scene of hysterical violence her pleadings remonstrances rages were all in vain mrs todd was rich and he was poor should his uncle see fit to marryâalways a possibilityâhe would have nothing he would carry out his purpose

the day after this announcement viney went to town sought out the object of dudleys attentions and told her something just what no one but herself and the lady ever knew when dudley called in the evening the widow refused to see him and sent instead a curt note cancelling their engagement

dudley went home puzzled and angry on the way thither a suspicion flashed into his mind in the morning he made investigations after which he rode round by the residence of his overseer returning to the house at noon he ate his dinner in an ominous silence which struck terror to the heart of the woman who waited on him and had already repented of her temerity when she would have addressed him with a look he froze the words upon her lips when he had eaten he looked at his watch and ordered a boy to bring his horse round to the door he waited until he saw his overseer coming toward the house then sprang into the saddle and rode down the lane passing the overseer with a nod

ten minutes later dudley galloped back up the lane and sprang from his panting horse as he dashed up the steps he met the overseer coming out of the house

you have not

i have sir and well i the shedevil bit my hand to the bone and would have stabbed me if i hadnt got the knife away from her youd better have the niggers look after her shes shamming a fit

dudley was remorseful and finding viney unconscious sent hastily for a doctor

the woman has had a stroke said that gentleman curtly after an examination  brought on by brutal treatment by gd dudley i wouldnt have thought this of you  i own negroes but i treat them like human beings and such a woman  im ashamed of my own race i swear i am if we are whipped in this war and the slaves are freed as lincoln threatens it will be gods judgment

many a man has been shot by southern gentlemen for language less offensive but dudleys conscience made him meek as moses

it was a mistake he faltered and i shall discharge the overseer who did it

you had better shoot him returned the doctor he has no soulâand what is worse no discrimination dudley gave orders that viney should receive the best of care next day he found behind the clock where she had laid it the letter which ben dudley many years after had read to graciella on mrs treadwells piazza it was dated the morning of the previous day

an hour later he learned of the death of his uncle who had been thrown from a fractious horse not far from mink run and had broken his neck in the fall a hasty search of the premises did not disclose the concealed treasure the secret lay in the mind of the stricken woman as soon as dudley learned that viney had eaten and drunk and was apparently conscious he went to her bedside and took her limp hand in his own

im sorry viney mighty sorry i assure you martin went further than i intended and i have discharged him for his brutality youll be sorry viney to learn that your old master ralph is dead he was killed by an accident within ten miles of here his body will be brought home today and buried tomorrow

dudley thought he detected in her expressionless face a shade of sorrow old ralph high liver and genial soul had been so indulgent a master that his nephew suffered by the comparison

i found the letter he left with you he continued softly and must take charge of the money immediately can you tell me where it is  

one side of vineys face was perfectly inert as the result of her disorder and any movement of the other produced a slight distortion that spoiled the face as the index of the mind but her eyes were not dimmed and into their sombre depths there leaped a sudden fireâonly a momentary flash for almost instantly she closed her lids and when she opened them a moment later they exhibited no trace of emotion

you will tell me where it is  he repeated a request came awkwardly to his lips he was accustomed to command

viney pointed to her mouth with her right hand which was not affected

to be sure he said hastily you cannot speakânot yet

he reflected for a moment the times were unsettled should a wave of conflict sweep over clarendon the money might be found by the enemy should viney take a turn for the worse and die it would be impossible to learn anything from her at all there was another thought which had rapidly taken shape in his mind no one but viney knew that his uncle had been at mink run the estate had been seriously embarrassed by rogers extravagant patriotism following upon the heels of other and earlier extravagances the fifty thousand dollars would in part make good the loss as his uncles heir he had at least a moral claim upon it and possession was nine points of the law

 is it in the house   he asked

she made a negative sign

in the barn

the same answer

 in the yard  the garden  the spring house  the quarters

no question he could put brought a different answer dudley was puzzled the woman was in her right mind she was no liarâof this servile vice at least she was free surely there was some mystery

 you saw my uncle  he asked thoughtfully

she nodded affirmatively

and he had the money in gold 

yes

he left it here

yes positively

do you know where he hid it

she indicated that she did and pointed again to her silent tongue

you mean that you must regain your speech before you can explain

she nodded yes and then as if in pain turned her face away from him

viney was carefully nursed the doctor came to see her regularly she was fed with dainty food and no expense was spared to effect her cure in due time she recovered from the paralytic stroke in all except the power of speech which did not seem to return all of dudleys attempts to learn from her the whereabouts of the money were equally futile she seemed willing enough but though she made the effort was never able to articulate and there was plainly some mystery about the hidden gold which only words could unravel

if she could but write a few strokes of the pen would give him his hearts desire  but alas viney may as well have been without hands for any use she could make of a pen slaves were not taught to read or write nor was viney one of the rare exceptions but dudley was a man of resourceâhe would have her taught he employed a teacher for her a free coloured man who knew the rudiments but viney handicapped by her loss of speech made wretched progress from whatever cause she manifested a remarkable stupidity while seemingly anxious to learn dudley himself took a hand in her instruction but with no better results and in the end the attempt to teach her was abandoned as hopeless

years rolled by the fall of the confederacy left the slaves free and completed the ruin of the dudley estate part of the land went at ruinous prices to meet mortgages at ruinous rates part lay fallow given up to scrub oak and shortleaf pine merely enough was cultivated or let out on shares to negro tenants to provide a living for old malcolm and a few servants absorbed in dreams of the hidden gold and in the search for it he neglected his business and fell yet deeper into debt he worried himself into a lingering fever through which viney nursed him with every sign of devotion and from which he rose with his mind visibly weakened

when the slaves were freed viney had manifested no desire to leave her old place after the tragic episode which had led to their mutual undoing there had been no relation between them but that of master and servant but some gloomy attraction or it may have been habit held her to the scene of her power and of her fall she had no kith nor kin and her affliction separated her from the rest of mankind nor would dudley have been willing to let her go for in her lay the secret of the treasure and since all other traces of her ailment had disappeared so her speech might return the fruitless search was never relinquished and in time absorbed all of malcolm dudleys interest the crops were left to the servants who neglected them the yard had been dug over many times every foot of ground for rods around had been sounded with a pointed iron bar the house had suffered in the search no crack or cranny had been left unexplored the spaces between the walls beneath the floors under the hearthsâevery possible hiding place had been searched with little care for any resulting injury

into this household ben dudley left alone in the world had come when a boy of fifteen he had no special turn for farming but such work as was done upon the old plantation was conducted under his supervision in the decaying old house on the neglected farm he had grown up in harmony with his surroundings the example of his old uncle wecked in mind by a hopeless quest had never been brought home to him as a warning use had dulled its force he had never joined in the search except casually but the legend was in his mind unconsciously his standards of life grew around it some day he would be rich and in order to be sure of it he must remain with his uncle whose heir he was for the money was there without a doubt his greatuncle had hid the gold and left the letterâben had read it

the neighbours knew the story or at least some vague version of it and for a time joined in the searchâsurreptitiously as occasion offered and each on his own account it was the common understanding that old malcolm was mentally unbalanced the neighbouring negroes with generous imagination fixed his mythical and elusive treasure at a million dollars not one of them had the faintest conception of the bulk or purchasing power of one million dollars in gold but when one builds a castle in the air why not make it lofty and spacious 

from this unwholesome atmosphere ben dudley found relief as he grew older in frequent visits to clarendon which invariably ended at the treadwells who were indeed distant relatives he had one good horse and in an hour or less could leave behind him the shabby old house falling into ruin the demented old man digging in the disordered yard the dumb old woman watching him from her inscrutable eyes and by a change as abrupt as that of coming from a dark room into the brightness of midday find himself in a lovely garden beside a beautiful girl whom he loved devotedly but who kept him on the ragged edge of an uncertainty that was stimulating enough but very wearing

the summer following colonel frenchs return to clarendon was unusually cool so cool that the colonel pleasantly occupied with his various plans and projects scarcely found the heat less bearable than that of new york at the same season during a brief torrid spell he took phil to a southern mountain resort for a couple of weeks and upon another occasion ran up to new york for a day or two on business in reference to the machinery for the cotton mill which was to be ready for installation some time during the fall but these were brief interludes and did not interrupt the current of his life which was flowing very smoothly and pleasantly in its new channel if not very swiftly for even the colonel was not able to make things move swiftly in clarendon during the summer time and he was well enough pleased to see them move at all

kirby was out of town when the colonel was in new york and therefore he did not see him his mail was being sent from his club to denver where he was presumably looking into some mining proposition mrs jerviss the colonel supposed was at the seaside but he had almost come face to face with her one day on broadway she had run down to the city on business of some sort moved by the instinct of defense the colonel by a quick movement avoided the meeting and felt safer when the lady was well out of sight he did not wish at this time to be diverted from his southern interests and the image of another woman was uppermost in his mind

one moonlight evening a day or two after his return from this brief northern trip the colonel called at mrs treadwells caroline opened the door mrs treadwell she said was lying down miss graciella had gone over to a neighbours but would soon return miss laura was paying a call but would not be long would the colonel wait no he said he would take a walk and come back later

the streets were shady and the moonlight bathed with a silvery glow that part of the town which the shadows did not cover strolling aimlessly along the quiet unpaved streets the colonel upon turning a corner saw a lady walking a short distance ahead of him he thought he recognised the figure and hurried forward but ere he caught up with her she turned and went into one of a row of small houses which he knew belonged to nichols the coloured barber and were occupied by coloured people thinking he had been mistaken in the womans identity he slackened his pace and ere he had passed out of hearing caught the tones of a piano accompanying the words  i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls with vassals and serfs at my siide

it was doubtless the barbers daughter the barbers was the only coloured family in town that owned a piano in the moonlight and at a distance of some rods the song sounded well enough and the colonel lingered until it ceased and the player began to practise scales when he continued his walk he had smoked a couple of cigars and was returning toward mrs treadwells when he met face to face miss laura treadwell coming out of the barbers house he lifted his hat and put out his hand

i called at the house a while ago and you were all out i was just going back ill walk along with you

miss laura was visibly embarrassed at the meeting the colonel gave no sign that he noticed her emotion but went on talking

it is a delightful evening he said

yes she replied and then went on you must wonder what i was doing there

i suppose he said that you were looking for a servant or on some mission of kindness and good will

miss laura was silent for a moment and he could feel her hand tremble on the arm he offered her

no henry she said why should i deceive you i did not go to find a servant but to serve i have told you we were poor but not how poor i can tell you what i could not say to others for you have lived away from here and i know how differently from most of us you look at things i went to the barbers house to give the barbers daughter music lessonsâfor money

the colonel laughed contagiously

you taught her to singâ i dreamt that i dwelt in marble halls

yes but you must not judge my work too soon she replied it is not finished yet

you shall let me know when it is done he said and i will walk by and hear the finished product your pupil has improved wonderfully i heard her singing the song the day i came backâthe first time i walked by the old house she sings it much better now you are a good teacher as well as a good woman

miss laura laughed somewhat excitedly but was bent upon her explanation

the girl used to come to the house she said her mother belonged to us before the war and we have been such friends as white and black can be and she wanted to learn to play and offered to pay me well for lessons and i gave them to her we never speak about the money at the house mother knows it but feigns that i do it out of mere kindness and tells me that i am spoiling the coloured people our friends are not supposed to know it and if any of them do they are kind and never speak of it since you have been coming to the house it has not been convenient to teach her there and i have been going to her home in the evening

my dear laura said the colonel remorsefully i have driven you away from your own home and all unwittingly i applaud your enterprise and your public spirit it is a long way from the banjo to the pianoâit marks the progress of a family and foreshadows the evolution of a race and what higher work than to elevate humanity

they had reached the house mrs treadwell had not come down nor had graciella returned they went into the parlour miss laura turned up the lamp

graciella had run over to a neighbours to meet a young lady who was visiting a young lady who was a friend of graciellas she had remained a little longer than she had meant to for among those who had called to see her friends friend was young mr fetters the son of the magnate lately returned home from college barclay fetters was handsome welldressed and wellmannered he had started at one college and had already changed to two others stories of his dissipated habits and reckless extravagance had been bruited about graciella knew his family history and had imbibed the oldfashioned notions of her grandmothers household so that her acknowledgment of the introduction was somewhat cold not to say distant but as she felt the charm of his manner and saw that the other girls were vieing with one another for his notice she felt a certain triumph that he exhibited a marked preference for her conversation her reserve gradually broke down and she was talking with animation and listening with pleasure when she suddenly recollected that colonel french would probably call and that she ought to be there to entertain him for which purpose she had dressed herself very carefully he had not spoken yet but might be expected to speak at any time such marked attentions as his could have but one meaning and for several days she had had a premonition that before the week was out he would seek to know his fate and graciella meant to be kind

anticipating this event she had politely but pointedly discouraged ben dudleys attentions until bens pride of which he had plenty in reserve had awaked to activity at their last meeting he had demanded a definite answer to his oftrepeated question

graciella he had said are you going to marry me yes or no ill not be played with any longer you must marry me for myself or not at all yes or no

then no mr dudley she had replied with spirit and without a moments hesitation  i will not marry you i will never marry you not if i should die an old maid

she was sorry they had not parted friends but she was not to blame after her marriage she would avoid the embarrassment of meeting him by making the colonel take her away sometime she might through her husband be of service to ben and thus make up in part at least for his disappointment

as she ran up through the garden and stepped upon the porchâher slippers were thin and made no soundâshe heard colonel frenchs voice in the darkened parlour some unusual intonation struck her and she moved lightly and almost mechanically forward in the shadow toward a point where she could see through the window and remain screened from observation so intense was her interest in what she heard that she stood with her hand on her heart not even conscious that she was doing a shameful thing

her aunt was seated and colonel french was standing near her an open bible lay upon the table the colonel had taken it up and was reading who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come laura he said the proverb maker was a prophet as well in these words written four thousand years ago he has described you line for line

the glow which warmed her cheek still smooth the light which came into her clear eyes the joy that filled her heart at these kind words put the years to flight and for the moment laura was young again

you have been good to phil the colonel went on and i should like him to be always near you and have your care and you have been kind to me and made me welcome and at home in what might otherwise have seemed after so long an absence a strange land you bring back to me the best of my youth and in you i find the inspiration for good deeds be my wife dear laura and a mother to my boy and we will try to make you happy

oh henry she cried with fluttering heart i am not worthy to be your wife i know nothing of the world where you have lived nor whether i would fit into it

you are worthy of any place he declared and if one please you more than another i shall make your wishes mine

but henry how could i leave my mother and graciella needs my care

you need not leave your motherâshe shall be mine as well as yours graciella is a dear bright child she has in her the making of a noble woman she should be sent away to a good school and i will see to it no dear laura there are no difficulties no giants in the pathway that will not fly or fall when we confront them

he had put his arm around her and lifted her face to his he read his answer in her swimming eyes and when he had reached down and kissed her cheek she buried her head on his shoulder and shed some tears of happiness for this was her secret she was sweet and good she would have made any man happy who had been worthy of her but no man had ever before asked her to be his wife she had lived upon a plane so simple yet so high that men not equally highminded had never ventured to address her and there were few such men and chance had not led them her way as to the othersâ perhaps there were women more beautiful and certainly more enterprising she had not repined she had been busy and contented now this great happiness was vouchsafed her to find in the love of the man whom she admired above all others a womans true career

henry she said when they had sat down on the old haircloth sofa side by side you have made me very happy so happy that i wish to keep my happiness all to myselfâfor a little while will you let me keep our engagement secret until iâam accustomed to it  it may be silly or childish but it seems like a happy dream and i wish to assure myself of its reality before i tell it to anyone else

to me said the colonel smiling tenderly into her eyes it is the realisation of an ideal since we met that day in the cemetery you have seemed to me the embodiment of all that is best of my memories of the old south and your gentleness your kindness your tender grace your selfsacrifice and devotion to duty mark you a queen among women and my heart shall be your throne as to the announcement have it as you willâit is the ladys privilege

you are very good she said tremulously this hour repays me for all i have ever tried to do for others

graciella felt very young indeedâsomewhere in the neighbourhood of ten she put it afterward when she reviewed the situation in a calmer frame of mindâas she crept softly away from the window and around the house to the back door and up the stairs and into her own chamber where all oblivious of danger to her clothes or her complexion she threw herself down upon her own bed and burst into a passion of tears she had been cruelly humiliated colonel french whom she had imagined in love with her had regarded her merely as a child who ought to be sent to schoolâto acquire what she asked herself good sense or deportment perhaps she might acquire more good senseâshe had certainly made a fool of herself in this caseâbut she had prided herself upon her manners colonel french had been merely playing with her like one would with a pet monkey and he had been in love all the time with her aunt laura whom the girls had referred to compassionately only that same evening as a hopeless old maid

it is fortunate that youth and hope go generally hand in hand graciella possessed a buoyant spirit to breast the waves of disappointment she had her cry out a good long cry and when much weeping had dulled the edge of her discomfiture she began to reflect that all was not yet lost the colonel would not marry her but he would still marry in the family when her aunt laura became mrs french she would doubtless go often to new york if she would not live there always she would invite graciella to go with her perhaps to live with her there as for going to school that was a matter which her own views should control at present she had no wish to return to school she might take lessons in music or art her aunt would hardly care for her to learn stenography now or go into magazine work her aunt would surely not go to europe without inviting her and colonel french was very liberal with his money and would deny his wife nothing though graciella could hardly imagine that any man would be infatuated with her aunt laura

but this was not the end of graciellas troubles graciella had a heart although she had suppressed its promptings under the influence of a selfish ambition she had thrown ben dudley over for the colonel the colonel did not want her and now she would have neither ben had been very angry unreasonably angry she had thought at the time and objectionably rude in his manner he had sworn never to speak to her again if he should keep his word she might be very unhappy these reflections brought on another rush of tears and a very penitent contrite humbleminded young woman cried herself to sleep before miss laura with a heart bursting with happiness bade the colonel goodnight at the gate and went upstairs to lie awake in her bed in a turmoil of pleasant emotions

miss lauras happiness lay not alone in the prospect that colonel french would marry her nor in any sordid thought of what she would gain by becoming the wife of a rich man it rested in the fact that this man whom she admired and who had come back from the outer world to bring fresh ideas new and larger ideals to lift and broaden and revivify the town had passed by youth and beauty and vivacity and had chosen her to share this task to form the heart and mind and manners of his child and to be the tie which would bind him most strongly to her dear south for she was a true child of the soil the people about her white and black were her people and this marriage with its larger opportunities for usefulness would help her to do that for which hitherto she had only been able to pray and to hope to the boy she would be a mother indeed to lead him in the paths of truth and loyalty and manliness and the fear of godâit was a priceless privilege and already her motherheart yearned to begin the task

and then after the flow came the ebb why had he chosen her was it merely as an abstractionâthe embodiment of an ideal a survival from a host of pleasant memories and as a mother for his child who needed care which no one else could give and as a helpmate in carrying out his schemes of benevolence were these his only motives and if so were they sufficient to ensure her happiness was he marrying her through a mere sentimental impulse or for calculated convenience or from both she must be certain for his views might change he was yet in the full flow of philanthropic enthusiasm she shared his faith in human nature and the triumph of right ideas but once or twice she had feared he was underrating the power of conservative forces that he had been away from clarendon so long as to lose the perspective of actual conditions and that he was cherishing expectations which might be disappointed should this ever prove true his disillusion might be as farreaching and as sudden as his enthusiasm then if he had not loved her for herself she might be very unhappy she would have rejoiced to bring him youth and beauty and the things for which other women were preferred she would have loved to be the perfect mate one in heart mind soul and body with the man with whom she was to share the journey of life

but this was a passing thought born of weakness and selfdistrust and she brushed it away with the tear that had come with it and smiled at its absurdity her youth was past with nothing to expect but an old age filled with the small expedients of genteel poverty there had opened up to her suddenly and unexpectedly a great avenue for happiness and usefulness it was foolish with so much to be grateful for to sigh for the unattainable his love must be all the stronger since it took no thought of things which others would have found of controlling importance in choosing her to share his intellectual life he had paid her a higher compliment than had he praised the glow of her cheek or the contour of her throat in confiding phil to her care he had given her a sacred trust and confidence for she knew how much he loved the child

the colonels schemes for the improvement of clarendon went forward with occasional setbacks several kilns of brick turned out badly so that the brickyard fell behind with its orders thus delaying the work a few weeks the foundations of the old cotton mill had been substantially laid and could be used so far as their position permitted for the new walls when the bricks were ready a gang of masons was put to work white men and coloured were employed under a white foreman so great was the demand for labour and so stimulating the colonels liberal wage that even the drowsy negroes around the market house were all at work and the pigs who had slept near them were obliged to bestir themselves to keep from being run over by the wagons that were hauling brick and lime and lumber through the streets even the cows in the vacant lot between the postoffice and the bank occasionally lifted up their gentle eyes as though wondering what strange fever possessed the twolegged creatures around them urging them to such unnatural activity

the work went on smoothly for a week or two when the colonel had some words with jim green the white foreman of the masons the cause of the dispute was not important but the colonel as the master insisted that certain work should be done in a certain way green wished to argue the point the colonel brought the discussion to a close with a peremptory command the foreman took offense declared that he was no nigger to be ordered around and quit the colonel promoted to the vacancy george brown a coloured man who was the next best workman in the gang

on the day when brown took charge of the job the white bricklayers of whom there were two at work laid down their tools

whats the matter asked the colonel when they reported for their pay arent you satisfied with the wages 

yes weve got no fault to find with the wages

well

we wont work under george brown we dont mind working with niggers but we wont work under a nigger

im sorry gentlemen but i must hire my own men here is your money

they would have preferred to argue their grievance and since the colonel had shut off discussion they went down to clay jacksons saloon and argued the ease with all comers with the usual distortion attending onesided argument jim green had been superseded by a niggerâthis was the burden of their grievance

thus came the thin entering wedge that was to separate the colonel from a measure of his popularity there had been no objection to the colonels employing negroes no objection to his helping their schoolâif he chose to waste his money that way but there were many who took offense when a negro was preferred to a white man

through caxton the colonel learned of this criticism the colonel showed no surprise and no annoyance but in his usual goodhumoured way replied well go right along and pay no attention to him there were only two white men in the gang and they have never worked under the negro they quit as soon as i promoted him i have hired many men in my time and have made it an unvarying rule to manage my own business in my own way if anybody says anything to you about it you tell them just that these people have got to learn that we live in an industrial age and success demands of an employer that he utilise the most available labour after green was discharged george brown was the best mason left he gets more work out of the men than green didâeven in the old slave times negroes made the best of overseers they knew their own people better than white men could and got more out of them when the mill is completed it will give employment to five hundred white women and fifty white men but every dog must have his day so give the negro his

the colonel attached no great importance to the incident the places of the workmen were filled and the work wept forward he knew the southern sensitiveness and viewed it with a goodnatured tolerance which however stopped at injustice to himself or others the very root of his reform was involved in the proposition to discharge a competent foreman because of an unreasonable prejudice matters of feeling were all well enough in some respectsâno one valued more highly than the colonel the right to choose his own associatesâbut the right to work and to do ones best work was fundamental as was the right to have ones work done by those who could do it best even a healthy social instinct might be perverted into an unhealthy and unjust prejudice most things evil were the perversion of good

the feeling with which the colonel thus came for the first time directly in contact a smouldering fire capable always of being fanned into flame had been greatly excited by the political campaign which began about the third month after his arrival in clarendon an ambitious politician in a neighbouring state had led a successful campaign on the issue of negro disfranchisement plainly unconstitutional it was declared to be as plainly necessary for the preservation of the white race and white civilisation the example had proved contagious and fetters and his crowd who dominated their state had raised the issue there at first the pronouncement met with slight response the sister state had possessed a negro majority which in view of reconstruction history was theoretically capable of injuring the state such was not the case here the state had survived reconstruction with small injury white supremacy existed in the main by virtue of white efficiency as compared with efficiency of a lower grade there had been places and instances where other methods had been occasionally employed to suppress the negro vote but taken as a whole the supremacy of the w hite man was secure no negro had held a state office for twenty years in clarendon they had even ceased to be summoned as jurors and when a negro met a white man he gave him the wall even if it were necessary to take the gutter to do so but this was not enough this supremacy must be made permanent negroes must be taught that they need never look for any different state of things new definitions were given to old words new pictures set in old frames new wine poured into old bottles

so long said the candidate for governor when he spoke at clarendon during the canvass at a meeting presided over by the editor of the anglosaxon so long as one negro votes in the state so long are we face to face with the nightmare of negro domination for example suppose a difference of opinion among white men so radical as to divide their vote equally the ballot of one negro would determine the issue can such a possibility be contemplated without a shudder  our duty to ourselves to our children and their unborn descendants and to our great and favoured race impels us to protest by word by vote by arms if need be against the enforced equality of an inferior race equality anywhere means ultimately equality everywhere equality at the poils means social equality social equality means intermarriage and corruption of blood and degeneration and decay what gentleman here would want his daughter to marry a blubberlipped cocoanutheaded kidneyfooted etc etc nigger

there could be but one answer to the question and it came in thunders of applause colonel french heard the speech smiled at the old arguments but felt a sudden gravity at the deepseated feeling which they evoked he remembered hearing when a boy the same arguments they had served their purpose once before with other issues to plunge the south into war and consequent disaster had the lesson been in vain he did not see the justice nor the expediency of the proposed antinegro agitation but he was not in politics and confined his protests to argument with his friends who listened but were not convinced

behind closed doors more than one of the prominent citizens admitted that the campaign was all wong that the issues were unjust and reactionary and that the best interests of the state lay in uplifting every element of the people rather than selecting some one class for discouragement and degradation and that the white race could hold its own with the negroes or against them in any conceivable state of political equality they listened to the colonels quiet argument that no state could be freer or greater or more enlightened than the average of its citizenship and that any restriction of rights that rested upon anything but impartial justice was bound to react as slavery had done upon the prosperity and progress of the state they listened which the colonel regarded as a great point gained and they agreed in part and he could almost understand why they let their feelings govern their reason and their judgment and said no word to prevent an unfair and unconstitutional scheme from going forward to a successful issue he knew that for a white man to declare in such a community for equal rights or equal justice for the negro or to take the negros side in any case where the race issue was raised was to court social ostracism and political death or if the feeling provoked were strong enough an even more complete form of extinction

so the colonel was patient and meant to be prudent his own arguments avoided the stirring up of prejudice and were directed to the higher motives and deeper principles which underlie society in the light of which humanity is more than race and the welfare of the state above that of any man or set of men within it it being an axiom as true in statesmanship as in mathematics that the whole is greater than any one of its parts content to await the uplifting power of industry and enlightenment and supremely confident of the result the colonel went serenely forward in his work of sowing that others might reap

the atmosphere of the treadwell home was charged for the next few days with electric currents graciella knew that her aunt was engaged to colonel french but she had not waited the night before to hear her aunt express the wish that the engagement should be kept secret she was therefore bursting with information of which she could manifest no consciousness without confessing that she had been eavesdroppingâa thing which she knew miss laura regarded as detestably immoral she wondered at her aunts silence except a certain subdued air of happiness there was nothing to distinguish miss lauras calm demeanor from that of any other day graciella had determined upon her own attitude toward her aunt she would kiss her and wish her happiness and give no sign that any thought of colonel french had ever entered her own mind but this little drama rehearsed in the privacy of her own room went unacted since the curtain did not rise upon the stage

the colonel came and went as usual some dissimulation was required on graciellas part to preserve her usual lighthearted manner toward him she may have been to blame in taking the colonels attentions as intended for herself she would not soon forgive his slighting reference to her in his eyes she had been only a child who ought to go to school he had been good enough to say that she had the making of a fine woman thanks  she had had a lover for at least two years and a proposal of marriage before colonel frenchs shadow had fallen athwart her life she wished her aunt laura happiness no one could deserve it more but was it possible to be happy with a man so lacking in taste and judgment 

her aunts secret began to weigh upon her mind and she effaced herself as much as possible when the colonel came her grandmother had begun to notice this and comment upon it when the happening of a certain social event created a diversion this was the annual entertainment known as the assembly ball it was usually held later in the year but owing to the presence of several young lady visitors in the town it had been decided to give it early in the fall

the affair was in the hands of a committee by whom invitations were sent to most people in the county who had any claims to gentility the gentlemen accepting were expected to subscribe to the funds for hall rent music and refreshments these were always the best the town afforded the ball was held in the opera house a rather euphemistic title for the large hall above barstows cotton warehouse where thirdclass theatrical companies played onenight stands several times during the winter and where an occasional lecturer or conjurer held forth an amateur performance of pinafore  had once been given there henry w grady had lectured there upon white supremacy the reverend sam small had preached there on hell it was also distinguished as having been refused even at the request of the state commissioner of education as a place for booker t washington to deliver an address which had been given at the town hall instead the assembly balls had always been held in the opera house in former years the music had been furnished by local negro musicians but there were no longer any of these and a band of string music was brought in from another town so far as mere wealth was concerned the subscribers touched such extremes as ben dudley on the one hand and colonel french on the other and included barclay fetters whom graciella had met on the evening before her disappointment

the treadwell ladies were of course invited and the question of ways and means became paramount new gowns and other accessories were imperative miss lauras one party dress had done service until it was past redemption and this was graciellas first assembly ball miss laura took stock of the familys resources and found that she could afford only one gown this of course must be graciellas her own marriage would entail certain expenses which demanded some present selfdenial she had played wallflower for several years but now that she was sure of a partner it was a real sacrifice not to attend the ball but graciella was young and in such matters youth has a prior right for she had yet to find her mate

graciella magnanimously offered to remain at home but was easily prevailed upon to go she was not entirely happy for the humiliating failure of her hopes had left her for the moment without a recognised admirer and the fear of old maidenhood had again laid hold of her heart her aunt lauras case was no consoling example not one man in a hundred would choose a wife for colonel frenchs reasons most men married for beauty and graciella had been told that beauty that matured early like her own was likely to fade early

one humiliation she was spared she had been as silent about her hopes as miss laura was about her engagement whether this was due to mere prudence or to vanityâthe hope of astonishing her little world by the unexpected announcementâdid not change the comforting fact that she had nothing to explain and nothing for which to be pitied if her friends after the manner of young ladies had hinted at the subject and sought to find a meaning in colonel frenchs friendship she had smiled enigmatically for this selfrestraint whatever had been its motive she now reaped her reward the announcement of her aunts engagement would account for the colonels attentions to graciella as a mere courtesy to a young relative of his affianced

with regard to ben graciella was quite uneasy she had met him only once since their quarrel and had meant to bow to him politely but with dignity to show that she bore no malice but he had ostentatiously avoided her glance if he chose to be illnatured she had thought and preferred her enmity to her friendship her conscience was at least clear she had been willing to forget his rudeness and be a friend to him she could have been his true friend if nothing more and he would need friends unless he changed a great deal

when her mental atmosphere was cleared by the fading of her dream ben assumed larger proportions perhaps he had had cause for complaint at least it was only just to admit that he thought so nor had he suffered in her estimation by his display of spirit in not waiting to be jilted but in forcing her hand before she was quite ready to play it she could scarcely expect him to attend her to the ball but he was among the subscribers and could hardly avoid meeting her or dancing with her without pointed rudeness if he did not ask her to dance then either the virginia reel or the lancers or quadrilles would surely bring them together and though graciella sighed she did not despair she could of course allay his jealousy at once by telling him of her aunt lauras engagement but this was not yet practicable she must find some other way of placating him

ben dudley also had a problem to face in reference to the ballâa problem which has troubled impecunious youth since balls were inventedâthe problem of clothes he was not obliged to go to the ball graciellas outrageous conduct relieved him of any obligation to invite her and there was no other woman with whom he would have cared to go or who would have cared so far as he knew to go with him for he was not a ladys man and but for his distant relationship would probably never have gone to the treadwells he was looked upon by young women as slow and he knew that graciella had often been impatient at his lack of sprightliness he could pay his subscription which was really a sort of gentility tax the failure to meet which would merely forfeit future invitations and remain at home he did not own a dress suit nor had he the money to spare for one he or they for he and his uncle were one in such matters were in debt already up to the limit of their credit and he had sold the last bale of old cotton to pay the last months expenses while the new crop already partly mortgaged was not yet picked he knew that some young fellows in town rented dress suits from solomon cohen who though he kept only four suits in stock at a time would send to new york for others to rent out on this occasion and return them afterwards but ben would not wear another mans clothes he had borne insults from graciella that he never would have borne from any one else and that he would never bear again but there were things at which his soul protested nor would cohens suits have fitted him he was so much taller than the average man for whom store clothes were made

he remained in a state of indecision until the day of the ball late in the evening he put on his black cutaway coat which was getting a little small trousers to match and a white waistcoat and started to town on horseback so as to arrive in time for the ball in case he should decide at the last moment to take part

the opera house was brilliantly lighted on the night of the assembly ball the dancers gathered at an earlier hour than is the rule in the large cities many of the guests came in from the country and returned home after the ball since the hotel could accommodate only a part of them

when ben dudley having left his horse at a livery stable walked up main street toward the hall carriages were arriving and discharging their freight the ladies were prettily gowned their faces were bright and animated and ben observed that most of the gentlemen wore dress suits but also much to his relief that a number sufficient to make at least a respectable minority did not he was rapidly making up his mind to enter when colonel frenchs carriage drawn by a pair of dashing bays and driven by a negro in livery dashed up to the door and discharged miss graciella treadwell radiantly beautiful in a new lowcut pink gown with pink flowers in her hair a thin gold chain with a gold locket at the end around her slender throat white slippers on her feet and long white gloves upon her shapely hands and wists

ben shrank back into the shadow he had never been of an envious disposition he had always looked upon envy as a mean vice unworthy of a gentleman but for a moment something very like envy pulled at his heartstrings graciella worshipped the golden calf he worshipped graciella but he had no money he could not have taken her to the ball in a closed carriage drawn by blooded horses and driven by a darky in livery

graciellas cavalier wore with the ease and grace of long habit an evening suit of some fine black stuff that almost shone in the light from the open door at the sight of him the waist of bens own coat shrunk up to the armpits and he felt a sinking of the heart as they passed out of his range of vision he would not appear to advantage by the side of colonel french and he would not care to appear otherwise than to advantage in graciellas eyes he would not like to make more palpable by contrast the difference between colonel french and himself nor could he be haughty distant reproachful or anything but painfully selfconscious in a coat that was not of the proper cut too short in the sleeves and too tight under the arms

while he stood thus communing with his own bitter thoughts another carriage drawn by a pair of beautiful black horses drew up to the curb in front of him the horses were restive and not inclined to stand still some one from the inside of the carriage called to the coachman through the open window

ransom said the voice stay on the box here you open this carriage door 

ben looked around for the person addressed but saw no one near but himself

you boy there by the curb open this door will you or hold the horses so my coachman can  

are you speaking to me demanded ben angrily

just then one of the sidelights of the carriage flashed on bens face

oh i beg pardon said the man in the carriage carelessly i took you for a nigger

there could be no more deadly insult though the mistake was not unnatural ben was dark and the shadow made him darker

ben was furious the stranger had uttered words of apology but his tone had been insolent and his apology was more offensive than his original blunder had it not been for bens reluctance to make a disturbance he would have struck the offender in the mouth if he had had a pistol he could have shot him his great uncle ralph for instance would not have let him live an hour

while these thoughts were surging through his heated brain the young man as immaculately clad as colonel french had been left the carriage from which he helped a lady and with her upon his arm entered the hall in the light that streamed from the doorway ben recognised him as barclay fetters who having finished a checkered scholastic career had been at home at sycamore for several months much of this time he had spent in clarendon where his fathers wealth and influence gave him entrance to good society in spite of an ancestry which mere character would not have offset he knew young fetters very well by sight since the latter had to pass mink run whenever he came to town from sycamore fetters may not have known him since he had been away for much of the time in recent years but he ought to have been able to distinguish between a white manâa gentlemanâand a negro it was the insolence of an upstart old josh fetters had been in his younger days his uncles overseer an overseers grandson treated him ben dudley like dirt under his feet  perhaps he had judged him by his clothes he would like to show barclay fetters if they ever stood face to face that clothes did not make the man nor the gentleman

ben decided after this encounter that he would not go on the floor of the ballroom but unable to tear himself away he waited until everybody seemed to have gone in then went up the stairs and gained access by a back way to a dark gallery in the rear of the hall which the ushers had deserted for the ballroom from which he could without discovery look down upon the scene below his eyes flew to graciella as the needle to the pole she was dancing with colonel french

the music stopped and a crowd of young fellows surrounded her when the next dance which was a waltz began she moved out upon the floor in the arms of barclay fetters

ben swore beneath his breath he had heard tales of barclay fetters which if true made him unfit to touch a decent woman he left the hall walked a short distance down a street and around the corner to the bar in the rear of the hotel where he ordered a glass of whiskey he had never been drunk in his life and detested the taste of liquor but he was desperate and had to do something he would drink till he was drunk and forget his troubles having never been intoxicated he had no idea whatever of the effect liquor would have upon him

with each succeeding drink the sense of his wongs broadened and deepened at one stage his intoxication took the form of an intense selfpity there was something rotten in the whole scheme of things why should he be poor while others were rich and while fifty thousand dollars in gold were hidden in or around the house where he lived  why should colonel french an old man who was of no better blood than himself be rich enough to rob him of the woman whom he loved  and why above all should barclay fetters have education and money and every kind of opportunity which he did not appreciate while he who would have made good use of them had nothing with this sense of wong which grew as his brain clouded more and more there came side by side a vague zeal to right these wongs as he grew drunker still his thoughts grew less coherent he lost sight of his special grievance and merely retained the combative instinct

he had reached this dangerous stage and had fortunately passed it one step farther along the road to unconsciousnessâfortunately because had he been sober the result of that which was to follow might have been more seriousâwhen two young men who had come down from the ballroom for some refreshment entered the barroom and asked for cocktails while the barkeeper was compounding the liquor the young men spoke of the ball

that little treadwell girl is a peach said one i could tote a bunch of beauty like that around the ballroom all night

the remark was not exactly respectful nor yet exactly disrespectful ben looked up from his seat the speaker was barclay fetters and his companion one tom mc rae another dissolute young man of the town ben got up unsteadily and walked over to where they stood

i want you to unerstan he said thickly that no genlman would menshn a ladys name in a place like this or shpeak dissuspeckerly bout a lady n any place an i want you to unerstan futhermo that youre no genlman an that im goint lick you by gâd

the hell you are returned fetters a scowl of surprise rose on his handsome face and he sprang to an attitude of defence

ben suited the action to the word and struck at fetters but ben was drunk and the other two were sober and in three minutes ben lay on the floor with a sore head and a black eye his nose was bleeding copiously and the crimson stream had run down upon his white shirt and vest taken all in all his appearance was most disreputable by this time the liquor he had drunk had its full effect and complete unconsciousness supervened to save him for a little while from the realisation of his disgrace

who is the mucker anyway asked barclay fetters readjusting his cuffs which had slipped down in the melee

hes a chap by the name of dudley answered mc rae lives at mink run between here and sycamore you know

oh yes ive seen himâthe po white chap that lives with the old lunatic thats always digging for buried treasurefor my name was captain kidd as i sailed as i sailed but lets hurry back tom or well lose the next dance

fetters and his companion returned to the ball the barkeeper called a servant of the hotel with whose aid ben was carried upstairs and put to bed bruised in body and damaged in reputation

bens fight with young fetters became a matter of public comment the next day after the ball his conduct was cited as sad proof of the degeneracy of a once fine old family he had been considered shiftless and not well educated but no one had suspected that he was a drunkard and a rowdy other young men in the town highspirited young fellows with plenty of money sometimes drank a little too much and occasionally for a point of honour gentlemen were obliged to attack or defend themselves but when they did they used pistols a gentlemans weapon here however was an unprovoked and brutal attack with fists upon two gentlemen in evening dress and without weapons to defend themselves one of them said the anglosaxon the son of our distinguished fellow citizen and colleague in the legislature the honourable william fetters

when colonel french called to see miss laura the afternoon of next day after the ball the ladies were much concerned about the affair

oh henry exclaimed miss laura what is this dreadful story about ben dudley they say he was drinking at the hotel and became intoxicated and that when barclay fetters and tom mc rae went into the hotel he said something insulting about graciella and when they rebuked him for his freedom he attacked them violently and that when finally subdued he was put to bed unconscious and disgracefully intoxicated graciella is very angry and we all feel ashamed enough to sink into the ground what can be the matter with ben he hasnt been around lately and he has quarrelled with graciella i never would have expected anything like this from ben

 it came from his greatuncle ralph said mrs treadwell ralph was very wild when he was young but settled down into a very polished gentleman i danced with him once when he was drunk and i never knew itâ it was my first ball and i was intoxicated myself with excitement mother was scandalised but father laughed and said boys would be boys but poor ben hasnt had his uncles chances and while he has always behaved well here he could hardly be expected to carry his liquor like a gentleman of the old school

my dear ladies said the colonel we have heard only one side of the story i guess theres no doubt ben was intoxicated but we know he isnt a drinking man and one drinkâor even one drunkâdoesnt make a drunkard nor one fight a rowdy barclay fetters and tom mc rae are not immaculate and perhaps ben can exonerate himself

i certainly hope so said miss laura earnestly i am sorry for ben but i could not permit a drunken rowdy to come to the house or let my niece be seen upon the street with him

it would only be fair said the colonel to give him a chance to explain when he comes in again i rather like ben he has some fine mechanical ideas and the making of a man in him unless i am mistaken i have been hoping to find a place for him in the new cotton mill when it is ready to run

they were still speaking of ben when there was an irresolute knock at the rear door of the parlour in which they were seated

miss laura o miss laura came a muffled voice

kin i speak to you a minute its mighty pertickler miss laura fo god it is 

laura said the colonel bring catharine in i saw that you were troubled once before when you were compelled to refuse her something henceforth your burdens shall be mine come in catharine he called and tell us whats the matter whats your trouble  whats it all about

the woman redeyed from weeping came in winging her apron

miss laura she sobbed an colonel french my husban bud is done gone and got inter mo trouble hes run away pin mistah fettuhs wat he wuz sol back to in de spring an hes done ben fine fifty dollahs mo an hes gwine ter be sol back ter mistah fettuhs in de mawnin fer ter finish out de ole fine and wok out de new one is ben ter see im in de gyard house an be say mistah haines wat use ter be de constable and is a gyard fer mistah fettuhs now beat an bused him so he couldn stan it an ceptin i could pay all dem fines hell be tuck back dere an he say ef dey evah beats him agin deyll eithuh haf ter kill him er hell kill some er dem an bud is a rash man miss laura an im feared dat hell do wat he say an ef dey kills him er he kills any er dem itll be all de same ter meâill never seem no mo in dis worl ef i could borry de money miss lauraâmars colonelâid wuk my fingers ter de bone tel i paid back de las cent er ef youd buy bud suh lack you did unc peter he would n mind wukkin fer you suh fer bud is a good wukker wen folks treats him right an he had n never had no trouble nowhar befo he come hyuh suh

how did he come to be arrested the first time asked the colonel

he didnt live hyuh suh i used ter live hyuh an i maied him down ter madison where i wuz wukkin we fell out one day an i got mad and lef imâit wuz all my fault an i ben payin fer it evuh sinceâan i come back home an went ter wuk hyuh an he come aftuh me an de fus day he come befo i knowed he wuz hyuh dis yer mistah haines tuck im up an lock im up in de gyard house like a hog in de poun an he didn know nobody an dey didn give im no chanst ter see nobody an dey tuck im roun ter squi reddick nex mawmin an fined im an sol im ter dis yer mistuh fettuhs fer ter wok out de fine an i ben wantin all dis time ter hyuh fum im an id done ben an gone back ter madison to look fer im an foun he wuz gone an god knows i didn know what had become er im tel he run awray de yuther time an dey tuck im an sent im back again an he hadn done nothin de fus time suh but de lawd know wat he won do ef dey sens im back any mo

catharine had put her apron to her eyes and was sobbing bitterly the story was probably true the colonel had heard underground rumours about the fetters plantation and the manner in which it was supplied with labourers and his own experience in old peters case had made them seem not unlikely he had seen catharines husband in the justices court and the next day in the convict gang behind turners buggy the man had not looked like a criminal that he was surly and desperate may as well have been due to a sense of rank injustice as to an evil nature that a wong had been done under cover of law was at least more than likely but a deed of mercy could be made to right it the love of money might be the root of all evil but its control was certainly a means of great good the colonel glowed with the consciousness of this beneficent power to scatter happiness

laura he said i will attend to this it is a matter about which you should not be troubled dont be alarmed catharine just be a good girl and help miss laura all you can and ill look after your husband and pay his fine and let him work it out as a free man

thanky suh thanky mars colonel an miss laura an de lawd is gwine bless you suh you an my sweet young lady fuh bein good to po folks wat cant do nuthin to hep deyseves out er trouble said catharine backing out with her apron to her eyes

on leaving miss laura the colonel went round to the office of squire reddick the justice of the peace to inquire into the matter of bud johnson the justice was out of town his clerk said but would be in his office at nine in the morning at which time the colonel could speak to him about johnsons fine

the next morning was bright and clear and cool enough to be bracing the colonel alive with pleasant thoughts rose early and after a cold bath and a leisurely breakfast walked over to the mill site where the men were already at work having looked the work over and given certain directions he glanced at his watch and finding it near nine set out for the justices office in time to reach it by the appointed hour squire reddick was at his desk upon which his feet rested while he read a newspaper he looked up with an air of surprise as the colonel entered

why good mornin colonel french he said genially i kind of expected you a while ago the clerk said you might be around but you didn come so i supposed youd changed yo mind

the clerk said that you would be here at nine replied the colonel it is only just nine

did he well now thats too bad  i do generally git around about nine but i was earlier this mornin and as everybody was here we started in a little sooner than usual you wanted to see me about bud johnson  yes i wish to pay his fine and give him work

well thats too bad but you werent here and mr turner was and he bought his time again for mr fetters im sorry you know but first come first served

the colonel was seriously annoyed he did not like to believe there was a conspiracy to frustrate his good intention but that result had been accomplished whether by accident or design he had failed in the first thing he had undertaken for the woman he loved and was to marry he would see fetters man however and come to some arrangement with him with fetters the hiring of the negro was purely a commercial transaction conditioned upon a probable profit for the immediate payment of which and a liberal bonus he would doubtless relinquish his claim upon johnsons services

learning that turner who had acted as fetterss agent in the matter had gone over to clay johnsons saloon he went to seek him there he found him and asked for a proposition turner heard him out

well colonel french he replied with slightly veiled insolence i bought this niggers time for mr fetters an unless im mightly mistaken in mr fetters no amount of money can get the nigger until hes served his time out hes defied our rules and defied the law and defied me and assaulted one of the guards and he ought to be made an example of we want to keep im hes a bad nigger an weve got to handle a lot of em an we need im for an exampleâhe keeps us in trainin

have you any power in the matter demanded the colonel restraining his contempt

me no not me i couldn let the nigger go for his weight in golâan wouldn if i could i bought im in for mr fetters an hes the only man thats got any say about im

very well said the colonel as he turned away ill see fetters

i dont know whether you will or not said turner to himself as he shot a vindictive glance at the colonels retreating figure fetters has got this county where he wants it an ill bet dollars to bird shot he aint goin to let no coonflavoured nothen interloper come down here an mix up with his arrangements even if he did hail from this town way back yonder this here nigger problem is a southen problem and outsiders mights well keep their hans off me and haines an fetters is the kind o men to settle it

the colonel was obliged to confess to miss laura his temporary setback which he went around to the house and did immediately

its the first thing ive undertaken yet for your sake laura and ive got to report failure so far

its only the first step she said consolingly

thats all ill drive out to fetterss place tomorrow and arrange the matter by starting before day i can make it and transact my business and get back by night without hurting the horses

catharine was called in and the situation explained to her though clearly disappointed at the delay and not yet free of apprehension that bud might do something rash she seemed serenely confident of the colonels ultimate success in her simple creed god might sometimes seem to neglect his black children but no harm could come to a negro who had a rich white gentleman for friend and protector

it was not yet sunrise when the colonel set out next day after an early breakfast upon his visit to fetters there was a crisp freshness in the air the dew was thick upon the grass the clear blue sky gave promise of a bright day and a pleasant journey

the plantation conducted by fetters lay about twenty miles to the south of clarendon and remote from any railroad a convenient location for such an establishment for railroads while they bring in supplies and takeout produce also bring in light and take out information both of which are fatal to certain fungus growths social as well as vegetable which flourish best in the dark

the road led by mink run and the colonel looked over toward the house as they passed it old and weatherbeaten it seemed even in the distance which lent it no enchantment in the bright morning light when the colonel had travelled that road in his boyhood great forests of primeval pine had stretched for miles on either hand broken at intervals by thriving plantations now all was changed the tall and stately growth of the longleaf pine had well nigh disappeared fifteen years before the turpentine industry moving southward from virginia along the upland counties of the appalachian slope had swept through clarendon county leaving behind it a trail of blasted trunks and abandoned stills ere these had yielded to decay the sawmill had followed and after the sawmill the tar kiln so that the dark green forest was now only a waste of blackened stumps and undergrowth topped by the vulgar shortleaved pine and an occasional oak or juniper here and there they passed an expanse of cultivated land and there were many smaller clearings in which could be seen plowing with gaunt mules or stunted steers some heavyfooted negro or listless po white man or women and children black or white in reply to a question the coachman said that mr fetters had worked all that country for turpentine years before and had only taken up cotton raising after the turpentine had been exhausted from the sand hills

he had left his mark thought the colonel like the plague of locusts he had settled and devoured and then moved on leaving a barren waste behind him

as the morning advanced the settlements grew thinner until suddenly upon reaching the crest of a hill a great stretch of cultivated lowland lay spread before them in the centre of the plantation near the road which ran through it stood a square new freshly painted frame house which would not have seemed out of place in some ohio or michigan city but here struck a note alien to its surroundings off to one side like the negro quarters of another generation were several rows of low unpainted cabins built of sawed lumber the boards running up and down and battened with strips where the edges met the fields were green with cotton and with com and there were numerous gangs of men at work with an apparent zeal quite in contrast with the leisurely movement of those they had passed on the way it was a very pleasing scene

 dis yer suh said the coachman in an awed tone is mistah fetterss plantation you ain gwine off nowhere and leave me alone whils you are hyuh is you suh

no said the colonel ill keep my eye on you nobodyll trouble you while youre with me

passing a clump of low trees the colonel came upon a group at sight of which he paused involuntarily a gang of negroes were at work upon the ankles of some was riveted an iron band to which was soldered a chain at the end of which in turn an iron ball was fastened accompanying them was a white man in whose belt was stuck a revolver and who carried in one hand a stout leather strap about two inches in width with a handle by which to grasp it the gang paused momentarily to look at the traveller but at a meaning glance from the overseer fell again to their work of hoeing cotton the white man stepped to the fence and colonel french addressed him

good morning

mornin suh

will you tell me where i can find mr fetters inquired the colonel

no suh unless hes at the house he may have went away this mornin but i havent heard of it but you drive along the road to the house an somebodyll tell you

the colonel seemed to have seen the overseer before but could not remember where

sam he asked the coachman who is that white man 

dats mistah haines suhâuse ter be de constable at claendon suh i wouldn lak to be in no gang under him suh sho i wouldn no suh

after this ejaculation which seemed sincere as well as fervent sam whipped up the horses and soon reached the house a negro boy came out to meet them

is mr fetters at home inquired the colonel

iâi don know suhâiâill ax mars turner hes hyuh

he disappeared round the house and in a few minutes returned with turner with whom the colonel exchanged curt nods

i wish to see mr fetters said the colonel

well you cant see him

why not

because he aint here he left for the capital this mornin to be gone a week youll be havin a fine drive down here and back

the colonel ignored the taunt

 when will mr fetters return  he inquired

im shore i dont know he dont tell me his secrets but ill tell you colonel french that if youre after that nigger youre wastin your time hes in hainess gang and haines loves him so well that mr fetters has to keep bud in order to keep haines theres no accountin for these vilent affections but theyre human natur and they have to be umoured

ill talk to your master rejoined the colonel restraining his indignation and turning away

turner looked after him vindictively

hell talk to my master like as if i was a nigger it ll be a long time before he talks to fetters if thats who he meansâif i can prevent it not that it would make any difference but ill just keep him on the anxious seat

it was nearing noon but the colonel had received no invitation to stop or eat or feed his horses he ordered sam to turn and drive back the way they had come

as they neared the group of labourers they had passed before the colonel saw four negroes in response to an imperative gesture from the overseer seize one of their number a short thickset fellow overpower some small resistance which he seemed to make throw him down with his face to the ground and sit upon his extremities while the overseer applied the broad leathern thong vigorously to his bare back

the colonel reached over and pulled the reins mechanically his instinct was to interfere had he been near enough to recognise in the negro the object of his visit bud johnson and in the overseer the exconstable haines he might have yielded to the impulse but on second thought he realised that he had neither authority nor strength to make good his interference for aught he knew the performance might be strictly according to law so fighting a feeling of nausea which he could hardly conquer he ordered sam to drive on

the coachman complied with alacrity as though glad to escape from a mighty dangerous place he had known friendless coloured folks who had strayed down in that neighbourhood to be lost for a long time and he had heard of a spot far back from the road in a secluded part of the plantation where the graves of convicts who had died while in fetterss service were very numerous

during the next month the colonel made several attempts to see fetters but some fatality seemed always to prevent their meeting he finally left the matter of finding fetters to caxton who ascertained that fetters would be in attendance at court during a certain week at carthage the county seat of the adjoining county where the colonel had been once before to inspect a cotton mill thither the colonel went on the day of the opening of court his train reached town toward noon and he went over to the hotel he wondered if he would find the proprietor sitting where he had found him some weeks before but the buggy was gone from before the piazza and there was a new face behind the desk the colonel registered left word that he would be in to dinner and then wont over to the court house which lay behind the trees across the square

the court house was an old square hiproofed brick structure whose walls whitewashed the year before had been splotched and discoloured by the weather from one side under the eaves projected a beam which supported a bell rung by a rope from the window below a hall ran through the centre on either side of which were the county offices while the court room with a judges room and jury room occupied the upper floor

the colonel made his way across the square which showed the usual signs of court being in session there were buggies hitched to trees and posts here and there a few negroes sleeping in the sun and several old coloured women with little stands for the sale of cakes and fried fish and cider

the colonel went upstairs to the court room it was fairly well filled and he remained standing for a few minutes near the entrance the civil docket was evidently on trial for there was a jury in the box and a witness was being examined with some prolixity with reference to the use of a few inches of land which lay on one side or on the other of a disputed boundary from what the colonel could gather that particular line fence dispute had been in litigation for twenty years had cost several lives and had resulted in a feud that involved a whole township

the testimony was about concluded when the colonel entered and the lawyers began their arguments the feeling between the litigants seemed to have affected their attorneys and the court more than once found it necessary to call counsel to order the trial was finished however without bloodshed the case went to the jury and court was adjourned until two oclock

the colonel had never met fetters nor had he seen anyone in the court room who seemed likely to be the man but he had seen his name freshly witten on the hotel register and he would doubtless go there for dinner there would be ample time to get acquainted and transact his business before court reassembled for the afternoon

dinner seemed to be a rather solemn function and except at a table occupied by the judge and the lawyers in the comer of the room farthest from the colonel little was said a glance about the room showed no one whom the colonel could imagine to be fetters and he was about to ask the waiter if that gentleman had yet entered the dining room when a man came in and sat down on the opposite side of the table the colonel looked up and met the cheerful countenance of the liveryman from whom he had hired a horse and buggy some weeks before

howdy do said the newcomer amiably hope youve been well

quite well returned the colonel how are you 

oh just tolable tendin cot 

no i came down here to see a man thats attending courtâyour friend fetters i suppose hell be in to dinner

oh yes but he aint come in yet i reckon you find the hotel a little different from the time you were here befo

this is a better dinner than i got replied the colonel and i havent seen the landlord anywhere nor his buggy

no he aint here no more sad loss to carthage you see bark fettersâthats bills boy thats come home from the noth from collegeâbark fetters come down here one day anwent in the hotel an when lee dickson commenced to put on his big airs bark cussed im out and lee who didn know bark from adam cussed im back an then bark hauled off an hit im they had it hot an heavy for a while lee had more strength but bark had more science an laid lee out col then bark went home an tol the ole man who had a mortgage on the hotel an he sol lee up i hear hes barberin or somethin er that sort up to atlanta an the hotels run by another man theres fetters comin in now

the colonel glanced in the direction indicated and was surprised at the appearance of the redoubtable fetters who walked over and took his seat at the table with the judge and the lawyers he had expected to meet a tall longhaired redfaced truculent individual in a slouch hat and a frock coat with a loud voice and a dictatorial manner the typical southerner of melodrama he saw a keeneyed hardfaced small man slightly gray cleanshaven wearing a wellfitting citymade business suit of light tweed except for a few little indications such as the lack of a crease in his trousers fetters looked like any one of a hundred business men whom the colonel might have met on broadway in any given fifteen minutes during business hours

the colonel timed his meal so as to leave the diningroom at the same moment with fetters he went up to fetters who was chewing a toothpick in the office and made himself known

i am mr french he saidâhe never referred to himself by his military titleâ and you i believe are mr fetters

yes sir thats my name replied fetters without enthusiasm but eyeing the colonel keenly between narrowed lashes

ive been trying to see you for some time about a matter continued the colonel but never seemed able to catch up with you before

 yes i heard you were at my house but i was asleep upstairs and didnt know youd ben there till youd gone

your man told me you had gone to the capital for two weeks

my man oh you mean turner well i reckon you must have riled turner somehow and he thought hed have a joke on you

i dont quite see the joke said the colonel restraining his displeasure but thats ancient history can we sit down over here in the shade and talk by ourselves for a moment

fetters followed the colonel out of doors where they drew a couple of chairs to one side and the colonel stated the nature of his business he wished to bargain for the release of a negro bud johnson by name held to service by fetters under a contract with clarendon county he was willing to pay whatever expense fetters had been to on account of johnson and an amount sufficient to cover any estimated profits from his services

meanwhile fetters picked his teeth nonchalantly so nonchalantly as to irritate the colonel the colonels impatience was not lessened by the fact that fetters waited several seconds before replying

well mr fetters what say you

colonel french said fetters i reckon you cant have the nigger

 is it a matter of money   asked the colonel  name your figure i dont care about the money i want the man for a personal reason

so do i returned fetters coolly and moneys no object to me ive more now than i know what to do with

the colonel mastered his impatience he had one appeal which no southerner could resist

mr fetters he said i wish to get this man released to please a lady 

sorry to disoblige a lady returned fetters but ill have to keep the nigger i run a big place and im obliged to maintain discipline this nigger has been fractious and contrary and ive sworn that he shall work out his time i have never let any nigger get the best of meâor white man either he added significantly

the colonel was angry but controlled himself long enough to make one more effort ill give you five hundred dollars for your contract he said rising from his chair

you couldnt get him for five thousand

very well sir returned the colonel this is not the end of this i will see sir if a man can be held in slavery in this state for a debt he is willing and ready to pay youll hear more of this before im through with it another thing colonel french said fetters his quiet eyes glittering as he spoke i wonder if you recollect an incident that occurred years ago when we went to the academy in clarendon

if you refer returned the colonel promptly to the time i chased you down main street yesâi recalled it the first time i heard of you when i came back to clarendonâ and i remember why i did it it is a good omen thats as it may be returned fetters quietly i didnt have to recall it ive never forgotten it now you want something from me and you cant have it

we shall see replied the colonel i bested you then and ill best you now

we shall see said fetters

fetters was not at all alarmed indeed he smiled rather pityingly there had been a time when these old aristocrats could speak and the earth trembled but that day was over in this age money talked and he had known how to get money and how to use it to get more there were a dozen civil suits pending against him in the court house there and he knew in advance that he should win them every one without directly paying any juryman a dollar that any nigger should get away while he wished to hold him wasâwell inconceivable colonel french might have money but he fetters had men as well and if colonel french became too troublesome about this nigger this friendship for niggers could be used in such a way as to make clarendon too hot for colonel french he really bore no great malice against colonel french for the little incident of their school days but he had not forgotten it and colonel french might as well learn a lesson he fetters had not worked half a lifetime for a commanding position to yield it to colonel french or any other man so fetters smoked his cigar tranquilly and waited at the hotel for his anticipated verdicts for there could not be a jury impanelled in the county which did not have on it a majority of men who were mortgaged to fetters he even held the judges note for several hundred dollars

the colonel waited at the station for the train back to clarendon when it came it brought a gang of convicts consigned to fetters they had been brought down in the regular jim crow car for the colonel saw coloured women and children come out ahead of them the colonel watched the wretches in coarse striped garments with chains on their legs and shackles on their hands unloaded from the train and into the waiting wagons there were burly negroes and flatshanked scrawny negroes some wore the ashen hue of long confinement some were shamefaced some reckless some sullen a few white convicts among them seemed doubly ashamed âboth of their condition and of their company they kept together as much as they were permitted and looked with contempt at their black companions in misfortune fetterss man and haines armed with whips and with pistols in their belts were present to oversee the unloading and the colonel could see them point him out to the state officers who had come in charge of the convicts and see them look at him with curious looks the scene was not edifying there were criminals in new york he knew very well but he had never seen one they were not marched down broadway in stripes and chains there were certain functions of society as of the body which were more decently performed in retirement there was work in the state for the social reformer and the colonel undismayed by his temporary defeat metaphorically girded up his loins went home and still metaphorically set out to put a spoke in fetterss wheel

his first step was to have caxton look up and abstract for him the criminal laws of the state they were bad enough in all conscience men could be tried without jury and condemned to infamous punishments involving stripes and chains for misdemeanours which in more enlightened states wore punished with a small fine or brief detention there were for instance no degrees of larceny and the heaviest punishment might be inflicted at the discretion of the judge for the least offense

the vagrancy law of which the colonel had had some experience was an open bid for injustice and graft and clearly designed to profit the strong at the expense of the weak the croplien laws were little more than the instruments of organised robbery to these laws the colonel called the attention of some of his neighbours with whom he was on terms of intimacy the enlightened few had scarcely known of their existence and quite agreed that the laws were harsh and ought to be changed

but when the colonel pursuing his inquiry undertook to investigate the operation of these laws he found an appalling condition the statutes were mild and beneficent compared with the results obtained under cover of them caxton spent several weeks about the state looking up the criminal records and following up the sentences inflicted working not merely for his fee but sharing the colonels indignation at the state of things unearthed convict labour was contracted out to private parties with little or no effective state supervision on terms which though exceedingly profitable to the state were disastrous to free competitive labour more than one lawmaker besides fetters was numbered among these contractors

leaving the realm of crime they found that on hundreds of farms ignorant negroes and sometimes poor whites were held in bondage under claims of debt or under contracts of exclusive employment for long terms of years âcontracts extorted from ignorance by craft aided by state laws which made it a misdemeanour to employ such persons elsewhere free men were worked side by side with convicts from the penitentiary and women and children herded with the most depraved criminals thus breeding a criminal class to prey upon the state

in the case of fetters alone the colonel found a dozen instances where the law bad as it was had not been sufficient for fetterss purpose but had been plainly violated caxton discovered a discharged guard of fetters who told him of many things that had taken place at sycamore and brought another guard one evening at that time employed there who told him among other things that bud johnsons life owing to his surliness and rebellious conduct and some spite which haines seemed to bear against him was simply a hell on earthâthat even a strong negro could not stand it indefinitely

a case was made up and submitted to the grand jury witnesses were summoned at the colonels instance at the last moment they all weakened even the discharged guard and their testimony was not sufficient to justify an indictment

the colonel then sued out a wit of habeas corpus for the body of bud johnson and it was heard before the common pleas court at clarendon with public opinion divided between the colonel and fetters the court held that under his contract for which he had paid the consideration fetters was entitled to johnsons sendees

the colonel defeated but still undismayed ordered caxton to prepare a memorial for presentation to the federal authorities calling their attention to the fact that peonage a crime under the federal statutes was being flagrantly practised in the state this allegation was supported by a voluminous brief giving names and dates and particular instances of barbarity the colonel was not without some quiet support in this movement there were several publicspirited men in the county including his able lieutenant caxton dr price and old general thornton none of whom were under any obligation to fetters and who all acknowledged that something ought to be done to purge the state of a great disgrace

there was another party of course which deprecated any scandal winch would involve the good name of the state or reflect upon the south and who insisted that in time these things would pass aw ay and there would be no trace of them in future generations but the colonel insisted that so also would the victims of the system pass away who being already in existence were certainly entitled to as much consideration as generations yet unborn it was hardly fair to sacrifice them to a mere punctilio the colonel had reached the conviction that the regenerative forces of education and enlightenment in order to have any effect in his generation must be reinforced by some positive legislative or executive action or else the untrammelled forces of graft and greed would override them and he was human enough at this stage of his career to wish to see the result of his labours or at least a promise of result

the colonels papers were forwarded to the proper place whence they were referred from official to official and from department to department that it might take some time to set in motion the machinery necessary to reach the evil the colonel knew very well and hence was not impatient at any reasonable delay had he known that his presentation had created a sensation in the highest quarter but that owing to the exigencies of national politics it was not deemed wise at that time to do anything which seemed like an invasion of state rights or savoured of sectionalism he might not have been so serenely confident of the outcome nor had fetters known as much would he have done the one thing which encouraged the colonel more than anything else caxton received a message one day from judge bullard representing fetters in which fetters made the offer that if colonel french would stop his agitation on the labour laws and withdraw any papers he had filed and promise to drop the whole matter he would release bud johnson

the colonel did not hesitate a moment he had gone into this fight for johnsonâor rather to please miss laura he had risen now to higher game nothing less than the system would satisfy him

but colonel said caxton its pretty hard on the nigger theyll kill him before his times up if youll give me a free hand ill get him anyway

how

perhaps its just as well you shouldnt know but i have friends at sycamore

you wouldnt break the law asked the colonel fetters is breaking the law replied caxton hes holding johnson for debtâand whether that is lawful or not he certainly has no right to kill him

youre right replied the colonel get johnson away i dont care how the end justifies the meansâ thats an argument that goes down here get him away and send him a long way off and he can write for his wife to join him his escape need not interfere with our other plans we have plenty of other cases against fetters

within a week johnson with the connivance of a bribed guard a poorwhite man from clarendon had escaped from fetters and seemingly vanished from beaver county fetterss lieutenants were active in their search for him but sought in vain

ben dudley awoke the morning after the assembly ball with a violent headache and a sense of extreme depression which was not relieved by the sight of his reflection in the lookingglass of the bureau in the hotel bedroom where he found himself

one of his eyes was bloodshot and surrounded by a wide area of discolouration and he was conscious of several painful contusions on other portions of his body his clothing was badly disordered and stained with blood and all in all he was scarcely in a condition to appear in public he made such a toilet as he could and anxious to avoid observation had his horse brought from the livery around to the rear door of the hotel and left for mink run by the back streets he did not return to town for a week and when he made his next appearance there upon strictly a business visit did not go near the treadwells and wore such a repellent look that no one ventured to speak to him about his encounter with fetters and mc rae he was humiliated and ashamed and angry with himself and all the world he had lost graciella already any possibility that might have remained of regaining her affection was destroyed by his having made her name the excuse for a barroom broil his uncle was not well and with the decline of his health his monomania grew more acute and more absorbing and he spent most of his time in the search for the treasure and in expostulations with viney to reveal its whereabouts the supervision of the plantation work occupied ben most of the time and during his intervals of leisure he sought to escape unpleasant thoughts by busying himself with the model of his cotton gin

his life had run along in this way for about two weeks after the ballwhen one night barclay fetters while coming to town from his fathers plantation at sycamore in company with turner his fathers foreman was fired upon from ambush in the neighbourhood of mink hun and seriously wounded groaning heavily and in a state of semiunconsciousness he was driven by turner in the same buggy in which he had been shot to doctor prices house which lay between mink run and the town

the doctor examined the wound which was serious a charge of buckshot had been fired at close range from a clump of bushes by the wayside and the charge had taken effect in the side of the face the sight of one eye was destroyed beyond a peradventure and that of the other endangered by a possible injury to the optic nerve a sedative was administered as many as possible of the shot extracted and the wounds dressed meantime a messenger was despatched to sycamore for fetters senior who came before morning posthaste to his anxious inquiries the doctor could give no very hopeful answer

hes not out of danger said doctor price and wont be for several days i havent found several of those shot and until theyre located i cant tell what will happen your son has a good constitution but it has been abused somewhat and is not in the best condition to throw off an injury

do the best you can for him doc said fetters and ill make it worth your while and as for the doubledamned scoundrel that shot him in the dark ill rake this county with a finetoothed comb till hes found

if bark dies the murderer shall hang as high as haman if it costs me a million dollars or if bark gets well he shall have the limit of the law no man in this state shall injure me or mine and go unpunished

the next day ben dudley was arrested at mink run on a warrant sworn out by fetters senior charging dudley with attempted murder the accused was brought to clarendon and lodged in beaver county jail

ben sent for caxton from whom he learned that his offense was not subject to bail until it became certain that barclay fetters would recover for in the event of his death the charge would be murder in case of recovery the offense would be merely attempted murder or shooting with intent to kill for which bail was allowable meantime he would have to remain in jail

in a day or two young fetters was pronounced out of danger so far as his life was concerned and colonel french through caxton offered to sign bens bail bond to caxtons surprise dudley refused to accept bail at the colonels hands

i dont want any favours from colonel french he said decidedly i prefer to stay in jail rather than to be released on his bond

so he remained in jail

graciella was not so much surprised at bens refusal to accept bail she had reasoned out with a fine instinct the train of emotions which had brought her lover to grief and her own share in stirring them up she could not believe that ben was capable of shooting a man from ambush but even if he had it would have been for love of her and if he had not she had nevertheless been the moving cause of the disaster she would not willingly have done young mr fetters an injury he had favoured her by his attentions and if all stories were true he had behaved better than ben in the difficulty between them and had suffered more but she loved ben as she grew to realise more and more she wanted to go and see ben in jail but her aunt did not think it proper appearances were all against ben and he had not purged himself by any explanation so graciella sat down and wrote him a long letter she knew very well that the one thing that would do him most good would be the announcement of her aunt lauras engagement to colonel french there was no way to bring this about except by first securing her aunts permission this would make necessary a frank confession to which after an effort she nerved herself

aunt laura she said at a moment when they were alone together i know why ben will not accept bail from colonel french and why he will not tell his side of the quarrel between himself and mr fetters he was foolish enough to imagine that colonel french was coming to the house to see me and that i preferred the colonel to him and aunt laura i have a confession to make i have done something for which i want to beg your pardon i listened that night and overheard the colonel ask you to be his wife please dear aunt laura forgive me and let me write and tell benâjust ben in confidence no one else need know it

miss laura was shocked and pained and frankly said so but could not refuse the permission on condition that ben should be pledged to keep her secret which for reasons of her own she was not yet ready to make public she too was fond of ben and hoped that he might clear himself of the accusation so graciella wrote the letter she was no more frank in it however on one point than she had been with her aunt for she carefully avoided saying that she had taken colonel frenchs attentions seriously or built any hopes upon them but chided ben for putting such a construction upon her innocent actions and informed him as proof of his folly and in the strictest confidence that colonel french was engaged to her aunt laura she expressed her sorrow for his predicament her profound belief in his innocence and her unhesitating conviction that he would be acquitted of the pending charge

to this she expected by way of answer a long letter of apology explanation and protestations of undying love

she received instead a brief note containing a cold acknowledgment of her letter thanking her for her interest in his welfare and assuring her that he would respect miss lauras confidence there was no note of love or reproachfulnessâmere cold courtesy

graciella was cut to the quick so much so that she did not even notice bens mistakes in spelling it would have been better had he overwhelmed her with reproachesâ it would have shown at least that he still loved her she cried bitterly and lay awake very late that night wondering what else she could do for ben that a selfrespecting young lady might for the first time she was more concerned about ben than about herself if by marrying him immediately she could have saved him from danger and disgrace she would have done so without one selfish thoughtâunless it were selfish to save one whom she loved

the preliminary hearing in the case of the state vs benjamin dudley was held as soon as doctor price pronounced barclay fetters out of danger the proceedings took place before squire reddick the same justice from whom the colonel had bought peters services and from whom he had vainly sought to secure bud johnsons release

in spite of dudleys curt refusal of his assistance the colonel to whom miss laura had conveyed a hint of the young mans frame of mind had instructed caxton to spare no trouble or expense in the prisoners interest there was little doubt considering fetterss influence and vindictiveness that dudley would be remanded though the evidence against him was purely circumstantial but it was important that the evidence should be carefully scrutinised and every legal safeguard put to use

the case looked bad for the prisoner barclay fetters was not present nor did the prosecution need him his testimony could only have been cumulative

turner described the circumstances of the shooting from the trees by the roadside near mink run and the driving of the wounded man to doctor prices

doctor price swore to the nature of the wound its present and probable consequences which involved the loss of one eye and perhaps the other and produced the shot he had extracted

mc rae testified that he and barclay fetters had gone down between dances from the opera ball to the hotel bar to get a glass of seltzer they had no sooner entered the bar than the prisoner who had evidently been drinking heavily and showed all the signs of intoxication had picked a quarrel with them and assaulted mr fetters fetters with the aid of the witness had defended himself in the course of the altercation the prisoner had used violent and profane language threatening among other things to kill fetters all this testimony was objected to but was admitted as tending to show a motive for the crime this closed the states case

caxton held a hurried consultation with his client should they put in any evidence which would be merely to show their hand since the prisoner would in any event undoubtedly be bound over ben was unable to deny what had taken place at the hotel for he had no distinct recollection of itâmerely a blurred impression like the memory of a bad dream he could not swear that he had not threatened fetters the states witnesses had refrained from mentioning the ladys name he could do no less so far as the shooting was concerned he had had no weapon with which to shoot his gun had been stolen that very day and had not been recovered

the defense will offer no testimony declared caxton at the result of the conference

the justice held the prisoner to the grand jury and fixed the bond at ten thousand dollars graciellas information had not been without its effect and when caxton suggested that he could still secure bail he had little difficulty in inducing ben to accept colonel frenchs friendly offices the bail bond was made out and signed and the prisoner released

caxton took ben to his office after the hearing there ben met the colonel thanked him for his aid and friendship and apologised for his former rudeness

i was in a bad way sir he said and hardly knew what i was doing but i know i didnt shoot bark fetters and never thought of such a thing

im sure you didnt my boy said the colonel laying his hand in familiar fashion upon the young fellows shoulder and well prove it before we quit there are some ladies who believe the same thing and would like to hear you say it

thank you sir said ben i should like to tell them but i shouldnt want to enter their house until i am cleared of this charge i think too much of them to expose them to any remarks about harbouring a man out on bail for a penitentiary offense ill write to them sir and thank them for their trust and friendship and you can tell them for me if you will that ill come to see them when not only i but everybody else can say that i am fit to go

your feelings do you credit returned the colonel warmly and however much they would like to see you im sure the ladies will appreciate your delicacy as your friend and theirs you must permit me to serve you further whenever the opportunity offers until this affair is finished

ben thanked the colonel from a full heart and went back to mink run where in the effort to catch up the plantation work which had fallen behind in his absence he sought to forget the prison atmosphere and lose the prison pallor the disgrace of having been in jail was indelible and the danger was by no means over the sympathy of his friends would have been priceless to him but to remain away from them would be not only the honourable course to pursue but a just punishment for his own folly for graciella after all was only a girlâa young girl and scarcely yet to be judged harshly for her actions while he was a man grown who knew better and had not acted according to his lights

three days after ben dudleys release on bail clarendon was treated to another sensation former constable haines now employed as an overseer at fetterss convict farm while driving in a buggy to clarendon where he spent his offduty spells was shot from ambush near mink run and his right arm shattered in such a manner as to require amputation

colonel frenchs interest in ben dudleys affairs had not been permitted to interfere with his various enterprises work on the chief of these the cotton mill had gone steadily forward with only occasional delays incident to the delivery of material the weather and the health of the workmen which was often uncertain for a day or two after pay day the coloured foreman of the bricklayers had been seriously ill his place had been filled by a white man under whom the walls were rising rapidly jim green the foreman whom the colonel had formerly discharged and the two white bricklayers who had quit at the same time applied for reinstatement the colonel took the two men on again but declined to restore green who had been discharged for insubordination

green went away swearing vengeance at clay johnsons saloon he hurled invectives at the colonel to all who would listen and with anger and bad whiskey soon worked himself into a frame of mind that was ripe for any mischief some of his utterances were reported to the colonel who was not without friendsâthe wealthy seldom are but he paid no particular attention to them except to keep a watchman at the mill at night lest this hostility should seek an outlet in some attempt to injure the property the precaution was not amiss for once the watchman shot at a figure prowling about the mill the lesson was sufficient apparently for there was no immediate necessity to repeat it

the shooting of haines while not so sensational as that of barclay fetters had given rise to considerable feeling against ben dudley that two young men should quarrel and exchange shots would not ordinarily have been a subject of extended remark but two attempts at assassination constituted a much graver affair that dudley was responsible for this second assault was the generally accepted opinion fetterss friends and hirelings were openly hostile to young dudley and haines had been heard to say in his cups at clay jacksons saloon that when young dudley was tried and convicted and sent to the penitentiary he would be hired out to fetters who had the county contract and that he haines would be delighted to have dudley in his gang the feeling against dudley grew from day to day and threats and bets were openly made that he would not live to be tried there was no direct proof against him but the moral and circumstantial evidence was quite sufficient to convict him in the eyes of fetterss friends and supporters the colonel was sometimes mentioned in connection with the affair as a friend of bens for whom he had given bail and as an enemy of fetters to whom his antagonism in various ways had become a matter of public knowledge and interest

one day while the excitement attending the second shooting was thus growing colonel french received through the mail a mysteriously worded note vaguely hinting at some matter of public importance which the writer wished to communicate to him and requesting a private interview for the purpose that evening at the colonels house the note which had every internal evidence of sincerity was signed by henry taylor the principal of the coloured school whom the colonel had met several times in reference to the proposed industrial school from the tenor of the communication and what he knew about taylor the colonel had no doubt that the matter was one of importance at least not one to be dismissed without examination he thereupon stepped into caxtons office and wrote an answer to the letter fixing eight oclock that evening as the time and his own library as the place of a meeting with the teacher this letter he deposited in the postoffice personallyâit was only a step from caxtons office upon coming out of the postoffice he saw the teacher standing on an opposite corner when the colonel had passed out of sight taylor crossed the street entered the postoffice and soon emerged with the letter he had given no sign that he saw the colonel but had looked rather ostentatiously the other way when that gentleman had glanced in his direction

at the appointed hour there was a light step on the colonels piazza the colonel was on watch and opened the door himself ushering taylor into his library a very handsome and comfortable room the door of which he carefully closed behind them

the teacher looked around cautiously

are we alone sir

yes entirely so

and can any one hear us 

no what have you got to tell me

colonel french replied the other im in a hard situation and i want you to promise that youll never let on to any body that i told you what im going to say

all right mr taylor if it is a proper promise to make you can trust my discretion

yes sir im sure i can we coloured folks sir are often accused of trying to shield criminals of our own race or of not helping the officers of the law to catch them maybe we does suh he said lapsing in his earnestness into bad grammar maybe we does sometimes but not without reason

what reason asked the colonel

well sir fer the reason that we aint always shore that a coloured man will get a fair trial or any trial at all or that hell get a just sentence after hes been tried we have no hand in makin the laws or in enforcin em we are not summoned on jury and yet were asked to do the work of constables and sheriffs who are paid for arrestin criminals an for protectin em from mobs which they dont do

 i have no doubt every word you say is true mr taylor and such a state of things is unjust and will some day be different if i can help to make it so but nevertheless all good citizens whatever their colour ought to help to preserve peace and good order

yes sir so they ought and i want to do just that i want to cooperate and a whole heap of us want to cooperate with the good white people to keep down crime and lawlessness i know theres good white people who want to see justice doneâbut they aint always strong enough to run things an if any one of us coloured folks tells on another one hes liable to lose all his friens but i believe sir that i can trust you to save me harmless and to see that nothin mo than justice is done to the coloured man

yes taylor you can trust me to do all that i can and i think i have considerable influence now whats on your mind do you know who shot haines and mr fetters  

well sir youre a mighty good guesser it aint so much mr fetters an mr haines im thinkin about for that place down the country is a hell on earth an theyre the devils that runs it but theres a friend of yors in trouble for something he dicin do an i wouldn stan for an innocent man bein sent to the penitentiaryâthough many a po negro has been yes sir i know that mr ben dudley didn shoot them two white men

so do i rejoined the colonel  who did 

it was bud johnson the man you tried to get away from mr fettersâyor coachman tol us about it sir an we know how good a friend of ours you are from what youve promised us about the school an i wanted you to know sir you are our friend and have showed confidence in us and i wanted to prove to you that we are not ungrateful an that we want to be good citizens

i had heard said the colonel that johnson had escaped and left the county

so he had sir but he came back they had bused him down at that place till he swore hed kill every one that had anything to do with him it was mr turner he shot at the first time and he hit young mr fetters by accident he stole a gun from ole mr dudleys place at mink hun shot mr fetters with it and has kept it ever since and shot mr haines with it i suppose theyd a ketched him before if it hadnt ben for suspectin young mr dudley

where is johnson now asked the colonel

 hes hidin in an old log cabin down by the swamp back of mink run he sleeps in the daytime and goes out at night to get food and watch for white men from mr fetterss place

 does his wife know where he is  

no sir he aint never let her know

by the way taylor asked the colonel how do you know all this

well sir replied the teacher with something which in an uneducated negro would have been a very pronounced chuckle theres mighty little goin on roun here that i dont find out sooner or later

taylor said the colonel rising to terminate the interview you have rendered a public service have proved yourself a good citizen and have relieved mr dudley of serious embarrassment i will see that steps are taken to apprehend johnson and will keep your participation in the matter secret since you think it would hurt your influence with your people and i promise you faithfully that every effort shall be made to see that johnson has a fair trial and no more than a just punishment

he gave the negro his hand

thank you sir thank you sir replied the teacher returning the colonels clasp if there were more white men like you the coloured folks would have no more trouble

the colonel let taylor out and watched him as he looked cautiously up and down the street to see that he was not observed that coloured folks or any other kind should ever cease to have trouble was a vain imagining but the teacher had made a wellfounded complaint of injustice which ought to be capable of correction and he had performed a publicspirited action even though he had felt constrained to do it in a clandestine manner

about his own part in the affair the colonel was troubled it was becoming clear to him that the task he had undertaken was no light oneânot the task of apprehending johnson and clearing dudley but that of leavening the inert mass of clarendon with the leaven of enlightenment with the best of intentions and hoping to save a life he had connived at turning a murderer loose upon the community it was true that the community through unjust laws had made him a murderer but it was no part of the colonels plan to foster or promote evil passions or to help the victims of the law to make reprisals his aim was to bring about by better laws and more liberal ideas peace harmony and universal good will there was a colossal work for him to do and for all whom he could enlist with him in this cause the very standards of right and wrong had been confused by the race issue and must be set right by the patient appeal to reason and humanity primitive passions and private vengeance must be subordinated to law and order and the higher good a new body of thought must be built up in which stress must be laid upon the eternal verities in the light of which difficulties which now seemed unsurmountable would be gradually overcome

but this halcyon period was yet afar off and the colonel roused himself to the duty of the hour with the best intentions he had let loose upon the communtiy in a questionable way a desperate character it was no less than his plain duty to put the man under restraint to rescue from fetters a man whose life was threatened was one thing to leave a murderer at large now would be to endanger innocent lives and imperil ben dudleys future

the arrest of bud johnson brought an end to the case against ben dudley the prosecuting attorney who was under political obligations to fetters seemed reluctant to dismiss the case until johnsons guilt should have been legally proved but the result of the negros preliminary hearing rendered this position no longer tenable the case against ben was nolled and he could now hold up his head as a free man with no stain upon his character

indeed the reaction in his favour as one unjustly indicted went far to wipe out from the public mind the impression that he was a drunkard and a rowdy it was recalled that he was of good family and that his forbears had rendered valuable service to the state and that he had never been seen to drink before or known to be in a fight but that on the contrary he was quiet and harmless to a fault indeed the clarendon public would have admired a little more spirit in a young man even to the extent of condoning an occasional lapse into license

there was sincere rejoicing at the treadwell house when ben now free in mind want around to see the ladies miss laura was warmly sympathetic and congratulatory and graciella tearfully happy tried to make up by a sweet humility through which shone the true womanliness of a hitherto undeveloped character for the past stings and humiliations to which her selfish caprice had subjected her lover ben resumed his visits if not with quite their former frequency and it was only a day or two later that the colonel found him and graciella with his own boy phil grouped in familiar fashion on the steps where ben was demonstrating with some pride of success the operation of his model into which he was feeding cotton when the colonel came up

the colonel stood a moment and looked at the machine

its quite ingenious he said explain the principle

ben described the mechanism in brief wellchosen words which conveyed the thought clearly and concisely and revealed a fine mind for mechanics and at the same time an absolute lack of technical knowledge

it would never be of any use sir he said at the end for everybody has the other kind but its another way and i think a better

it is clever said the colonel thoughtfully as he went into the house

the colonel had not changed his mind at all since asking miss laura to be his wife the glow of happiness still warmed her cheek the spirit of youth still lingered in her eyes and in her smile he might go a thousand miles before meeting a woman who would please him more take better care of phil or preside with more dignity over his household her simple grace would adapt itself to wealth as easily as it had accommodated itself to poverty it would be a pleasure to travel with her to new scenes and new places to introduce her into a wider world to see her expand in the generous sunlight of ease and freedom from responsibility

true to his promise the colonel made every effort to see that bud johnson should be protected against mob violence and given a fair trial there was some intemperate talk among the partisans of fetters and an ominous gathering upon the streets the day after the arrest but judge miller of the beaver county circuit who was in clarendon that day used his influence to discountenance any disorder and promised a speedy trial of the prisoner the crime was not the worst of crimes and there was no excuse for riot or lynch law the accused could not escape his just punishment

as a result of the judges efforts supplemented by the colonels and those of doctor price and several ministers any serious fear of disorder was removed and a handful of fetterss guards who had come up from his convict farm and foregathered with some choice spirits of the town at clay jacksons saloon went back without attempting to do what they had avowedly come to town to accomplish

one morning the colonel while overseeing the work at the new mill building stepped on the rounded handle of a chisel which had been left lying carelessly on the floor and slipped and fell spraining his ankle severely he went home in his buggy which was at the mill and sent for doctor price who put his foot in a plaster bandage and ordered him to keep quiet for a week

peter and phil went around to the treadwells to inform the ladies of the accident on reaching the house after the accident the colonel had taken off his coat and sent peter to bring him one from the closet off his bedroom

when the colonel put on the coat he felt some papers in the inside pocket and taking them out recognised the two old letters he had taken from the lining of his desk several months before the housekeeper in a moment of unusual zeal had discovered and mended the tear in the sleeve and peter had by chance selected this particular coat to bring to his master when peter started with phil to go to the treadwells the colonel gave him the two letters

give these he said to miss laura and tell her i found them in the old desk

it was not long before miss laura came with graciella to call on the colonel when they had expressed the proper sympathy and had been assured that the hurt was not dangerous miss laura spoke of another matter

henry she said with an air of suppressed excitement i have made a discovery i dont quite know what it means or whether it amounts to anything but in one of the envelopes you sent me just now there was a paper signed by mr fetters i do not know how it could have been left in the desk we had searched it years ago in every nook and cranny and found nothing

the colonel explained the circumstances of his discovery of the papers but prudently refrained from mentioning how long ago they had taken place

miss laura handed him a thin oblong yellowish slip of paper which had been folded in the middle it was a printed form upon which several words had been filled in with a pen

it was enclosed in this she said handing him another paper

the colonel took the papers and glanced over them

mother thinks said miss laura anxiously that they are the papers we were looking for that prove that fetters was in fathers debt

the colonel had been thinking rapidly the papers were indeed a promissory note from fetters to mr treadwell and a contract and memorandum of certain joint transactions in turpentine and cotton futures the note was dated twenty years back had it been produced at the time of mr treadwells death it would not have been difficult to collect and would have meant to his survivors the difference between poverty and financial independence now it was barred by the lapse of time

miss laura was waiting in eager expectation outwardly calm her eyes were bright her cheeks were glowing her bosom rose and fell excitedly could he tell her that this seemingly fortunate accident was merely the irony of fateâa mere cruel reminder of a former misfortune  no she could not believe it 

it has made me happy henry she said while he still kept his eyes bent on the papers to conceal his perplexity it has made me very happy to think that i may not come to you emptyhanded

 dear woman he thought you shall not if the note is not good it shall be made good

laura he said aloud i am no lawyer but caxton shall look at these today and i shall be very much mistaken if they do not bring you a considerable sum of money say nothing about them however until caxton reports he will be here to see me today and by tomorrow you shall have his opinion

miss laura went away with a radiantly hopeful face and as she and graciella went down the street the colonel noted that her step was scarcely less springy than her nieces it was worth the amount of fetterss old note to make her happy and since he meant to give her all that she might want what better way than to do it by means of this bit of worthless paper it would be a harmless deception and it would save the pride of three gentlewomen with whom pride was not a disease to poison and scorch and blister but an inspiration to courtesy and kindness and right living such a pride was worth cherishing even at a sacrifice which was after all no sacrifice

he had already sent word to caxton of his accident requesting him to call at the house on other business caxton came in the afternoon and when the matter concerning which he had come had been disposed of colonel french produced fetterss note

caxton he said i wish to pay this note and let it seem to have come from fetters

caxton looked at the note

why should you pay it he asked i mean he added noting a change in the colonels expression why shouldnt fetters pay it

because it is outlawed he replied and we could hardly expect him to pay for anything he didnt have to pay the statute of limitations runs against it after fifteen yearsâand its older than that much older than that

caxton made a rapid mental calculation

that is the law in new york he said but here the statute doesnt begin to run for twenty years the twenty years for which this note was given expires today

then it is good demanded the colonel looking at his watch

it is good said caxton provided there is no defence to it except the statute and provided i can file a petition on it in the county clerks office by four oclock the time at which the office closes it is now twenty minutes of four

can you make it

ill try

caxton since his acquaintance with colonel french had learned something more about the value of half an hour than he had ever before appreciated and here was an opportunity to test his knowledge he literally ran the quarter of a mile that lay between the colonels residence and the court house to the openeyed astonishment of those whom he passed some of whom wondered whether he were crazy and others whether he had committed a crime he dashed into the clerks office seized a pen and the first piece of paper handy and began to write a petition the clerk had stepped into the hall and when he came leisurely in at three minutes to four caxton discovered that he had witten his petition on the back of a blank marriage license he folded it ran his pen through the printed matter endorsed it estate of treadway vs fetters signed it with the name of ellen treadway as executrix by himself as her attorney swore to it before the clerk and handed it to that official who raised his eyebrows as soon as he saw the endorsement

now mr munroe said caxton if youll enter that on the docket now as of today ill be obliged to you id rather have the transaction all finished up while i wait your fee neednt wait the termination of the suit ill pay it now and take a receipt for it

the clerk whistled to himself as he read the petition in order to make the entry

thats an oldtimer he said itll make the old man cuss

yes said caxton do me a favour and dont say anything about it for a day or two i dont think the suit will ever come to trial

on the day following these events the colonel on the arm of old peter hobbled out upon his front porch and seating himself in a big rocking chair in front of which a cushion had been adjusted for his injured ankle composed himself to read some arrears of mail which had come in the day before and over which he had only glanced casually when he was comfortably settled peter and phil walked down the steps upon the lowest of which they seated themselves the colonel had scarcely begun to read before he called to the old man

peter he said i wish youd go upstairs and look in my room and bring me a couple of lightcoloured cigars from the box on my bureauâthe mild ones you know peter

yas suh i knows suh de mil ones dem wid de gol bans roun em now you stay right hyuh chile till peter come back

peter came up the steps and disappeared in the doorway

the colonel opened a letter from kirby in which that energetic and versatile gentleman assured the colonel that he had evolved a great scheme in which there were millions for those who would go into it he had already interested mrs jerviss who had stated she would be governed by what the colonel did in the matter the letter went into some detail upon this subject and then drifted off into club and social gossip several of the colonels friends had inquired particularly about him

one had regretted the loss to their whist table another wanted the refusal of his box at the opera if he were not coming back for the winter

 i think youre missed in a certain quarter old fellow i know a lady who would be more than delighted to see you i am invited to her house to dinner ostensibly to talk about our scheme in reality to talk about you

 but this is all by the way the business is the thing take my proposition under advisement we all made money together before we can make it again my option has ten days to run wire me before it is up what reply to make i know what youll say but i want your ipse dixit

the colonel knew too what his reply would be and that it would be very different from kirbys anticipation he would write it he thought next day so that kirby should not be kept in suspense or so that he might have time to enlist other capital in the enterprise the colonel felt really sorry to disappoint his good friends he would write and inform kirby of his plans including that of his approaching marriage

he had folded the letter and laid it down and had picked up a newspaper when peter returned with the cigars and a box of matches

mars henry he asked wats gone wid de chile

phil replied the colonel looking toward the step from which the boy had disappeared i suppose he went round the house

mars phil o mars phil called the old man

there was no reply

peter looked round the corner of the house but phil was nowhere visible the old man went round to the back yard and called again but did not find the child

i hyuhs de train comin i specs hes gone up ter de railroad track he said when he had returned to the front of the house ill run up dere an fetch im back

 yes do peter returned the colonel  hes probably all right but youd better see about him

little phil seeing his father absorbed in the newspaper and not wishing to disturb him had amused himself by going to the gate and looking down the street toward the railroad track he had been doing this scarcely a moment when he saw a black cat come out of a neighbours gate and go down the street

phil instantly recalled uncle peters story of the black cat perhaps this was the same one

phil had often been warned about the railroad

keep way fm dat railroad track honey the old man had repeated more than once its as dangeous as a gun and a gun is dangeous widout lock stock er bairl i knowed a man oncet wat beat is wife ter def wid a ramrod an wuz hung fer it in a ole fiel down by de hanted house dat gun could nt hoi powder ner shot but was dangeous nuff ter kill two folks so you jes better keep way fm dat railroad track chile

but phil was a child with the making of a man and the wisest of men sometimes forget for the moment phil saw nothing but the cat and wished for nothing more than to talk to it

so phil unperceived by the colonel set out to overtake the black cat the cat seemed in no hurry and phil had very nearly caught up with himâor her as the case might beâwhen the black cat having reached the railroad siding walked under a flat car which stood there and leaping to one of the truck bars composed itself presumably for a nap in order to get close enough to the cat for conversational purposes phil stooped under the overhanging end of the car and kneeled down beside the truck

kitty kitty  he called invitingly

the black cat opened her big yellow eyes with every evidence of lazy amiability

peter shuffled toward the corner as fast as his rickety old limbs would carry him when he reached the corner he saw a car standing on the track there was a brakeman at one end holding a coupling link in one hand and a coupling pin in the other his eye on an engine and train of cars only a rod or two away advancing to pick up the single car at the same moment peter caught sight of little phil kneeling under the car at the other end

peter shouted but the brakeman was absorbed in his own task which required close attention in order to assure his own safety the engineer on the cab at the other end of the train saw an old negro excitedly gesticulating and pulled a lever mechanically but too late to stop the momentum of the train which was not equipped with air brakes even if these would have proved effective to stop it in so short a distance

just before the two cars came together peter threw himself forward to seize the child as he did so the cat sprang from the truck bar the old man stumbled over the cat and fell across the rail the car moved only a few feet but quite far enough to work injury

a dozen people including the train crew quickly gathered willing hands drew them out and laid them upon the grass under the spreading elm at the corner of the street a judge a merchant and a negro labourer lifted old peters body as tenderly as though it had been that of a beautiful woman the colonel somewhat uneasy he scarcely knew why had started to limp painfully toward the corner when he was met by a messenger who informed him of the accident forgetting his pain he hurried to the scene only to find his hearts delight lying pale bleeding and unconscious beside the old negro who had sacrificed his life to save him

a doctor who had been hastily summoned pronounced peter dead phil showed no superficial injury save a cut upon the head from which the bleeding was soon stanched a negros strong arms bore the child to the house while the bystanders remained about peters body until the arrival of major mc lean recently elected coroner who had been promptly notified of the accident within a few minutes after the officers appearance a jury was summoned from among the bystanders the evidence of the trainmen and several other witnesses was taken and a verdict of accidental death rendered there was no suggestion of blame attaching to any one it had been an accident pure and simple which ordinary and reasonable prudence could not have foreseen

by the colonels command the body of his old servant was then conveyed to the house and laid out in the front parlour every honour every token of respect should be paid to his remains

meanwhile the colonel forgetting his own hurt hovered with several physicians among them doctor price around the bedside of his child the slight cut upon the head the physicians declared was not of itself sufficient to account for the rapid sinking which set in shortly after the boys removal to the house there had evidently been some internal injury the nature of which could not be ascertained phil remained unconscious for several hours but toward the end of the day opened his blue eyes and fixed them upon his father who was sitting by the bedside

papa he said am i going to die

no no phil said his father hopefully you are going to get well in a few days i hope

phil was silent for a moment and looked around him curiously he gave no sign of being in pain

is miss laura here

yes phil shes in the next room and will be here in a moment

at that instant miss laura came in and kissed him the caress gave him pleasure and he smiled sweetly in return

papa was uncle peter hurt

yes phil

where is he papa was he hurt badly

he is lying in another room phil but he is not in any pain

papa said phil after a pause if i should die and if uncle peter should die youll remember your promise and bury him near me wont you dear

yes phil he said but you are not going to die but phil died dozing off into a peaceful sleep in which he passed quietly away with a smile upon his face

it required all the fathers fortitude to sustain the blow with the added agony of selfreproach that he himself had been unwittingly the cause of it had he not sent old peter into the house the child would not have been left alone had he kept his eye upon phil until peters return the child would not have strayed away he had neglected his child while the bruised and broken old black man in the room below had given his life to save him he could do nothing now to show the child his love or peter his gratitude and the old man had neither wife nor child in whom the colonels bounty might find an object but he would do what he could he would lay his childs body in the old family lot in the cemetery among the bones of his ancestors and there too close at hand old peter should have honourable sepulture it was his due and would be the fulfilment of little phils last request

the child was laid out in the parlour amid a mass of flowers miss laura for love of him and of the colonel with her own hands prepared his little body for the last sleep the undertaker who hovered around wished with a conventional sense of fitness to remove old peters body to a back room but the colonel said no

they died together together they shall lie here and they shall be buried together

he gave instructions as to the location of the graves in the cemetery lot the undertaker looked thoughtful

i hope sir said the undertaker there will be no objection its not customaryâtheres a coloured graveyardâyou might put up a nice tombstone thereâand youve been away from here a long time sir

if any one objects said the colonel send him to me the lot is mine and i shall do with it as i like my greatgreatgrandfather gave the cemetery to the town old peters skin was black but his heart was white as any mans  and when a man reaches the grave he is not far from god who is no respecter of persons and in whose presence on the judgment day many a white man shall be black and many a black man white

the funeral was set for the following afternoon the graves were to be dug in the morning the undertaker whose business was dependent upon public favour and who therefore shrank from any step which might affect his own popularity let it be quietly known that colonel french had given directions to bury peter in oak cemetery

it was inevitable that there should be some question raised about so novel a proceeding the colour line in clarendon as in all southern towns was on the surface at least rigidly drawn and extended from the cradle to the grave no negros body had ever profaned the sacred soil of oak cemetery the protestants laid the matter before the cemetery trustees and a private meeting was called in the evening to consider the proposed interment

white and black worshipped the same god in different churches there had been a time when coloured people filled the galleries of the white churches and white ladies had instilled into black children the principles of religion and good morals but as white and black had grown nearer to each other in condition they had grown farther apart in feeling it was difficult for the poor lady for instance to patronise the children of the welltodo negro or mulatto nor was the latter inclined to look up to white people who had started in his memory from a position but little higher than his own in an era of change the benefits gained thereby seemed scarcely to offset the difficulties of readjustment

the situation was complicated by a sense of injury on both sides cherishing their theoretical equality of citizenship which they could neither enforce nor forget the negroes resented noisly or silently as prudence dictated its contemptuous denial by the whites and these viewing this shadowy equality as an insult to themselves had sought by all the machinery of local law to emphasise and perpetuate their own superiority the very word equality was an offence society went back to egypt and india for its models to break caste was a greater sin than to break any or all of the ten commandments white and coloured children studied the same books in different schools white and black people rode on the same trains in separate cars living side by side and meeting day by day the law made and administered by white men had built a wall between them

and white and black buried their dead in separate graveyards not until they reached gods presence could they stand side by side in any relation of equality there was a negro graveyard in clarendon where as a matter of course the coloured dead were buried it was not an ideal locality the land was low and swampy and graves must be used quickly ere the water collected in them the graveyard was unfenced and vagrant cattle browsed upon its rank herbage the embankment of the railroad encroached upon one side of it and the passing engines sifted cinders and ashes over the graves but no negro had ever thought of burying his dead elsewhere and if their cemetery was not well kept up whose fault was it but their own

the proposition therefore of a white man even of colonel frenchs standing to bury a negro in oak cemetery was bound to occasion comment if nothing more there was indeed more several citizens objected to the profanation and laid their protest before the mayor who quietly called a meeting of the board of cemetery trustees of which he was the chairman

the trustees were five in number the board with the single exception of the mayor was selfperpetuating and the members had been chosen as vacancies occurred by death at long intervals from among the aristocracy who had always controlled it the mayor a member and chairman of the board by virtue of his office had sprung from the same class as fetters that of the aspiring poor whites who freed from the moral incubus of slavery had by force of numbers and ambition secured political control of the state and relegated not only the negroes but the old master class to political obscurity a shrewd capable man was the mayor who despised negroes and distrusted aristocrats and had the courage of his convictions he represented in the meeting the protesting element of the community

gentlemen he said colonel french has ordered this negro to be buried in oak cemetery we all appreciate the colonels worth and what he is doing for the town but he has lived at the north for many years and has got somewhat out of our way of thinking we do not want to buy the prosperity of this town at the price of our principles the attitude of the white people on the negro question is fixed and determined for all time and nothing can ever alter it to bury this negro in oak cemetery is against our principles

the mayors statement of the rule is quite correct replied old general thornton a member of the board and not open to question but all rules have their exceptions it was against the law for some years before the war to manumit a slave but an exception to that salutary rule was made in case a negro should render some great service to the state or the community you will recall that when in a sister state a negro climbed the steep roof of st michaels church and at the risk of his own life saved that historic structure the pride of charleston from destruction by fire the muncipality granted him his freedom

and we all remember said mr darden another of the trustees we all remember at least im sure general thornton does old sally who used to belong to the mc rae family and was a member of the presbyterian church and who because of her age and infirmitiesâshe was hard of hearing and too old to climb the stairs to the galleryâwas given a seat in front of the pulpit on the main floor

that was all very well replied the mayor stoutly when the negroes belonged to you and never questioned your authority but times are different now they think themselves as good as we are we had them pretty well in hand until colonel french came around with his schools and his high wages and now they are getting so fat and sassy that therell soon be no living with them the last election did something but well have to do something more and that soon to keep them in their places theres one in jail now alive who has shot and disfigured and nearly killed two good white menand such an example of social equality as burying one in a white graveyard will demoralise them still further we must preserve the purity and prestige of our race and we can only do it by keeping the negroes down

after all said another member the purity of our race is not apt to suffer very seriously from the social equality of a graveyard

and old peter will be pretty effectually kept down wherever he is buried added another

these sallies provoked a smile which lightened the tension a member suggested that colonel french be sent for

it seems a pity to disturb him in his grief said another

its only a couple of squares suggested another lets call in a body and pay our respects we can bring up the matter incidentally while there

the muscles of the mayors chin hardened

colonel french has never been at my house he said and i shouldnt care to seem to intrude

come on mayor said mr darden taking the official by the arm these fine distinctions are not becoming in the presence of death the colonel will be glad to see you

the mayor could not resist this mark of intimacy on the part of one of the old aristocracy and walked somewhat proudly through the street arm in arm with mr darden they paid their respects to the colonel who was bearing up with the composure to be expected of a man of strong will and forceful character under a grief of which he was exquisitely sensible touched by a strong mans emotion which nothing could conceal no one had the heart to mention in the presence of the dead the object of their visit and they went away without giving the colonel any inkling that his course had been seriously criticised nor was the meeting resumed after they left the house even the mayor seeming content to let the matter go by default

fortune favoured caxton in the matter of the note fetters was in clarendon the following morning caxton saw him passing called him into his office and produced the note

thats no good said fetters contemptuously it was outlawed yesterday i suppose you allowed id forgotten it on the contrary ive a memorandum of it in my pocketbook and i struck it off the list last night i always pay my lawful debts when theyre properly demanded if this note had been presented yesterday id have paid it today its too late it aint a lawful debt

 do you really mean to say mr fetters that you have deliberately robbed those poor women of this money all these years and are not ashamed of it not even when youre found out and that you are going to take refuge behind the statute

now see here mr caxton returned fetters without apparent emotion you want to be careful about the language you use i might sue you for slander youre a young man that hopes to have a future and live in this county where i expect to live and have law business done long after some of your present clients have moved away i didnt owe the estate of john treadwell one centâyou ought to be lawyer enough to know that he owed me money and paid me with a note i collected the note i owed him money and paid it with a note whoever heard of anybodys paying a note that wasnt presented

its a poor argument mr fetters you would have let those ladies starve to death before you would have come forward and paid that debt

theyve never asked me for charity so i wasnt called on to offer it and you know now dont you that if id paid the amount of that note and then it had turned up afterward in somebody elses hands id have had to pay it over again now wouldnt i

caxton could not deny it fetters had robbed the treadwell estate but his argument was unanswerable

yes said caxton i suppose you would

im sorry for the women said fetters and ive stood ready to pay that note all these years and it aint my fault that it hasnt been presented now its outlawed and you couldnt expect a man to just give away that much money it aint a lawful debt and the laws good enough for me

youre awfully sorry for the ladies arent you said caxton with thinly veiled sarcasm

i surely am im honestly sorry for them

and youd pay the note if you had to wouldnt you asked caxton

i surely would as i say i always pay my legal debts

all right said caxton triumphantly then youll pay this i filed suit against you yesterday which takes the case out of the statute

fetters concealed his discomfiture

well he said with quiet malignity ive nothing more to say till i consult my lawyer but i want to tell you one thing you are ruining a fine career by standing in with this colonel french i hear his son was killed today you can tell him i say its a judgment on him for i hold him responsible for my sons condition he came down here and tried to demoralise the labour market he put false notions in the niggers heads then he got to meddling with my business trying to get away a nigger whose time i had bought he insulted my agent turner and came all the way down to sycamore and tried to bully me into letting the nigger loose and of course i wouldnt be bullied afterwards when i offered to let the nigger go the colonel wouldnt have it so i shall always believe he bribed one of my men to get the nigger off and then turned him loose to run amuck among the white people and shoot my boy and my overseer it was a lowdown performance and unworthy of a gentleman no really white man would treat another white man so you can tell him i say its a judgment thats fallen on him today and that its not the last one and that hell be sorrier yet that he didnt stay where he was with his niggerlovin notions instead of comin back down here to make trouble for people that have grown up with the state and made it what it is

caxton of course did not deliver the message to do so would have been worse taste than fetters had displayed in sending it having got the best of the encounter caxton had no objection to letting his defeated antagonist discharge his venom against the absent colonel who would never know of it and who was already breasting the waves of a sorrow so deep and so strong as almost to overwhelm him for he had loved the boy all his hopes had centred around this beautiful man child who had promised so much that was good his own future had been planned with reference to him now he was dead and the bereaved father gave way to his grief

the funeral took place next day from the episcopal church in which communion the little boy had been baptised and of which old peter had always been an humble member faithfully appearing every sunday morning in his seat in the gallery long after the rest of his people had deserted it for churches of their own on this occasion peter had for the first time a place on the main floor a little to one side of the altar in front of which banked with flowers stood the white velvet casket which contained all that was mortal of little phil the same beautiful sermon answered for both in touching words the rector a man of culture taste and feeling and a faithful servant of his master spoke of the sweet young life brought to so untimely an end and pointed the bereaved father to the best source of consolation he paid a brief tribute to the faithful servant and humble friend to whom though black and lowly the white people of the town were glad to pay this signal tribute of respect and appreciation for his heroic deed the attendance at the funeral while it might have been larger was composed of the more refined and cultured of the townspeople from whom indeed the church derived most of its membership and support and the gallery overflowed with coloured people whose hearts had warmed to the great honour thus paid to one of their race four young white men bore phils body and the six pallbearers of old peter were from among the best white people of the town

the double interment was made in oak cemetery

simultaneously both bodies were lowered to their last restingplace simultaneously ashes were consigned to ashes and dust to dust the earth was heaped above the graves the mound above little phils was buried with flowers and old peters was not neglected

beyond the cemetery wall a few white men of the commoner sort watched the proceedings from a distance and eyed with grim hostility the negroes who had followed the procession they had no part nor parcel in this sentimental folly nor did they approve of itâin fact they disapproved of it very decidedly among them was the colonels discharged foreman jim green who was pronounced in his denunciation

colonel french is an enemy of his race he declared to his sympathetic following he hires niggers when white men are idle and pays them more than white men who work are earning and now he is burying them with white people

when the group around the grave began to disperse the little knot of disgruntled spectators moved sullenly away in the evening they might have been seen most of them around clay jacksons barroom turner the foreman at fetterss convict farm was in town that evening and jacksons was his favourite haunt for some reason turner was more sociable than usual and liquor flowed freely at his expense there was a great deal of intemperate talk concerning the negro in jail for shooting haines and young fetters and concerning colonel french as the protector of negroes and the enemy of white men

at the same time that the colonel dryeyed and heavyhearted had returned to his empty house to nurse his grief another series of events was drawing to a climax in the dilapidated house on mink run even while the preacher was saying the last words over little phils remains old malcolm dudleys illness had taken i sudden and violent turn he had been sinking for several days but the decline had been gradual and there had seemed no particular reason for alarm but during the funeral exercises ben had begun to feel uneasyâsome obscure premonition warned him to hurry homeward

as soon as the funeral was over he spoke to dr price who had been one of the pallbearers and the doctor had promised to be at mink run in a little while ben rode home as rapidly as he could as he went up the lane toward the house a negro lad came forward to take charge of the tired horse and ben could see from the boys expression that he had important information to communicate

yo uncle is monstous low sir said the boy you bettah go in an see im quick er youll be too late dey ain nobody wid im but ole aun viney

ben hurried into the house and to his uncles room where malcolm dudley lay dying outside the sun was setting and his red rays shining through the trees into the open window lit the stage for the last scene of this belated drama when ben entered the room the sweat of death had gathered on the old mans brow but his eyes clear with the light of reason were fixed upon old viney who stood by the bedside the two were evidently so absorbed in their own thoughts as to be oblivious to anything else and neither of them paid the slightest attention to ben or to the scared negro lad who had followed him and stood outside the door but marvellous to hear viney was talking strangely slowly thickly but passionately and distinctly

you had me whipped she said do you remember that you had me whippedâwhippedâwhippedâby a poor white dog i had despised and spurned you had said that you loved me and you had promised to free meâ and you had me whipped but i have had my revenge 

her voice shook with passion a passion at which ben wondered that his uncle and she had once been young he knew and that their relations had once been closer than those of master and servant but this outbreak of feeling from the winkled old mulattress seemed as strange and weird to ben as though a stone image had waked to speech spellbound he stood in the doorway and listened to this ghost of a voice long dead

your uncle came with the money and left it and went away only he and i knew where it was but i never told you i could have spoken at any time for twentyfive years but i never told you i have waitedâi have waited for this moment i have gone into the woods and fields and talked to myself by the hour that i might not forget how to talkâand i have waited my turn and it is here and now

ben hung breathlessly upon her words he drew back beyond her range of visionlest she might see him and the spell be broken now he thought she would tell where the gold was hidden

he came she said and left the goldâtwo heavy bags of it and a letter for you an hour later he came back and took it all away except the letter i the money was here one hour but in that hour you had me whipped and for that you have spent twentyfive years in looking for nothingâsomething that was not here i have had my revenge for twentyfive years i have watched you look forânothing have seen you waste your time your property your life your mindâfor nothing for ah mars macolm you had me whippedâby another man

a shadow of reproach crept into the old mans eyes over which the mists of death were already gathering

yes viney he whispered you have had your revenge but i was sorry viney for what i did and you were not and i forgive you viney but you are unforgivingâeven in the presence of death

his voice failed and his eyes closed for the last time when she saw that he was dead by a strange revulsion of feeling the wall of outraged pride and hatred and revenge built upon one brutal and bitterly repented mistake and labouriously maintained for half a lifetime in her womans heart that even slavery could not crush crumbled and fell and let pass over it in one great and final flood the pentup passions of the past bursting into tears âstrange tears from eyes that had long forgot to weepâ old viney threw herself down upon her knees by the bedside and seizing old malcolms emaciated hand in both her own covered it with kisses fervent kisses the ghosts of the passionate kisses of their distant youth

with a feeling that his presence was something like sacrilege ben stole away and left her with her deadâthe dead master and the dead pastâand thanked god that he lived in another age and had escaped this sin

as he wandered through the old house a veil seemed to fall from his eyes how old everything was how shrunken and decayed the sheen of the hidden gold had gilded the dilapidated old house the neglected plantation his own barren life now that it was gone things appeared in their true light fortunately be was young enough to retrieve much of what had been lost when the old man was buried he would settle the estate sell the land make some provision for aunt viney and then with what was left go out into the world and try to make a place for himself and graciella for life intrudes its claims even into the presence of death

when the doctor came a little later ben went with him into the death chamber viney was still kneeling by her masters bedside but strangely still and silent the doctor laid his hand on hers and old malcolms which had remained clasped together

they are both dead he declared i knew their story my father told it to me many years ago

ben related what he had overheard

im not surprised said the doctor my father attended her when she had the stroke and after he always maintained that viney could speakâif she had wished to speak

the colonels eyes were heavy with grief that night and yet he lay awake late and with his sorrow were mingled many consoling thoughts the people his people had been kind aye more than kind their warm hearts had sympathised with his grief he had sometimes been impatient of their conservatism their narrowness their unreasoning pride of opinion but in his bereavement they had manifested a feeling that it would be beautiful to remember all the days of his life all the people white and black had united to honour his dead

he had wished to help themâhad tried already he had loved the town as the home of his ancestors which enshrined their ashes he would make of it a monument to mark his sons resting place his fight against fetters and what he represented should take on a new character henceforward it should be a crusade to rescue from threatened barbarism the land which contained the tombs of his loved ones nor would he be alone in the struggle which he now clearly foresaw would be a long one the dear good woman he had asked to be his wife could help him he needed her clear spiritual vision and in his lifelong sorrow he would need her sympathy and companionship  for she had loved the child and would share his grief she knew the people better than he and was in closer touch with them she could help him in his schemes of benevolence and suggest new ways to benefit the people phils mother was buried far away among her own people could he consult her he felt sure she would prefer to remain there here she would be an alien note and when laura died she could lie with them and still be in her own place

 have you heard the hews sir asked the housekeeper when he came down to breakfast the next morning

no mrs hughes what is it

they lynched the negro who was in jail for shooting young mr fetters and the other man

the colonel hastily swallowed a cup of coffee and went down town it was only a short walk already there were excited crowds upon the street discussing the events of the night the colonel sought caxton who was just entering his office

theyve done it said the lawyer

so i understand when did it happen 

about one oclock last night a crowd came in from sycamoreânot all at once but by twos and threes and got together in clay johnsons saloon with ben green your discharged foreman and a lot of other riffraff and went to the sheriff and took the keys and took johnson and carried him out to where the shooting was and

spare me the details he is dead

yes

a rope a treeâa puff of smoke a flash of flameâor a barbaric orgy of fire and bloodâwhat matter which  at the end there was a lump of clay and a hundred murderers where there had been one before

can we do anything to punish this crime

we can try

and they tried the colonel went to the sheriff the sheriff said he had yielded to force but he never would have dreamed of shooting to defend a worthless negro who had maimed a good white man had nearly killed another and had declared a vendetta against the white race

by noon the colonel had interviewed as many prominent men as he could find and they became increasingly difficult to find as it became known that he was seeking them the town he said had been disgraced and should redeem itself by prosecuting the lynchers he may as well have talked to the empty air the trail of fetters was all over the town some of the officials owed fetters money others were under political obligations to him others were plainly of the opinion that the negro got no more than he deserved such a wretch was not fit to live the coroners jury returned a verdict of suicide a grim joke which evoked some laughter doctor mc kenzie to whom the colonel expressed his feelings and whom he asked to throw the influence of his church upon the side of law and order said it is too bad i am sorry but it is done let it rest no good can ever come of stirring it up further

later in the day there came news that the lynchers after completing their task had proceeded to the dudley plantation and whipped all the negroes who did not learn of their coming in time to escape the claim being that johnson could not have maintained himself in hiding without their connivance and that they were therefore parties to his crimes

the colonel felt very much depressed when he went to bed that night and lay for a long time turning over in his mind the problem that confronted him

so far he had been beaten except in the matter of the cotton mill which was yet unfinished his efforts in bud johnsons behalfâthe only thing he had undertaken to please the woman he loved had proved abortive his promise to the teacherâwell he had done his part but to no avail he would be ashamed to meet taylor face to face with what conscience could a white man in clarendon ever again ask a negro to disclose the name or hiding place of a coloured criminal  in the effort to punish the lynchers he stood to all intents and purposes singlehanded and alone and without the support of public opinion he could do nothing

the colonel was beaten but not dismayed perhaps god in his wisdom had taken phil away that his father might give himself more completely and singlemindedly to the battle before him had phil lived a father might have hesitated to expose a childs young and impressionable mind to the things which these volcanic outbursts of passion between mismated races might cause at any unforeseen moment now that the way was clear he could go forward hand in hand with the good woman who had promised to wed him in the work he had laid out he would enlist good people to demand better laws under which fetters and his kind would find it harder to prey upon the weak

diligently he would work to lay wide and deep the foundations of prosperity education and enlightenment upon which should rest justice humanity and civic righteousness in this he would find a worthy career patiently would he await the results of his labours and if they came not in great measure in his own lifetime he would be content to know that after years would see their full fruition

so that night he sat down and wrote a long answer to kirbys letter in which he told him of phils death and burial and his own grief something there was too of his plans for the future including his marriage to a good woman who would help him in them kirby he said had offered him a golden opportunity for which he thanked him heartily the scheme was good enough for any one to venture upon but to carry out his own plans would require that he invest his money in the state of his residence where there were many openings for capital that could afford to wait upon development for large returns he sent his best regards to mrs jerviss and his assurance that kirbys plan was a good one perhaps kirby and she alone could handle it if not there must be plenty of money elsewhere for so good a thing

he sealed the letter and laid it aside to be mailed in the morning to his mind it had all the force of a final renunciation a severance of the last link that bound him to his old life

long the colonel lay thinking after he retired to rest and the muffled striking of the clock downstairs had marked the hour of midnight ere he fell asleep and he had scarcely dozed away when he was awakened by a scraping noise as though somewhere in the house a heavy object was being drawn across the floor the sound was not repeated however and thinking it some trick of the imagination he soon slept again

as the colonel slept this second time he dreamed of a regenerated south filled with thriving industries and thronged with a prosperous and happy people where every man having enough for his needs was willing that every other man should have the same where law and order should prevail unquestioned and where every man could enter through the golden gate of hope the field of opportunity where lay the prizes of life which all might have an equal chance to win or lose

for even in his dreams the colonels sober mind did not stray beyond the bounds of reason and experience that all men would ever be equal he did not even dream there would always be the strong and the weak the wise and the foolish but that each man in his little life in this our little world might be able to make the most of himself was an ideal which even the colonels waking hours would not have repudiated

following this pleasing thread with the unconscious rapidity of dreams the colonel passed in a few brief minutes through a long and useful life to a happy end when he too rested with his fathers by the side of his son and on his tomb was graven what was said of ben adhem here lies one who loved his fellow men and the further words and tried to make them happy

shortly after dawn there was a loud rapping a the colonels door come downstairs and look on de piazza colonel said the agitated voice of the servant who had knocked come quick suh

there was a vague terror in the mans voice that stirred the colonel strangely he threw on a dressing gown and hastened downstairs and to the front door of the hall which stood open a handsome mahogany burial casket stained with earth and disfigured by rough handling rested upon the floor of the piazza where it had been deposited during the night conspicuously nailed tothe coffin lid was a sheet of white paper upon which were some lines rudely scrawled in a handwriting that matched the spelling kurnell french take notis berry yore ole nigger somewhar else he cant stay in oak semitury the majority of the white people of this town who dident tend yore nigger funarl woant have him there niggers by there selves white peepul by there selves and them that lives in our town must bide by our rules by order of cumitty

the colonel left the coffin standing on the porch where it remained all day an object of curious interest to the scores and hundreds who walked by to look at it for the news spread quickly through the town no one however came in if there were those who reprobated the action they were silent the mob spirit which had broken out in the lynching of johnson still dominated the town and no one dared to speak against it

as soon as colonel french had dressed and breakfasted he drove over to the cemetery those who had exhumed old peters remains had not been unduly careful the carelessly excavated earth had been scattered here and there over the lot the flowers on old peters grave and that of little phil had been trampled under footâ whether wantonly or not inevitably in the execution of the ghoulish task

the colonels heart hardened as he stood by his sons grave then he took a long lingering look at the tombs of his ancestors and turned away with an air of finality

from the cemetery he went to the undertakers and left an order thence to the telegraph office from which he sent a message to his former partner in new york and thence to the treadwells

miss laura came forward with outstretched hands and tearstained eyes to greet him

henry she exclaimed i am shocked and sorry i cannot tell you how much nor do i know what else to say except that the best people do notâcannotâcould notâapprove of it

the best people laura he said with a weary smile are an abstraction when any deviltry is on foot they are never there to prevent itâthey vanish into thin air at its approach when it is done they excuse it and they make no effort to punish it so it is not too much to say that what they permit they justify and they cannot shirk the responsibility to mar the livingâit is the history of lifeâbut to make war upon the deadâ i am going away laura never to return my dream of usefulness is over tonight i take away my dead and shake the dust of clarendon from my feet forever will you come with me

henry she said and each word tore her heart i have been expecting thisâsince i heard but i cannot go my duty calls me here my mother could not be happy anywhere else nor would i fit into any other life and here too i am usefulâand may still be usefulâand should be missed i know your feelings and would not try to keep you but oh henry if all of those who love justice and practise humanity should go away what would become of us

i leave tonight he returned and it is your right to go with me or to come to me

no henry nor am i sure that you would wish me to it was for the old towns sake that you loved me i was a part of your dreamâa part of the old and happy past upon which you hoped to build as upon the foundations of the old mill a broader and a fairer structure do you remember what you told me that nightâthat happy nightâthat you loved me because in me you found the embodiment of an ideal well henry that is why i did not wish to make our engagement known for i knew i felt the difficulty of your task and i foresaw that you might be disappointed and i feared that if your ideal should be wrecked you might find me a burden i loved you henryâi seem to have always loved you but i would not burden you

no no lauraânot sol not sol

and you wanted me for phils sake whom we both loved and now that your dream is over and phil is gone i should only remind you of where you lost him and of your disappointment and ofâthis other thing and i could not be sure that you loved me or wanted me surely you cannot doubt it laura his voice was firm but to her sensitive spirit it did not carry conviction

you remembered me from my youth she continued tremulously but bravely and it was the image in your memory that you loved and now when you go away the old town will shrink and fade from your memory and your heart and you will have none but harsh thoughts of it nor can i blame you greatly for you have grown far away from us and we shall need many years to overtake you nor do you need me henryâi am too old to learn new ways and elsewhere than here i should be a hindrance to you rather than a help but in the larger life to which you go think of me now and then as one who loves you still and who will try in her poor way with such patience as she has to carry on the work which you have begun and which youâoh henry 

he divined her thought though her tearfilled eyes spoke sorrow rather than reproach

yes he said sadly which i have abandoned yes laura abandoned fully and forever

the colonel was greatly moved but his resolution remained unshaken

laura he said taking both her hands in his i swear that i should be glad to have you with me come away the place is not fit for you to live in

no henry i it cannot be i could not go i my duty holds me here i god would not forgive me if i abandoned it go your way live your life marry some other woman if you must who will make you happy but i shall keep henryânothing can ever take away from me âthe memory of one happy summer

no no laura it need not be so i shall write you youll think better of it but i go tonightânot one hour longer than i must will i remain in this town i must bid your mother and graciella goodbye

he went into the house mrs treadwell was excited and sorry and would have spoken at length but the colonels farewells were brief

i cannot stop to say more than goodbye dear mrs treadwell i have spent a few happy months in my old home and now i am going away laura will tell you the rest

graciella was tearfully indignant

it was a shame she declared peter was a good old nigger and it wouldnt have done anybody any harm to leave him there id rather be buried beside old peter than near any of the poor white trash that dug him upâso there im so sorry youre going away but i hope sometime she added stoutly to see you in new york dont forget

ill send you my address said the colonel

it was a few weeks later old ralph dudley and viney had been buried ben dudley had ridden in from mink run had hitched his horse in the back yard as usual and was seated on the top step of the piazza beside graciella his elbows rested on his knees and his chin upon his hand graciella had unconsciously imitated his drooping attitude both were enshrouded in the deepest gloom and had been sunk for several minutes in a silence equally profound graciella was the first to speak

well then she said with a deep sigh there is absolutely nothing left

not a thing he groaned hopelessly except my horse and my clothes and a few odds and ends which belong to me fetters will have the landâtheres not enough to pay the mortgages against it and im in debt for the funeral expenses

and what are you going to do

gracious knowsâi wish i did i came over to consult the family i have no trade no profession no land and no money i can get a job at braking on the railroadâor may be at clerking in a store id have asked the colonel for something in the millâbut that chance is gone

gone echoed graciella gloomily i see my fate i shall marry you because i cant help loving you and couldnt live without you and i shall never get to new york but be all my life a poor mans wifeâa poor white mans wife

no graciella we might be poor but not poorwhite our blood will still be of the best

it will be all the same blood without money may count for one generation but it wont hold out for two they relapsed into a gloom so profound so rayless that they might almost be said to have reveled in it it was lightened or at least a diversion was created by miss lauras opening the garden gate and coming up the walk ben rose as she approached and graciella looked up

i have been to the postoffice said miss laura here is a letter for you ben addressed in my care it has the new york postmark

thank you miss laura

eagerly bens hand tore the envelope and drew out the enclosure swiftly his eyes devoured the lines they were typewritten and easy to follow

glory he shouted glory hallelujah listen

he read the letter aloud while graciella leaned against his shoulder and feasted her eyes upon the words the letter was from colonel french my dear ben i was very much impressed with the model of a cotton gin and press which i saw you exhibit one day at mrs treadwells you have a fine genius for mechanics and the model embodies i think a clever idea which is worth working up if your uncles death has left you free to dispose of your time i should like to have you come on to new york with the model and we will take steps to have the invention patented at once and form a company for its manufacture as an evidence of good faith i enclose my draft for five hundred dollars which can be properly accounted for in our future arrangements

o ben gasped graciella in one long drawn out ecstatic sigh

o graciella  exclaimed ben as he threw his arms around her and kissed her rapturously regardless of miss lauras presence  now you can go to new york as soon as you like

colonel french took his dead to the north and buried both the little boy and the old servant in the same lot with his young wife and in the shadow of the stately mausoleum which marked her restingplace there surrounded by the monuments of the rich and the great in a beautiful cemetery which overlooks a noble harbour where the ships of all nations move in endless procession the body of the faithful servant rests beside that of the dear little child whom he unwittingly lured to his death and then died in the effort to save and in all the great company of those who have laid their dead there in love or in honour there is none to question old peters presence or the colonels right to lay him there sometimes at night a ray of light from the uplifted torch of the statue of liberty the gift of a free people to a free people falls athwart the white stone which marks his resting placeâfit prophecy and omen of the day when the sun of liberty shall shine alike upon all men

when the colonel went away from clarendon he left his affairs in caxtons hands with instructions to settle them up as expeditiously as possible the cotton mill project was dropped and existing contracts closed on the best terms available fetters paid the old noteâeven he would not have escaped odium for so barefaced a robberyâand mrs treadwells last days could be spent in comfort and miss laura saved from any fear for her future and enabled to give more freely to the poor and needy barclay fetters recovered the use of one eye and embittered against the whole negro race by his disfigurement went into public life and devoted his talents and his education to their debasement the colonel had relented sufficiently to contemplate making over to miss laura the old family residence in trust for use as a hospital with a suitable fund for its maintenance but it unfortunately caught fire and burned downâand he was hardly sorry he sent catherine bud johnsons wife a considerable sum of money and she bought a gorgeous suit of mourning and after a decent interval consoled herself with a new husband and he sent word to the committee of coloured men to whom he had made a definite promise that he would be ready to fulfil his obligation in regard to their school whenever they should have met the conditions

one day a year or two after leaving clarendon the colonel in company with mrs french formerly a member of his firm now his partner in a double senseâwas riding upon a fast train between new york and chicago upon a trip to visit a western mine in which the reorganised french and company limited were interested he noticed that the pullman car porter a tall and stalwart negro was watching him furtively from time to time upon one occasion when the colonel was alone in the smokingroom the porter addressed him

excuse me suh he said ive been wondering ever since we left new york if you want colonel french 

yes im mr frenchâcolonel french if you want it so

 i lowed it must be you suh though youve changed the cut of your beard and are looking a little older suh i dont suppose you remember me

ive seen you somewhere said the colonelâno longer the colonel but like the porter let us have it so where was it

im henry taylor suh that used to teach school at clarendon i reckon you remember me now

yes said the colonel sadly i remember you now taylor to my sorrow i didnt keep my word about johnson did i

oh yes suh replied the porter i never doubted but what youd keep your word but you see suh they were too many for you there aint no one man can stop them folks down there when they once get started

and what are you doing here taylor

well suh the fact is that after you went away it got out somehow that i had told on bud johnson i dont know how they learned it and of course i knew you didnt tell it but somebody must have seen me going to your house or else some of my enemies guessed itâand happened to guess rightâand after that the coloured folks wouldnt send their children to me and i lost my job and wasnt able to get another anywhere in the state the folks said i was an enemy of my race and what was more important to me i found that my race was an enemy to me so i got out suh and i came noth hoping to find somethin better this is the best job ive struck yet but im hoping that sometime or other ill find something worth while

and what became of the industrial school project asked the colonel ive stood ready to keep my promise and more but i never heard from you

well suh after you went away the enthusiasm kind of died out and some of the white folks throwed cold water on it and it fell through suh

when the porter came along before the train reached chicago the colonel offered taylor a handsome tip

thank you suh said the porter but id rather not take it im a porter now but i want always one and hope i wont always be one and during all the time i taught school in clarendon you was the only white man that ever treated me quite like a manâand our folks just like peopleâand if you wont think im presuming id rather not take the money

the colonel shook hands with him and took his address shortly afterward he was able to find him something better than menial employment where his education would give him an opportunity for advancement taylor is fully convinced that his people will never get very far along in the world without the good will of the white people but he is still wondering how they will secure it for he regards colonel french as an extremely fortunate accident

and so the colonel faltered and having put his hand to the plow turned back but was not his after all the only way for no more now than when the man of sorrows looked out over the mount of olives can men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles the seed which the colonel sowed seemed to fall by the wayside it is true but other eyes have seen with the same light and while fetters and his kind still dominate their section other hands have taken up the fight which the colonel dropped in manufactures the south has gone forward by leaps and bounds the strong arm of the government guided by a wise and just executive has been reached out to crush the poisonous growth of peonage and men hitherto silent have raised their voices to commend here and there a brave judge has condemned the infamy of the chaingang and convict lease systems good men north and south have banded themselves together to promote the cause of popular education slowly like all great social changes but visibly to the eye of faith is growing up a new body of thought favourable to just laws and their orderly administration in this changed attitude of mind lies the hope of the future the hope of the republic

but clarendon has had its chance nor seems yet to have had another other towns some not far from it lying nearer the main lines of travel have been swept into the current of modern life but not yet clarendon there the grass grows thicker in the streets the meditative cows still graze in the vacant lot between the postoffice and the bank where the public library was to stand the old academy has grown more dilapidated than ever and a large section of plaster has fallen from the wall carrying with it the pencil drawing made in the colonels schooldays and if miss laura treadwell sees that the graves of the old frenches are not allowed to grow up in weeds and grass the colonel knows nothing of it the pigs and the loafersâleaner pigs and lazier loafersâstill sleep in the shade when the pound keeper and the constable are not active the limpid water of the creek still murmurs down the slope and ripples over the stone foundation of what was to have been the new dam while the birds have nested for some years in the vines that soon overgrew the unfinished walls of the colonels cotton mill white men go their way and black men theirs and these ways grow wider apart and no one knows the outcome but there are those who hope and those who pray that this condition willpass that some day our whole land will be truly free and the strong will cheerfully help to bear the burdens of the weak and justice the seed and peace the flower of liberty will prevail throughout all our borders
