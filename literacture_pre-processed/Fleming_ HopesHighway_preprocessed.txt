hopes highway fleming sarah lee brown  novel
beautiful santa maria land of the gods that nestles beneath wondrously blue skies lies upon a luxurious carpet of green on a prominence overlookingâas did psyche of the myths in her liquid mirror of oldâthe limpid bay of joan

in the seventeenth century wealthy spaniards had come over here in large numbers from the old world and because of its seclusion had chosen this heavenly spot for a home across the bay was to be seen another ideal place santa barbara where today only the ruins of a once most extensive cotton plantation remain to show the existence of former grandeur negro men and women may be seen working in the fields which show a few patches of cultivation rickety cabins scattered thickly here and there tell the tale of the passing of the masters of this once thriving island and of the reign of the blacks for investigation will show that no white man lives there now

in santa maria may also be seen ruins of an old monastery built by the spaniards in the seventeenth century after the state became a part of the union and the spaniards gradually dispersed other settlers came to this secluded spot which until the emancipation was one of the most aristocratic plantation settlements of the whole south and in those days cabin life of the better sort was a conspicuous feature of beautiful santa maria and of its neighbor santa barbara it seemed the purpose of the owners of the blacks to have this the one place where slavery was of a higher orderâif degrees of serfdom be possible

the approach to santa maria was very beautiful imagine a shellroad of great length and width lined on either side with drooping willowsâmossladenâsome interlocking forming spacious arches and others opening sufficiently at the top to let in the southern sunlight in all its regal splendor the effect was almost fairylike and to add enchantment to the scene one could for an instant imagine these drooping willows bowing as it were most hospitably to the traveler as if ushering him on and on to the resplendent glories of santa maria

in the days of its gloryâafter the traveler had left the willows behindâimposing residences might be seen as far as the eye could reach

from the quarters on summer nights plantation melodies were wafted on balmy breezes and as one drew nearer crooning lullabies sung by dusky mothers could be heardâlullabies so full of rest and hope

honey take yo  res on yo mammes breas see dat lightâafadin mong do pine trees in do wes yes de day is gone night is comin  on darksome night inns come to us befo another dawn

masters here were more or less kind to their slaves and consequently their reputation for gentleness spread far and wide at the slave market one might observe a striking evidence of this  for whenever a buyer from santa maria or santa barbara came along every slave showed up at his best upon the auction block

when the death knell to slavery was sounded and lincoln signed the great emancipation proclamationâwhich spelled liberty for millions of slavesâa great many of the blacks in santa maria and santa barbara remained with their owners

of these slaveholders john vanceâregarded as one of the wealthiest in this realmâ freed and educated one of his loyal servitors with the idea that should the freedom that the bondmen craved come to them he could impart to his people some of the essentials necessary for a recently emancipated race to understand thus enoch vance taking his masters name attracted much attention by his application and brilliancy at a western university and returned to his former owner at the announcement of freedom fortunately he arrived in santa maria a few months before his benefactors death

john vance because of the manumission of the negroes had lost some of his vast fortune but in his great generosity he left nearly half of what was left for the education of the blacks whom slavery had kept so long in ignorance

upon his deathbed he sent for his former slave

go said he to enoch and upon the land i shall give you at the entrance of this beautiful santa mariaâland that i love so wellâ facing the drooping willows and the shellroad erect a school that shall be a guiding star to your people lost on the road of ignorance be a leader to themâbe a mosesâsafely carrying them over the bed sea to the promised land 

john vances name was held in reverence by every negro in and around santa maria how many black men and women in slavery had heard of this good man and prayed that some day they might become his property  often on moonlight nights he would listen to the singing of his slaves as they sat in their cabin doors voicing the familiar plantation melodiesâthe effect of which was marvelousâas it passed from door to door on the balmy breezes one song that particularly pleased their master was  lord id rather go to glory lord id rather go to glory lord id rather go to glory than to leave this master kind

john vance was in the habit of visiting his slaves in their cabins he would talk with them and thus he became a part of their lives he never had occasion to whip a slave never kept an overseer neither did he ever have a runaway when a slave became in any way obstinate or unruly the master would only have  to suggest in a kindly way that perhaps the bondman would like another master and almost invariably he would get the result he desired he could count upon the fingers of one handâout of a thousand or more slaves that he ownedâthe few cases he could not handle

being of a very sympathetic nature he often wanted to help many a one who yearned for an education for if there was any aristocrat in the south who desired to change the existing laws regarding educating slaves john vance truly was one as soon as freedom came he secured teachers for those of the adults that desired to learn while the children were compelled to spend a certain number of hours each day in the schoolroom indeed his was the first institute for blacks in the south being the forerunner of the many organizations that were established for this race by loyal northern supporters

the young negro lad enoch whom john vance specially favored was born upon the vance plantation as was his mother his father had been bought by vance from a neighboring slaveholderâwho had lost heavily in speculation the father of enoch had courted and married enochs mother and when the son was born his mother felt that the boy was destined to be a moses to his people

knowing how enochs mother yearned for an education and seeing the same desire manifested by the lad john vance hoped that he might be able to start him on the road of knowledge he was fortunately able to do this by giving the lad his freedom and sending him to that greatest of western colleges which has ever held and which still holds open the door of hope to all who would enter therein thus enoch developed into a true leader of his people for he was the first negro qualified to teach the blacks in the south after emancipation

when john vance lay dead in the big house negroes came from far and near to view the abode of this true lover of humanity many too poor to buy flowers wrought wreaths out of wild flowers and lay them at the entrance of the big house children could be seen strewing flowers in the familiar spots and along the roads he frequented men and women wept like babies as from their cabins they saw the body of their dearest friend borne to its final restingplace

after the closing up of the big house the late owners widowed sister who had made her home with him returned north to her husbands people the division of his lands was made according to john vances dying wish which gave his belongings to the exslaves that had served him faithfully and these same people by their frugality became the hope of the south while by their efforts great business enterprises were launchedâenterprises that today together with the institute are the pride of the black south

this institute was a haven for the negro located picturesquely at the entrance of santa maria and overlooking the bay of joan it seemed almost a temple in a land of promise and flocking to its doors came from all parts of the world those eager to learn

enoch first made the curriculum cover those things that his people most neededâagriculture and manual training for he was aware that a people just emerging from slavery could need nothing more than the rudiments of education as time advanced however other departments were added and finally from the leaders school emerged men and women fitted for every vocation in life

the leader was heralded far and wide for his great achievements even abroad he was talked of and educators of distant lands visited his institute for the purpose of studying his methods of instruction great men from different parts of the country either gave their support financially or otherwise to the vance institute and from its example other schools sprang up heralding as did their alma mater higher education for the black man

this system of enlightenment in the course of time became unpopular with a certain element in the southâan element that crowded in after slavery from the mountainous districts to the west of santa maria or that came in by immigration and as the slaveholding aristocracy passed out by death or migration these people became leading figures soon wielding the political ax that chopped down all things that were unfavorable to themâamong them the political status of the negro whom they considered to be growing too powerful throughout the south state after state disfranchised the blacks and decreed against higher education for them thus because of legislative interference the great ambition of the leaders life was blighted

joe vardam an enemy to the cause of the blacks worked his way forward politically fighting with tooth and nail to have the whole educational curriculum changed so far as higher education for blacks was concerned

realizing that he was utterly powerless to contend with this powerful demagogue the leader was compelled to bend to his will and strike out from his course of study psychology sociology comparative literature law theology mathematics and the classics

we dont want any niggers reading latin and greek joe vardam would say soon theyll be wantin to call on us and be askin to marry our daughters

the leader remembered that his former master had often been upbraided in the state conventions by this fellow and he remembered too that vardam had once shaken his fist in john vances face remarking if i ever get a chance to deal a blow at these damned blacks ill deal some blow believe me 

true to his oath he dealt a deadly blow and the leader hurt to the soulâhaving had all his fond hopes blighted and being powerless to ask in the name of the law protection in the exercise of a right that he considered sacredâ died of a broken heart in the very prime of his manhood leaving to the world the memory of a wellspent life

phillip ennery a boyhood chum of john vances was one of the great plantation owners in the prosperous days of santa maria phillip had two sons one of whom francis at his mothers death left the south when still a young man with his share of the ennery fortune and entered the brokerage business in new york city in the course of time lie met a beautiful young woman of bostons most exclusive circle and married her she did not live long after the birth of her daughter grace and francis ennery was left a widower in new york with a little daughter of five years to look after

graces maternal grandmother who lived in boston was an invalid and her uncle john ennery had never married  thus the dear little girl for a time after her mothers death was dependent upon strangers this fact was a source of some worry to her grandmother who realized that unless she could arrange to have the child under her guidanceâeven though she were disabled that the little girl would be  brought up among paid attendants this she felt would not be the best thing for a child so young thus a plan was adopted by which grace could remain with her grandmother until she should be old enough to enter a boarding school after a competent governess had been secured francis ennery returned from the hub to new york grieved that his happy home life should be thus shattered

graces grandmother was of puritan stock and reverenced those ideals for which her forefathers desiring to enjoy freedom in a new land had braved the dangers of the ocean and the terrors of warlike tribes this love for liberty was so early implanted in the childs mind that we find her eager to hear the great stories of struggle and sacrifice and privation for freedoms sakeâstories that her grandmother took pride in telling her

as she sat with her grandmother she learned of the historical interest associated with the many places in and around boston and when she went out for her daily walks she beheld these spots and loved them because of their glorious associations

granny she would often say tell me of the boston tea party

then her grandmother would weave one of the prettiest talcs concerning the tax on tea

much enthused was she when she was told of the battle of bunker hill and how her greatgreatgrandfather had died in defense of the rights of the colonists and how her grandfather defended the rights of the slaves taking an active part in the working of the famous  underground kail road the story of how he helped them escape from their cruel masters in the south greatly interested her young mind

grace never grew weary of listening to the sorrows of the blacks and ofttimes she would say to charlotte her governess take me where i may see these people that grandpa helped to get away from their had masters and charlotte show me a man like uncle tom who was so good to little eva

as grace grew to womanhood she never forgot these pictures that her grandmother painted for her in such glowing colors the negro wherever she met him felt the sympathetic spirit for his sufferings that animated the girl

the years flew rapidly by and with them grace grew of course francis ennery often came to sec his daughter who began to look more and more like her dead mother each day at the suggestion of her grandmother who was gradually declining the father decided to send the child to a select boardingschool as she was now twelve years of age the day grace bade her dear grandmother goodby was a sad one for her how she hated to leave this place with all its dear associations for it was her mothers birthplace the storehouse of everything sacred in her childmind then too she loved the implements of warârelics of the familys braveryâthat had their places here and there around the house from cellar to attic

her spirits were revived only when her grandmother told her that she was going to the same school from which her mother had been graduated this of course pleased grace in a way but it did not prevent her crying herself to sleep for the first few nights after her entrance however the beauty of the scenery her joy in her studies the happiness of her teachers and the spirited life of the school soon revived her youthful spirits

thus passed grace ennerys years from girlhood to womanhood surrounded by every luxury for she was a rich girl yet poor too in that she was bereft of that richest of blessings a fond mother to whom she might now and again unburden herselfâone whom she might kiss and fondle with the abandon of a spoilt child so after all grace ennery might be called a poor little rich girl think of the loneliness that came to her young life at times think of the yearnings she had a father you say yes she did and a devoted one too  but he never tilled that void or satisfied an instinct that lay hidden within her soul and because of her warmth of feeling and her passionate yearnings it was a wonder that the suppression of her longing did not make her sad and pensive and thus embitter her youthful existence grace however possessed an indomitable will coupled with a courageous heart which kept her from ever wincing hence there bloomed into womanhood under the faithful guidance of the teachers of saint agnes school at lynhurst a girl who developed the most beautiful characterânoble strong and modest

after her graduation grace was sent abroad to study artâfor which she had formed a decided talentâchaperoned by one of her instructors who also desired to make further studies in the same field miss arnold who was very much attached to grace made a pleasant traveling companion and two delightful years were spent studying the old masters in the different countries of europe

one morning a most unexpected thing happenedâgrace received a cablegram announcing that her father had been advised by his physician to drop his business cares and responsibilities for the present and take a trip around the world and that he wished to see her before sailing for the orient by way of the mediterranean

on graces receiving this news miss arnold comforted her and assisted her in every possible way so that nothing might delay her departure and grace after being placed in the care of good friends was on her way to america

she reached home just before her father sailed for greece and egypt in one of his last talks with her he said as i look upon your face you so remind me of your dead mother with your fluffy golden hair and large blue eyes i pray that you may develop into the noble woman she was remember always grace that you were her idol i dislike to leave you at this time when i know you should have me with you but i must bow to my physicians command you have an uncle in the south in beautiful santa maria where i was born i hope upon my return from the east to gaze once more upon those mossladen willows under which i had my first boyish dreams

all alone in a great house he lives upon a plantation where once your grandfather held numerous slaves he writes that you must pay him a visit soon when you will sec one of natures enchanting spots

i have made my home with the grants for a number of years and they have been very kind to me if you do not return to your studies make your home with them i am sure they will be very good to you the property and stocks left by your mother have been wisely invested and yield a large income this with other sums that i have placed in trust for you will make it possible for you to grant your every wish while i am away deny yourself nothing for there is plenty for everything

the next day mr ennery left with his valet grace found herself pleasantly located in busy new york with her fathers friends the grants after getting somewhat acquainted she returned to her work in the world of art where because of her undoubted talent she became quickly known she found mrs grant very busy with her numberless social dutiesâentertaining and being entertained to a degree

after a few months had elapsed grace decided to visit her uncle in santa maria shortly after her arrival her uncle was called to europe on business and she was left in control of the place she enjoyed the delights of the big house but felt very lonely so wishing to see and learn a little more of the south she took quarters in a nearby hotel

because of a deep sympathy for the blacks formed in her early years it was her delight to wander with a friend or twoâbut oftener alone âin the neighborhoods where they were to be found there to study their humble lives

the leader of his people lay dead and as the funeral cortege wound its way into the peaceful graveyard to lay at rest all that remained of a once powerful man one could hear from the scattered groups of spectators such expressions as these wholl take his place well now go to do dogs for de white folks will surely do us bad dey done peck on him an peck on him till dey done kill him

one of the old women began to sing and others took up the strain de lord done take our moses de lord done take our moses de lord done take our mosesâ who we gwine to follow now

deep into the heart of tom brinley sank these expressions and although but a boy of fifteen years he was much disturbed he suddenly felt the weight of a people upon his shoulders and an irresistible impulse seized him to answer these poor dependent people

imagine a little brown boyâbarefooted with clothes covered with patchesâattempting to quell the sobbing multitude that had lost all hope because of the death of the leader however obeying the impulse tom sprang among the group of sobbing women and with wideopen eyesâeyes that brimmed over with sympathyâand with the assurance of a man cried out  dont be sad dont cry  look at me ill lead youâill be your moses

o black boyâwith that look of exultation on your faceâsurely some day you will be great with your wonderful determination you truly have been sent to earth for some purpose in your life the divine will shine with such glorious brightness that men will forget the hue of your skin thought grace who was present

surprised for an instant by toms words the mourning groups temporarily forgot their grief and looked at the boy when one woman had recovered sufficiently she said  go long boy you done gone stark crazy you is

then a group of the rowdy clement of which the south is full and who had gathered for no other purpose than curiosity jeered at tom and one of them tripped him up  le fell against an iron rail hitting his head then lay upon the ground in a swoon

some kindhearted men picked him up and carried him to his home which was not very far off what of his assailants you ask this class compose the criminal element of the south many of the lynchings in that region are occasioned by the misdeeds of some one of this idle class of negroes who care little or nothing about leaders or rights then too the laws of the south had become so lax in the matter of offenses perpetrated by blacks against blacks that it was useless to complain

grace ennery who was a witness to all that had happened followed the limp body of little tom to his mothers cabin of two rooms

toms mother was a quiet sympathetic woman of about forty with large glowing eyes and a slightly bent frame which told of much drudgery

tom truly has her eyes thought grace as she looked upon the mother when the men who carried tom told of what had happened her reply was  toms always bein pecked on folks don seem to understan him

upon a clean but humble bed they placed the little lad grace ennery assisted in bringing him to

i shall never forget his deep soulstirring eyesâso full of purpose she remarked to friends afterward as he came ont of his swoon his first words were  all right hollow gang you shall yet call me leader mother didnt you hear our leader say that when he was a little slave boy he would call the other slave children around him and tell them that he would some day be a great man and the leader of his people and even they would not believe him 

yes replied his mother softly stroking his forehead

and mother he continued see what a great man he became

grace ennery listened to the little fellow with much interest and when the crowd had somewhat disappeared she asked the mother if she could be of any further service

lor bless you dear lady she replied tom is given to dem failin out spells whenever any one hits his head when he use to work wid mister joe he would ofttimes send for me to ris tom out of dem spells when he done hit him fur somethin

will you have those boys punished who willfully meddled with tom asked grace oh miss you mus be a stranger here yes im from the north

i thought so maam de white folks don bother bout our troubles lessen they cant help it

my that is a very discouraging condition of affairs

well maam we are gettin so used to trouble dat we don look for justice till we die an then come judgment day was tlie resigned reply

grace bade tom goodby and slipping a bill into his mothers hand said i expect to leave for the north in a few days but will sec you before i go

toms mother bowed her visitor out graciously it was somewhat new to her to have a sympathetic caller from the opposite race

the blacks at this time owing to the injustice of vardam were so crushed that any white person having any relations with them other than those of employer and employed was considered an enemy to the cause of white supremacy down with the blacks was the slogan of vardam and his allies

grace of course did not know of the sentiment regarding the blacks and even though she was the only white woman present in her girlish optimism she had not observed it hers was a divine sympathy impartial and uncolored

but after all a mans ideals aspirations hopes and longings are not controlled by the color of his skin does not a brown horse that has broken his leg feel the same pain that a white horse doesâdoes he not demand the same amount of attention regardless of the color of his hide

the next day was sunday and after attending church grace had a strong desire to glance at the grave of the dead leader this desire had been interfered with on the previous day because of the accident to little tom

she had never seen the leader yet even in the north his fame had reached her ear and she had learned to respect him for his achievements among his people his success was greatly appreciated by the north and his advice had been sought by men of high as well as low degree

knowing all this grace was desirous of seeing the mound of dirt under which the body of this famed negro rested so she sauntered slowly to that spot on the grounds of the great school that he had established she was not known therefore was not interfered with but one crosslooking white man who to graces mind had the look of a man who might have been a cruel slaveholder such as she had read about in uncle toms cabin stopped her as she entered the grounds

turning around grace saw a picturesque but not a very prepossessinglooking individual âa tall rawboned and sinewy individual of about fifty with a widebrimmed slouch hat tilted on one side a long coat and trousers tucked in leather boots who walked with a long swinging stride and spoke with a slow southern drawl but if his figure and attire were striking his face was not attractive grace found herself looking into a pair of fierce devilish black eyes that gleamed beneath shaggy eyebrows besides these eyes she saw a decidedly hooked nose which surmounted a thin cruel mouth and a long jaw which was covered with a beard of medium growth

but if the face was evil and sinister in repose it took on added malignity as the man smiled sardonically plainly here was a man with executive and administrative ability with power to dominate the ignorant masses  a man possessed of a selfish cruel nature

say miss he said aint you fraid to be travelin in these nigger haunts

no answered grace somewhat indignant so far you have been my only annoyance is that so was his surly query i guess you dont know who i am

perhaps i dont and neither do i care to know who you are even if you were the governor

well if you ever get into trouble with these niggers you neednt bother joe vardam he retorted angrily turning away

grace walked on and soon reached the leaders grave she had made no reply to joe vardams last remark neither had she looked back  but had kept on until she came to the spot that she was seeking this she could not miss because of the profusion of flowers that covered it she rested upon a stone coping and gazed upon the manyhued flowers that in the suns dancing rays seemed to stir and send their mingled perfume up to heaven

while sitting there wondering about the people whom this worthy man represented grace was startled by a rustle of leaves behind her it was the first of october when nature clothed herself in gorgeous robes of crimson and gold and even the ground was covered with a golden leafy carpet

her revery broken she turned and saw tom as she looked up he cried aint de flowers pretty missus look de sun is comin down to them

and the boy stood there entranced by the wedding of the sun and the flowers

tom you loved your leader asked grace sympathetically

yessum answered tom still under the spell of the scene

grace continued did you go to his school

yessum he replied again still not taking his eyes away from the grave

he must have been a very wonderful man to impress you so strongly i hope some day you will be as great and influential a man as he was

i will maam if joe vardam dont turn de hose on me as he did the leader

who is joe vardam

didnt you pass a man when you come in dc school

yes i remember that i did

well dats de one maam who would kill us all up if he could hes powerfully strong missus

so he interfered with the progress of the school

yessum folks call him goliath here and they is all fraid of him

i hope he may some day meet his david tom retorted grace with earnestness

the chapel bell tolled two and grace arose to go bidding tom who still was looking admiringly at the flowers goodby she told him that she would be leaving for her northern home soon but would see both him and his mother before she left

grace walked slowly to her hotel thinking of the sorrows of this race

o black boy thought she too sensitive were you made you too shall have many sorrows for my people do not believe in souls of black folks 

the next day grace sitting at her window at the hotel after supper glancing over the daily papers was startled by a heinous yell looking out she saw four white men dragging a poor negro to the park which faced the hotel on their trail a thousand whites followed crying at the top of their voices  lynch him lynch him

she had heard and read much of lynchings but never thought she would witness such a barbarous scene enacted by her own people yet here was a poor fellowâperhaps innocent of the crime with which he was chargedâbeing brutally killed without being able to utter one single word in defense of himself

quickly they strung him up to a tree and daubing his body with pitch struck fire to him in telling of the fiendish deed afterward grace said  the sight was too brutal for words soon the sizzling and crackling of the fire could be heard and the smell of human flesh was stifling

i wanted to satisfy myself that real people were implicated in the deed but as i looked upon the upturned faces it seemed as if the spirit of humanity had fled from that mob and that in its stead a living devil was implanted oh thought i i cannot dwell another night among these peopled so in my excitement i packed my grip and went to the office to settle my bill after having done so and while waiting for transportation to the depot i encountered the same man whom i had met on the previous day he quickly recognized me and said with a laugh   i am sure glad you are going miss for we will certainly have to string up another nigger tomorrow  then he gave a fiendish chuckle and passed on

grace never bore any hatred in her heart for any one but this man joe vardara had created within her a most uncomfortable feeling

a few moments after her encounter with him she was whirled off to the depot beaching there she found that she had leisure on her hands before her train was due she wondered just how to pass away the time she wanted to talk with a real sympathizer or with one who even if he were not a sympathizer possessed a tinge of respect for his community and had ideals looking around the partly filled depot she saw no promise in the faces of those around her her eye was attracted toward the door and there she saw an immaculately dressed man of middle ageâtall and symmetrical of frameâwith the air of a born aristocrat he was ushered in by a black lad who seemed to be showing him every attention after he had arranged for his baggage the lad left him courteously bowing

surely thought grace this is a man i can talk toâone from whom i may gain information regarding these parts that no one whom i have yet seen would willingly give me

before he had espied her she arose and as the bench upon which he sat had only one other occupant she quickly sat there waiting for an opportunity to speak

the aristocrat as soon as his eyes rested upon grace regarded her with deep interest

pardon me he said are you an ennery  

yes she quietly replied fearful lest he might discern her eagerness to talk

you came here i suppose to visit your  he paused

uncle grace quickly replied

oh yes said he then francis was your father we were boys together and our parents were good friends

grace found herself drawing very near to the opportunity for which she longedâto be able to glean the information she desired

how do you like the south asked her companion

not at all she answered i am going home sooner than i anticipated because of the crime perpetrated before my eyes

oh the lynching you mean that has become a common occurrence in these parts i regret to say

i regret to say meant worlds to grace it made her feel that she had met a sympathizer

i am so glad to hear you talk thus remarked grace if it would not seem inquisitive i wish you would tell me why the blacks have so little protection in a country so unique in its republican form of government i have always loved my country and even though i knew conditions were not so very good in the south i did not understand it to be a condition that resulted from gross injustice on the part of my people towards a people powerless to protect themselves

my dear miss ennery you are too conscientious in this matter i fear we all would like to see the millennium if we could but the world is not ready for it yet

we may not be ready for the millennium interrupted grace but we should at all times use our consciences right is right sir oh pardon me if i have been too bold of course you know that i am a northerner and while for so young a woman i may express myself in too frank terms regarding my attitude toward your treatment of the blacks here yet i feel that i am justified because they are human beings and our brothers and we are our brothers keepers

mr garrett assured grace that she was justified in all she had said and that her view was no different from that of the average northerner yet even the northerner he went on after residing in the south for a time often became more bitter in his attitude toward the blacks than were those that had always lived there

along came the train and emerging from some inconspicuous corner the black boy who assisted mr garrett some time before came forward to be of further service to his employer mr garrett speaking very kindly bade him take graces luggage to the car and arrange her comfortably

at parting with her recent acquaintance grace said i thank yon so much sir for your patience in answering my questions i shall go away with a different impression than i would have had had i not met you

you flatter me miss ennery i am the one who has been benefited i would like to at this momentâif i had the powerâmake such laws as would give every black man woman and child better protection since we have had this pleasant little chat and also since your father and i are good friendsâalso your uncleâi trust you may give me the privilege of hunting you up on the train and continuing this conversation if it is agreeable to you

i shall be delighted replied grace

so giving her one of his cards the old aristocrat handed her over to his bodyservant who courteously escorted her to her seat

the car was well on its way to the north and grace had settled herself quite comfortably when mr garrett found his childhood chums laughter grace was much impressed with her newfound friend and waited with profound anticipation to hear what of interest he had to tell her

before delving into the allimportant question he told her that he was on his way to the governor of the state to report on the recent lynching which was a great source of grief to the committee of which he was a member this committee he further stated consisted of a group of men selected by the governor who met after such disturbances as lynchings and riots passed judgment upon them and reported their findings to the governor

why can you not stop such riots before they go as far as they did this afternoon

a lynchingbee is often gotten up so suddenly that frequently in one hour it is both planned and executed when we are able to jail the victim we are more likely to protect his body 

please tell me grace asked how things ever developed to this state of affairs in this beautiful settlement where natures artist has painted so lavishly the skies the bay and the trees and where everything is bathed in an atmosphere of serenity

settling himself comfortably and clearing his throat so that he might be distinctly heard above the rumbling of the train seward garrett began  in  the negro was given the ballot in this state about that time a negro was made secretary of the state a number of colored men also went to congress negro legislators held regal sway in the capitol with their mahogany tables brussels carpets and dresden china cuspidors at the change of administration in  the federal troops that protected the rights of the negro were withdrawn from this state and when other complications came up between republicans and democrats the southern confederates took possession of the state capitol by force then came the kuklux klans they were oathbound societies the members disguised with masks and armed to the teeth they rode at night committed depredations and did their bloody work they intimidated negro voters drove them by force from the polls and suppressed the negro leaders until eventually the constitutions of the southern states practically disfranchised the race but in spite of all these drawbacks the negro rose intellectually and financially of course you have heard of the leaders school

yes i have been on the grounds interposed grace

well then you saw what in spite of great opposition he accomplished he was forced because of the interference of the democrats hereâwho hold political sway of courseâto cut out all of the higher courses from the curriculum this has been a great blow to the blacks as nothing above the elementary grades can he taught now

do you not think this very unfair mr garrett

well i suppose you do but down here they do not think the negro ready for the higher stuff yet

well then the politicians are supposed to be the judges as to when the brain can accept certain branches of information if they are able to determine this then they know more than all the seers ever knew mr garrett few human beings have ever desired anything along intellectual lines unless they were ready for it tis sad to blight the higher bent of man tis cruelâman must at all times to develop the highest within him be a free agent oh tis all wrong all wrong

it may be but time will tell and remember miss ennery the worst enemies of the blacks are not the descendants of their former owners but a class of poor whites who have pushed in from the mountains and who never knew of them other than that they crowded them out of a livelihood by having the monopoly of service this condition of course kept them very poor barely above starvation  hence this is the cause of their intense prejudice these people prospered after emancipation and today are the life politically and commercially of the south the negro it is true was caught in a mesh that he is still untangling it is evident that the only satisfactory solution will be for him to find his own way out

but how can he do this without the protection that his country should offer

i dont know but he must do it some way miss ennery we anglosaxons surely musthave found an opportunity to wedge our way out of the conditions that we first faced generations ago

yes i know mr garrett but these people have a far greater fight than our anglosaxon ancestors had saddest of all are the distinct physical characteristics so unlike ours that make the problem a matter of condition pins color

mr garrett looking at his watch found that he had nearly readied his destination so getting up he wished miss ennery a safe journey home and asked her to come at some future time and visit his home in santa maria where his wife and daughters would he most happy to welcome her

after grace had thanked her companion for his courtesy and too for his extreme kindness in explaining matters so plainly as to racial conditions they parted as the train roiled in to the capital of the state

darkness had not yet completely taken possession of the landscape and grace sat admiring the southern sunsetâwith its wonderful golden huesâas it fell upon the autumn foliage making a most gorgeous display the skies so wondrously blue made grace wish for her palette and brushes

nature is so generous she thought depriving none of usâno matter how humbleâ of her grandeur

looking away toward the west she discerned mountains   those must be the mountains that mr garrett referred to there was the home of the poor whitesâmade poor by slavery surely there must be a law of retribution in crushing the slave our own people were crushed because an inferior element sprang upâan element that would never have come into existence but for the importation of slaves

after traveling a day and a night grace reached new york mr and mrs grant met her at the station they were whirled quickly home and she being quite fatigued without saying very much of her trip went directly to bed

before going to sleep she wondered what she could do to help the colored people for she determined to do something for them never having made a study of the sentiment of the north with regard to this race and not knowing to what extent prejudice existed she resolved to find out in a way she had been removed nearly all her life from the world at large because of her mothers death in a select boardingschool one would hardly hear of the negro and his condition and similar problems discussed to any extent

grace thought that she would try to find out the grant familys opinion regarding the question that dominated her young mind

this family consisted beside mr and mrs grant of a girl of twelve a boy of ten and a baby girl of four

aunt grace said margaret the oldest daughter after dinner the next night we missed you so much we thought that the niggers had stolen you didnt we mother

no margaret they did not bother me in the leastâin fact i enjoyed seeing them and talking with them

o aunt grace what could you find interesting in these people

ã great deal margaret i found them very much like ourselves in every way except color and in the south many who were pointed out to me as colored were really as white as you or i

they are wicked and had and were made by the devil chimed in jack who had left off his reading to listen

while mrs grantâone of those mothers who experience difficulty in controling her childrenâwas trying to quiet margaret and jack for she had quickly seen that their attitude was distasteful to grace baby eileen was singing eeny moony miney mo

catch a nigger by the toe if he hollers let im go eeny meeny miney mo   no children you must not deride these poor people their lot is so hard and they need a helping hand remarked grace earnestly

o aunt grace remarked margaret i couldnt love a niggerâi couldnt

then give them your sympathy said grace rising

mr grant was not at home so grace did not have a chance to sound his views however the opportunity was offered the next evening at dinner

as they sat chatting on various subjects the maid announced the fact that the same nigger who called the other evening was at the door

tell him i dont care to see him and i dont want him to be ringing my frontdoor bell again or ill have him arrested wanting me to offer a bill to introduce niggers into the state militia  absurd  niggers with firearms  id sooner trust these emigrants that are pouring in upon our shores

the maid left the room while mr grant was expostulating and soon grace heard the front door close with a bang

mr grant had entered the political arena while the great war was on to protect certain of his wall street interests the war in europe being over this country was facing some complicated issues

emigration seemed to have reached a serious stage after the european war this country in its generosity opened its gates without any reservation to this land came various classes of foreigners to avoid the responsibility that would devolve upon them of building new homes in europe upon this countrys investigating a number of plots to blow up various buildings it was found that anarchists had come over in large numbers so in order to avoid the danger that might arise by permitting more of these anarchistic spirits to infest the country a ban was placed upon emigration this of course was not kindly accepted by many yet it ultimately became a law

then the negro wanted to serve his country by admittance into the state militia where he might be trained as a soldier this did not meet the approval of many who were opposed to negroes being armed

these were the pressing questions of the time and were being seriously discussed

mr grant as grace ennery saw was an enemy to her cause and as such things dawn upon us when we wish to make use of them she remembered that her father had told her some time ago that he was stopping with folks whom he knew years ago in the south now she could see why he spoke thus she did not comment at all upon his last expression but discerned in his countenance something that recalled joe vardam vividly to her mind

i wonder she thought but she would wonder no more she wished to dismiss the dreadful thought from her mind and said to herself no it cannot be

after chatting awhile with mrs grant she retired for the night

while arranging her hair for bed grace resolved that she would use a portion of her income in behalf of the blacks just how she would do so she determined to leave to her maturer judgment

grace now became very busy taking up her work in art where she had left off because mrs grant insisted she went out occasionally to social functions her hostess was a social butterfly hitting here and there wherever pleasure could be found she was happiest when being entertained and entertaining this âentertainingâshe was very capable of doing because her husband provided liberally for her she had no special aim either for herself or her children she was continually on the go and could never understand why grace would not appreciate her opportunity to mingle in the highest society

grace she would often say you arc wasting your youth by not seeing more of life ho you think so mrs grant grace would reply i feel as though i would like to accomplish something before i took up social duties for i know from observation that i could never do much more than keep up with society were i to enter it

that may be true to some extent but at your age you should never talk so with your money and opportunity many a girl would consider herself blessed

then the maid would announce mrs de allen or count van silver or fanny de forest and away mrs grant would glide bedecked in silks and diamonds worn with dignity supreme upon a superstately figure crowned with a madonnalike face whereupon grace would betake herself to her own apartment unless requested by mrs grant to stay and meet her distinguished guests then she would he agreeable because she felt that she must

in her art work grace ennery was by no means mediocre she attracted attention on her return from abroad by a beautiful painting of two children entitled love in the picture one of the children a boy climbs an appletree to bring down the last appleâfar out on a frail branchâto the girl

frederick trower a patron of art contributing generously to the cultivation of the fine arts in new york city was attracted toward grace and during her previous stay in the city had called upon her frequently

during the war mr trower was called abroad to protect the interests of his father in paris and from time to time grace would receive some word from himâas she would from her father who was at this time in egypt not very long after her arrival home from the south grace found at her place at breakfast a letter postmarked paris  she hastily ate and returned to her room to read it the portion that had the greatest weight with her read as follows  i dont know what your attitude is toward the negro but you may be interested in knowing that the french army has enlisted many of these black men in the ranks and the report is that they make brave soldiers going into the hottest of the fray without reserve or fear

one herculean black was given a medal of honor a couple of weeks ago for his bravery in battle his physique was magnificentâtall erect of stature and well proportioned he impressed one as he stood to receive his degree the french people could not do enough for him imagine my attending a banquet in his honor the french seemed to have forgotten his color and spoke only of his valor and bravery

after all grace i feel that we americans are too narrow in our feelings what difference does it make whether bravery is garbed in black or white it is deeper than the skin it reaches the soul and the soul of the good is always white

i know you have come in touch with these black people of the south tell me your opinion as gained by your trip

grace after reading this interesting letter from fred trower unconsciously wiped her eyes and held the missive to her lips

i have decided she said half aloud i have decided to act upon my convictions the light that i have desired has been given to me

immediately she sat down and wrote a letter to tom brinleys mother in care of the institute as she had failed to get toms address in her excitement in leaving

now in santa maria politics had control of everything even the mails of colored people were continually being tampered with

it happened that the day graces letter reached santa maria joe vardam was lounging around the post office as he usually did as his money was made more or less from political graft he often when he had time on his hands helped billy the postmaster sort the mail in coming across this letter marked new york and written in a legible hand to tom brinleys mother joe yardam became curious

he had always had a suspicious feeling regarding this fellow he watched the development of his precocious mind with envy as he feared he might attract attention especially among those who were negro sympathizers often he shook his fist at the boy and told him to keep scarce

as soon as joe yardam discovered the letter he told billy that he would deliver it briskly walking to his cottage where he lived alone and stealthily entering it as if he feared even his own conscience he lit a kerosene lamp and hastily read the following words my dear mrs brinley i have been thinking of tom ever since my return i wanted so much to talk with you about him but the dreadful lynching hastened my departure

i want to educate tom and send him abroad if necessary i want to help him develop the splendid nascent manhood which slumbers in his nature

after reading this much joe yardam chuckled

ah my dear woman you will be baffled this time youll not get your wish if i can balk it

joe yardam was a politician of the lowest type there was nothing too degrading for him to do in order to gain his ends

it was whispered that he had beaten his poor wife to death and that he drove his son from home when the latter would not cooperate with him in political wrongs where the younger vardam went no one knew

it was also whispered that joe vardams father a very cruel slaveholder was killed by one of his slaves because he thrashed a woman slave until she became unconscious the slave in turn thrashed him and when vardams father drew his pistol to shoot him the slave wrested it from his hand and shot the master then the homicide gave himself up to the authorities to be dealt with as they saw fit

joe vardam whether because of the manner of his fathers death was seeking vengeance or because of the natural cruelty that possessed him was relentless wherever a negro was concerned for some reason he held a bitter hatred for the race

after thinking over the letter during the night joe vardam determined to place tom brinley where he would never attract attention day after day he walked the streets of santa maria in search of his prey wishing to catch him away from his home and surroundings not many days had passed by when he found his opportunity noticing that the leaders grave was bare and not having enough money to buy suitable flowers tom after school one day told his mother that he was going over to san joan to gather wild flowers for the leaders grave just as he was about to embark across the stream in a little rowboat which he found on the sands of santa maria he was seized by the collar by vardam and dragged back to the settlement

all right you little rascal you will hang around stealin boats and idlin your time away âwill you ill fix you to the chaingang with you

when tom brinleys mother heard of her childs arrest she tried in every way to reach the proper authorities in order to speak a word in behalf of her son the way seemed barred for she was told that what joe vardam had passed judgment upon could not be changed in her great grief she decided to leave santa maria and seek the north as she had now lost all hope she had saved a little money for toms schooling this she took after closing up her home in which she had spent so many happy days both with her husband and her boy âshe took the boat for new york where she hoped to get something to do to try to forget her great affliction tier friends sympathized with her and kept her in touch with all that was transpiring in santa maria

her kindly sympathetic face won for her a good home with the de forest family who had advertised for a good laundress

one day miss de forest had a young peoples party and among the invited guests were the little grants running around as children will eileen roamed into the kitchen where she came across mandy brinley who was sobbing soon the child had assembled all the other little ones at the door to watch the sobbing woman

at the grants suppertable that night the children told of the colored womans crying in miss de forests kitchen at which grace expressed great sympathy

aunt grace said margaret grant her son was stolen in the south by a cruel man and put on the chaingang

that is very sad answered grace suppose jack were to be taken from us suddenly without warning and we were never to see him again

oh that would be awful chimed little eileen is some one going to steal our jack ill shoot them said the little fellow by way of defending himself

days and weeks passed and still grace received no reply to the letter she had sent she could not determine what she was to do next in the meantime she still worked at her art expending her greatest efforts in the painting of a likeness of tom brinley as nearly as was possible a painting that she named purpose

a member of the f n p federation for negro protectionâa group of influential whites and blacks formed for the protection of the rights of the black man in the north and the south seeing the picture asked that it be loaned for an exhibition that they were about to give grace gladly consented to this and the picture was placed in the gallery of fine arts

nanna the old cook at the de forests house by way of making it pleasant for mandy brinley asked her to attend the exhibit with her this nanna was a woman who stood for the highest aims of the blacksâwith which race she was identified often she would say im a cook an im not ashamed of my daily occupation for a good cook must take pride in her work yet i would not see all my people laboring in this held they must scatter themselves in all avenues of work in order to become a wellrounded welldeveloped people i am always anxious to know what all my people are doing 

hence her interest in the exhibit which marked an anniversary of progress for her people

the great armory where the exhibition was held was crowdedâthe f n p having also invited a number of speakers both white and black to talk in behalf of the negro the absorbing themes were the negro in office the negro in politics and the negro in the army

how mandy brinley wished for her tom and in walking about after the great addresses she as if her prayer was answered came face to face with a painted reproduction of her tom

o my jesus she cried nanna heres my boyâheres my tom

go on mandy youve got your boy on your mind so you imagine everything is him

grace ennery and fred trower were also present they almost passed tom brinleys mother as she turned from the picture in great grief grace in her absorption in other exhibits did not see mandy but fred trower saw her and he remarked to himself that the wonderful eyes of the lad must have made her sad

fauna and mandy returned quietly homeâ mandy laden with sorrow grace and fred after the interesting meeting sauntered leisurely home they talked of the speakers especially the negro speakers who knew what their people needed

i am sure tom brinley would do equally as well as any of those speakers were he given the opportunity to develop himself said grace it is so strange that i never received any reply to my first letter to his motherâ and my second was returned to me

fred replied  grace i am afraid you are taking matters too seriously sometimes those whom we would wish to be worthy are altogether unworthy 

not so with tom he has a strong will and i am quite sure that he although young has determined to develop in the direction of his natural taste and aptitude

now grace i begin to think that you never intend to devote any of your time to me since i have returned home you have had this and that to interfere with our pleasant little chatsâsuch as we use to have

forgive me fred if i have appeared selfish since you have returned it is not selfishness it is really that my life is broader unexpected problems have come before me and i am anxious to grapple with them

whether grace knew it or not fred trover was in love with her and had been so even before she went abroad to study art whenever the desire urged him to say something of his tenderness to her her mind seemed always centered on something else which made any declaration of love at that time quite inopportune

when they had reached home fred asked grace to give him an evening and to promise him for once not to speak of any of her pet hobbies but to give up tile entire time to him

it is a small favor fred answered grace you may have your wish of course

all right i shall see you tomorrow evening and if mrs grant has company be prepared for a walk as these evenings are very enticing in the open

very well goodnight said grace as she endeavored to disengage her arm

instead of freeing the arm immediately however fred trower pressed it gently and looked into her large blue eyes which with upturned gaze met his the look was like the meeting of two soulsâeach read the heart of the other quickly grace as if she had committed a misdeed went into the vestibule remaining there until the maid admitted her the maid noticed a flushed look upon graces face as she thanked the girl and ran swiftly to her own apartment

fred trower stood for a moment as if glued to the spot then collecting himself he turned and hastened away

grace when she reached her luxuriously appointed apartmentâconsisting of bedroom private sittingroom and bathâyielded to an irresistible impulse to run to the baywindow of her sittingroom which permitted her to see a distance up the street there she sat hat and coat on watching pass on under the bright electric lights the manly erect form of the man about whom was now the glamour of a young girls love when he had passed out of sight she slowly disrobed and went to bedâ thinking of many things that before this night had never seriously entered her mind tonight tom brinley had no place in her young mind hers was a dream of love with fred trower crowned king

the next day seemed to two persons the longest day upon the calendar and when the sun was slowly sinking in the west two hearts were beating with gladness

grace was ready long before the maid announced mr trower fred was prepared long before he came his father noticed the new light in freds eye as he closed the lid of his desk and hurried off calling hack  goodnight dad

his fathers look followed him to the door and he questioned something on tonight fred

but his son was gone

when the maid did announce the presence of fred trower in the parlors below the fact had already been known to grace some time she was seated behind her curtain on her windowseat waitingâin accordance with the demands of societyâto be told what she already knew

softly she stole downstairsâso much more softly than was her customâand with an air of coquettishness sat opposite her lover no word had yet been broken when fred full of ardor and not knowing how to free his pentup feeling rose and bent over her saying grace you know it all do you not need i tell you how tenderly i love you you do care for me some do you not

grace held her head back and looking into freds eyes replied softly yes fred i think i do

then his head bent lower and their lips met after which fred sat beside grace her hand in his and their heads together fred told her of his great love for her how he hoped that it would be reciprocated he also told her of his splendid prospects and asked if she would consent to become his wife

grace answered  not yet fred i must do something of worth before i accept the very tender care that i know you are capable of giving me let me devote more time to my art before anything definite is decided

why grace you have done something what more commendation can you wish than has been given to your picturesâlove and purpose

but that is just a beginning fred then there is tom brinley must i leave him should i not try to find him and help him

then may i hope that you may tell me something definite as to our final plans when this little colored boy is found as to your art grace you can do even better work after you marry a woman is better able to express herself whatever her sphere in life after she marries because her life includes a broader scope about the lad  my father wants me to look into some cotton interests in the south soon and i can extend my trip visit the institute and inquire about the boy

dear fred you are so considerate and i am so thankful that you will do this i have a peculiar feeling concerning this boy some inner prompting that urges me on

well dont worry any more grace everything will come out satisfactorily so you have really decided to educate this colored lad yes fred my desire is to give him an opportunity to serve his people

i trust that ho will prove himself worthy of your interest

i am sure he will by the way fred i received a letter from my father who is in egypt now he spoke very highly of you and much of his friendship with your father he says that his stay will be an extended one as the egyptian climate agrees with him better than any other that he has been in he speaks in glowing terms of the scenery of the nile and has been captivated by the grandeur of egypts monuments he has seen the pyramids the memnonion colossi the temple of the kings at luxor and the vast hypostile hall at karnak he also writes that my uncle has joined him having attended to his business affairs in europe how glad i shall be when he returns 

when i write and tell him of our plans i shall insist upon his returning for our wedding which i trust will be in the near future

they finished the evening with happy talk on topics that would naturally be of interest to engaged couples

fred trower was overjoyed the fact that grace ennery had truly agreed to share her future with him made him show his delight without any reserve he was a handsome fellow of about twentyeightânearly seven years graces seniorâyet there was something quite boyish in his air tonight grace thought as she looked at him admiringly his complexion was so clear his soft brown eyes so full of sympathy eyes and hair were so exactly of the same shade that one wondered how nature could match in humanity her colors so harmoniously

any one gazing at the man at grace ennery s sideâwith his hair slightly ruffled looking admiringly into the girls faceâwould at once recognize and be amused at the boyishness portrayed in his manner and would consider him not so bad for an only child humored and petted as only children usually are

time flew by so rapidly that it quite surprised the young lovers when they heard the hall clock strike eleven

when frederick trower rose to go he looked so pleadingly at grace that she could not resist going over to him and throwing her golden head upon his breast and permitting him to caress it with all the fondness that his manly nature could display then he left her with her promise that a date of marriage would be set as soon as tom brinleys future bad been arranged for

a few weeks later fred brower left for the south

after reaching richmond and arranging business matters in accordance with his fathers suggestions fred took the train for further south

the south was not new to him he had been there a number of times as his father had various financial interests in different sections of the country yet he had never been there bent on the mission he had now undertakenâthe search of a poor little brown lad

all along the road he studied the people âespecially at the depots which seemed a veritable  hangout

i wonder thought he if these people will ever carve out their own destiny judging from these laggards who seem utterly dependent one would say not

these were merely passing thoughts and fred did not allow them to worry him seriously he felt that grace had enough philanthropy for them both

after an extremely hot and dusty trip he reached santa maria he took a carriage and having reached the hotel went directly to his apartments as he felt very dusty and tired

in the morning which was an extremely warm one he awoke early after breakfast he walked around town and was attracted by the beauty of the place roses were in bloom and nature had everywhere a glad smiling look

quite an inquisitive gaze was bestowed upon fred when he asked at the hotel what is the best time to visit the vance institute 

the clerk quickly replied we dont know much about them niggers they stay over on that side and we stay on this nobody much bothers about them they tell me that the school is going to the dogs you came down to look em over i suppose

yes said fred not wishing to prolong the conversation with this somewhat contrary individual

he passed out of the hotel door and went down the steps walking off somewhat slowly down the street he had not gone very far when a somewhat repulsive looking man tall middleaged and carelessly attired overtook him

lookin us folks behind the sun over i suppose he ventured

well somewhat replied fred you have a pretty nice town here

yes but things have gone somewhat to the dogs on account of these lazy darkies down this way cant make em work unless you beat em theres that fine school that fool vance put up for em an they dont even have enough attendin to keep the doors open

are you acquainted around these parts asked fredâfor he thought that he might get the information he desired from this man

yes i know everybody in and aroun santa mariaâwhite an black

then you probably know something of a tom brinley

that little black thief an idler of course i do what do you want with him

i am trying to find him for a friend of mine

well you wont come across him round these parts he was sent to the chaingang in the backwoods for idlin and stealin

fred did not seem as shocked as one might think at hearing this for all along the road lie had seen the negros idleness and since theft follows such a weakness it seemed just natural

what did your friend wish with this little black devil asked vardam for it was he

she thought that she saw some good traits in him and wished to develop them

what nigger has any but bad traits a woman too good lord my good man keep her away from niggers or she and you will regret it some day 

fred never found the institute in fact he had no desire to hunt for it after talking with this man he lit a cigar and puffing it complacently slowly returned to his hotel

on the veranda he stopped to watch the southern sunset slowly and slowly old sol sank to the western horizon and when almost all had disappeared the rest dropped suddenly out of sight as fred trower witnessed this sudden dropping he thought of how graces fond hopes had vanished like a dream

he said to himself its all tomfoolery her coming down here and getting interested in a trifling black lad who was not worth a rap anyhow i have done my part i wish grace would not get so wrapped up in these goodfornothing people

after staying around another day fred started for home he ran into a college chum who was traveling in the interest of an agricultural society and he persuaded fred to attend this farmers conference with him

jerry dill did not mention the fact that this conference concerned the blacks as well as the whites for if he did i do not think fred trower would have troubled to go

he was not a narrow manâhe tried to view a subject from all sides before arriving at a conclusion yet be failed to see anything other than absurdity in his errand to santa maria when his friend jerry dill found that fred had some time to spare he persuaded him to attend the farmers conferenceânot that fred trower was one bit interested in farms or farmers nor did he have any special desire to hang around the south but the air was somewhat balmy and his love for nature met its response in everything in bloom so fred told jerry that if it were not for the tugging at his heartstrings that drew him home he would like to remain in the sunny south for an indefinite time

the friends alighted at a little town about seventy miles from richmond called hollis and found a pleasant little boardingplace after jerry had made all necessary arrangements for the following day he and fred roamed around the village for a little fresh air

as they wandered off the main road they came to a settlement of cabins behind which were richly cultivated tracts of land at the doors of the cabins groups of blacks were congregated

this settlement said jerry is one of the most progressive in the south the negroes are very energetic and this section produces larger crops for its size than any other known settlement

how do you account for this unusual progress here asked fred

well i suppose the main thing is that these people get better treatmentâthat is there are fairer laws and a better spirit on the part of the authorities here than elsewhere its only a matter of human treatment after all fredâ the better you treat a horse the more he will love you and the more devotedly he will serve you

even with what jerry had said fred was still reticent in talking of his prime mission in the south he did not state his own opinions but simply allowed jerry to air his ideas and now and then he would inject a question or two of his own

who attends these conferences and what good is derived from them asked fred

jerry replied well as i said a mutual feeling exists between the races down here on matters of mutual concern all attend the conferences and one gleans information from the others experiences that is why this agricultural society sent me down here they selected this place because they feel that where race hatred is least bitter more good will be developed as you know hatred be it of races or individuals retards progress this is why i feel that the south is behind the northâbecause it spends a good bit of its time and valuable energy trying to crush the blacks politically and otherwise

fred still did not comment but listened attentively soon the two retraced their steps and until a late hour sat upon the boardinghouse veranda and smoked jerry dreaming of the excellent reports he would be able to take back to the agricultural society and fred dreaming of grace the girl of his heart and of her disappointment when she should hear the bad news of her wouldbe protege tom brinley

after the two amid circles of smoke had dreamed to their hearts content they went contentedly to bed

the next morning when fred trower awoke he wondered what impressions he would gain before the day was over his disappointment had been so great that he had not written to grace since his arrival in santa maria rising late he missed jerry who had left a note stating that he would be found at town hall where the conference would be held fred ate his breakfast leisurely then wrote a note to grace stating that he would tell her everything as soon as he should reach home which would be in a few days and that at this writing he was attending with a college chum a farmers conference at the place mentioned after mailing his letter he walked leisurely toward the town hall

as fred approached the hall he saw the most interesting sight he ever witnessed in his life every kind of vehicle that could be mentioned stood outside the place and upon looking in different directions he still saw more coming someâthe better situated financiallyâcame in autos and others came on horseback occasionally the father mother and child were carried on one poor horse then others came in wagons in shays on mules and in oxcarts

the colored women were dressed in every bright color one could think of some wore hats with style and without style red bandannas seemed to have the day among them the styles effected by the men were various vests were in as many colors as were the womens dresses and prince alberts were almost in as great evidence among the men as red bandannas were among the women fred did not know whether he was attending a farmers conference or a baptist convention

when he entered the hall he saw a goodly number both white and colored seated many seemed to be conferring one with the other and to his surprise the atmosphere was most genial jerry dill had seen his friend enter and take his place amid the crowd of farmers and knowing that fred would enjoy the sight better from the platform he sent down for him

some style said fred to jerry as he was escorted to a seat

yes old pal but just you wait and see what they know just listen and hear what dame nature has taught them what they know from that sincere teacher would surprise some of our fair lads and lassies in high school

the meeting was called to order by the moderator as fred looked around him he was surprised to see the class of men that had come to listen to the farming experiences of these illiterate country folk

the meeting lagged somewhat at first as one would naturally expect the innocent country folk had to be aroused just as the little seeds and plants need to be drawn out of the earth by the sun

at length one large colored woman arose and told how she was supporting her five children by growing cotton

 tis de swelles cotton dat grows anywheres aroun    she cried enthusiastically

she told of how the land had been at first a hollow pond of how her boys had filled it in and fertilized it and of her great success

black speakers and white were interspersed but fred found the negroes far more interesting because of their ingenious ways of doing things

he listened with enthusiasm to a colored farmer whose clothes were less gaudy than any of the rest the moderator introduced him as the richest negro for one hundred miles around

the speaker arose and in an unassuming manner spoke of his rise from poverty he told of his fathers and mothers being slaves and of his being taken away from them when he was quite young and of their being sold and going away and of his never seeing them again he told of how he would watch the soil and study the growth of things and of his great success in raising cotton and how today he shipped more cotton of the finer grade than any other farmer in the south

fred whispered to jerry its wonderful jerry i must admit

another burly black man told of the planting of the legumes and of the plowing of the roots under the soil enriching it with nitrogen which produced the element necessary for the growth of a number of plants and vegetables that he called by name he also spoke of the rotation of the crops thus preventing taking from the soil the same mineral matter year after year he said that planting different crops every year kept the soil rich for the next crop

after a few more talks all present filed out to the grounds for dinner

a picnic in the biggest sense thought fred

jerry took fred around among the farmers showing him the cooked materials all of which had been raised by them

fred remarked afterward to his northern friends everything looked too good to be true as for fried chickenâmany of the colored farmers wives had it over the french chefs of the waldorfastoria

the next morning fred thanked his friend jerry and left hollis for the north feeling that his trip south had not been such a failure after all

tom brinley grieved to his soul lay upon a lay bed in a brokendown little hutâa figure to move any one to pity chained to him was an old manâuncle abbottâseventy years of ago whom the cruel overseer always used to break in young prisoners uncle abbott took mightily to the boy and urged him not to show much strength as it would go bard with him thus tom reserved his energy as directed by lis adviser and well it was that he did for he was to stand in great need of it later on

vardam and tilton were in league with other political leaders to keep down those negroes who manifested any degree of independence these they branded as dangerous characters it was their usual plan to trump up some charge of misdemeanor and then send them to the chaingang in order to keep the others in the community in submission

tilton incarcerated uncle abbott because he pastored a set of his people who were always in fear of their employers uncle abbott taught them never to stand in fear of any one but god these people were so ignorant that they continued to serve their old master in the same capacity as they had in slavery not really knowing that they had ever been freed this knowledge was kept from them by their white employers and it was agreed among these employers to keep them ever thus tilton was a political demagogue in these quarters and pronounced judgment against any one that tried to enlighten the people otherwise

thus uncle abbott posed as merely the preacher for these people but secretly he had a knowledge of their ignorance and with an assumption of shrewdness effected to teach them humility when not spied upon however he told them of their freedomâof lincoln and the emancipation teaching them too their rights the effect was soon seen a number of the blacks left holding for other climes

when tilton heard of this he questioned uncle abbott who replied yes i told my people of their freedom and now my work is done you may do whatever you wish with me it was my mission and now it has been fulfilled

to the chaingang with you cried tilton lynching is too good i must put you where you can be tortured and tormentedâyou deceiving boast

thus uncle abbott was sent to the chaingang and had been there two years when tom brinley came two favors he asked of his incarceratorsâto be able to take his worn and torn bible and a little grip that held a few pieces of worn clothing his wish was granted

when uncle abbott went to holding to preach he had taken with him money which was hidden between the worn covers of his bible for he did not know when he might be forced to leave thus he could depend upon this money which he had saved to get away with should the opportunity be offered to him when he found that he did not have the chance to escape as he had anticipated he resignedly faced the situation he had almost forgotten that he had this money when tom came upon the scene

after he had heard toms sad story from the boys own lips and had discerned his aptitude and indomitable spiritâwhich would mean much to his peopleâhe determined to help the lad make his escape

uncle abbott was not a man of much learning but he was possessed of tact and a native shrewdness which mastered any emergency he truly would have made a leader had he been given the chance in tom he saw true worth and appreciated it and all his mental energy was spent in planning for this hoy an escape from a life of torture

here is worth he would say to himself as he would watch the boy asleep it must not let its lifeblood he sapped in these backwoods my people are crying for men and more men i have had my dayâi have done my masters bidding but tom the power of god is greater than the devil i shall pray for your freedom and it will surely come

in his satchel he had a little toolkit which no one knew ho had there no one ever watched him as he had never attempted to make his escape or the escape of any one else before even though he had brought his tools for this purpose he had heard of this place and knew that many an innocent man had perished in these chains and in his profound grief he did not forget that he might have a chance to be of serviceâeven in the chaingang

uncle abbott awoke tom one night and told him what he intended doing tom pleaded with the old man not to jeopardize his own life by trying to assist him uncle abbott told him not to fear that he knew the road well and that he felt that divine guidance would clear the way of any obstacles that might arise as their hut was located right on the road of escape he told tom to follow the road until he came to toddsville where he knew a good christian family that would shield him from harm

go to them he said and tell them that i sent you and they will drive you over to cherry where you can board a train for maryland after reaching there buy some decent clothes and go directly to new yorkâwhere you can pass under another nameâand seek work 

tom listened attentively to uncle abbott  he know that the guards were situated at the other end of the cabins for they did not consider it necessary to be very watchful of uncle abbott as he never attempted to escape and even if tom did they knew he could not get very far with uncle abbott chained to him no one ever suspected that the old man had in his possession means by which he could undo his chains if he so desired

in the moonlight uncle abbott released toms chains and put into the lads pocket all the dry bread he could gather after he had given him the money from between the covers of the bible and had wished him godspeed he bade him to go quickly and quietly this was too much for tom he appreciated his friends great kindness but he felt that to take the money which uncle abbott might some day need would be an imposition he told the old man that he would rather take his chance at finding something to do and working his way on to new york than to take that which he might some day need

but the old man replied no i will not consider you out of danger until you have crossed the mason and dixon line prejudice today my boy is very rank down here and if you are caught anywhere in the south i know that they will place you where there will never be any hope so take this money and travel as fast as you can to your destination you will for quite some time be only a few hours in advance of your pursuers who will be on your heels as soon as they have discovered that you have escaped take these tools and bury them somewhere along the road be off my boy be off

tom bade the old man goodby saying i shall never forget you as long as i shall live uncle abbott and if i should get safely to the north without interference i will work hard to acquire the power to some day destroy this place that keeps in chains such good people as you

then tom went out stealthily into the night in the direction that uncle abbott pointed out when he had gone some distance from the cabin he heard steps and to his dismay came face to face with one of the guards as quick as a flash he saw his fate

to hesitate means death thought he so before the guard had really recognized him tom made a dive similar to a flying tackle in football and threw him the lad seemed for the moment to be endowed with supernatural strength before the guard could rise or get him fully in his grasp tom dealt him a blow across the head with the tool he had not yet disposed of and fled

after that unexpected encounter tom in his excitement was on the alert every moment but he met no one else he reached toddsville bedraggled and dusty about nine o clock the following morning seeing some men on their way to the fields be asked them to direct him to uncle abbotts friends this they did without questioning the poor boy who presented a veritable picture of distress

when tom found the people and had told them his sad story and the story of uncle abbott their grief knew no bounds

tom had just finished his tale of woe when the folks were startled by loud voices outside their suspicion was immediately aroused so they hid tom in a load of hay then aunt fanny and uncle joe went on with their work planning that as soon as they had got rid of these trailers they would get tom to cherry as quickly as possible

sure enough the voices belonged to those that were hunting for tom they yelled to aunt fanny asking her if she had seen a little nigger come along that way

yes returned aunt fanny a long time ago an he look so queer i knowed he wus up tu mischief he asked me where rootville was an i showed him an off he trotted

now rootville was in the opposite direction to cherry and after looking through her cabin the men hurried in the direction aunt fanny had indicated when the trailers were out of sight she put tom on horseback and directed him to cherry where her sister lived

when tom reached cherry he was nearly exhausted his story touched fannys sister and after seeing to it that he ate a good meal she bade him rest until the last train left there for maryland the boys clothes by this time were in a wretched condition and as she had boys of about toms age she managed to find some presentable clothing for him to travel further in he left cherry on the last train which reached washington about noon the following day where he planned to make his final dash to the north

everything went on well for tom until he reached washington he was just about to alight when he espied one of his pursuers standing not many yards away whether he was still looking for him or whether he was traveling on his own accord tom did not know he evidently seemed to be watching for some one when tom spied him he had presence of mind to hide himself under a seat and when every one had left the train he made his exit in another direction

tom remained in washington several days desiring to make this place his destination but there was some unknown impulse that urged him on to the metropolis

while in washington he saw many things of interest to him it was a wonderful city the streets so beautifully planned and the innumerable public buildings impressed him greatly

at midnight a few evenings afterwards tom brinley was well on his way to new york arriving there he was directed by a porter to a good stopping place he dreaded telling his secret as he had been warned that as he traveled farther north he would not find his own people as loyal to him as the simple southern folks were in their sympathetic hearts so he kept his secret in his breast and assumed the name of frank hope frank was his benefactors christian name and hope was his own fancyâfor he hoped for better things in the future as he pursued his eventful career

tom brinley soon found work and also time to devote to his studies ho never permitted an opportunity for mental improvement to slip by to his notice soon came hoopers institute with its advantages for the pursuance of studies in the evenings after working hours this suited tom admirably and he could be found at his desk at the institute in the evening while during the day he worked

he attracted much attention both at work and at the institute yet in his great desire to learn he did not consider that he because of his application to duty was being admired by those that came in touch with him

at this time a young colored woman attracted his attention tom was now in his seventeenth year unassuming and manly he impressed this modest young colored girl who like himself was taking advantage of an opportunity that the north offered

one evening as they passed out together mary abbottâthat was her nameâsaid i have been so interested in this article about this tom brinley whom they are seeking that i want you to read it

tom took the paper calmly and read this headline  one thousand dollars reward for the return of a black boy who is an escaped convict

and then the text went on to give his description as to color height looks and so on

whether mary was suspicious or not tom did not know she told him that the paper had been sent to her from the south by friends who sympathized with the boy because they knew that he was innocent they had also told her that in that section if any colored person chanced to attract attention by being ambitious he would be put out of the way by political renegades

much to his dismay tom found that he was not even safe in new york what should lib do what resort had he upon handing the paper back to mary he made no comment upon it other than that the victim must either be dangerous or valuable

tom found himself occasionally at the side of this finelooking young girl he often saw a resemblance to his benefactor uncle abbott and when she told him of a dear uncle who was imprisoned by the same wicked people that hunted the boy he longed to tell her his secret and how his present opportunity was due to the bigheartedness of this grand old man

not yet he thought i must first know how much she cares for me before i do this i wish i could tell her of my feeling for her  but i cannot without telling my secret so i must keep this too within my breast

one day while delivering packages for the bracy firm for which he worked tom came near running into the arms of joe vardam he had one package marked mrs silas grant east st street after the maid had taken the package and he was turning to go he saw joe vardam enter the house the politician did not recognize the lad in uniform and ever afterward tom kept scarce in joe vardams terminology in that vicinity

in the meantime tom and mary often met and in time they came to know each other well mary discovered admirable traits in tom and tom discerned excellent qualities in mary aside from going back to and from school tom rarely went out for he did not know when he might run into joe yardam

tom was always neatly attired and presented a pleasing appearance wherever he delivered goods for his firm the people were always satisfied with his service some commented upon this and many an extra dollar he had at the end of the month he had rented a small room in order to save his money

to mary abbott lie spoke but slightly of his past however great was his yearning to do so oftimes he felt that he could trust her with his secret

upon fred trowers return to the north he told grace that he had met a man who informed him that tom brinley had been sent to the chaingang because he was a thief an idler and a dangerous character but since his description of the man tallied with the appearance of joe vardam grace would not believe the charges against tom she said little to fred about the matter however

joe vardam had visited the grants in the course of his search for tom this grace did not know until after a planned absence arranged for the purpose of avoiding this man after she returned however she learned that he was in search of tom brinley then as if in a vision she remembered about the woman crying for her lost sonâthe black woman of whom the little grant children had spoken

over to the de forests she went and after speaking to fanny about the matter she saw mandy brinley and talked with her after this talk grace was more than ever convinced of toms innocence for between fanny and grace the conclusion had been established that joe vardam was a scheming rascal so the grants were kept in ignorance of the whereabouts of toms mother after this visit grace called frequently to see fanny and the friendship between the two grew strong and deep

time went on and with it tom had changed âhaving grown taller and stouter now he had a certain assurance that he could get by better than at first he was preparing to graduate from hoopers institute in his twentieth year and because of his brilliancy and oratorical ability he was given the valedictory which he felt even now unsafe to accept so because he begged to be excused it passed on to the next

meanwhile he had kept up his friendship with mary abbott and though his tender feeling toward her was manifest he did not dare to speak to her of his love

mary is so hard to read he would say to himself she always seems so sympathetic in her manner which somewhat puzzles me she looks at me so tenderly when she asks me questions regarding my past and which i try so hard to evade answering it has been a great task for me to avoid telling her all in the few years in which i have known her she has been my only comfort through these long and dreary months

mary abbott was preparing to be a domestic science teacher she worked as maid in a private family during the day and at night attended bloopers institute having come from the south where the advantage for such a training was small her fondest hope was to go back as a teacher with this added northern training which was so much the envy of the ambitious southern girl tom knew that she would be leaving him the following fall and then he would be left absolutely alone what would he her do without congenial association how he longed to keep her with him if he only dared teli her his secret and have her help him to find way out of the awful dread that occasionally overwhelmed him

after you have gone from me mary and have taken all that is sweet out of my life if i could only find my dear mother to whom i might go for solace  i wonder if she still lives and yearns for her boy   mother what cruel fate has severed usâwho have lived so happily together  

one evening at a church social mary met her aunt whom she had not seen since she left the south it was nanna the cook who worked for the de forest family once when mary was visiting her she told her aunt of the fine young man whom she had met at the institute and how much he reminded her of mandy the laundress

the eyes are so much alike mary would say

nanna told her that mandy was in great distress as they were seeking the lad who had escaped from the chaingang and she knew that if they caught him they would lynch him

i do feel so sorry for both said mary for i know they both suffer it is so sad that those wicked people in the south are not brought to justice

some day them white trash down there will get all they are lookin for bless the lord returned nanna

it was then that mary began to suspect that frank hope was really tom brinleyâmandys son and she resolved that at the first opportunity she would reveal her suspicions to tom

one day tom felt that he must give vent to the pentup feelings that were getting the better of him he felt that he must tell some one in his association at the institute he came in touch with a number of catholics ofttimes he heard them speak of confession then too he remembered that one of the boys had committed a theft in a thoughtless moment and when he thought over what he had done it worried him so much that he confessed to his priest whose influence went far towards making his punishment a slight one then too he was rid of the dreadful remorse that attends a hidden crime

tom thought over all this very seriously and determined to go to a priest and tell him his sad story

i must unbosom my secret self he would often say to himself for i cannot stand this torture much longer

mary abbott noticed that tom was greatly worriedâthat recently he even evaded her presence

if i could only help him i would be so happy i am almost sure that he is mandys boy i must tell him that i know it and that i want to help him his mother would mean so much to him if i could only bring them together without even nanna knowing it how i want to help him  can he not see that i care enough for him not to expose him she reasoned

that mary might not consider him rude in his great distress tom dropped her these lines  dear mary such a spell of melancholy has come over me because of a great sorrow in my life that i would not care to burden you with it when i feel brighter i shall see you

yours etc frank hope

two weeks passed during which time tom was making up his mind just what course to take to relieve himself of his great burden he determined that he would see father wesser to whom he had been referred by a catholic friend as he was walking toward the parish he came face to face with mary abbott who not having completed her course of studies was on her way to the institute

why mary remarked tom somewhat surprised where are you bound for

i am on my way to school replied the girl and you are out for an evenings walk i suppose

not exactly answered tom with a faraway look in his eyes

well i hope in your melancholia youre not planning to jump into the bay

i have had a great sorrow mary which has made me feel quite blue at times and i was on my way to father wesser to confide my troubles in him

confide in me frank i believe that i know your trouble i have recently surmised it do you remember long ago when i handed you that paper that was sent me from the south well from your actions then from the description and also from what i have recently heard i think that you are tom brinley

o maryâdont

you will not deny that you are tom brinleyâwill you

suppose i do say that i am tom brinley what would you do 

what should i do other than sympathize with youâas i have been doing for the past three years now i have a great surprise for youâone that i wish you to hear of 

tom looked anxiously into marys face

mary continued it is your mother that i desire to tell you of she is laundress in the family with my aunt nanna whom i have only recently found now your life i have heard of as she told nanna and naima in turn told me you must be very cautious for the people your mother works for the de forests are great friends of the people whom joe vardam stopped with when he was up here searching for you

toms eagerness to see his dear mother knew no bounds he wanted to go directly to her no matter what might accrue to him from it but at the look on marys beautiful face when he expressed his rash desire he yielded to the appeal of her worried countenance and said resignedly  all right mary i shall let you arrange a meeting with your own tactfulness only let me see my mother as soon as you can

mary wondered just how things could be arranged as toms mother seldom went out and then only when her aunt nanna urged her to do so

despite marys record for punctuality at the institute tonight she felt that she could not leave tom nor did he persuade her to leave himâthough he knew that she disliked to miss her classesâas he felt that he needed her just then so much so on they walked and talked hardly noticing where they were going

when the young people reached sixtyninth street they were startled by an alarm of fire mary and tom quickened their steps and hastened to the sceneâin seventyfirst street

volumes of smoke seemed to be pouring forth from the upper windows of a house a man rushed in and a woman met him at the head of the stairs pointing above where they both hastened soon he was seen with a child in his arms he rested her on the step and went up again bringing down this time a young girl neighbors took charge of these no sooner had the same man gone up again than flames were seen bursting from the windows the firemen had not yet arrived and tom forgetting for the moment mary at his side ran into the house and up the stairs he saw that the man was trying to manage a halfdazed boy and a young woman who was partly overcome by the smoke tom seeing that the man was tottering under the double load seized the woman and brought her down the staircase as ho reached the door a neighbor called to him to bring her into the house where the two girls were being cared for

as soon as tom reached the air with the woman she opened her eyes and looking into the face of her rescuer cried why tomâis this tom brinley

hie recognized the woman as one whom he had seen in his santa maria homeâgrace ennery

yes maam he replied but dont expose me please

by this time fred trower had reached graces side with jack grant whom grace had insisted upon freds rescuing with the rest of the children before she permitted him to pay any attention to her

fred she whispered this is the boy whom i sent you in search of he is the one who prevented us from being overcome by the smoke

tom put his finger to his lip in order to quiet her fearing exposure

give your address to mr trower and we shall arrange to talk with you tom do not fear anything as we shall nowâsince you have so bravely rescued usâguard you with our lives

goodby whispered tom as he handed his address to mr trower and hurried out not wishing to excite attention to his amazement he found that as he pushed his way out of the neighbors house he was confronted by policemen and reporters in the street there was much excitement for by this time the engines had arrived and great crowds had congregated as tom appeared upon the street he was greeted with bravo bravo from the crowd some came up to him and asked his name but tom being entirely unprepared for this notoriety brushed quickly by the people refusing to comment upon what he had done

give ye name ye fool cried a tough ye might git somethin out er it

dont want anything answered tom

then tell us where you live interrupted a policeman

dont want to muttered tom and pushing by them he ran up the street

queer guy remarked some one in the crowd

tom ran home alone in his excitement leaving mary waiting for him somewhere in the crowd

after the fire had subsided and the grant children and grace ennery were permitted to return home accompanied by fred trower they were temporarily provided for in the lower part of the house the fire caused by the shortcircuiting of the electric wires affected the upper part of the house only and that part by smoke and water rather than by flames

when mr and mrs grant returned home from a social function greatly frightenedâ as they had been sent forâthe children told them excitedly how a colored man had come to the rescue when mr trower had been almost overcome

 who was he and what was his name inquired mr and mrs grant in a breath

he wouldnt tell us his name did he tell you aunt grace i saw him talking to you and mr trower said jack with much concern

grace remained quiet but fred trower broke in  he did but in our excitement we forgot it

i thought that i saw him write something down margaret put in

if he did i dont really recall it was freds reply

this conversation was interrupted by the maid who came in to ask for help in removing some beds to the library both mr grant and fred went out to assist her after everything had been arranged fred left promising to see grace on the morrow

going directly to the club fred remained there talking of the fire and other things until quite a late hour when he returned home while undressing for bed he thought of the exciting events of the evening and of the bravery of tom brinley

brave chap   said fred aloud as was his custom in the quiet of his apartment i wonder if such a fellow could be a dangerous character nevertheless ill size him up tomorrow and will let grace know what i think of him let me see where he lives

fred arose took up his vest and to his great dismay found that the paper was not where he was sure he had placed it he looked in the other pockets of the clothes that he wore  still he could not find it his first impulse of course was to call up grace and ask her if she had found the slip of paper that tom brinley had given her

immediately he went to the phone and called up the grant house of course at this hour of the night mr grant was the one to answer the call as all the servants were asleep in another part of the house a night call always annoyed silas grant as he never cared to be aroused from his sleep and when both he and his wife were wakened by the ring just outside their door he remarked who the devil is calling up at this hour of the nightâafter all the excitement too

i cant imagine replied his wife probably some one who has just heard of the fire and is calling up to see if we are all right get up silas and see who it is

mr grant arose reluctantly and after inquiring who it was and finding out that it was fred trower said what in the thunder do you want to wake us up at this hour of the night for

awful sorry to bother you grant but i must speak to miss ennery upon a matter of very great importance

very great importance hey and cant wait until a decent hour to talk to her snarled silas grant and as he walked through the hall to miss ennerys door he muttered waivin up everybody for a little nonsense grace awoke when mr grant called to her and impatiently slipping on her boudoir slippers and gown went to the phone

fred why could you not wait mr grant docs not like this intrusion on his sleep sorry grace but i could not wait until morning to tell you that i lost the paper with toms address on it did you find it after i left you

o fred how careless of you  what will you do something must be done immediately what can i do i dont know where to find him i didnt notice what was on the card

o fred this is dreadful ill look around and call you up if i find it if you dont hear from me come up to the house before you go to your office and we can determine upon some step to take under these unfortunate circumstances goodby for the present

grace depressed went on a search for the paper which would however mean much if found before it fell into anothers hand joe vardam had made the name of tom brinley well known in the grant home as he had stayed with them when he was searching for tom as has been said when grace heard of his coming she purposelyâwithout letting the grants into the secretâmade a visit to a school chum to avoid identification

and now the only thing to do was to find the card for should any of the grants get hold of the paper it would surely mean a return to the chaingang for the boy

poor grace searched everywhere for the missing slip of paper but it failed to materialize she refrained from inquiring whether or not it had been seen as she knew that she would surely incur suspicion tired and fagged out from the hunt she returned to her room a most unhappy woman

fred called early the next day and they talked seriously of some possible way to save the boy they could arrive at nothing definite and fred left as quietly as he had entered promising to think things over and return in the evening

in the mornings papers much space was devoted to the fire in the grant household and there was also a statement to this effect  a colored youth whose name could not be ascertained saved miss ennery the artist whom reports state will soon marry banker trowers son fred trower and jack grant were also saved from being overcome fred trowcr knew at his last going up into the burning apartment that he would have to bring both miss ennery and little jack down for he was afraid that to leave cither would mean sure death to that one when the colored youth rushed up he found that trowers load was too much for him so relieving him of miss ennery he enabled trower to rescue the boy which was all that he could well do in his overcome condition detectives are hunting for the youth whom the grants feel should be rewarded

grace came down to her breakfast with a careworn look mrs grant insisted that the girl remain in bed and a physician be summoned  but grace said she was not ill

what is the matter with you then inquired mrs grant you look positively wretched you must have attention

i thank you mrs grant but i must be out today it is important that i should go

o grace you must not go out  you have had a dreadful shock and it is telling upon you let me do your errand

i it is so dear of you mrs grant but i shall go to bed when i return

o dad cried jack running into the diningroom all excited his face very red i have found the escaped criminal in my bed

every one was startled and stopped eating to look at jack but before any one had a chance to question him he read aloud tom brinley no  ââ street

the shock was great for grace for she had not looked for the exposure in this way nevertheless she had presence of mind not to say anything as jack handed the slip of paper to his father

how the devil did this get here   he asked in a perplexed manner

oh cried margaret that looks like the slip of paper the colored man handed to mr trowerâdoesnt it aunt grace

does it i was so full of excitement that i did not take notice of what he gave mr trower 

then excusing herself grace hurried to her room put on her coat and hat and went out immediately at the nearest telephone station she called up fred trower arranging for him to meet her immediately this fred did in a remarkably short time and away they went to find the address that grace bore in mind for jack had read it in a very audible manner

they found the place but the youth was not at home gaining the desired information as to his place of employment and finding out his assumed name they called for him at the bracy establishment

when tom heard the news that he was wanted he thought that his hour had come and as he went into the presence of fred and grace he prepared himself for the inevitable

they took tom aside and told him what had happened

you must leave immediately as you are in danger for these grants are friends of vardams remarked grace excitedly

as if he had been struck with a bolt tom recalled the fact that he had delivered a package at this very house and had come almost face to face with the man who had done him so much wrong

grace looked up into her lovers face saying suppose fred we send him out of the country what boats are going out this morning

let me seeâthe lusanne sails at twelve oclock today bo you think he can make it

why not interposed grace tom ask the manager to let yon off at our request and we shall see that you get there in time

tom obediently did as he was bid yet in his heart at that moment he was prepared to face the worst

he was relieved from duty without any trouble and giving him money to get suitable clothing for the trip grace and fred left him to meet him again at the lus mines dock

as they had a little time grace bought for the boy a number of things that she felt he would enjoy having and yet knew he would not get she had warned him not to return to his stopping place since she did not know what course mr grant would take

grace and fred were anxiously waiting at the dock when tom reached there and having him register as lester trower the name of freds dead brother they supplied him with funds to give him a start at oxford where grace wished him to continue his studies

remaining until they saw the boat fairly under way and with the feeling of security that came of seeing the deep lying between tom and his enemies grace and fred left the wharf a happy pair

now grace said fred let us arrange for a quiet wedding in a few days since your father has given his consent and tells us not to wait for him as his stay is still indefinite for a time we can rent an apartment its easy enough to make a change when we have found a suitable location i have a notion that vardam will be up here in a few days and i want you to be out of his way today is wednesday let us be married saturday in the little church around the corner

all right fred perhaps it is the proper thing now and the coming true of my wish has made me so happy yet we never have what we really want after all in this life things happen so differently from what we desire i wanted to talk with tom about his trouble i firmly believe he met with foul play some one wished to do him harm

yes grace i too believe in the lad now since i have seen him and know of his unselfishness he seems utterly incapable of wrongdoing his eyes are so wonderfully sympathetic poor boy if ho is truly innocentâas i believe him to beâhis persecutors should be brought to justice

fred you had better leave me now and return to the office while i go home and rest you need rest surely for you look so careworn go home and do not worry any more but get yourself together for the event of our livesâour wedding

grace smiled complacently as they parted fred going to the office and she home to restâ both pleased with the fact that they were able to beat whomever would be first on the boys trail

at the dinnertable grace learned that detectives had already been on the boys track and that a telegram had been sent to vardam to acquaint him of the fact

i cant see for the life of me remarked mr grant at the dinnertable how that paper could have gotten into my house unless it was brought in i shant rest until i find out the truth

in the meantime fred had arranged for a saturday morning wedding a dear little apartment overlooking the park was the selected spotâfor a while at least

freds father and mother were pleased with the match for they both knew and respected banker ennerys daughter they had met grace and liked her and were very proud of the fact that fred was attracted toward such a fine girl

after dinner grace found mrs grant in her apartment and told her that she and fred had decided to be married very quietly the following saturday and that she wanted to have her and mr grant present with the children she also said that fanny de forest would be at the ceremony

i am glad you are going to marry grace she replied but i hope you wont go to work and settle down and never amount to anything socially why even your father went out more frequently than you do

that will depend entirely upon fred mrs grant if he cares for society of course i will adapt myself to his inclinations along this line 

oh he used to go out a good bit grace but since he has been so wrapped up in you he has not been seen anywhere but at the club

well i suppose that this and other things will adjust themselves nevertheless what we do socially and otherwise i hope will be for the best

saturday morning then grace my dear remarked mrs grant as grace arose to go

when grace rang the de forest bell that very afternoon she was pleased to have the door opened by mandy brinley in handing her card to mandy grace said softly come to this place alone tonightâi must see you regarding tom

mandy bowed understandingly and hastened to call miss de forest who soon put in her appearance bedecked like the queen of sheba

ah she cried in her usual spirited manner what wind blew you my way today you naughty kid

im marrying on saturday morning fanny in the little church around the corner and i want you present as a witness

sure thing kid and i wish you piles of luck youre getting the real stuff grace lots of girls have been crazy over himâgot the dough you know that is his dad has and he the only child hes some catch i tell you why didnt you have a decent wedding whats it so quick for did the fire drive you to it no not exactly drawled grace and in a way it did then since we were really going to cross the rubicon and neither of us cared about a large wedding we thought we might as well cross now as at any time

well perhaps youre right after all grace whats in a wedding its the living afterwards that counts in the long run by the way theyve found mandys poor son havent they

grace reddening a bit replied  yes

mrs grant said that they found his card after the lire and some think he was the lad who rescued you

that may be so said grace

if you could hear his poor mother talk you would think he was an angel instead of the devil vardam pictures him to be well i dont know its all very mysteriousâthat he should be so good and at the same time so bad

grace went after fanny had lavished all sorts of good wishes upon her

fanny de forest was a typical society girl yet she had a sympathy which grace thought appealing and even though fanny loved to go into society at every chance she sought grace and took great delight in her company and in her art she had a freedom of speech that was attractive in her though at times she gave it rein until it trampled over the proprieties despite this she never because of her intuitive sympathy gave offense her wholesomeness combined with this sympathy had won graces friendship

saturday morning arrived and upon this eventful day the grant household was in great excitement the children did not feel very happy over losing their aunt grace yet they enjoyed the privilege of attending a wedding

aunt grace why cant mr trower come here to live well have room for him after the carpenters get through mending where the fire burned lisped little eileen of whom the household always stood in fear for no one knew just how frankly she would express her views

i shall ask him eileen grace answered trying hard to keep back a smile which was forcing its way to the front while little eileen ignorant of the amusement she was causing continued if he doesnt want to go upstairs with sally and ann he can have my bed and i will come in with you

you are very very generous my dear and your arrangements will be looked into grace replied while taking her into her arms and fondling her closely

the day was a wonderfully pretty one in april the sun shone as perfectly and the air was as balmy as a day in june and every one seemed in good spirits grace was attired in a simple but handsome traveling suit of pearl gray business was very pressing and freds father did not wish him to leave for any lengthy absence just then so the bridal pair had planned a short honeymoon trip to atlantic city

mr grant returned to the house at eleventhirty with his chauffeur and all were ready to be taken over to the church

when the party had reached the church and were about to alight they noticed some sort of excitement which seemed unaccountable

as soon as they had alighted and entered upon the scene mr grant found that the detectives whom he had engaged to hunt tom brinley had traced fred trower as an accomplice to his flight and a warrant had been issued for his arrest

everything was in confusion freds father was distracted mr grant nonplussed

the detectives then told how fred and a lady answering the description of miss ennery had gone to tom brinleys place of abode the morning that the card was found in the grant home the detectives had also found out that the boy had been posing under the name of frank hope and that he had been in the community several years he had worked for the bracy firm and since he had been north had entered and graduated from hoopers institute they also discovered that the morning he disappeared a man and woman answering to the description of fred trower and miss ennery had been with him the three had been traced to the wharf of the lusanne upon which boat they learned the boy had taken passage under the name of lester trower

grace ennery and fred trower stood speechless during this rehearsal both failed to show any emotion while mrs trower sobbed and mrs grant between outbursts stated how terrible it was to bring upon them such disgrace because of a worthless nigger

why dont you talk fred inquired his father

i will dad when the time comes come on in and let the ceremony go on

a sadder group never entered a church for a wedding mr grant remained with the detectives while the others went forward where the few witnesses sat

after the ceremony the grant children and mrs grant left immediately for their home while mr grant the two detectives grace her husband and mr and mrs trower were driven over to the station where freds father arranged matters so that he and his bride could have an unmolested honeymoon

fanny de forest dismissed her own chaffeur at mrs grants request and rode in the car with her and the children so that they might have an opportunity to talk over the event that had just transpired

well even if fred and grace did spirit the boy away i dont believe that he was the devil old vardam said he was fanny replied after a short silence having learned the facts of the case then she went on did they admit doing what they were charged with

no not one word did either of them utter regarding the affair returned mrs grant fred trower said that he would talk when the time came i dont understand it one bit fanny

do you think since they cannot get the boy that they will ever take fred into custody asked fanny with a serious look

never jail fred trower for a nigger the only inconvenience he would experience would be a longdrawnout trial perhaps as it would be interstate and about all they could do would be to fine fred for interference with the law

poor fredâi believe he is doing it all for her  she is so unprejudiced in her feelings so loyal she has a strong flow of antislavery blood running through her her mothers ancestors i have been told came over in the mayflower remarked fanny seriously to which mrs grant hastily replied  yes but her father and his people were southern slaveholders well at any rate it is very mysterious how they knew him and how the fatal card was brought into my house

by this time fannys home was reached and she alighted promising to see mrs grant and the children soon

the children not having understood all that had transpired sat as quiet as mice all the way until fanny alighted when little kllecn called to her does the colored woman still cry for her boy who was stolen from her aunt fanny this fanny pretended not to hear as she had never mentioned to mrs grant that her laundress was the mother of tom brinley mandy brinley as fanny knew was so afraid of vardam that she wanted him never to know what became of her thus she defended mandys whereabouts not only from vardam but also from his friends the grants

when fanny reached home she was very happy to find mandy and tell her that her son had escaped to england she could not account for the fact that mandy was not as overjoyed as she expected she would be

aint you glad mandy asked fanny

 deed i is deed i is replied the poor woman trying to assume an air of surprise but the truth was that she met grace by appointment the very night grace called at fannys bomb and had exchanged confidences both regarding the boy and the crookedness of the politics of santa maria which would take advantage of a lad so ambitious as was tom

in spite of the cloud that hung over the heads of grace and fred they spent a delightful honeymoon by the sea toms name was rarely mentioned for new scenes and new conditions had brought about new thoughts

while they were away freds mother superintended the arrangement of their apartment graces furniture and effects which were brought from her rooms at the grants home were artistically arranged the evening they were expected home being chilly and stormy mrs trower had a cheerful fire made in the grate and both she and her husband eagerly awaited the arrival of their children

supper was waiting when the honeymooners arrived and they with the older folks enjoyed it immensely every sad thought seemed far away until freds father aroused him to serious thought by asking him how he came to entangle himself with the colored runaway

then he and grace together told the story of tom brinley

this joe vardam is expected on to the trial which takes place next week freds father informed them

father i could bring back this lad and turn him over into the hands of these scoundrels but i wont why his landlady hoopers institute and the bracy firm belie every statement to the effect that he is a dangerous character 

the trial was set for the monday morning after grace and fred returned home but owing to the fact that vardam could not be present it was postponed

he cant find any witnesses i suppose fred remarked to grace the next evening as they sat at dinner in their apartment

during the interim fred gathered all his witnesses who included all whom the lad had come in touch with since his escape to the north

fred was impressed with the fact that they were all eager to appear in behalf of his protãgã

at length vardam and his witnesses came north and the day of the trial was set for  oclock of the morning after their arrival

mr grant with vardam tilton and their lawyer were in court and seated long before the appointed time

fred with grace and their lawyer made their appearance their witnesses included all with whom tom had been associated since his coming north also his mother the courtroom was packed with society folk as well as with those who did not mingle with the upper strata the unique feature of this case was that wealthy society leaders were defending a negro runaway at a time when prejudice was so violent

the judge took his place on the bench and called for order in the court

he read in measured tones the charge against fred trower who was accused of the abduction of a criminal for whom extradition papers had been made out and of placing him under an assumed name out of the reach of the law

then fred was asked to take the stand he did so testifying as to the grant fire and his meeting tom there for the first time he gave a graphic account of the boys rescue of miss ennery and jack grant at a time when he fred was almost exhausted and he told how the coming of this black lad on the scene had prevented all three from being overcome by the smoke

this news was a shock to mr grant as he did not for a moment think that tom brinley was the rescuer of whom he had heard so much yet he recovered his poise

after fred had finished grace was called to the stand she told of her meeting the lad for the first time in santa mariaâan innocent boy with a desire to be something in the world she told of the childs love for his leader who had died and of the great prejudice she saw existing between the races she even went so far as to tell of her conversation with the pursuer of the lad and of what tom had told her of vardam the lawyer on the other side tried to rule out this testimony but her lawyer showed that it was in order

then toms landlady was called and she spoke of the lads fine qualities and business integrity the bracy firm in turn told of the excellent service tom had given them and how much they appreciated it

the last witness in toms behalf was his mother she spoke in somewhat broken southern style but with earnestness so sincere that it impressed all present to such a degree that one could hear a pin drop during her testimony

mandy told of toms visit to the leaders grave which was constantly kept fresh with flowers she said that he went over and found the flowers withered the day she last saw him as he was going he said ma im goin over to git flowers for de leaders grave out of the fields of san joan she stated that after that she saw him no more

tilton and vardam were very restless in their scats as they listened to the words that their opponents were uttering in behalf of a member of a race that they hated with all their hearts

vardam was then called upon and he arose to his feet clearing his throat he told of every conceivable guilt he could name that the blacks were associated with he spoke of black mens assaulting white women of the negros neglect idleness and laziness of their feigning good behavior when the northern whites were around and of the latters interference with the southern laws making the negro contemptuous and hard to manage by his southern employers

may i ask interrupted the judge what this tom brinley was sent to the chaingang for

vardam cleared his throat and replied he was surly rude idle and a dangerous character

did i not hear that he stole

oh yes vardam quickly responded what did he steal

a number of things

name some of them

i object interposed vardams lawyer

if i can have one concrete example to place him in the criminal class i can see where frederick trower and his wife protected a criminal but up to this point i cannot see where he has been a dangerous character in the community

well i tell you they are all dangerousâ every confounded one of them

that is sufficient said the judge

then tilton was called to the witness chair

what do you know of tom brinley  asked the judge

everything bad answered tilton rather glumly

what connection did he have with you

he worked for me

at this remark mandy brinley sobbed aloud for she knew that tom had never laid eyes upon this man that stood there lying

what work did he do

worked in my ricefields and while there he created disturbances among the other workers

then remarked the judge do i understand that you sent him for no particular offense to the chaingang where after being driven and lashed and starved he loosens his chains steals tools from the drunken guard beats him into unconsciousness and escapes that is what any of us would have done under the circumstances

at this moment the courtroom door opened and tom brinley walked slowly down the aisle those who knew him could not have been more startled toms mother screamed out and joe vardam turned as white as a ghost as tom stood there facing the judge

your honor said he i tom brinley have come back to defend myself

vardam regaining command of himself caught tom by the arm and cried you are my prisoner

order in the courtroom cried the judge release that boy he is yours only if he is proven guilty then turning to the boy he asked what have you to say boy

the unexpected arrival of the youthâregarding whom so many conflicting reports had been heardâwas dramatic he descended upon the court like a bolt from the blue every eye was riveted upon him his face and bearing were closely scrutinized his manner of speaking his every gesture was eagerly watched

and what did the audience in the courtroom see a manly youth of twenty whose very appearance belied the accusations of vardam and tilton they saw a browncolored boy with a broad brow that was crowned with curly black hair  with large glowing brown eyes that could flash with indignation or melt with tenderness with a nose slightly roman in character a jaw and chin broad and square lips firmly compressed and a face round and full but the determination that was expressed in that firm mouth and square jaw and chin were relieved from harshness by the twinkle in his eye and those slightly curved lips could break into a beautiful smile not exactly a handsome face yet it was a decidedly noble one suffering and sorrow showed there but it was suffering and sorrow that had been conquered and mastered that was expressed in that countenance

and the form they saw was in keeping with the head and face a form slightly above the medium height erect broadshouldered and deepchested with that ease of movement that betokens great strength and agility

it was easily seen that tom had made a favorable impression upon his audience before he began to speak in calm measured tones with a wellmodulated voice

amid breathless silence tom began his story

he told a most touching tale of his life with his mother at santa maria stating that he did all that he could to help her he told the court how vardam laid in wait for him as was his habit with other ambitious individuals of his race he told a pitiful tale of the chaingang having sufficient presence of mind not to mention uncle abbott yet he did say that he found others there as innocent of crime as he was he said in reference to the overseer whom he incapacitated that he had hoped in his escape to meet no obstacle and that when he did meet such in the form of the overseer that to deal this blow was his only salvation his only gateway to liberty

in finishing his story tom said that he had an opportunity in his trip to europe to escape but when the disabled lusanne stopped off nova scotia for repairsâshe having been hurt by stormâon going ashore he had learned from a new york paper that his benefactors were in trouble because of him then he felt that he must return to exonerate these good friends from any blame

the verdict was written on the faces of the jury as they filed out while awaiting their return tom sat facing the court he was not conscious of the opinions the people were forming of him  but sat there stoically calm and selfpossessed

every one in the courtroom could not escape some feeling of relief when after a great suspense the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty

for a second everything was silent and then excitement reigned it seemed that every one sympathized with grace and her husband and the lad who had so nobly defended himself

toms mother could not release the hoy from her embrace for her joy at seeing him and knowing that he had his liberty was almost too much for her all she could utter in her great emotion was my tomâmas own tom  

vardam and tilton were absolutely without sympathizers for every word from toms mouth had touched the hearts in the court as he defended his actions with so much depth of feeling and even though he was a colored boy trying to prove his innocence one was moved as he gazed into his deepset eyes for in their depths his very soul revealed itself

all said something encouraging to him and in his simple unassuming way he passed out by the side of his mother

once outside grace urged tom to go on his trip as soon as his mother felt that she could spare him this he promised to do freed now he was able to do those things that had been impossible to him before because of his fear of detection

what enjoyment tom took in being able to look the world squarely in the face the feeling of independence that possessed him could not be expressed in words

mr silas grant forsook his southern friends for one could see that apart from the conventional courtesies that he was bound to extend to them he was eager to be freed of their society

silas grant made it his business to see tom in a few days and offer to share a portion of his educational expenses and even after tom told him that mr and mrs trower had amply provided for him he still proffered his services upon his insistence tom asked him if he would devote that portion to the comfort of his mother mr grant said that he was willing to do so because he felt he must do something for a ladâeven though he was blackâwho had been so brave in rescuing one of his children at the time of the fire

tom found some time to spend with the companion of his dark days mary abbott he told her muchâconsidering the short time he hadâ of his feeling for her and of his desire to make her his wife when he made good he also told her of her uncle abbott his benefactor and how he wished that it wore in his power to do something for him

having attended to all the necessary thingsâ among them the adopting of his right name in every instance where the name of frank hope had been usedâin two weeks time in company with his mother and mary abbott tom stood on the same wharf again starting after bidding them fond goodbys to carve a destiny for himself in another land

the steamer excelsior after an uneventful trip landed in liverpool about a week after tom had embarked when he reached london he could hardly discern his hand before his face

this is one of those dense fogs of which london is famous he said your welcome is not an enthusiastic one but old london i have faith in you and in your people and in your laws

london was a wonderful city to tomâso different from the great metropolis that he had just left the streets so narrow the crowds so dense and everywhere peopleâgreat hordes of people

the wars killing off of millions docs not seem to have produced a scarcity here at least remarked tom to himself

everywhere england the motherland was in gala attire because of her great victory even though the war had been over some little time the gaycolored buntings gave evidence of the recent triumphant end of the fight

this condition of things surprised tom for he expected to see nearly every one in mourning because of the great numbers he had read of who had been slain in battleâwho surely thought tom must have had association with every other person alive

tom in his inexperience did not realize that this is but the condition that succeeds any great calamity so quickly are the horrors forgotten that one often wonders with alarm at the indifference to the taking of human life

tom was greatly impressed with the treatment he received in this great city deference and respect lined his pathway nowhere was he made to feel that he was different from any one else as he wrote to mary abbott i feel so different here there is no prejudice anywhere my color appears to be only an accident as docs the color of ones hair or eyes i may exaggerate conditions mary but it seems as if the english people are extremely courteous because i am coloredâtheir desire seeming to be to make me disregard the fact that i am different from other people i feel that i should like to remain here and never come back to my country where i am spurned and treated as though i were responsible for that for which god alone is accountable

tom established himself with a very pleasant english family all the members of which were extremely kind to him  and after a few days he gained admittance to the great english university oxford

he was delighted with this old english institution from which had sprung some of the greatest scholars the world has ever known every instructor was keen earnest and sincere every student had an equal chance the great war affected this institution very little for within its walls all races and nations were represented as time went on tom met many interesting charactersâamong them some africans who were enrolled there there was one siamiâa brilliant negro black as the ace of spades but as rich as croesus his father was king of a tribe in his native land and the vast territory upon which he lived was rich in gold mines of him tom wrote home  he mingles with royalty and has advantages over the white man without a title for he is admitted into inner royal circles and upon festive occasions he takes precedence of those who are below a king in rank

toms letters were always interesting and mrs trower mary abbott and his mother wore his constant correspondents as for grace trower she was enthusiastic over toms letters and the zeal with which the boy took up his work

westminster abbey wherein are buried all the english celebrities was the place in which tom loved to wander for hours he would sit and study this last restingplace of englands famed sons awed and impressed by its silent grandeur

mary abbott kept tom in touch with his countrys activities after he was away two years great excitement was being manifested over the countrys threatened war with japan then too the question that his people were pressing was the admittance of the negro into the state militia no cried many yes cried a few what are we exclaimed tom on reading of the issue that even to die for ones country is too great an honor

tom on account of his excellent record was admitted into some of the most exclusive societies of the university he was even privileged to attend social functions the social attitude of the english people puzzled him for he thought that socially his color would be a barrier as long as he lived so far as mingling with white man was concerned though enjoying every privilege tom never took advantage of this liberty given him and he seldom entered into the social life that he was so often urged to share

mrs trower did not stint tom at all in the matter of allowance she was eager for him to imbibe all he could from educational sources she encouraged him to visit historic places throughout europe although the war had left its mark of devastation to a greater or less degree on the different countries she felt nevertheless that he could picture in his imagination what it had been

it was interesting to tom to watch the women in the different avenues of work which before had been filled by men outside of england women predominated everywhere he went tom was forced to the conclusion that she could never be denied the ballot for which she had fought so arduously he found however upon investigation that in nearly every country that had participated in the war the women had been permitted to vote only england was still orthodox in this particular and her pankhursts were still knocking at the door of parliament and the house of commons but without success even though much progress had been made by the feminists

why is it asked tom of an english friend that the women are so persistent and rash in their demands for they still made raids upon assembled political bodies

felton the englishman to whom he had put the question answered  we english do not comply with the requests of our women without forethought we do not believe that it is good for women to have what we have decided is not good for them our attitude towards our women is the same as the southern attitude is towards your people we believe that women should always be subservient to men and to place the ballot in their hands would surely make them the equal of men and that we englishmen do not wish whereupon tom inquired how is it that the countries all about have granted her this privilege

so many would not have done so if it had not been for the war which taking so many of their men necessarily made the countries to a great degree dependent upon their women was the reply

tom had many leisure hours while in england and in them he often thought of his dear ones so far from him and of his beloved leaders grave his greatest sorrow was the fact that he never could feel safe to return to his own home town and visit this spot which he knew had been long neglected

how long he would ask in his sorrowful mood will vardam and tilton hold their cruel sway because of politics

not many days after one of his periods of thinking of santa maria he received a letter from mary who was then teaching in a southern school in it she sent a newspaper clipping which read as follows the vance institute has closed its doors so indifferent were its students to what the great john vance saw fit to leave for an unworthy people that it could not continue to open its doors to emptiness

in the letter mary stated that politics had grown so rotten in and around santa maria that the appropriation left in trust had been misused and that there were no funds left to keep this greatest of southern institutes open to the people that it was intended to help then she added if some one could have followed the leader who like him had the love of his people at heart things would not have taken the course that they did

following the leader breathed tom could i but do this mary it would be the realization of my dearest wish but i cannot follow the leader in santa maria if i follow him it must be elsewhere

time passed and tom made many good friends he applied himself arduously to his studies never feeling that he could spend any time for those things that did not tend to advance him along the road toward the responsibility that mrs trower had made his goal

mary still continued to keep tom in touch with american affairs her letters were a great source of delight to the student because they were so full of cheer and encouragement and there were times in toms life as well as in the life of other ambitious individuals when the worker needed a cheering word from home for they served as stimulants along lifes rugged paths

toms mother was still with the de forests who were extremely good to her often she wrote to tom that the grant children kept her cheerful and that mrs grant constantly looked after her wants grace trower always inquired after mandy when she went to see fanny who had become her very dear friend

grace kid  fanny would say in her usual buoyant manner you are the real dope i want you always to be where i can get to you easy if im in bad youll always fix me up you know what youre up to every time kid and thats more than a lot o them know

four years had passed since tom set sail for england and time had wrought many changes margaret grant was a young woman out of school and ready to be launched into the world of fashion by a societyloving mamma and to be kept upon this social sea by a rich papa jack whom tom brinley helped fred trower to rescue from the fire was off to yale shining as most jacks do in the athletic field eileen did not sing eeny meeny mincy mo now but had stolen over to fannys and hunted mandy to whom she had become much attached and the greatest of all changes was that silas grant had become a director of the negro protective federation

and in the trower household noteworthy changes had taken place too here you will find a baby girl of three prattling around in merriest glee she has made the trower happiness complete and grandpa ennery gets a generous portion of happiness under the spell of baby edythes winsome smiles and this little one knows tom brinley because of her mothers talks of him especially at this time when in her home much is being said concerning the advisibility of toms return

the trowers showed great interest in tom brinleys letters the unprejudiced condition abroad appealed to them particularly and for that reason they were convinced that tom having completed his oxford course could not do more wisely than cast his lot under englands skies

as for tom he was eager to return but he could not decide what to do

the north does not need me her colleges and universities are open to the negro but positions are closed to him therefore there is nothing for me to do there he thought

the negro protective federation had its quota of negro men employed he learned on inquiry yet the many advantages offered tom in england compensated in a measure for his disappointment they did not wholly satisfy him however he wanted to see his mother and mary whom he had not grown to care for one whit less

grace trower was eager to see what oxford had done for tom and hoped that he might venture to return and engage in active life in the south  but she became thoroughly convinced that such a move would be foolish on his part when a paper from santa maria was sent to mr grant and he in turn sent it over to her this paper stated that if tom brinley the negro exconvict ever planted foot upon land below the mason and dixon lineâwhile the present political party was in powerâhe would again be immediately seized and put into the chaingang where he and his whole race belonged

that is dreadful cried grace after she had read the extract to her husband

dweadful dweadful lisped little edythe who apparently took it all in

we had better send him this paper and advise him to remain on the other side until things look more favorable over here he no doubt will very easily find something to do

tom on receipt of the information decided that his lot must be cast in europe

when i get money enough i shall send for mary and marry her and we will spend the rest of our lives over here he mused

having developed into a powerfully built man by this time tom was devoted to athletics and because of his prowess had gained much honor at oxford

on the completion of his course at the university a position was offered him in the newspaper world the london timesâbeing a daily paper of large circulation paying its employees wellâgave tom an excellent field for his talents as well as affording him an opportunity to travel

france and germany it appears had never settled a disagreement over some african land and germany threatened to fight france in order to make her withdraw her claim to this territory at this time tom visited france in the interest of his paper and found that that country was calling for recruits so impressed was he with the attitude the frenchmen held towards the negro soldierâagainst whom no discrimination was shownâthat he decided to return to england resign from his paper temporarily and enter the french army tom had been drilled in military tactics at oxford and had hoped for a chance to serve his own country by entering the service at home if it were possible his visit to france opened his eyes to the fact that all men were equal in the french army and his joy at this discovery knew no bounds

so into the army he went  promotion quickly followed till at length as commander of a regiment he led a successful charge upon the enemy sweeping them from their position

this was a charge that had much to do with the settlement of the question at issue the territory became the property of the french

commander brinleys fame now resounded through france and england caught up the strainâfor was it not because of her training that tom had served so well medals of honor were bestowed upon the negro and he was lauded to an enviable degree

toms mother received from him a letter in which he told her that he would join the french army and fight since he could not fulfill his greatest desireâthe serving of his people in his native land but he added i am serving my people just the same mother by doing something that gives me an opportunity of acting a mans part

mrs trower did not think so kindly of toms adventure for she felt that if he were to die in battle every hope that she had fostered for him would be entirely destroyed when she read of his great achievements however her husband remarked  grace unless you should see the gratitude of france to her warriors you couldnt understand it the french worship their heroes as if they were gods

toms chance for making money both in england and france was now excellent he received many letters offering him such positions as would have flattered the vanity of many an ambitious youth this enbareas de choix was confusing tom was trying to decide just where he would settle and into just which of the open avenues he would turnâgoverning his choice always by what he considered would be most agreeable to mary whose prayers had followed him in and out of battleâwhen he wrote to her that as soon as he could settle upon one of the many advantageous offers held out to him she must cross the ocean and become his wife according to her promise

no sooner had he sent his letter off to america than he received a santa maria newspaper great democratic ring of santa maria broken âvardams and tiltons power killedârepublican rule the result of the recent electionâvardam and have been accused of graftâmisappropriation of much of the state s money

then too in the text occurred this passage after investigation it was found that through their dishonest maneuvering the vance instituteâthat heavilyendowed school for which there to follow that grand and noble leader and once more place upon a solid footing this institute the pride of the south

tom closed the paper laid it down and with his face buried in his palms he pondered at this moment there came a knock at the door he occupied a suite in one of the finest french hotels the garãon speaking in frenchâ which tom understood wellâtold him that he was wanted below rising he descended a magnificent stairway and entered a luxuriously appointed salon where a representative of the president of france awaited him toms visitor informed him that he was authorized to offer him an important consulate

when tom had expressed his appreciation of the conference of this great honor upon him âhe said quietly  duty calls me across the seas to my oppressed and forsaken people i must go and serve them i must spend my days in lifting them out of their igorance so that their condition may be altered i thank you for the great opportunity you have given me to prove my manhood to england i owe much because of the advantages she gave me of an education without restrictions i shall go to my people taking those european ideals which i trust shall ever be a part of me and my prayer to the almighty shall be for strength to bear uncomplainingly the scourge of prejudice which because of unfair laws has been allowed to run wild in ray own my native land

in a few days tom was en route to america

as he leaned over the rail to bid goodby to england and franceâsecure in the strength of the glories of centuriesâand afterwards turning his face toward his own land he said  i come back to you my country which i love and revere you have unjust laws  you are unfair to my people but i believe in your future i have faith in you though you mete out partial justice to me and mine and i shall believe in you as long as i hear christs name among you for through supreme love only may i and my people hope for a greater freedom 

toms coming was a surprise to all and the joy of the trowers especially grace could not be imagined they with the grants had hoped that he would find some worthy occupation in europe  but when they were told of what had occurred in santa maria and of how he was on his way to offer his services to the vance institute with the aim of devoting the rest of his life to the carrying out of the glorious work that the great leader had started they could not understand how he could turn his back upon a career rich in honors in order to serve a hopeless institution
