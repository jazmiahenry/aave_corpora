diane priestess of haiti durham john stephens 
minister kauffman had the earlyrising habit it is easily acquired in the tropics and hauffman had lived in the tropics half his life german trade had followed his long and arduous travels in africa and because of his success in learning the wants of the peoples who do not clothe themselves the emperors advisers had advanced him in rank and sent him to port au prince to combat the sale of american goods in the haãtien markets

he stood on the porch in the early dusk of the morning enveloped in a luxurious bathrobe he called loudly for coffee the scent of the roasting berry from the kitchen told him that the daily preparation of his morning refreshment was a trifle behindhand and the daily roasting was imperatively necessary for the comfortable beginning of his day he waited long enough to see a boy energetically begin the grinding in a rude mortar and then he entered the bath at the side of the house it was a great pool like a mammoth cheesebox and through it flowed continually a stream of clear water throwing off his robe and slippers he plunged in stuck out his head to breathe and to swear at the coldness of the water and dived deep to enjoy it the more he paddled around and splashed with all the abandon of a boy after a turn or two around the bath and a hearty rubdown he was soon again on his porch his black coffee and his big pipe before him the picture of european comfort and ease in an uncongenial latitude it was now quite daylight he drank in the wine of the air of a fine winter morning great curtains of gray hung along the mountains to the south while varying shades of green down the side of the slope and along the valley rested the eye with their crumpled velvety effects off to the east masses of mist like the smoke from the artillery of great armies made battle against the approaching sun a magnificent red ball irresistibly forcing his way to daily dominion this silent battle of the forces of day against the forces of night was accompanied by the sounds of mountain streams following their healthgiving mission down the valley through the filthy city into the sea

will the minister ride this morning

alcide had served the morning coffee and was apparently familiar with hauffmans habits he filled the big pipe as he spoke and placed the matches close at hand he was dressed in the blue denim of the working classes but there was a bit of selfconsciousness in his way of grooming himself the face of the youth was most pleasing in its affable composure and his entire makeup suggested vigor and intelligence the natural sweetness of his voice was made more agreeable by the liquid quality of the patois and by a manner which combined deference to his employer and a manly sense of comradeship

 yes said hauffman  but i am going to the city and it is not prudent that you go in that direction

 must i serve as a soldier asked alcide

 i fear that you must and alcide true to the stoicism of his people accepted the verdict without a sign of the deep disgust which surged through him but hauffman knew as alcide turned to go the minister detained him

 you may ride with me at eight if your work will permit he said  at that time i shall be able to speak definitely prepare your mind however to do your duty like a man and looking up he added smiling  here comes diane you will have entertainment until i return

up the walk from the road gate came the girl dressed in the loose gown of the country but as she approached she attracted attention as being out of the ordinary her superb height and statuesque figure were the more striking because of her simple covering her features were almost grecian in their outline and the thick fleece of hair was soft and tractable she was of a type rarely seen among the blacks the facial angle and delicate hands and feet being almost peculiar to a few families residing near aux cayes on the south side of the island she had the erect carriage of the people but she had not the jerking movement of the hips generally seen among women accustomed to carry burdens on their heads

 i came to see alcide she said after bidding them goodmorning she sat on the steps leading to the porch her chin resting on the palm of her hand her eyes fixed on the ground alcide left to look after the horse

how is pierre louis asked hauf tmnn for he knew everybody on the mountain side

 he was well yesterday

 isnt he at home 

 i dont know where he is

 and you slept alone at home 

 yes

 perhaps there is a dance 

 i dont know anything

and hauf tman not finding the conversation edifying disappeared to dress for the morning ride he returned to find diane in the same posture her knee supporting the elbow her chi in the palm of her hand alcide was coming up with the horse as the minister mounted she raised her head and askedâ  is papa pierre right when he says that alcide must be a soldier  i am not sure said hauffman with interest  when did he say so 

 i dont know

 how did he come to say so 

 i dont know

with an impatient word to his horse hauffman rattled down the lane and disappeared

 i came to talk with you she said simply

together they walked into the bathroomâproperly the enclosure for the place had no roof they sat on a wicker couch covered with a large bathtowel he looking at her expectantly and she contemplating a very black and shapely bare foot which obtruded from her single skirt he awaited her words very patiently after the habit of his people

 papa louis slept out of the house last night she said finally he remained silent

 i know that he had a dance somewhere

alcide waited

 he didnt say anything to me

alcide looked at the perfect foot with its strong instep and finely developed toes

 he said that you must be a soldier and when i said he must not let it be he became angry now he punishes me by going away without me he knows that i want to do the cures and be a mamaloi alcide frowned

 that meissner the white german and that tinceau the black minister have something to do with it but i dont like them i like you

he put his arm over her shoulder in a protecting sort of way but said nothing she began to cry

 papa pierre has taught me all the bells for the cures and all the steps for the dances i can do them better than he now he says that i must give them up or make you think as we do he says that you are not haãtien but foreign

 think as he does not haãtien but foreign alcides tone was from the heart contemptuous but he did not underestimate the influence of the priest

 that is what he says said diane in her simple and direct way  he says that you have power over me he thinks that you will take me away from the dances and the cures he did not take me yesterday yet i know that he had the cures all day and a dance last night there will be another tonight he wants to punish me and keep me away from you that is the reason too why he wants you to be a soldier minister hauffman knows something about it for he asked me questions just now and i lied

 you must not lie diane said alcide gravely

that is just it she said in reply when i am with you i want to be good and papa pierre does not want me to be good i dont want you to be a soldier i want to see you every day and hear you talk

 dont i preach too much  he asked smiling his assurance of her reply

 when you talk to me i go home and think and then i dont want so much to be a mamaloi and i dont want to do the cures and the bells and the dancesânot so much

 is that why you came so early this morning he asked

 yes papa pierre will be home soon he may have passed already he will scold me and say that he will not let me be a priestess and then i will think of you and it will not be so hard it is because i love you

she had never spoken so to him before his throbbing heart rose and struggled for utterance the words would not come

she was sobbing violently now but alcide only held her close and said nothing as she became calm he began speaking slowly ns if searching into himself for his deepest thoughts and feelings

 diane why is it such a hardship for you to give up this quackery  you know what a fraud it all is as children we began to learn it under papa pierres roof since i came to the minister i have learned better you too know what a fraud it is you have remained with papa pierre and your ambition to shine among the people makes you deaf to me if i must be a soldier i can do my duty it is a disgusting experience to anticipate but it is nothing what is everything to me is your own choice suppose you had to choose between obi and me

she flung her arms around his neck and tearfully stared him in the face he wound his powerful arms around her and drew her prostrate on the couch he kneeled beside her and looked deep into her eyes the great manfeeling held him the universal husbandlove possessed him he covered her forehead with kisses and she with open lips drank in the breath of his life  kiss me she murmured

gently he warned and advised her as she became more composed he told her of minister hauffmans family life he pointed out in the most intimate way his dreams of their own future life together dreams that had never before been told if they had ever taken conscious definite form

it was all so new to her this picture of herself at the head of a house of a home life illumined by the steady serene glow of a mutual habitual affection she looked through her tears deep into his earnest eyes the wonderment of a child in her gaze as her instinct read to her mind the marvel of the revelation

 it is very beautiful she murmured

 contrast it with the voudou deception and think how happy we shall be he urged with quiet intensity

 yes we shall be very happy she said looking out from within herself at the great life vision he had raised the curtain she had in her the woman to see and to feel its significance

gently he warned her of the priests hypnotic influence over her he advised her to be patient and discreet he led her to the gate at the road and returned to his work in his exaltation he had parted with her without even a touch of her hand

two men met in the early dawn of the morning on the edge of the champs dc mars at the gate of the avenue leading up to the hotel bellevue the great open space was deserted except that a few countrywomen their heads and shoulders burdened with vegetables were silently striding from the turgeau road across the park in the direction of the famous marketplace of port au prince

 i decided to start for the dance and to get through the city before daylight exclaimed one of the men impatiently  what detained you he spoke with a distinct german accent

 let us go to the hotel and put on nightclothes replied the other leading the way into the avenue  we must be careful about appearances now he continued in a satisfied tone  for all our plans are in motion

silently they entered the hotel past the sleeping watchmen in the barroom and they relaxed their caution only on entering a large room on the second floor

in a leisurely manner talking about the heat of the season the laziness of the servants and other subjects of universal but innocent concern they began to undress voices from other rooms and the noises of opening windows and doors below showed that they had had but little time to spare in entering the hotel unobserved when they went downstairs they met several men in pyjamas and slippers sitting at little tables on the balcony sipping their morning coffee

after the morning salutations they selected a little table apart at the end of the balcony and called for coffee

i am dying with impatience tinceau exclaimed the german  i would expect a haãtien to be more impulsive than a german but i seem to be the hotheaded one of this pair

 well meissner when you enter into a plot to make yourself president of haãti you will keep your head cool said tinceau meaningly  as we now stand we have slept here the devil of it all is that the presidents son looked in on us at our meeting in the woods

 tell me what you did said meissner his clear blond complexion reddened with excited interest and his fine blue eyes looking intently into the face of his companion

 dont appear so serious warned the haãtien  lounge back in your chair light a cigarette now smile thats better what would people say to see you talking seriously with the minister of war at this hour of the morning if we are laughing and chatting hereâ well you and i have had one of our late nights that laugh is all right and the war ministers comely black face was very bright and attractive as his teeth gleamed in response to meissners hearty burst of laughter

 now to my story said tinceau still smiling  first of all i know that hauffman the german minister and jules pirot the minister for foreign affairs had a long talk about the boy alcide yesterday

 yes and hauffman and pirot together can prevent us from getting that boy out of the way mused meissner

 not while i am minister of war exclaimed tinceau i dont meddle in foreign affairs and pirot shall not meddle in my department

 well you must get him out of the way papa pierre will have no influence over her so long as she sees alcide why the old man promised me the girl and i gave him his price but he keeps putting me off until after the boys conscription that is a virtual admission of alcides influence over diane

 papa pierre is very sensitive on that point replied tinceau smiling and he says that he will fulfil his promise if you will go to his house tonight after dinner he is having a great dance in the woods and it was that which detained me from meeting you in our room here last night as arranged he has announced the next great dance to take place near jacmel he promises me that as the president has been so fascinated by diane she will have no trouble in persuading the chief of state to follow her to that dance

 that is vital muttered meissner

 dont look so serious warned the war minister carelessly flipping the ashes from his cigarette  then after papa pierre had kept me waiting while he went through his antics as priest curing the faithful in the name of the voudou serpent and starting the dance we had the meeting with maillard and started him off to raise the insurrection

 so the ball is set rolling said meissner in a tone of relief

 yes every man has his part i will see to the revision of the constitution that your german capitalists may have their return for the money which you have spent maillard who is a priest of the itaner circle as well as a brave soldier will start the movement from port de paix where you have deposited the money for him and stored the arms he will arrive on the sixteenth in the mean time papa pierre will have brought diane and the president together and induced him to leave the capital for the jacmel meeting i have sent duport a trustworthy man to watch maillard and to come on ahead to report maillards movements for it is understood that the insurrection is to raise nobodys name as its candidate for president but is merely to declare its purpose to throw out the present government as he spoke he looked through the trees following a figure which was passing down the turgeau road it was the german minister and when tinceau saw that hauffman did not cross the champs de mars towards the legation but went straight on towards the national palace he became very pensive

now you are the serious one said meissner what is the matter 

hauffman just passed and he took the direction of the palace i think i will follow him

and as the two striking figures whose superb symmetry and power even the folds of the gaudy pyjamas could not conceal entered the hotel one man after another turned from his morning coffee to say a word of admiration to his neighbor

iii

after his unsatisfactory talk with diane the german minister rode slowly into town skirting the champs de mars towards the national palace he kept at prudent distance from the iron fence enclosing the grounds to avoid the challenge of sentinels stationed behind it every few feet apart reaching the main gate to the west he stopped to await the coming of the officers on guard he was immediately recognized the guard was turned out the gate thrown open and hauffman entered stopping for a moment for a word of salutation with the officers word had been sent ahead and he saw active preparations in the palace to receive him a highly adorned officer of the staff greeted him effusively of course the president would receive the minister and hauffman waiting to be announced smiled at three spitefullooking machine guns which pointed directly at him a score or more of slovenly soldiers stood at attention as he followed the officer up the winding staircase at each turn and corner sat a soldier on a threelegged stool hauffman remarked to himself that only one was asleep but a sharp kick on the shin from the officer leading the way awoke the poor wretch from his nap in time for hauffman to return the awkward salute

they had scarcely entered one of the private rooms on the second floor when the president walked in through another door his manner in greeting hauffman was as usual cordial but the foreigner detected something of reserve the face of the dreaded chief of state was comely and distinguished the fine sphere of a head was covered with closely cropped white wool and this with mustache and military imperial of the same whiteness contrasted strongly with the clear black skin the features were uncommonly regular for one of his race the eyes at once bespoke the character of the manâwide open alert the cornea as clear as that of a baby in backing himself out of the room the officer stumbled over a chair and the president expressed his displeasure by a glance of the eye that was like the crack of a whip hauffman knew the terrible man he had given the president asylum when the game of politics was against the now successful leader and when the lives of the defeated conspirators depended on the precarious protection of friends or the more secure sense of humanity of foreign diplomats he remarked that the president wore his house slippers and a long linen duster a friendly concession of informality from a rigorous observer of forms

general i have come to try to save my boy alcide said hnuffman  can i succeed pirot has spoken for me

 i cannot understand the interest which centres on that boy said the president reflectively  what is tinceaus interest

 i cannot find out replied hauffman

they talked twenty minutes hauffman pleaded he urged the character of the boy his training the danger of the associations alcide was fit to be an officer the president would promise only to do the best he could

the staffofficer returned with two glasses of champagne indicating that the time allowed by the president had expired

hauffman immediately arose the president bowed formally as his visitor bolted a swallow of wine and offered his hand in parting

 hauffman compare chita encore

there was something pleading in the old mans voice and a carião in the patois which the minister had not heard from his former protege in years

you have pleaded for the boy alcide most eloquently he continued in the language of the common people  but you have studiously omitted one appeal which would have been your first ten years ago you have not asked his release from service as a favor to yourself no dont interrupt me for months i have wanted to say this to you and i have not been able to bring myself to it until now we have drifted apart since i became president do you suppose i forget what i owe to you do my worst enemies call me an ingrate do i forget i was hunted for weeks in this capital that i lay in hiding fed through a hole in the floor can i forget your welcome when i reached your home in disguise why compere my bath that morning was the first in weeksâone of the delicious memories of my life do you forget our close companionship while i was an intruder in your house while you were arranging the amnesty

hauffmans face had a responsive expression but he was thinking behind the presidents mood he had never known the man to lie yet he had never seen him give way to gush still whatever the thoughts might be there was only one way to meet such a flow of sentiment he would have no reservation so he prepared himself as the president concluded  you may forget your humanity in the face of your own governments technical disapproval i cannot forget i will do the best i can for your boy i mean just that regardless of what seems to he the present policy of your government i will serve you personally i cannot forget i have no reserves from youâuntil recently i had none

why until recently what about my present policy hauffman spoke patois and with candor the president spoke rapidly as he concluded his talk almost hotly and hauffman caught his words on the wing and quickly flung them back in question form

 you know me continued the president disregarding the questions with a courteous gesture  i am a hard man my enemies say i am a cruel man i know my people and i can preserve public order am i a cunning a crafty man am i an intriguer do i not prefer a fight to a plot 

hauffman remained silent the two men closely regarded each other then the president leaned forward and askedâ  tell me how far your government is supporting the german syndicate 

hauffman threw back his head and laughed it was a laugh of relief he had feared some intrigue involving himself he explained that the syndicate was a combination of hamburg capitalists who had no political designs they merely wanted to acquire possession of lands for cultivation their ultimate object was to control commerce by exchanging their own haãtien products for imports from germany thus protecting themselves from fluctuations in exchange it had the legations most hearty support

 is that all you know about it  asked the president

hauffman said that there was no more to be known

 well i ought to have known that you would not mix in our politics i will tell you and i want your help the proposition made by the syndicate is not the mere possession of the lands but their ownership the constitution forbids alien ownership and i alone stand between them and the annulment of that clause of our fundamental law we are a nation of blacks we prefer our independence with all its present shortcomings to the bonds which white civilization under the present system of commercial exploitation would bring to us to attack that law i suspect it has been necessary to use large amounts of money that pirot and tinceau the most bitter political enemies should unite in urging the violation of this our dearest tradition confirms my suspicion as to the use of money by the syndicate the congress seems to have been convinced by them in some way the scheme centres on your boy alcide have you any idea how or why 

hauffman frankly said that he was puzzled no he hadno idea but the president could feel assured that while he stood ready to assist legitimate german enterprise the legation would not countenance such corruption as the president suspected

 then take my way to help me resumed the president  let your boy enter the army i must give these people more rope let them feel that they have influence with me and out of their confidence may come the exposing blunder i promise you to relieve the boy of service as soon as possible

hauffman agreed

i am glad that i spoke to you compare said the president smiling wearily  you always did ring true

 yes said hauffman heartily grasping his hand  count on me for anythingâexcept enjoying this hot sweet champagne at this hour of the morning

the diplomat had scarcely reached the post of the stairs when the minister of war was announced the president quickly put on a pair of dark smoked glasses they are watching hauffman he thought the german told me the simple truth he knew nothing about it

 the german minister was just here he says that the syndicate is composed of estimable men he said opening the talk

 so it appears replied tinceau  and strange to say the proposition grows in popular approval the people evidently want systematic work

the president drew him to a chair close to his own tinceau tried to study the face so close to him but the dark glasses hid the marvellous eyes nnd it seemed as though he were talking to a mask the use of those glasses was well known and the minister felt uncomfortable

 i want to talk to you my son said the president and taking off the glasses he looked his man straight in the eye

 nous sommes deux negres nest ce pas  he said putting a hand firmly on the knee of his listener  the freemasonry of race affinity and loyalty requires that you be perfectly open with me how comes it that you a national and pirot a liberal of liberals should be so united for this thing

tinceau did not like the appeal to color he knew and he knew the president knew that that demagogic appeal was for leaders to followers not for equals dealing frankly he resented it that the president should adopt it with him still the old man might be sincere as opposed to pirot

 surely president each of us is too patriotic to oppose a good measure merely because the other supports it he replied with dignity

then the chief of state tried another tack

 is it at all possible that pirot has been approached  the entire ambition of the man seems to be to get money

the minister became very grave he had remarked that weakness in pirot but such a subject could never be a matter of confidence between them all the world knew how bitterly he had denounced corruption in haãtien politics

 well said the president rising to end the interview  watch him and crush anything of that sort

 by the way president did the german minister make any plea for alcide and he turned back to say it as though it were an afterthought  i told him that i prefer to see your orders obeyed

and so the visitor withdrew the president walked to the side balcony and looked out upon his soldiers going through the morning work gazing wearily over the great square before his palace he wondered of all the officers lounging there how many really could be trusted

has diane gone asked hauffman as he returned from the palace

 yes said alcide his soul still in his eyes he mounted and they started off on their morning excursion

the minister told him that he must serve in the army and after a vigorous protest the boy forced himself to be resigned to the experience which he so detested

 you are a haãtien said hauffman firmly  at the moment of the general alarm your place is at the front to defend your national government

alcide grasped his patrons hand affectionately on their return as they parted at the gate of kauffmans residence the minister continued down the road for the work of the day at the legation the youth returned to the house and went about his morning duties as usual finishing these and taking leave of the family he walked firmly down to the public road and turned towards the city then he stopped and after some hesitation he walked rapidly up the road through the residence district of cultured haãtiens and fashionable foreigners passing the  source where a magnificent burst of water starts to join other streams from the mountain side he struck off into a section which appeared at first glance to be uninhabited now and then he passed a hut of a native and presently he stopped before one not differing from the others in material it was larger and was surrounded by a garden in which were cultivated herbs and weeds he stopped in the garden and called for diane she immediately came out to meet him she seemed much disturbed before he could tell her his errand she began almost hysterically  papa pierre has come he says that he does not want to speak with me go in he may talk with you

alcide entered and saluted the old man diane followed timidly and stood in the doorway it was a large cabin of two rooms mud walls with a roof of palmthatch dexterously woven the furniture was sparse but the old man had a modern bed whose appearance indicated that diane knew how to take care of it through the doorway it could be seen that her own room had been adorned with coquettish touch

that of pierre louis was evidently museum bedroom laboratory parlor and consultationroom all in one dried snakes were very much in evidence on the walls twisted into all sorts of shapes around large nails and staples into an effect that was absolutely artistic in its repulsiveness toads and lizards impaled helterskelter greeted the visitor from four sides with inquisitive smiles these it seemed were decorations but they were also calculated to have their effect upon the minds of votaries and clients nobody but a papaloi would sleep in the room with all these things crowding these decorations on the walls and hanging from the rafters were the vital organs of animals some in various stages of desiccation others undergoing decomposition no haãtiens of the country type could enter that room without a thrill of dread the impression which it all made on alcide was that the odor was decidedly objectionable

the priest was intently watching an iron pot the contents of which lie was stirring as it simmered over a little charcoal stove alcide stood watching him and the longer he stood the more indignant he grew the odors telling him of rotting tissues which were to be generated into deadly poisons for the convenience of highclass clients alcide stood there sullenly remembering many of the things which he had seen in this same room the cures the trade in poisons the impositions on the poor people when he and diane played there together little boy and girl it was the same bitter mood which had held him all the morning but the old priest was now the object of his resentment presently without changing his position without even raising his head the old man gruntedâ  i thought you would be in town with a gun in your hand by this time

 i came up to bid diane goodby said alcide quietly  i am going now to report

you are and the old man left his wizard caldron to look steadily at the young man

 you dont want to go he said sharply after a few seconds study of his face

 no was the simple reply

 you ought to be ashamed to say so the old mans voice became shrill with anger

 did you ever serve said alcide  you dont answer he continued  i know that you never did i know that you ran away into the mountains to dodge service and that troops were sent after yon you have no right to reproach me i have the same aversion to it under this government as you had under boyer yet i never thought of running away i remained at the ministers house hoping to get an honorable release failing in that i am now going to do my duty he spoke very quietly and there was a superior ring in his voice which the priest rarely heard when addressed by a haãtien he straightened up as the young man proceeded he paused as if restraining himself but he was studiously observing the impression on diane

your statement is not only false he began slowly furtively watching the girl  hut it is positively irreverent i possessed powers which were ordained for conservation for the good of the people when the troops came for me i did not ran away i retired i retired to the shrine of the allwise serpent and there i perfected myself in my arts i returned to the people invisible i knew the inner working of their hearts i controlled their thoughts by day and their dreams by night i then appeared to them in flesh and they worshipped me if they were sick i cured them if any desired to die i provided the means you you scoffer you have been rained by your love of the white man you are a black imitator of white men a dog if it served my purpose you would drop dead where you stand i spare you for more horrible things tonight i shall denounce you to the faithful as accursed by the spirit of obi living you shall suffer the tortures of hll and your death shall be by violence leave me and go to your death

he was now speaking rapidly with dramatic intensity his piercing eye fixed on the youth but he kept the girl clearly in view she was holding to the doorpost faint with the horror of the awful curse

alcides reply was a shrug of disgust he turned to bid diane goodby the girl had fallen to her knee at the side of the old mans bed her face buried in her hands

 dont speak to her shrieked the priest in a horrible tone  she is one of the faithful

alcide turned and walked slowly back to the path and down the mountain side

the old man made an impulsive spring to the girls side and drew her to her feet he held her head on his shoulder and called her endearing names in which the patois so abounds he caressed her tenderly and gradually she became composed

 you are well rid of him my pet of all gentle doves he said assuringly   but i dont want him to die like that she murmured tremblingly   he may not dear he may not if you prove faithful you will have power too but go to your bed and sleep take this yes that will make you sleep and it will refresh you and when you awaken bright and fresh with your devotion to ouanga as before we will talk about your baptism

she did sleep and the priest was prompt to take advantage of her waking impression

 ah your rest has done you good he said  you see i know my medicines you shall know too in time and be a great priestess among the people already they look up to you we are having a great meeting now and they miss you very much already they know you as one born with gifts tonight you shall have your baptism and the middle of next month when we meet in the south you shall make the cures for the first time it is all arranged the people will meet between here and jacmel you shall be my chief assistant

 but your chief assistant is maillard she protested showing a sudden interest in the programme

 maillard has gone on a long journey my dear he said  he will be exposed to many perils perils which will test his power over the people of late he has grown greatly in his estimation of his priestly powers his followers have even gone so far as to proclaim him my equal that will never do my dear maillard is a great fool my daughter a great fool he sets himself up as my rival and then trusts me i have advised him to raise the insurgent standard in his own name as a priest in order to hold his men together if they should mutiny that insurrection will fail my love and maillard will be either a fugitive from justice or a dead man you see i tell you my secrets it is due you under no circumstances must you reveal them to anybody you will be my first assistant my dear not maillard you shall make the cures and the people will worship you diane the priestess the beautiful mamaloi

she was under the spell her love of power held her and the old man knew that he was in control

go bathe and put on your best gown he said  this evening meissner will be here he is one of the faithful he is in love with you he is very necessary to our plans beautiful silver jewelry he will bring you i have seen it jewels for the wrist and the neck and the hair i want you to be ready to meet him

i dont want to meet him she said faintly he wants me to be bad

 there you go again there you go again repeated papa pierre patiently  you are thinking of the dog of a black german he has put those notions of goodness and badness into your head if you are to be a great priestess you must become one of us you must enter into our plans you and i will control great movements in the future it will be through meissner he may not succeed in his present projects but he will some day be a very rich man you will control him as you will your haãtien worshippers maillard must pass away soon for i will have no rival i must die some day you will be the power in all haãti you will have power with the people and you will have the power of wealth the beautiful mamaloi

the girl stood looking at nothing she was thinking back into the hauffman bathroom the old man became furious at her indecision

do as you please he cried turn from power and love and wealth to the black scoffer whom i have cursed turn your back on the road which i have spent years in opening up for you you shall see your alcide wither as withers a man of ninety years whom they set out in the sun that he may be warmed into life you shall see him in pain longing for death which i shall hold at arms length from him you shall see

 stop stop she moaned pressing her hands to her ears to shut out the awful prophecy she saw vividly again alcides picture of their future it was very beautiful she shuddered at the thought of the priests curse the old man was watching every change in her face he broke the silence again to appeal to her vanity and ambition

 you shall reign over haãti he said with ardor  presidents shall sue for your favor for they will recognize your power and i shall rest quietly in my grave contented in the satisfaction that you my disciple you the child whom i have reared as if you were my vn daughter you whom i love so fondly will be carrying on my great work

the ardor in his voice had softened into caressing endearment but the girls face showed no response as she stood silent looking out into the glare of the hillside

 i do not want to be a mamaloi she said sullenly

 and there is meissner the german who loves you the priest purred on ignoring her words he will be a power in haãti and you will control him he has beautiful jewels for you he will come to you

 i do not want to see him i do not want to be bad i want to be good she scarcely heard her own words the show and power of the priesthood no longer attracted her with her live feeling she saw alcide suffering all the tortures of the priests prediction and the old man was too quick with sympathy not to turn immediately to her dread of his powers it was this same sympathy which impelled him to be gentle and to make a show of reasonableness ns he proceeded to play upon her fears

 i cannot allow your alcide nor any other man to stand in my way he began with a quiet severity  you know that you have soon men meddle with my plans and you have seen them die all of your notions that oppose my plans for you have been put into your head by alcide because of his meddling he shall die because of his irreverence to me he shall writhe in torture before i let him die

the girl fell on her knees at the side of the bed and buried her face in her hands the priest leaned over her holding her shoulder in a firm grip

he shall die but first he shall suffer you shall sec him walk the streets of port au prince daily withering away to nothing he shall become a babbling idiot he will look at you but he will not know you he will be a mere brute in pain and torture before i let him die

dianes great form trembled she had seen men suffer so and slowly die she did not cry the thing was so awful she arose from her kneeling posture and looked the priest straight in the face he meant all he said she saw that she knew that he was capable of any crime

she decided on a plan of action she must see meissner

 i will do all that you want me to do she said in an intense calm  but you must promise that you will not hurt alcide

 with you at my side i will forget the boy said the priest

 you promise she repeated

 i swear by the serpent chanted the old man fervently

 then i promise to do all that you want me to do

diane sat on a low creole chair in the doorway looking blankly at the shadows from the edge of t ke wood as they flowed out towards her her mind was alive with plans to save alcide she had passed the entire afternoon passive in posture her thoughts a tumult of hope and despair

she heard the approach of a horse she felt that it was meissner on this unsought mountain path she rose to meet him as he came up and she remarked his clear complexion reddened by the tropical sun the perfection of his white ridingsuit and helmet and his fine military bearing

diane papa pierre said that i might come he said smiling as he held forth his hand in greeting  do you approve 

i want to talk with you she replied quietly but i will not lc bad

meissner laughed goodnaturedly and turned from her to throw his reins over a staple near the doorpost

and why this virtuous warning he asked in a bantering tone as he drew a chair near to hers  come sit near me see what i have brought you will you take them as a present from me she looked sadly at the box of brilliant silver ornaments and laid it on the ground at her side

 do you give these beautiful things to a woman who does not care for you  she asked calmly

 but i purpose to teach you to care for me said meissner

 but if i should never care for you  she asked earnestly

then i will wait until never ends he laughed back but he began to feel uncomfortable he had seen the girl often and had talked with her but he had never seen her so serious before he decided to humor her

 i will wait till never ends he repented  we will have a nice little house and you will learn to care for me when you know me i am not a bad fellow diane

his light way of speaking did not make the impression which he sought she was looking at him searchingly she said with conviction no you are not a bad man you arc a good man we will have a house as you say i will know you you will not make me bad you will wait until never ends before you will do me harm is it not so she spoke so gravely that he shared her mood

no diane whatever there may be between us will be with your consent he said earnestly

 then listen she said quietly  we will go to our house it will be well kept for you the world will say that i am bad let that be you will wait it is because of papa pierre that i do this do you understand 

meissner said that he understood but he said so expectantly

 papa pierre will not know you will not tell him you will be my friend will you not meissner and i will be your friend will it not be so meissner

there was a mystery behind it all but meissner could not resist the earnest simplicity of the appeal

 i will do whatever you say diane but tell me what it all means he protested

 i will tell you when we know each other better and you will be glad that you do what you now do she said it with a smile of sadness and relief which meissner admired while he could not interpret it  now go she added  do not stay i will keep the beautiful silver things and i will wear them tonight to my baptism go and soon we will meet and when i know you better i will tell you what you want to know but not a word to papa pierre or to tinceau

she held his hand confidingly and smiled back into his eyes with a radiant sadness in which the eyes and the lips belied each other meissner mounted and gallantly saluted her as he rode away into the deepening shadows she followed him with her eyes until he disappeared into the evening dusk near the mountain stream and lifting her casket of silver she walked heavily into the hut to dress for her baptism into the voudou priesthood

the coercion necessary to the conversion of diane decided papa pierre to act at once he had sent a message to meissner to come without delay this done he started immediately for the woods spreading the news along the roads and through the city as he went that there would be but two nights and that dianes baptism that night would be the closing ceremony

it was nearly midnight when meissner and tinceau arrived at the voudou gathering a clearing had been made in the thick brush and on two sides rude huts had been thrown up in front of these a halfdozen or more women had set out their wares and it was evident that eating and drinking were to be among the features of the exercises fresh claylike earth had been packed down in even layers and the bright light from the many flaming torches along the sides showed that many bare feet had contributed to the making of the primitive flooring this dancingfloor was enclosed by rough posts sustaining a rude but picturesque trellis or bower of leaves of the palm the entrance to the square was open

at the head of the square stood a small hut its doorway was entirely covered with palmleaves on one side of the hut was a large cross intertwined about whose arms was the body of a long thin snake well known in the neighborhood on the other side of the portiãre palmire was a small tree transplanted a woman clung to this weeping noiselessly the kneeling figure a most touching expression of abject selfabandonment in grief it was the itinerant shrine of the papaloi the high priest of the haãtiens the magician of the african voudou meissner and tinceau looked on at the waiting woman a moment and heard the voice of pierre louis from behind the palmleaf doorway and the tinkling of bells as he worked the magic of his fetichism for the benefit of the weeping woman

crowded outside of the enclosure were the faithful waiting for the conclusion of the cures and the beginning of the dance the three performers composing the orchestra were already waiting listlessly sitting astride of their native drums tinceau and meissner looked on a while and when the dance began they went back into the shadow where they were promptly joined by pierre louis they retired to a hut near by apparently the permanent residence of an old couple who greeted them cordially in the inner room of the cabin they sat at a little table and talked at length over their plans meissner drank heavily tinceau sparingly and the priest not at all every detail of the plot of the night before was checked against its seeming probability and there seemed no possibility of failure maillard would raise the insurrection and make a feint movement towards the north with the capital as his objective tinceau would use his authority as minister of war to send troops by sea to the north and leave the capital undefended diane would entice the president from the capital to sec her do her first cures papa pierre would control her and the war minister would keep alcide in the army on the entry of maillard tinceau would make the coup dtat assume the presidency and push the legislation required by the hnmburg syndicate meissner assured them repeatedly in maudlin voice that there was plenty of money us he called for more rum

 i think you and pierre louis are right in thinking as you do about the girl and her probable influence over the president remarked meissner reflectively toying with a thick and heavy tumbler his face was flushed and his eye uncertain tinceau smiled

you think i speak from experience eh meissner went on  well what if i do i left her only two hours ago he spoke in a halfdrunken tone of defiance and with a complacent chuckle lie askedâ  you are not jealous are you 

tinceaus reply was that the rum had come he poured out the grogs he evidently wanted his companion to talk drunk or sober meissner could not discuss his conquests he was too much a man of the world for that he did drink deeply and frequently however and he did talk much he said nothing of interest to tinceau however and the haitien proposed that they join the dance the german was just about fit to be one of the faithful and he had been so recognized bv the congregation since his initiation when tinceau vouched for him as a friend of the people

the occasion was recognized as important the men wore shoes some of them wore white trousers the women uniformly wore white gowns the skirts were cut high in front giving the feet entire freedom of motion while behind the stiffly starched train of a halfyard scraped and crackled over the ground

tinceau carefully looked around evidently seeking someone for other reasons than mere pleasure meissner caught the rhythm of the drums beaten with skilful fingers and flat of hand and danced up to the first woman who seemed to be unaccompanied he soon tired of her gave her a drink and started off with another such a generous patron of the booths was not ignored by the womenâeven though he danced like a goat as one confidentially observed to her lover

roast pig cooked over an open fire on a long pole turned as a spit by two cheerful youngsters gros bouillon roast plantains cooked in ashes to an inviting brown and white tafia were liberally consumed and as midnight approached the crowd was in the condition to accept anything which pierre louis jacques might dare to offer as a religious attraction but papa pierre had long ago decidedâthough dianes wilfulness for a while threatened to spoil his programmeâto close this successful meeting with a very simple ceremonial the youdou processional and the christening of his protegee for the priesthood

the music ceased with a startling suddenness and the dancers retired from the floor there was an impressive pause of quite two minutes and then the drums started again it was a wellset movement in double measure a slow deep rumble the baby drum running a rapid tattoo of variations to an obligato from one of the performers marvellously trained great toe from behind the palmleaf doorway came the voice of papa pierre singing an inarticulate chant to the time of the drums and the crowd now forming into single file under an experienced leader took up a refrain when the priest paused it was a curious gait with which they entered again upon the dancingfloor making short leaps from one foot to another their hands on their hips their bodies bent slightly forward the marching and the swaying in perfect time with the music of the drums the leader made them follow a sinuous course and the effect was not unlike that of the crawling of a great serpent in the flare of the flambeaux the black skins under headcloths of every combination of colors which aniline processes make possible would have been merely ludicrous if it were not for that expression of resigned sadness which had been stamped into their faces in repose through generations of pain in unrequited hopeless labor

now the great line extends outside of the enclosure the leader guiding it out under the trees into the darkness they keep up the same refrain the voice of papa pierre floats with feathery lightness above their heads they come back into the glare and each time they pass the head of the enclosure there are three genuflections one for the cross and serpent one for the shrine and one for the sacred tree three times the serpentine line of humanity in a concert of mass sway winds in and out and around the circuit

as the head of the line approached again papa pierre appeared quietly leading by the hand diane she was in spotless white her hair was done in n great loose knot set low a large silver band sprung low just above her forehead held the front hair close and brought out her remarkable features in striking severity her neck was decorated with a long string of minute silver beads falling down on her sturdy chest generously exposed on her wrists jingled bangles of silver coins and the silver in all the glint of newness and the plain skirt bleached to dazzling whiteness and set against the fine satinlike texture of her skin put her ns one apart from the other women surely she was born a priestess a goddess in black the personification of youthful strength beauty of form and agile grace

hand in hand they swung out into the enclosure the old man was a marvel of motion and the effect which the two made was a gliding without apparent break which nothing short of most painstaking practice could produce her gown was fitted close over her body and the modulation of her hips and the movement of her thighs attracted furtive glances from the men as all bowed their reverence and passed on meissner was an atom in the moving mass but his eyes were fastened on her in halfsodden satisfaction

papa pierre led the chant into a swinging chorus and suddenly dropped out from the line taking a position under the sacred tree leaving diane in the lead higher and higher his voice rose swinging his body to beat time he gradually increased the rapidity of their motion until soon he had them worked up into a frenzied mass under his complete control his alert eye was never more calm he saw everything yet he too seemed to be carried away by the common ecstasy diane was influenced by the common impulse drunk with the sense of realizing her most cherished dreams papa pierres eye was on her as she glided by him making a deep bow of reverence how graceful she was how well he had taught her yes she would control the crowd with lips apart her perfect teeth gleaming her statuesque bust rising and falling with her chest now heaving with excitement and violent exertion she appeared again from out of the darkness into the glare of the flambeaux

papa pierre uttered a command scarcely audible and a large white cock fell at his feet the crowd looked on in awe as they rushed past him fairly shouting their inarticulate song the head of the line with diane in the lead was only thirty feet away winding its rapid sinuous path outside the column retreating from the priest into the darkness quietly and firmly the priest grasped the fowl and leading the song in a voice like a grand organ he began beating its body against the trunk of the sacred tree there was only one man in that crowd who thought of the mortal agony of the sacred cock as its bones were crushed to the time of the song but even meissner was too thoroughly soaked in the excitement and rum to give it more than passing thought

diane was now only a few paces away the priest drew a large knife from the girdle under his gown he stood a moment with the quivering fowl held forth towards the crowd the blade held high above his head quiet now composed the personification of the acting art as she reached him one sweep of the knife whipped the head from the neck of the still struggling cock and a deft swing brought the fowl aloft just over her head she was truly a bora priestess her upturned face caught the first rush of blood from the baptismal sacrifice she gulped down a mouthful without losing the rapid gait she flung it out her eyes and nostrils and it trickled down her face and over her ordination gown she took a few paces swept in a curve out of the line and let it pass on taking her place at the side of the priest the devotees rushed madly by each eagerly reaching up his lips to catch some of the sacred blood meissners caught him just above the forehead it stained his blond hair and smeared his brow he had seen service as a good soldier his face gave not the slightest sign

the end of the line approached and pierre louis was squeezing and kneading the crushed body of the fowl that nobody should be missed as the last one passed he suddenly raised his hand the drums stopped on the instant the crowd stood still and was mute in the impressiveness of this absolute silence the priest took the hand of the priestess and the two slowly disappeared behind the palmleaf doorway the silence continued a moment then the frenzied spell broke women fell in hysterics some swooning dead away others shrieking or laughing like fiends great strong men quivering with excitement and panting from fatigue stood dazed and bloodsmeared in a huddled crowd

the only selfcontrolled one was tinceau who pushed his way through to look for meissner he had been merely a spectator and he had looked on in cool disgust he could afford to stand apart he was sure of his position with the people he looked on all sides and failing to find his friend he left the enclosure to go to the meetingplace of the conspirators the hut near by

as he came out into the starlight he recognized the forms of the german and the girl ahead of him meissners arm was around her he followed them they entered the hut of the old couple together then he turned and started at a good pace through the woods towards the city and when he was well on his way the deep distant rumble of the drums and the droning of the human voices told him that the dance was on again

alcide army life was a dreary monotony of sloth and universal gambling he had been well drilled by minister hauffman and a young colonel to whom the government had entrusted the setting up of the raw recruits took a decided fancy to alcide the first day this officer had been trained in france and the novel experience of meeting a recruit who actually knew the manual of arms attracted him to alcide at once and the boy was constantly reminded of his personal interest by little kindnesses which only a superior officer could extend to soften the hardships of the army life

in the gossip of the ranks there was much talk about a conspiracy in the north but alcide put no confidence in what his comrades said when he approached the colonel on the subject the kindly but firm manner of the officer rather than his words brought alcide back to an appreciation of military discipline

one morning there was a serious meeting the generals of la place and of the arrondissement conferred with the chief of police there was general gossip among the common soldiers about conspiracy the movement of troops and the call of the president for volunteers it was all new to alcide these details and for the first time he found himself awakened to an interest in his new life after the conference his company was broken into detachments each under a lieutenant with orders to go out and secure volunteers for the army each man carried a rifle the officer wore his sword at his side and he carried in his hand a cane of cocomacaque a walkingstick affected by foreigners and by haãtiens of position

the soldiers sauntered in any fashion at the heels of the officer until they reached the marketplace near the cathedral the place was a babel of womens voices all kinds of tropical fruits and vegetables and herbs and spices were exposed in little heaps to the fierce sun the owners squatting beside them talking to purchasers and neighbors at the same time it was the friendliest kind of competition which they maintained and there was a sturdy independence in the matter of driving bargains with the buyers  that is my price the seller would say and go on talking to her neighbor about the dance in the woods with most provoking indifference to the prospect of a sale there were many halfgrown children who had helped to bring the things to market and there was a swarm of nude babies rolling around in the glare and dust sucking at anything within reach models of infantile deportment

seeing a likely looking young fellow sitting near one of the marketwomen the soldiers grabbed him under orders from the officer immediately the place was in an uproar the mother for such she proved to be shrieking with rage pounded the officers face with an overripe squash howls of indignation came from every side volleys of stones vegetables and eggs poured upon the wretched detachment who formed around their capture with bayonets presented retreating slowly as they dodged the missiles the officer walked last his sword in one hand and his cocomacaque with its silver head in the other swearing vigorously at the women in all the rich and original profanity of the patois

 he is a volunteer yelled the lieutenant above the cries of the women  and if you dont stop ill fire a volley into you

before they had gone the length of the marketplace ten poor wretches too curious to run away as most of the youngsters had done had thus entered the volunteer service of the republic to the accompaniment of the weeping and wailing maledictions of a host of female relatives and friends alcides indignation was hard to restrain but he held his rifle firmly and obeyed orders with a military precision that elicited words of commendation from the lieutenant

one block before reaching the bord de la mer they encountered a youth standing in front of a showcase in which were exhibited wonders of cheap and showy jewelry the youngster was feasting his eyes on the beauty before him and tearing away with his teeth the skin of a mango he evidently had been making his breakfast off the fruit for his hands and face were shiny and sticky with the gummy fibrous juice he was too deeply absorbed in his double occupation to observe the approach of the soldiers when the lieutenant appeared at his side and ordered him into line with the other captured miserables who were easily handled by two of the armed soldiers but he sturdily refused to go he explained that he did not belong to port au prince and that he did not purpose to enter the army in the capital

 you are a volunteer screamed the officer excitedly  fall in fall in

 i am not a volunteer shrieked the boy  i wont fall in

the officer raised his cocomacaque and dealt a vicious blow at the boy but it did not land alcides bayonet caught it parried it and deftly flung the stick into the middle of the street he was strong in the bayonet drill the boy turned to run but alcide caught him by the shoulder and swung him into the group of volunteers

 how dare you you cried the officer dashing at him with drawn sword the point of the same skilful bayonet stopped his mad rush and the crowd which had gathered from all directions howled with delight at the spectacle officers ordered agunning for volunteers are not popular characters in the streets of port au prince

 you had no right to strike that boy said alcide  you have him safe with the others and your duty is done had you struck the child you would have injured him seriouslyâperhaps killed him you ought to be glad that i saved you from what would have been the result of your anger

surrender your rifle you are under arrest i will return you under guard alcide handed over his rifle saluted and entered the group of volunteers

in the crowd was the colonel who had been so pleased with alcides bearing and attainments several days before he spoke quietly with the lieutenant for some time and turned away without addressing a word to his proteg on their arrival at the arrondissement they found nearly the full regiment assembled and hurried preparations for a march in progress the general was too busy to look into alcides case and ordered him to prison awaiting examination the low barracks opening into a large square to which he was taken contained a large number of petty criminals who enjoyed at least the sunshine and the open air no such freedom was in store for the military prisoner however the openings into the barracks were from the square and it was through one of these that alcide was thrust and the doors were shut upon him

the place was filthy dark and altogether forbidding a few minutes after the door had closed upon him he became accustomed to the dim light which streaked in through chinks around the doors and which seemed at first to be absolute darkness several prisoners lay at full length on the floor their legs fastened to an iron rod which ran the length of the room he peered around the room and wondered what crimes his associates had committed he at least was free to move about the only person who enjoyed that liberty his accuser had followed him to see him safely bestowed but he did not ask that alcide be chained to the wall

his eye fell upon a man who immediately became conspicuous because of his dress he wore the uniform black and the long coat of the professional class and a silk hat lay on the earthen floor near by alcide approached him and recognized him as a man well known in society and distinguished as one of the leading lawyers in port au prince he had served this man many times at the hauffman residence the lawyer did not recognize him at first but he afterwards explained that he had been arrested that morning on a charge ofhonspiracy against the government his life was not worth thinking about he said as he was expecting at any moment the order for his immediate execution

 but never mind me why are you here  asked the lawyer  i see you are in uniform alcide explained that he had begun his service in the army and recited some of his experiences during his few days of army life closing with what had happened while drumming up volunteers

 grave matters at this time observed the lawyer  they would shoot you sure if you had not hauffman at your back you should send for him at once

alcide replied that he would take the consequences and that he was determined not to embarrass mr hauffman any further the minister had committed himself enough in his effort to secure a reversal of the order to recruit him the two talked on and finally alcide settled down to sleep an accomplishment which he had now thoroughly acquired during his short soldier life when he awoke it was quite dark in the cell and he was ravenously hungry

 ah my boy you sleep well i envy you that faculty

 yes but i am hungry too replied alcide rubbing his eyes and trying to penetrate the darkness

 i have been waiting to hear you move said the lawyer  it is infernally monotonous lying here after this fashion and it is positively exasperating to know that you my fellow in distress can sleep so easily one would think that you had seen years of service in the haãtien army instead of a fortnight and alcide heard the lawyer laugh

 well you have the advantage that you can be philosophic and can laugh i cant im hungry and alcides tone was very moody

 you will get food it is early yet and my wife will bring enough for two said the lawyer and at that moment alcide felt a hand grope across his body grasp his arm firmly and draw him in the direction of his distinguished fellowprisoner his head was drawn over until the lips of the lawyer touched his ear

listen quietly there may be a spy here chained to the wall to listen to me all may not be sleeping you must have remarked that i have talked with none of them i have heard the voice of my wife twice she is here in the enclosure she has food i am sure but there is something else afoot to cause her delay it may be that i am sentenced to be shot during the night in that case she has dropped everything to go and plead for me at the palace or she may be bribing the jailer as i planned when i go out make no movement it may be goodby forever

 i wish that food would come said the lawyer aloud  and when a man is hungry all other subjects of conversation seem to fly away my wife ought to have been here an hour ago it is not yet seven oclock yet i do wish she would come for your sake as well as my own

 in no case are you to make the least sign of being awake he said resuming the whisper the food will be left where you can reach it i will attend to that if i get outâand if it be by any means possible my wife will arrangeâhauffman will know all about your situation at once i will take refuge in a legation whether the diplomats like it or not ill get hauffman by telephone if i am to be shotâwell goodby my fine fellow they grasped hands and alcide slowly and silently withdrew to some distance but still within reach of his friend it was a curiously made friendship they had met many times at the hauffman residence but their relationship would have continued to be that of menial and superior common distress and common peril had brought them in a few hours to the equality bom of mutual understanding thinking out into the future thinking of his ambition to be a distinguished black scholar like his fellowprisoner known in the european world of scholarship alcide almost forgot his hunger when footsteps approached and the door opened it closed on a man carrying a lantern and a woman holding with unaccustomed solicitude a large bowllike dish covered with a napkin lie had a glimpse of starlight and a breath of the evening air

 where is he she asked in a controlled but agitated voice

here dear said the lawyer smiling into the feeble light of the lantern  be calm i am all right

 i bring you food but they will not let me stay this gentleman has been very good

very good asked the lawyer with an emphasis which alcide readily noted as significant

 yes very good she said smiling through her tears and as she stooped to place the dish upon the floor she slipped her hand into that of her husband they parted hurriedly the uniformed jailer had not uttered a word another glimpse of the starlight another gulp of fresh air and again the darkness and the stench

the lawyers hand reached that of alcide pulling it towards the dish he was not slow in fishing out a monstrous leg of turkey and a piece of firm crisp haãtien bread he ate ravenously but silently he was amazed at the gluttonous noise with which his companion attacked the food crunching on bones snapping them as it seemed on the iron rod at his feet the lawyer was suddenly taken with an alldevouring mania but alcide understood when through these noises he detected the gentle click of a lock then in a loud voice the lawyer offered alcide food and passed some down to the other prisoners alcide understood there was no need for further silence he talked and ate and was contented his friend had taken the first step towards freedom the devoted wife had done her work thus far at least

with the exception of his coffee and eggs alcide had been more than twentyfour hours without food he had eaten fine dinners at kauffmans but never such a feast as that meal with his fingers in the foul dark cell if he should live to thank that wife how could he ever put his gratitude into words  he thought of her beautiful devotion and of the husbands absolute confidence that she was working for him he stretched out on the damp floor with a thought of envy for the blessedness of that happily married man and then diane came in her presence diffusing a great bright light around her she kneeled and held his head in her arms she kissed him fondly on the forehead and soothed him with her pure voice how sweet she was how tender his wife to be how he rested on the dignity of the wifetouch and how weak he was after all he stretched up his arms to her longingly a chill draught awoke him the door was closing the starlight was waning and there was the smell of the dusk of the dawn he reached out in the darkness he felt glad the lawyer had gone

he reached out again splendid animal that he was for more food and he found not only that but also a bottle of coffeeâhaãtien coffee who will adequately describe it it goes right to the heart he took a long pull and settled down comfortable again

he was started to his feet by a great row the sounds of angry voices among them he recognized minister hauffmans  it was an infernal outrage the german was sayingâswearing in german french and patois in a way which alcide recognized as indicating that his employer was dangerously angry  damn your orders open the door and let me to him i speak for germany open i say that was the minister over and over thought the boy as he felt the hot tears start and run down his cheeks

the door was flung open and the precious daylight flooded into the place kauffman was on its heels in the full uniform of his military rankâhis war paint as his wife called it in a moment he had the boy in his arms sobbing over him caressing hi in damning him roundly

 you infernal ass you magnificent idiot he cried in the fluency of his native tongue kissing alcide and straining the boys head into a mass of decorations on his breast  would not send me a word you precious fool you ought to have run your bayonet through that brute and you were going to let them shoot you full of holes and you parried did you disarmed him eh and you were going to let them murder you without a word to me you sentimental jackass ill bet he wondered where you learned that trick by godâreverting to french of a very guttural fluencyâ by god the man who touches this boy responds to me personally do you understand ill bring out a schoolship and annihilate you yes all boys clean trained german boys to lick the thunder out of you he is under my protection say what they please you are dirty filthy i expect you are lousy like the rest of them and hauffman held the dirt and the lice all the closer to his unblemished uniform

alcide was crying softly smiling contentedly unnerved by the excitement all gone to pieces now that relief had come the german tried to calm him and in soothing the boy he regained control of himself and reflected on his incoherent outburst

 i am making an ass of myself he said in german and turning to the jailer he said  get him a tub of waterâplenty of soap give him all he can eat telephone to my house for clean linen for him heres money  and that spoke for germany too the jailer was very reluctant to take money for doing his simple duty and particularly from so distinguished and courteous a visitor as his excellency whom it was a pleasure to serve still the minister with his knowledge of all things must know that the government had not paid any salaries to employes for six months past

 well said hauffman drawing a long breath now that he had to some extent relieved his pentup feelings  when your fellowprisoner sent me the telephone message i was just out of bed my first thought was to go to the president for an order to admit me here i am glad i came without it i see your prison and your prisoners and i see how you do your simple duty with this parting shot at the jailer he started to go assuring alcide that he would at once set about his release

it is not necessary mr minister said a voice at his elbow  that has been arranged i have been looking for alcide it with hammocks turned into travellingbags and swung over shoulders alcides company would have looked a troop of pedlers had their packs not been swung from riflebarrels they had been ordered out for night duty to guard the streetcorners for the president had declared martial law

alcide and two comrades were placed at the corner of two important streets they immediately occupied the porch of the house swung their hammocks and then took their places on the street in order to challenge anyone who might approach his companions were two veterans and alcides admirer the rescued volunteer they explained that it was the custom to divide the night into watches in order that one sentry might sleep quietly in his hammock while his two comrades stood guard and watched for the coming of officers alcide accepted the arrangement and as he was granted the first watch off he soon fell asleep with the  qui vive still ringing in his ears

when he awoke he was startled to find his corner quite quiet the  qui vive  was ringing through the city he sat up sidewise on his hammock and reached for his rifle one of the veterans lay sprawling in the street his head resting in the mud at the edge of the rigole the other had maintained his sitting posture and was muttering the  qui vive  in his sleep

 qui vive cried alcide as two persons approached

 foreigners answered one of them resuming the conversation with his companion in german alcide recognized the form and voice of meissner

 be on board early in the morning he was saying  the ville de tangiers has a good cook and the captain an old friend of mine is a delightful fellow

 god how can you talk so lightly when you are leaving the enterprise practically in the hands of haãtiens the speaker was deeply in earnest

 of course i am sure was the reply clearly heard by alcide  the personal ambitions involved are sufficient guarantee besides i have put out a lot of money and gossip is already lively i must get away to quiet suspicion

was the young colonel who spoke alcide introduced the two men they had a long confab apart and alcide marched out with them taking his dirt with him the jailer holding firmly to his gold coin as he did his simple duty in bowing the visitors out they separated oh reaching the street the diplomat taking his carriage and the two soldiers going afoot towards the arrondissement

 are you sure that your arrangements are well made and that there will be no bloodshed  we may speak safely in german

 sure as death said meissner stopping at the corner which they now reached walking slowly  diane is a jewel she has worked the president beautifully and he is crazy over her he will go to see her make her first cures damn the cures i am going to jacmel to have a good time she may go to the dance but the rest of her time is mine the rebels will find the city without defence and the president absent we will come back to pay our respects to president tinceau is that not simple enough  how many times do you want me to go over the programme you wont lose your peoples money

alcide sat fixed to the side of the hammock what was this horrible thing was he dreaming at his post diane the rest of her time his the cures the president crazy over her the city undefended  president tinceau the veterans had awakened and they came up to the balcony vigorously crying  qui vive 

 here you fellows wake up and give us a chance protested one of the veterans

what is the matter are you sick he addressed alcide who was sitting doubled up on his hammock his eyes fastened on the floor the fellow had suggested an idea he groaned out his reply

 take me across the way and call up the druggist the volunteer helped very tenderly to lift him and fiercely admonished the veterans not to be so rough alcide was not ashamed of the deception he was thinking too rapidly to have any feeling his plans were taking shape

the druggist was a kindly man he came down promptly and opened his little shop he poured a fiery cholera mixture down alcides throat and the patient no longer had reason to simulate his torture the medicine was a roaring flame within him but he was grateful because he knew that he was a poor actor

doctor i know that you have a telephone he said feebly

 wont you call up the german minister and tell him that his boy alcide is here very anxious to see him

german minister alcide why sure it is i know you boy in the name of god what arc you doing exposed to this horrible soldier life of course ill call him up if i can get that lazy crowd at the central to connect me up and the veterans returned to their vigil

alcide was really ill now he felt a nervous chill run through his body and a ringing sound in his ears diane the cures and the rest of her time his she had worked the president beautifully tinceau so he and the priest were the ones who had made him a soldier to get him out of her way god how he buffered yet he smiled as he waved off the druggists assistant who wanted to administer another dose of the liquid fire

yes the central station had answered they were switched to the hauffman residence that was all right there was a second telephone in the bedroom and besides the minister heard everything through the night the night the thieves broke into the chickenhouse the minister heard them and he caught one too and made him eat all the eggs on which the hens were settingâshells and all how the minister enjoyed poking one egg after another into the fellows mouth whole alcide laughed hysterically and fell off into a doze then there was a sharp ringoff and the german minister hinkelf had answered that he would be down in ten minutes

 give me something for my nerves alcide begged of the druggist  he saw me cry this morning and when i think of his goodness i want to cry now he wont be longâand the sentinels wont stop him either

he took the sedative and tried hard to compose himself long before the minister reached him he imagined he heard the footfalls between the cries of the soldiers hauffman threw himself from his saddle and entered the little shop very quickly his great womanheart all concern for his boy he knelt down beside him and talked to him gently and alcide was bursting with shame and unnerved with affection  well ill get you home if we have to call a cabinet meeting he said quietly  doctor will you certify that this young man is not fit to be exposed to this night duty

 why certainly i will minister said the druggist  at his best he has been too well treated by you to stand it all port au prince is very reconnaissant of your treatment of alcide

 he deserves all i can do for him he is my son said the diplomat feelingly  please make the certificate my carriage will be here presently

the officer of the guard in making his midnight round had missed alcide and had come to the drugshop certainly he would permit the sick soldier to accompany the minister to the arrondissement

the carriage drove to the arrondissement and a mob of sentinels rushed out into the street to intercept it  look at the lamps see the flags i am the german minister and i must see the general of the arrondissement cried hauffman there was a great deal of confused talking and hauffman remembered that he had left his pocketbook at home a window opened in the upper balcony of the arrondissement and then a door was thrown open violently

 what is all that noise down there

it was the dreaded general his thin legs shrinking in the nightair under his flapping nightshirt hauffman stuck his head forth and explained the general removed his highly decorated smokingcap bowed politely and asked the minister to wait

presently he appeared on the lower balcony wearing the coat of his fulldress uniform over his nightshirt his legs still bare and his feet stuck into a pair of heelless slippers

kauffman handed him the doctors certificate and the general called for a light a candle was brought the wick protected from the wind by a neat glass globe the minister was once more seriously concerned for alcide as that young man buried his face in the laprobe and shivered with a convulsive fit of laughter when the general took the certificate and with grave deliberation went through the motion of reading it this performance carried through to his own satisfaction and nearly to the death of alcide as it appeared to kauffman the general put on his heaviest frown and looked from the paper to the minister a silent profound inquiry hauffman answered very politely that he would like to take the boy home permission was accorded the german fired an avalanche of apologies at the general for the trouble he had caused and the general exhausted his vocabulary of patois and french mixed in assuring the minister that he was entirely at the germans orders

 i am not sick at all the wretched alcide blurted out in german that the coachman might not understand  i am only nervous but it was necessary that i see you alone and at once

minister for foreign affairs jules pirot arrived at home one morning deeply disturbed after a talk with the president and the minister of war his wife said nothing knowing that he wanted to think and that he would tell her all as soon ns he could reach a definite conclusion concerning the situation she had passed a fortnight of great anxiety the arrest of her husbands former law partner the husband of her chum while at school in europe had seemed to confirm her worst fears she sat sewing and pirot joined her he sat looking over the pages of a lawbook

 dearest things are looking bad he said presently  tinceau openly expressed his hostility to me this morning in the presence of the president i kept myself fairly well in hand however and came out of the difficulty without violence

 was it as bad as that asked mrs pirot anxiously

 yes it was very threatening while it lasted i protested against the despatch of our best troops for the north by sea and the leaving of the capital exposed to a rebel attack tinceau became very angry and insinuated that i should leave such details to soldiers i replied that i could give him some lessons in the use of the sword he wears and that with the thought that i am the best swordsman in port an prince probably calmed him at any rate the president interposed and we parted without further trouble how i do wish it were all over there is just one more claim which i want to settle before i leave the government then we will go to paris

why not leave now tomorrow the ville de tangiers is in port and sails tomorrow we can connect with the st simon at fort de france i want to get away your life is greatly exposed mrs pirot made no effort to hide her alarm

 no not yet said pirot confidently  ill know when it comes to that hello the telephone it is the signal i expected no the moment of real danger has not come yet no i need a little more money just this one case and fifty thousand francs for my humble service he laughed nervously

 ill never enjoy that money she said with conviction  it is not earned the way in which you take it is not honest i shall never be happy nor will you be until you are really earning your jjving again

 fault of your teutonic education my dear the europeans with their gunboats would force us to pay right or wrong if the beneficiary choose to give me a little gratification why that is his affair he tried to speak gayly but she shook her head dubiously and went on with her embroidery

pirot continued with his show of legal research he knew that she was right she was always right on moral questions yet he always said to her that the man with his tastes who could patiently endure poverty is a lunatic or a god criticism from his wife struck deepâ he loved her so and lived in her good opinion of him and his reflections ran on so while he turned the pages of his lawbook and wondered whether he could say anything to reconcile her to his political savings did he really want to see her reconciled the telephone rang again he answered the ring but did not touch the receiver  serious send a trusted messenger to the palace on any errand his wife looked alarmed he answered the ring and went into his study he sent the president a report concerning the international claim it was from the minister of justice to the minister for foreign affairs discussing the law on the case pirot held both portfolios

he had to do something he could not wait a halfhour in suspense he would make a call on the spanish consul the most guileless of all the corps he kissed his wife goodby and rode away when he returned the message was there tinceau had reported maillard to be the leader of the rebels and that he was but the fighting man for pirot the president had refused permission to arrest him but had ordered a french and an english spy to be put on him

he slowly twisted the paper lit a cigarette with it and watched it reflectively as it smoked itself into a crisp cinder  two hundred and fifty thousand francs in two years so much for frugality on a meagre salary he murmured to himself if he could only get to the bottom of the thing if hauffman were in it he had covered his tracks admirably yet the german would not have implicated him in such a devilish way he would go directly to the president

he greeted an englishman as he went out and smiled grimly as he entered his carriage the fellow was an overzealous little cockney well known as a spy who sold the little he knew about affairs and a great deal he did not know to anybody who would buy

the president received pirot at once and began talking about the international claim pirot explained the matter at length and then exclaimed abruptly  president my purpose in coming is not to talk about the claim though i am glad to have the opportunity to do so with you what i want to do is to urge you seriously to consider the risk which we take in exposing the capital as tinceau purposes to do i dont pose as a soldier but you know better than tinceau what a good military training my father gave me you were his friend and you have shown your interest in me since my boyhood i have a right to an opinion as a student of military science but i dont urge that i put it on the ground of ordinary commonsense that you are taking grave risks

the president took off his goggles and wiped his eyes  you touch me deeply he said  when you speak of your father and of what i knew about you as a boy frederick pirot and i were strongly attached to each other and my first meeting with you was when you played horse on my walkingstick during one of his rare visits home i know that he was very careful in the matter of your education and that he had an eye single to your fitness to serve your country as he had done but you you want to get away he flung these parting words at the young man and looked at him earnestly to note their effect

pirot was very calm as he replied for he did not know on what dangerous ground the president was leading him  yes i want to go he said i have told you so and i have told you my reasons you have been my friend because you loved my father i have shown my gratitude in every way that i could conceive but you will never know how deeply i appreciate your kindness i want to go because my presence here is distasteful to the leading men in public life

 you arc the only man i know capable of preserving peace in haãti continued pirot  i dont agree with your politics i believe in throwing the country open to foreign capital still i must concede that you represent the traditional sentiment of the people i purpose as a part of your government to do all in my power to support you to the point of dying at your side if need be but i dont want to risk that unnecessarily and it need not be considered if you decide to keep your best troops at your side where they belong

 let me think said the president musingly  let me think leave me and come in tomorrow

so the day passed at the national palace military preparations filled the air with their sounds of horrible suggestion

alone in his private apartments sat this selfcontained chief of state carefully weighing the value of men and of events his face gave no sign of the anxiety which controlled him he received visitors and despatched orders with the same suave gravity which had always commanded the respect of his followers and when evening came he ate his frugal creole meal and drank his rumandwater as heartily as if he had not a care in the world now the  qui vive had started he must give orders that the girl be admitted

 goodevening your excellency pierre louis was actually before him

 the devil i exclaimed the president with emotional logic

 at your service replied papa pierre he was dressed in the ordinary blue denim and he might have been taken for one of a score of old men one meets on the public roads he was perfectly selfcontained as he faced the cold scrutiny of the man on whom he had intruded presently the president laughed

 up to your old tricks papa pierre up to your old tricks i see he said smiling  i dont ask you how you managed to get in one of your miracles i suppose

 i have come to cure your scoffing i was proud when i heard that you were thinking seriously of coming to the cures lust is stronger than faith

the president leaped from his chair and faced the priest his terrible eyes gleaming looking back into that murderous glare the eyes of pierre louis were perfectly calm he seemed to be speaking through inspiration

 yes my black solomon the girl could do what i never could with you i was proud when i heard that she had converted you i wanted to see you at the cures but i have had a dream i have seen men die under fire of many guns i have seen you helpless at a distance receiving the news much as i want to see you at one of my meetings i tell you not to go to the cures tell the girl tonight that you will go you must deceive her stay here and look to your defences if my dream directs you arightâand it cannot direct you to harmâthen some time in the future come to the cures as one who believes at least as one who recognizes my power i have spoken

the priest went out of the door like a shadow and down the hallway towards a back staircase the president called an officer from the main entrance

 go quickly towards the rear entrance if you see a man dont disturb him search for him thoroughly and merely let me know how lie gets out the president paced the floor in an agitated way for fully twenty minutes when the officer returned and reported that no strange person had been seen within the grounds

pierre louis went rapidly down the stair and out into the night he turned short in the shadow of the house and reaching up to a neighboring window he mounted with agility and glided into the room a woman servant closed the window quickly pierre louis sat watching through the crack between the shutters he saw an officer emerge from the shadow of the house looking in every direction and finally going off towards the nearest sentry there was a sharp  qui vive and a muttered consultation the officer moved on after a while he came back and entered the house still pierre louis did not move the room was quite dark and the sound of the womans even breathing told him that she was sleeping he did not disturb her but kept his place his face glued to the crack between the shutters

not the slightest sign of impatience escaped him he seemed something inanimate as he leaned there the hours passed by and he did not stir it was nearly midnight when he heard the quick  qui vive a muttered reply and the sound of footsteps approaching diane came accompanied by an officer the door closed on them papa pierre waited some time longer

then he opened the door of the room and examined well the hallway nobody was in sight except a sentinel doubled up asleep on his little threelegged stool he returned and bolted the shutters of the window it would give the faithful woman something to think about in the morning he went out into the hall closing the door gently on the sleeper within reaching into one pocket he drew out a scarlet cap and fixed it firmly on his head from another pocket he drew out a quivering nuremberg serpent with glittering glass eyes and flaming tongue protruding

thus armed he glided down the hallway to the sleeping sentinel he put himself into position to get the full value of the dim light effect and then touched the man with the head of the toy the startled cry was choked in the throat held in the firm grasp of the priest

do you know me whispered pierre louis nearly throttling his victim

 yes papa pierre replied the terrorstricken wretch

well follow me not a sound or you will die the slow death come lock this door after me not a sound and he crept into the shadow of the house

diane came out and the priest lay in the shadow awaiting the return of the officer who accompanied her the man safe within doors he crouched there some time watching the sentinel it was the same whom he had passed on entering closing one hand he began playing a voudou drumtune upon the fist with the fingers of the other it was a very slight noise between the cries of the  qui vive  it was quite sufficient to carry itself to the ears of the sentinel the fellow soon heard listened a moment intently and then approached without a word he led the priest to the next sentry and so he passed on to the limit of the grounds it was a high iron fence which enclosed the grounds but he vaulted it easily and started off across the champs de mars 

as he turned into the turgeau road a carriage drove by rapidly the flags on the lamps marked it as belonging to the german legation  big dinner somewhere tonight he observed to a man who joined him  did you get the horses 

together they went afoot up the turgeau road out into the mountain path to his house he lighted his lamp and began to pack up his drugs he was preparing for the cures powders and herbs and roots were in abundance these simples were for the genuine treatment of the faithful but jumbled into the same pack were the dried snakes and lizards from the walls to play upon the imagination of the people he collected the things and packed them with simian dexterity into a pair of paniers which his attendant held open for him

then a visitor came his appearance showed that he had had a long journey in the saddle and there was blood on his bare heel over which was strapped a large spur with a brutal rowel pierre louis took the letter which the messenger presented and recognized the handwriting of maillard

 you are tired and hungry he said  sit down and i will get you something to eat

at this moment diane entered she looked around at the evidences of preparation for the journey and asked for pierre louis the old man heard her voice and returned instantly

 he will go to the cures she said quietly  come with me she led the way into her own room and dropped the curtain between them and the man in the other room

you have done well he said now get our visitor food he has had a hard journey

 papa pierre her voice was very tremulous

why what is it child what is the matter you are nervous as a kitten said the priest

 papa pierre do you know that alcide is very ill 

the old man looked at her in angry astonishment

 did i not tell you never to mention his name to me he growled  he is a mahoganycolored german how dare you to bring up his name at such a time get food for the man and prepare for your journey the night is going

 i will mention his name to you and it may be for the last time she replied firmly but in a tone of deep grief you must hear me and you must answer me the world now thinks me a bad womanâ bad bad bad i but i love him as i never did before i am not fit to speak to him now but he would have made meâa good woman the priest turned to go a look of deep disgust on his face

 stop she hissed catching his arm in an iron grip  stop hear me i am going to do all you want me to do i have left alcide forever do you understand 

the priest was stupefied with amazement he had never seen her so before

 i love him do you understand 

 yes i understand he said sullenly

 if you have harmed him ill kill you do you understand  yes kill you kill you with my own hands do you understand the girls grip benumbed his arms as it tightened itself with her repetition of the threat

the priest did understand and he did not he knew that the girl was dreadfully in earnest that she meant all she said he saw that she meant no rebellion against his authority she was too strong a nature to permit herself to suffer remorse he understood all that he could not understand why she should so suddenly and apparently without suggestion imagine that he had harmed the foolish boy

 why my dear you must calm yourself he said caressingly  i have not hurt the boy take my word for it i will let him alone as long as he lets me alone what is the matter she was watching him with a vicious gleam in her eyes

 listen and i will tell you she aid more calmly  i did not stay long at the palace i have been at hauffmans as i came up the road i saw the house lighted up and i saw a light in alcides room

i looked in at the gate i thought it was a party and i wanted tos ceâ the dresses of the ladies then i saw it was not a party only the servants were there and mrs hauffman they were running about

a carriage came very fast into the yard i hid myself behind the carriage and watched they took a sick man out of the carriage and it was alcide the minister moved around alcides room then the minister came down and spoke in german with mrs hauffman she went to her rooms i was about to leave when celeste the cook came out i called her to me and she told me all about it

well what did she tell you asked the priest the girl was crying softly forgetting her narrative in the burden of her undercurrent of thought and feeling

 what did she tell you insisted pierre louis

 why the minister had been called by a doctor at midnight he said that alcide had fallen very sick did you make him sick 

again there came that fierce gleam in her eye and the grip on the old mans arm

 by all the oaths to the sacred serpent i swear that i have done no harm to that boy except to insist that he be put into the army said the priest solemnly

 then listen and i will tell you and she seemed greatly relieved  he was doing the qui vive on the grand rue and he suddenly fell with a pain in his stomach that is what made me think you had given him the quick dose

 no i swear i never thought of it i had forgotten him interrupted the priest

 well the other soldiers picked him up and took him to the doctorshop the doctor he talked over the wire machine to the minister and the minister made a great noise and went to alcide on his horse alcide vomited and i thought that saved him from the quick dose

 no no child get that out of your head protested papa pierre  i did the boy no harm

 and then the minister saw the arrondissement and the arrondissement let him bring alcide home that is what celeste told me and the minister called out of alcides window to put away the horses and lock up the house then i came away

 oh god she moaned  no other man will ever kiss me as he did and fell on the bed burying her face and sobbing violently the old man looked on helplessly and then approached the bed she turned to him and drew him down to her side

 tell me again she cried imploringly  tell me again that you did not do it

 i did not said the priest

 promise me that you never will she said sternly

 i do promise you my dear he replied

 now then i tell you that i will never mention his name again i will never see him again he thinks that i am bad bad bad i shall always love him love him but i will never see him again do you understand

the priest said that he did but he said to himself that he never did understand a woman

he wanted a marriage in a church and a family just like the minister she continued in a retrospective sort of way  he would never look at a femme placãe like me so you need not fear i am all for you and your work go tell the man that his food will soon be ready

it was soon ready and she was perfectly composed when she brought it in the man had heard the sounds of weeping and of voices that appeared angry but the appearance of diane dispelled all idea of a quarrel she was all graceful attention to the visitor

as he served him the priest took the letter which he had brought and read it carefully maillard told him that they had suffered great hardships that the men had been ready to disband while they had plenty of arms and ammunition there had been great scarcity of food on the march the men had talked so generally of returning to their homes that he had adopted papa pierres suggestion and raised his own name to keep them together he had felt compelled to do this in order to use his influence as a priest of the inner circle would papa pierre please make this explanation to tinceau 

they had crossed the frontier into santo domingo to seek cattle for slaughter but the people had heard of their coming and had moved everything eatable the men were so reduced that he had stopped to give them rest in order to keep up their spirits he was giving a dance and women had come in from the neighborhood they had brought some vegetables and some rum but not nearly enough

he felt that he could hold them together he urged papa pierre to see tinceau at once to show him the letter and to assure him that the column would be there on time

the old man knew too much to write a reply he did not purpose to have his handwriting found on the dead body of his rival please make the explanation to tinceau that was funny he turned to the messenger and bade him to explain to maillard that he was about to start for the cures and that therefore he did not have time to write tell himâbut what the devil could he tell him 

the messenger protested that he must have a written answer maillard told him that he would give him the slow death if he failed to return with a written answer he fell on his knees before the priest and implored him piteously to write if it were only a line the attitude of the man his demonstration of terror of maillard fired the old mans jealousy of the younger rival

 who taught maillard  he asked severely

 you papa pierre

 who gave him his powers

 you papa pierre cried the man grovelling under the angry voice of the priest

 then stay right here in my house until i return you shall sec maillard suffer under my anger you will sec that he has no power but by me no harm shall come to you my son the old man gave him his benediction and the man rose with a resigned look on his face

the pack was ready the messenger had been sent to an outhouse to sleep and pierre louis was locking up the house when tinceau appeared before the door the priest merely remarked that the minister was an early riser for the flush in the east announced the appearance of day

 i received your note telling me that you would leave before daybreak he said  i must talk with you alone a while diane will wait wont you dear girl what a charming woman you have grown to be i tried to get out before evening came but i have had awful days pirot is doing all he can to upset our plans and he urges the president to keep the best troops here i have had a terrible day and the best i have been able to do is to have everything ready for a movement to gonaives or to st marc i tell you pirot is a great nuisance

 prove him a traitor and shoot him said the old man decisively as he struggled with an intractable padlock  that is the best recipe for those fancy mixed bloods or if you would like a little sugar for his coffee i have it right here

the priest was expeditious he wanted to get away he took a small package from the panier selected a little folded paper pnrcel and handed it to his visitor

 i have about concluded that maillard has proved false to us resumed tinceau hurriedly  he has the money and he has the troops and now i have news that he has proclaimed himself as a candidate for the presidency tinceau was greatly excited and the priest was quite calm as he replied persuasively  you are quite young dont be in too great a hurry if you can count on the accuracy of your news you must change your plans and stick to the president i am interested in you and you will thank me if you follow my advice are you sure that he has proclaimed in his own name

 there is no doubt of the accuracy of my report

then you must kill him too said the priest seriously you cannot become president now if he has done that you must get pirot out of the way as he is your natural enemy then you must kill maillard it will be better to kill him in battle defending the president that saves your hide from being riddled with government bullets for the chief will otherwise suspect because of your former plan of campaign you will have a chance another time i purpose to make you president

tinceau was frankly troubled

you advise the president to stay continued the priest earnestly

 tell him that your recent advices indicate port au prince to be maillards objective tell him to remain to look after the city and let you go to defend his person maillards men are dure to be hungry and tired you will have no trouble in defeating them but you must kill maillard or he will ruin all of us

the war minister accompanied the party a little way on the road talking over details with papa pierre diane and the man with the pack rode on ahead

 but meissner will be angry if the thing fail said tinceau  and besides you have not received your share of the money

 my dear tinceau i repeat that money is nothing to me said the priest  all i want is to be able to practice my religion in peace i did all i could for you but the situation is against you we fail this time but you will go up still higher in the estimation of the people you will lose nothing it is true that meissner will have lost some money but he loses to haãtiensâyou among them

tinceau left the party and went straight to the palace few officers were in sight he went upstairs the president was just coming from his morning bath

 president pardon my intrusion he said  but i could not wait your prudence and superior judgment in holding back orders have been justified the attack is to be made on port au prince i think i have intercepted a letter from maillard to pirot they tell me it is in cipher detailing plans but they have yet to make ut the destinataire i am sure of the attack on port au prince i ran up to tell you this and i will report definitely later if i can only get that letter clearly deciphered

the president only wrapped his bathrobe closer and he answered without the slightest change of countenance the troops are ready and so am i if that letter prove to be important let me see it and its translation if i agree with you as to the implication of pirot i will execute him at once as you go down tell the officer on guard that the barber may come up

tinceau looked for one of the officers of the guard none was in sight he heard the ringing of the telephone and went to the closet in which it hung he found pirots friend there just hanging up the receiver swearing because the telephone was out of order again

 where is the presidents barber  the minister asked the officer replied that the man had been there a moment ago they walked together until the barber was found

 now report with me at the gate said tinceau  you are under arrest

the young man turned pale recovered his selfcontrol in a moment md saluted he ungirted his sword and handed it to the war minister

alcide told his story hauffman sat silent smoking steadily and looking out into the darkness the boy told all that he had heard except the references to diane they were his affairsâand meissners

there was a characteristic medley of emotions depicted on hauffmans face as he smoked on and listened to the recitalâpaternal concern for the boy serious fears over the political revelation humorous appreciation of the choleramixture incident and of alcides dolorously dirty plight he snapped out short imperative interruptions between his pipepuffs but he really said nothing the burden of his thought was the political situation alcides eyes followed every turn of his patrons head waiting for him to pronounce himself hauffman thought on and on then turning suddenly on alcide he said with an affectionate sharpness  go and wash thyself i will come back

hauffman went downstairs to explain the situation to the members of his household who were greatly alarmed and sent the servants to bed allowing them to hold the impression that alcide was seriously ill

it was late towards morning when they separated hauffman had made him repeat the story of the cholera mixture and questioned him again and again as to his certainty that he had heard the name of tinceau the boy went to sleep and the diplomat went to his little den where he spent the remainder of the night studying papers bearing on the proposed german concession daybreak found him fresh and vigorous after his bath sitting on his balcony his coffee and big pipe before him for the first time in weeks alcide had the pleasure of serving him

he took his usual morning ride and then went to the palace he was so familiar with every detail of haãtien life that he took in at a glance any change from the routine whether public or private he saw at once that the president was not confining himself to merely offensive operations as had been reported throughout the city the little stoneandmud fortress to the south of the gate had two little viciouslooking rapidfiring guns mounted to command the entire block it was crowded with soldiers who were really actively moving about

at the gate was a uniformed mob of not less than five hundred men and their belts contained the full supply of cartridges the young colonel whom alcide had introduced to him was drilling a squad in openorder firing upon the knee hauffman waited until the young man noticed him they greeted each other pleasantly and the german complimented him on his work

 by the way said hauffman  i know that young officer there under guard i have met him at the house of minister pirot is he in disgrace

 he has been standing as you see him two hours or more replied the colonel  he was put under arrest personally by the minister of war he is an old friend of mine and one of our few welldrilled wellinformed officers he says that he knows of no charge against him none of us knows poor chap i would not give a fig for his chances of being alive an hour from now tinceau has evidently not had things all his own way and god help the man who crosses his path now

hauffman spoke with several others of the officers among whom he was a great favorite and then rode slowly up the carriageway to the palace entrance the little brass machine guns were no longer mere ornaments boxes of cartridges in all their disfiguring but businesslike rudeness were stowed behind the weapons broken and ready for use the work of polishing had been neglected this morning instead a man was carefully oiling the working parts and testing the movement of each the visitor watched the process while waiting to be announced but he was promptly admitted to the presence of the chief of state

 i am so glad to see you hauffman he said greeting the german cordially  i want to talk with you about the proposed concession in some way the thing is connected with conspiracies here in the capital and with uprisings in the north i cannot yet determine what the connection is but i want to repeat to you that the concession cannot be granted

 i did not come to talk about the concession said hauffman  i came to talk about something more important

 nothing else can be more important at this time said the president

 your life is said hauffman quietly the president looked him straight in the eye

 go on he said

 information has come to me warranting this statement to you by way of warning i shall mention no names i shall tell you what i think you should do you must make your own inferences first of all on no errand should you leave the capital until this trouble is over nor should you permit to leave your side those troops on whose efficiency and loyalty you can absolutely rely do not communicate to anyone that i have spoken to you on this subject as you might expose the person who is the source of my information

 excuse me a moment said the president he walked from one door to another and threw each wide open  come to the balcony your habit of speaking in a low tone of voice saved you from being overheard as a rule i prefer to let them hear one side plays against the other and i get the advantage of the result go on

 send out trusted men without the knowledge of any member of your cabinet to determine the precise position of the insurgents concentrate your light artillery at a convenient point to enfilade any road entering the city hold your best troops and plenty of them as your reserve and take command of them in person let the others go to meet the rebels their movements determined and thus hold the entrances until the batteries can be brought in you and your reserve can take hold of any movement which may be made in the capital itself it should be strong enough to take care of the rebels and the troops you send out if need be

 i cant express my gratitude said the president  will you answer one question is pirot behind this thing

 my opinion is that he is not was the germans prompt reply  i have no reason to suspect him i know him well i know that he is very grateful for the opportunities which you have opened up for him he is the last man i would believe guilty of such a thiriâ and besides with all the information which has come to me there is nothing which points to him as possibly implicated

the president looked over the grounds musingly his face ns calm ns if he were merely enjoying the view over the bay

 there is only one other man near me to suspect the others of my cabinet are mere figureheads said the president musingly

 general i beg you not to mention names to me protested hauffman  my purpose in coming is to warn you i answered your question concerning pirot simply because silence on my part might have done him the injustice to impel your suspicion

they talked on earnestly the president repeating charges of ingratitude against pirot and hauffman warmly defending the haãtien diplomat the president bluntly told the german that pirot would be arrested and probably executed if a cipher letter from the insurgent leader maillard should inculpate the minister for foreign affairs

 that would be murder exclaimed hauffman  pirot wants to make money but he is not in this thing take my word for it it appears that i know more about the affair than you do have you ordered his arrest  he asked this question suddenly for the thought had just occurred to him

 no he is not under arrest said the president  but he is under close surveillance i promise you this he shall not be touched until i shall have shown you the proofs and satisfied you of his guilt

 i thank you cried hauffman he shook hands hurriedly and darted out of the room to hide his weakness

as he went out of the grounds he remarked that the young man whom he had met under arrest had gone soldiers were lying around some sleeping and others gambling but weapons of all kinds were in evidence and there was no mistaking the nature of the preparations he decided to go home to be near his family instead of spending the day at the legation the thought of pirots fate unnerved him and his active imagination pictured his friend in all sorts of ghastly shapes filled with gaping wounds he had the presidents promise he could rely on that

as he approached his garden gate a carriage stopped and a young man alighted just as he came up

 i am looking for the residence of the german minister said the newcomer  will you kindly tell me whether i have come to the right place 

 i have the honor to be the german minister said hauffman pleasantly  how can i serve you 

 i bring a letter of introduction from the german consul at la guayra was the reply  i believe that he is a friend of yours hauffman recognized the handwriting and invited the young man to the house

 so you are an american journalist said hauffman smiling  i have met several correspondents here are you on your way north 

yes and no replied the reporter i was down in venezuela during the revolution fine country venezuela i had enough of it however when the war closed hard work and plenty of it it was while doing this work that i met your friend he is an active man at la guayra and he has done a great deal for german commerce then i was ordered back to new york i came up by way of the leeward islands picking up materials for magazine articles

 it must be very fascinating work for an unmarried man remarked the minister

yes it isâvery said the young man enthusiastically but it is not appreciated the men who stay at home have the inside unless something unusual turns up off the earth somewhere all of us who were in venezuela will have to hustle to get regular work even on our own papers i am getting tired of it i was about to say that i was in martinique picking up snakestories a former chicago reporter made himself and the snakes famous by writing them up the stories sell well first because they are snakestories the snake has an attraction for all human beings eveiy religion must have its snake somewhere in its bible then the martinique snakestories sell well in the united states because they are particularly horrible

hauffman was deeply interested in the readiness with which his visitor made himself at home  i shall be glad to see your article when it is printed mr wiley he remarked

 you shall mr minister you shall cried the young man warmly  well while there he resumed  i had a telegram to change my route and come over here to look up an uprising which was threatened do you know anything about it

hauffman answered promptly he knew that a moments delay would make the keen searcher for news follow him with questions day and night he smiled inwardly at the sudden and adroit directness of the question but he answered at once

 i know that many arrests have been made and that some troops have been sent off to the north the city is full of rumors you must have heard them if you hear anything definite you must share with me you know my work makes me a correspondent too how long have you been here 

 yes i have heard rumors i came by the ville de tangiers just had time to telegraph from martinique to la guayru for this introduction to you but i want a story something definite cant yon tell me something about the german concession 

the details have been reported faithfully by your legation here and the facts given out by your state department at washington said hauffman the haãtien congress is now in session debating the proposition i can give you news however and you may quote me the president says that he will oppose to the last any change in the constitution to help this concession

 thanks said wiley in the disgust of disappointment  that is news in haãti it would go for a halfstickful in new york what i want is a story yoq see in answer to your first question if i cannot get any stories ill go north by the dutch steamer if there be any good ones in sight i stay it a battle likely  are troops in motion 

 it is hard to say what will happen next in this country replied hauffman

 well how about a good voudou story eating babies and all that sort of thingâthe goat without horns why they just revel in that sort of thing up north  our special correspondent at port an prince and the loup garou and that sort of thing you know cant you give me a story about human sacrifices and that sort of thing we have the cuts already in the office

hauffman felt very relieved when a carriage drove in at this remark serving to check what would have been an indignant reply he took advantage of the interruption to arise and await the arrival of the carriage an ordinary public  bus a lady decently dressed stepped out paid the driver and said that he need not return for her she asked for the german minister

 i have the honor to be the german minister said hauffman with quiet courtesy  please come up how can i serve you

she walked to the balcony with a pretty mincing step and took a chair at some distance from hauffman she threw back her veil which covered her eyes and looked straight at him

 dont you remember me  she asked sweetly

hauffman was plainly embarrassed that he could not recognize her and he began talking about his wretched eyesight he was interrupted by uproarious laughter from the dainty one with the mincing step

 one on you old man she laughed

 thunder pirot cried hauffman rushing to him and grasping his hand

 only pirot and a refugee taking asylum in your house

 you know that my government docs not countenance this application of the doctrine of extraterritoriality said hauffman severely holding pirots hand all the while

 yes and i know that your government will not order you to turn me out of doors to be shot down like a dog said the refugee with composure

 well how did you manage it  said hauffman in his excitement he entirely forgot the presence of his other visitor

 i have been under the eyes of spies and a victim of lies said pirot  i took precaution to be well informed i have known more or less the charges which have been made against me and the attitude of the president this morning the order to arrest me was proposed to the president and he promised to consider it they probably would have sent me to kingdom come without a chance to bid you goodby so i decided to make you a call it may turn out to be a long visit

 but how did you manage these clothes your mustache gone as if it had never grown asked hauffman with increasing interest

 i must thank heloise for all that she and i are the same size nearly you know and our complexions arc about the same she has done it all and for weeks she has had this dress wigâthe whole outfit âready in her wardrobe i let her have her way and rather enjoyed the masquerade and the fun of being laced and fitted up by her at intervals we had lots of sport out of the thing but when my feminine wardrobe was once complete i forgot it but she and i thought of it at the same moment this morning i tell you 

 but how did you escape the spies 

 it was very simple as she arranged it the signal came over the telephone early this morning it told me that my arrest might be ordered at any moment i was shaving upstairs but i heard the signals heloise answered the rings later my informant was arrested

 most women would have fainted said hauffman

 not a bit of that in her said the haãtien with enthusiasm

 she just marched upstairs and told me to shave off my mustache and i whipped it off i tell you she has a dress just like the one she made for me she put that on and then began to fix me up she put the wig on me and the hat and filled my face with powder till she choked meâjust as all the women pile it on here she buckled me up in this infernal corset while i held up my arms to make myself as small as possible around the waist and then she put on the dress she told me to wait while she went to the balcony she called a servant and sent him for a carriage she spoke in a loud tone of voice bidding him hurry as she did not have time to wait for our carriage to be hitched up she came in the carriage came up i stepped out in the teeth of the spies and we drove off

 that was splendid cried hauffman  but you have been a long time getting here

 yes i did not trust myself to drive through the city i went out into the country towards the plains then i came back and went around to the petioville road and cut across to turgeau i took my time as i did not expect to catch you at home for heavens sake let me wash off this powder and get out of these corsets and wigs and things i have suffered enough for my country

 capital cried wiley  capital sir mr pirot oh i know you sure to have your picture among our cuts every cabinet officer in the world we have there you can gamble on that great story clean scoop goodby gentlemen excuse me ill see you later this must be on the wire before two oclock gad what a beat and the correspondent darted down the garden path

meissners trip to jacmel on the little french steamer the ville de tangiers was a joyous yet restful experience after the excitement of his political scheming and active lobbying at the capital the officers on board and the merchants at the ports all were eager to show their appreciation of the most hearty entertainer in all haãti

koffel the german consular agent at jacmel received him cordially and the little foreign colony immediately set itself to planning entertainments in his honor there was to be a ball of course and as they sat in the soft evening air planning the entertainments between the hands of a game of poker somebody proposed a bachelor dinner immediately a thought came to meissner he would prepare a surprise for them he would have diane dance

the more he thought of it the more it pleased him he had not had a real german debauch in a long while he would take the servants into his confidence secrete diane in the house and have her come out and dance in the height of the fun he expressed such interest in the dinner suggestion as to assure its adoption and resumed his activity in the game all were enjoying their peaceful recreation after the hard work of the day when they were interrupted by the cry of fire

the players dropped their cards no other danger carries such universal dread in haãti as that of fire it is the forerunner of revolution the opportunity of robbers and assassins the paralyzer for the time of honest human activity each man had his own place of business in mind and all started downstairs in a rush on reaching the street three shots were heard fired in a rapid but distinct succession that meant serious trouble and at koffels suggestion they returned for revolvers meissner went on unarmed

he had gone only a few feet when he met papa pierre the priest seemed anxious to avoid meeting people and he drew meissner to the shadow of a balcony on the other side of the street men and women were rushing wildly in the direction of the blaze along the lateral streets and stumbling over those leading up the steep hillside pierre louis hurriedly told meissner that there was no danger that the blaze had been all arranged

 what devilment are you up to now demanded meissner  that you should want to scare people out of their boots 

 you see it looked as though the general of arrondissement here proposed to make some kind of movement of troops i did not know what he wanted to do in the face of this panic he will stay right here this fire will do no harm and the three shots were fired by men who made off to the woods immediately we may be sure that the general will remain at his post

 you would die if you could not intrigue said meissner laughing  where is diane   she is here and crazy to see you said pierre louis  but you must not have her come to youânot yet you must go to her we have a safe cosey rendezvous i will let you know in the morning

meissner joined the crowd of people who were making their way up the hillside he did not look for his friends as he knew that they had gone to protect their stores he observed that the fire had been set to leeward where the prevailing nightwind would really protect the town with the whole caribbean to draw upon there was not a public firepump in the place he forced himself through the crowd and saw that there was no danger

he passed within arms length of diane but did not see her she saw him however and kept within reach he looked on while the excited haãtiens fought the fire in their awkward fashion and then decided to hunt up his friends there seemed no possibility of returning through the streets by which he had come for the crowd grew more compact every moment men women and children attracted by the excitement could scarcely move he decided on a detour he worked his way past the fire easily and as he moved around the outskirts he gave himself up to the wild beauty of the place the town and the port at his feet silent in the soft and clear tropical moonlight for the time he thought of nothing his feelings were purely the rapturous response of sense he had gone some distance from the fire in the direction of the wind a blaze broke in on his abstraction a small isolated hut was on fire

mechanically he quickened his pace and with accustomed skill picked his way to the wretched little shanty sparks from the other fire had caught on the dry palmthatch it was a pretty sight he remarked to himself on approaching as he watched the dried leaves so skilfully interwoven to resist rain and sun twist and crackle into flame freeing themselves into fluffy flakes of fire to be carried off into the air along the mountain side the rude rafters were beginning to expose themselves and the edges of timber were beginning to blaze when a woman dashed by him shrieking and burst into the burning hut

surprised for the moment he stood still then he went rapidly forward no human being could live long in that place he heard no sound from within he dashed through the blazing doorway the stinking smoke both blinded and suffocated him where was the fool of a woman he stumbled over something it was a human body he grasped it and dragged it out into the footway how grateful was the fresh air the woman quickly revived

 my child  she cried  my poor child 

 where  demanded meissner and without waiting for a reply he dashed into the flaming hut again

he knew the structure of these houses he had slept in them too often not to know where the woman had probably left her child when attracted by the big fire in his rush he went straight through the burning partition to the inner room of the cabin god what a heat how the smoke stung the nostrils and throat he was growing faint he had gone to the wrong corner for the child he must try again he had it its little bare body had not been burned he turned to get out he could not go back as he had come he could kick out the side of the house why had he not thought of that before he had lost his strength he kicked he was falling to die like this he raised his foot he heard his name  meissner meissner it was the voice of diane was he going mad he answered feebly he kicked again and fell headlong through the side into the burning trash holding the limp body of the child at arms length that it might not be crushed

diane blindly followed the voice and fell in a heap over him her skirts ablaze she was on her feet at once and with magnificent strength dragged him and the child beyond the danger line the woman ran to them

 my child my child she cried wildly  does it live

take your cursed brat shrieked diane you have killed my man

and there alone with him on the hillside she cared for him tenderly he was breathing in feeble and short gasps she tore away the charred pieces of clothing and saw that the shoulder whose skin was as soft and white as a womans bore an ugly mark running down the arm to the elbow she raised his head and gently placed it on her thigh she felt so helpless the  cures were no good here what a humbug the magic of the ouanga was after all how she hated it all alcide was right alcide she must not think of him he was so good and people had told him that she was bad bad bad and then the shock of tension suddenly relaxed quite overcame her she sobbed out her excess of feeling and covered meissners unconscious face with hysterical kisses

as consciousness slowly came to him he felt the keen pure air cutting its way into his lungs and then a great dreamy relaxation a desire to sleep overcame him he heard his name it was the voice of diane again he heard his own voice murmur a reply was he dying was this the death of suffocation he had always heard that it was painless even pleasant but he felt no pain from the burning he tried to rise he could not move a muscle then he began to think more consciously he saw clearly and recognized the lovely hillside the smouldering hut the little french steamer riding at anchor the fading glare in the distance and the murmur of the crowd

he looked up into the face of diane it was she and no disordered image it was she and she was kissing him with an abandon she had never shown before

he stretched out his arms and drank in more air he was safe in her arms too weak to raise himself he tried to speak but the words seemed crushed with soot and they stuck in his throat she was rocking his head gently and stroking his face and humming a curious crooning song it was very grateful in his helpless condition the touch of this strong magnetic woman

he felt himself completely under the spell of her presence he felt his strength rapidly returning he knew that he was not seriously hurt she pressed her finger firmly and gently on the artery near his throat and noted eagerly the uniform improvement in the strength and regularity of pulsation she saw that he was conscious and that he was observing her closely she drew back within herself she shrank instinctively from revealing herself to him she became quite calm she kissed his check gently and smoothed the hair from his brow

 diane yon have saved my life he said at last with effort  how can i thank you 

 i saved my own she said smiling  if you had died i would have swallowed the quick death you are all i have

 but you do not love me he said

she looked deep into his eyes a hunted searching look her face betrayed to him her doubt her absolute uncertainty of herself for the moment candor an uncivilized directness and simplicity was among the great charms which she had for meissner and after his own misgivings and perplexities concerning their future he readily understood her feeling

 it is true that i did not love she said finally  but nowâwon now i dont know when i saw you in the crowd i followed you i was right behind you yet i did not know whether to call you or not i was not sure of you or myself then when i saw you bring out that woman and go back for the child i felt differently i wanted to be with you in the fire you are a brave man

he felt flattered by what she said in her simple way yet he did not want her to fall in love with him it was a mental struggle between his desire to free himself and his love of the chase

 but you loved alcide he persisted  you have really loved him while you have been placãe with me

 yes i loved him that is true but i have left him behind you are all i have left when you go back to germany i will kill myself wtien i came to you i left alcide behind it is all so different and you do not love me as you will love a german woman

she said it all very calmly but he felt a desire to get out of it all she was submitting to him an analysis he could not stand that he looked out over the quiet bay and wondered what he should say it was a perfect panorama and the little french steamer lay quietly where he left her the messenger to the outside world he loved so how could civilized men be contented here how different that world she could not share it even though it were possible to ask her to do so she could barely read and write though she spoke the patois with such picturesque simplicity she scarcely knew french what right had she to reproach him to compare herself with german women he had bought her and paid well for her he had been generous with herâlavish even she had accepted the bargain even though she had maintained her absurdly virtuous attitude how did she differ from other haãtien women what idiocy to talk about suicide she could not reproach him with having wronged her he had humored her notions and amused himself watching her learn things a strong feeling of resentful irritability took hold of him yet beneath it was i he consciousness that he was not entirely satisfied with himself

you may have deceived yourself he heard himself say but i have not deceived myself you have loved that boy alcide from childhood you love him now you and i have had some good times together and we will have more of them but some day you will be placãe with alcide and you will be very happy though the deep waters be between us i shall never let you want for anything

his gaze was on the little french steamer and his heart on the weird scene in which he was defying the promptings of his better nature how he despised himself he himself it was who had pursued the girl he who had tried to betray her through the influence of pierre louis instead of meeting a mistress he had found a woman making the vital sacrifice for the man she loved she was a womanâ he had to confess itâa bigger woman than he had ever dreamed of finding her he did not look at her but he felt from sheer sympathy the shock of pain he was causing her she said with a quiet intensity  you do not mean what you say you hope for it because you would not care you know alcide and you know me he would never be placã with any woman he thought of me as you foreigners think of your women i promised to become placãe with you to save him i told you and you were good to me i am not bad but people think me bad and they will tell him he will never look at me you are all i have and some day we must leave each other

on that same deck he thought this same question had forced itself upon him and here was this crude unlettered woman reading his very soul as though it were an open book if she would only accuse him and rail at him he might get angry and answer her in kind if she would only threaten him as she with the resources of pierre louis could threaten he could defy her and leave her but she clung to him  how could he throw her off with twenty thousand marks a year he would be able to go by that steamer and leave haãti forever could he forget her would her dead face haunt him through life he had not harmed the girl how could he reproach himself for what people thought of her own voluntary act 

 diane why borrow trouble he asked  we are happy together why look into the future 

 because now i know why i was sent to the president pierre louis has told me about your big machines which you will buy for haãti and you will make money and go home and forget me then i must die for i am already tired of the dances and the cures you will go and there will be nobody else

 there is alcide who worships you he said with relentless cruelty and for the want of anything else to say

 i am a different woman in these weeks i know so many things which i did not know before so long as you are with me i shall like them for you taught me to like them when you go though somebody else should offer me dresses and jewelry and wines and gay nights i shall not want them i shall be tired of them too they would not be the same without you

he was sitting at her side now holding her hands he looked steadily over the bay at the little ship the sign and token of his life that was to be he could not bear to look at her face the thought of another man offering her what he was giving her stirred him deeply in his vanity over the appearance of conquest he had allowed his friends to believe her his mistress he could have protected her in the beginning in his heart he respected the simple beauty of her character he felt so small before her when he thought that to save the man she loved she had made the greatest sacrifice possible in human experience that of the loved ones esteem and respect she detested pierre louis and she was tired of the charlatanism she was right he was all that was left to her she had thought it all out too yes almost all of his friends would be rivals jumping at the chance to teach her all the refinements of civilized vice he knew that she would not be placãe with any other man

she had drawn up her knee and was leaning forward her chin supported by the palm of her handâher accustomed attitude when thinking seriously or deeply moved he sat by her side tracing out line by line the curves of her body always marvellously beautiful to him her neck a powerful column was exposed to him by the turn of her head he looked a moment longer and then buried his lips in the firm resisting throat

she did not respond to the unfamiliar caress he was disappointed the abandon of grief which she had shown while he lay half unconscious there would have its corresponding feeling he thought if he should appeal to it instead she threw her arm about him in a tender clinging way and looked him straight in the face he could not help looking at her now that strained sad yet resigned expression had a terrible fascination for him he was in an inextricable position what could he say she came to his relief

 it is getting chilly she said  and you must be careful and not be sick after what has passed we had better go dont fail to cover jour shoulder well take this shawl

he rose as she did it was with a helpless guilty feeling that he did so the fire was out the little streets were deserted on the outside of the town a few soldiers cried their  qui vive  but the streets of jacmel were not infested by the noisy guardians of the public peace who make life in port au prince a burden the hut the scene of the rescues was ashes and a few coals

hand in hand they walked he leading her down the mountain path as though this were her first experience in haãtien footways it never occurred to him to be other than polite to a woman whatever her station but he felt particularly deferential to diane now he could have protected her if he had believed her capable of remaining faithful to her black lover was she about to fall in love with him he did not want that now she had not lived with him and yet he let the world believe her to be his mistress they walked on silently he was at high tension with excitement and the burden of helplessness before this strong nature disgust with himself which he could generally so easily subdue his man of the world mastered him for once they came to a street leading up and along the mountain side

 i am living here goodnight she said

stop he said fervently is that all will you not kiss me shall we not make an appointment for tomorrow 

she smiled as he kissed her and she told him to come during the day as she was making the cures at night and she did not know but that the president would come ahead of time

 and i want to send up some wines and other nice things said meissner  you must tell me too the name of the people with whom you are stopping and i want to bring some friends for a gros bouillon we must have a good time while we are here diane

 you know that i am ready for anything with you she said  but you must promise me one thing

 why certainly what is it

 you must tell me beforeâlong time beforeâwhen you make up your mind to go

 i promise he said

 then you have not made up your mind yet she asked timidly

no you goose she kissed him heartily and told him that she would look for him

he held her back he drew her to him and kissed her lips again she tapped his cheek in coquettish reproof and disappeared in the shadow of the houses

as he turned to go home a woman stopped him he turned on her with an angry exclamation she had seen him caress diane

 i only want to thank you mshay she said shrinking from him it was the mother of the rescued child

 did the child live he asked eagerly

 yes mshay and mshay saved him mshay brav blanc li she said with such genuine gratitude that he wanted to make amends for his rudeness of a moment before

will mshay accept this it is very little but it is from my grangran and it is all i have i give it to you because it has no price it was blessed by the papaloi

it was a dagger sheathed he did not examine it he merely remarked that it was very heavy he protested that she should not give away a heritage from her grandparents but he soon saw that to refuse the gift would wound her deeply so he thanked her and told her to bring their baby to see him at the german consuls at mr koffels private house the next morning

he walked slowly home trying to think it all out he decided to consult papa pierre the old man could engage the girl in some of his ambitious schemes and perhaps she would not take the prospect of this separation so seriously

the house was still brightly lighted the servants said that the gentlemen had not returned he took the news gladly and hurried to his room

he stripped and examined the burn thoroughly it would leave a bad scar but it was not serious he applied a soothing mixture and put on his pyjamas he stretched out on a lounge under a lamp and tried to read nothing interested him

then the men came in all were intent on the discussion of the probable cause of the fire meissner did not want any of that talk and decided to remain quiet in his room koffel was the last to come unbelting his revolver and laying it on the table he remarked that it would be wise to remain awake until morning he had been investigating the men who probably had set the blaze had made off up the mountain side they must have come from the dances in the woods they could not have known jacmel well or they would have started the fire at the other end of the town

 do you think we had better stand by the stores asked one

 no answered koffel  we have reliable people stationed around we need only to be ready in case there is another alarm

somebody suggested that they resume their game they called for beer and cold luncheon and took their seats

 wheres meissner  asked koffel

 here i am he called out  i might have dropped overboard and you would not have missed me had you stayed away from the pokertable

he came out laughing heartily the prospect of having something to do until morning was a relief

hauffman settled himself at the porch table to enjoy as usual his pipe and his early morning reflections he noticed that the waiterbov served the coffee he asked for alcide the boy had not seen him a strict disciplinarian hauffman gulped down his coffee impatiently and sent the boy to find the derelict favorite he reached for his pipe which had been set at the centre of the table under it lay an envelope addressed to himself he opened it hurriedly his fears anticipating its contents dear minister please pardon my going without asking your permission i am going to do my duty i am a haãtien and i belong at my post if i live through the battle i trust that you will take me back

 your affectionate and obedient  alcide

hauffman read and reread the little simple note and smoked furiously presently pirot came down kauffman heard him splashing in the swimmingpool and his goodhumor annoyed him when pirot came out he joined hauffman at the table to take his coffee the boy served him

 where is alcide asked pirot

 gone to be a soldier damn him snapped hauffman pulling away at his big pipe the haãtien saw that it would not be prudent to push inquiries for the present

infernal ass schafskopf muttered hauffman instinctively pirot remained silent that hauffman might work off his fit

 not a cowardly bone in his body sentimental jackass sure to be shot full of holes pirot knew that the young man had acted simply in accord with hauffmans teachings but this was not the moment to remind him of the fact

 under the protection of the legation too i registered him myself last week not a sound from pirot only the chirping of birds and the rippling of the mountain streams and the voices of the refugees in the grasspiece and the whiffwhiff from hauffmans pipe

 going after him legation registration must be respected and the german minister purple with excitement was not a very dignified figure as he pounded away into the house and up the stairs in bathrobe and felt slippers

pirot hastened to his room to dress that he might be ready to watch developments if there was to be a promiscuous street firing it would be dangerous to go in search of the boy as wiley had remarked the haãtien bullet has no respect for the person of the german minister when he returned he found hauffman in boots and spurs ready to start but seated on the porch mrs hauffman at his side talking quietly the face of the old soldier had an obstinate set but the hands belied it they were hanging limp between his legs most eloquent in their irresoluteness

 i have suggested to the minister she said turning to pirot  that he wait until the clerks shall have opened the consulate general

he can then learn precisely what is going on in the city do you not think so

pirot did agree with her heartily but she knew that she did not need his support to convince hauffman the german gave way with poor grace and immediately began to torture the switchman at the central telephone station of course nobody had arrived at the consulate he had little to say as he chafed under the delay then he went off to the stable to look after his horse he trusted nobody but alcide and himself to girth a saddle for him

it was only a minute or two after eight oclock when he received an answer from the consulate there had been a general jail deliver the political prisoners had all found refuge there had been a short panic but order had been restored the president had taken charge of the streets in person and more than one hundred men were already reported deadâkilled on sight they were rapidly rounding up the liberated criminals several of these had been shot also tinceau had won a decisive victory the night before and had expected to capture the fleeing rebels at daybreak

at this moment wiley the tireless correspondent trotted up the garden path he had seen the entire military movement and was impatient to get to the telegraph office as he took his coffee he told how tinceau had beaten back the rebels by moonlight slept in the woods and captured all the enemy at daybreak

 the end was most dramatic he said  nothing but a shot from one of the government rifles saved tinceaus life by a clever bit of night scouting tinceau located the enemy and he surprised them just at dawn before they were thoroughly awake the rebel pickets gave the alarm but he was on their heels with his entire force

 so they were captured without a struggle exclaimed pirot  now people will know from maillards own lips whether i had any understanding with him

 no maillard was killed in a duel with tinceau as each saw the other about the same time they drew and fell to fighting furiously calling each other  trompeur and traitre in a way that bespoke deadly personal hatred neither handled his sword very well but both were giants in strength the soldiers of both sides stopped fighting and crowded around to see the duel

 haãtians do not want to fight one another if they can avoid doing so observed pirot

 maillard was the stronger and he forced the fighting tinceau cautiously retreating stumbled maillard would have run him through but a shot from the government side broke the rebels swordarm tinceaus men rushed forward to seize him when he drew his revolver with his left hand and killed himself

the group on the porch were excitedly talking over wileys report and hauffman had even delayed his start for town to hear it

 where is alcide  nsked wiley as he noticed the servingboy pirot explained

 i shall go dear said hauffman turning to his wife he had repeated sentence for sentence the telephone message he held her hand a moment in a shy surreptitious way and walked quickly to his horse wiley mounted too and they paced briskly down to the road gate mrs hauffman went to the telephone and called up the legation the attach happened to be early at his desk and answered in person

 please mount at once she said  and go to meet the minister in the champs de mars he has just started down dont fail to take the national colors with you please let there be no delay

through the dreadful night of suspense alcide had not slept he had put out his light and watched over the city expecting at any moment to see the capital burst into flames he had heard the firing on chemin lalue early in the evening and the comments which the gentlemen had made concerning the attack but the night had been quiet enough a painful contrast to the storm of questionings which convulsed him occasionally an irresponsible shot was fired and all through the city the wind carried the shrill tones of the  qui vive but there was no exciting incident it was evident that the government troops had checked the advance of the rebels

no bitterness of material warfare however could approach the moral struggle through which he was passing if he could only get to jacmel he should now be at his post any excitement would be welcome now that he could get no news of diane but that should not be his motive mere thirst for excitement at the moment of general alarm his place was at the front to defend the national government the minister was right and diane would wait for him pierre louis might drive him from his house but he could not drive him from her heart

how beautiful she was and how she clung to him and begged him to kiss her he would make a home for her he would convince her of the folly of the priestess quackery meissner had called her a jewel and had said that her time was his she would never forsake the playmate of her childhood for a foreigner no foreigner could love her as he loved her dear diane what a child she was if he could only know what she was doing at jacmel

and if he should go to his post he might attract the attention of the president and be promoted he might have a chance to carry out some of the reforms which he had planned for haãti and papa pierre would have to admit that he was a true haãtien and diane would love him all the more if she could see him do great things how he despised these politicians what a mockery to die fighting for them at the moment of the general alarm your place is at the front to defend the national government he made a light and wrote u note to tell the minister his decision

diane had looked so pained when papa pierre had called him no haãtien she must have learned since that he had served in the ranks and that he had gone to prison for doing his duty he had arranged the ministers cup and pipe and had left the house noiselessly and was now cautiously making his way down the turgeau road if she could see him now actually stealing away to do his duty they must marry as soon as this trouble should be over he was so sure of her trust in him he would not let her deny him he would kneel at her side and plead with her until she would give up that ouanga for the great love she bore him

 qui vive  he had stumbled on a new outpost

 haãtien replied alcide calmly

 au poste  muttered the sentry he walked over to the post and saluted the officer in command

 where are you going  demanded that bundle of decorations

 i am on my way to my post it is at the glacierre replied alcide

 you lie said the officer on general principles

 if i wanted to escape duty i should the other way

 all right said the officer convinced by the argument  dont go through the city they are shooting all delinquents on sight

the warning came at a good moment it was easy to go off to the right and pass by the petit four to make a complete detour of the city he passed along the road rapidly for the earlymorning air was uncomfortably chill to one who had not slept his heart was thumping with excitement as at short intervals he heard small volleys in the city

he was passing the house of an english resident a frequent visitor at the house of the german minister a great british ensign floated lazily over the roof there he would be safe why not enter and remain until after the fighting if diane should see him now hesitating before a foreign flag she would remember all of papa pierres bitter reproaches

he hurried past the house by the post marchand where he was recognized and allowed to pass on back again through bel air road to avoid the builtup portions of the city and after a short turn by the hotel de france to the extreme north of the bord de la mer near the post of the glacierre where he belonged before the minister had arranged the registration a cloud of dust and the noise of the trumpets and drums announced the approach of the president officers were shouting their orders and troops were running out to receive the chief of state alcide wanted to join the line which was forming he ran towards the military post to secure a gun an officer stopped him

 where are you going  he demanded

 to the post to get my gun

you lie you were about to run you ought to have reported last night

 you saw the direction in which i was going answered alcide hotly

 insolent go ahead of my horse you are under arrest

the president had arrived he was consulting with the officer in command two ragged blacks stood by looking sullenly at the ground

 who are they  asked the president

 two criminals who escaped when the enemy liberated the political prisoners your excellency

 execute them

the condemned were backed to the side of the street and a firing party told off for each

whom have we here asked the president as alcide approached ahead of his captor

 a vile haãtien who has learned french to insult his superiors your excellency i stopped him as he was about to desert

 execute him

the words came to alcide as though from a great distance the quick movement of things had benumbed every nerve of sense and action what had happened  would he awaken and find himself safe at the ministers house

the preparation for the execution of the two criminals brought him to his senses they faced the soldiers with a stolid sullenness

fire

alcide was thoroughly awake now one of the men was apparently dead the other seemed to be in great pain he raised himself on his elbow and beckoned for an officer to come and end his agony a young lieutenant sprang forward and drove his sword into the breast of the criminal he turned to the president and saluted

 brav gaãon murmured the chief of state

 it is a brutal outrage it is violence to every human right a terrified silence followed alcides ringing protest

 you speak french my fine haãtien said the president looking intently at the boy who was trembling with passion before him  the patois of your fathers was not good enough for you you vile deserter

shoot the deserter cried the soldiers taking their cue from the officers vive le president vive la republique a bas la revolution

 execute him repeated the president quietly he started down the street followed by his troop of aides and cavalry and the infantry from the palace guard and discords of drums and trumpets

the eyes of the crowd followed the movements of the president alcide saw nothing one word with diane before dying she must not remember him as a deserter the humiliation was maddening he must live

he made a dash for life the noise of the firing and the pingping of the bullets gave him wings he seemed scarcely to touch the ground as he sped on the soldiers in full cry as he reached the bureau du port he ran straight on dodging around the head of hauffmans horse he heard his name but he thought he had been headed off he recovered his balance and dashed down the long wharf the troops were on him he leaped into the water the foul sticky mud made underwater swimming impossible he raised his head for more breath

how they missed the target the bullets struck all around him but not one touched him were they really trying to miss him to die like this diane he was a deserter papa pierre he must have more breath he raised his head escaped another shower of bullets and rolled over under the water again how the vile mud stank

hauffman was at his heels and leaped from his horse

 no you dont cried wiley kicking off his shoes  undignified for you my job you stop the damned firing im off

hauffman wheeled and ordered the soldiers to cease firing when he returned again towards the water he saw two figures rise to the surface exchange violent blows and disappear he dismounted to join in the rescue but wileys form soon appeared he was holding the limp body of alcide and confidently making for the shore

news travelled slowly from the capital to the south coast and the regular couriers who brought the routine mails to jacmel were almost overtaken by the express messengers sent out to announce the defeat of revision and the downfall of the german syndicate meissners disappointment bore down heavily upon him he had spent a considerable sum of other peoples money on the working up of the scheme he was mixed up with the conspiracies in the capital too and that relationship might cause his expulsion from the country any day

he had talked the whole question over with papa pierre the priest could give him but little explanation he believed that their scheme had failed because the president had refused to leave the capital beyond that he could explain nothing there had been no hope of success unless diane had succeeded in drawing the old man away

if he had come to the dance and the cures as he had promised diane to do revision would now be a fact and tinceau president of haãti just what had induced tinceau to run to cover as he clearly had done nobody had as yet explained

by the way what about maillard asked meissner if you feel sure of tinceaus change of front i trust that maillard was warned in time

oh i did not tell you purred the priest my memory gets worse and worse as i get older just before i left port au princei i heard that maillard had raised his own name in the interior and that he proposed to make himself president tinceau was about to investigate when i left

 odd trick for him to play on our money said meissner  and you had such confidence in him too

yes it was my dear very odd i did have confidence still ambition is a canker which breeds on the conscience of men and that consumed eats on to their destruction i merely suspend judgment tinceau will find out will determine what course is best to bo pursued with reference to maillard

meissner had not mentioned the matter again to the priest he was a good loser and there was little change in his demeanor he apparently enjoyed the various entertainments prepared in his honor and if he could have been persuaded to get out of his martyr mood he would have admitted that he had entered into them with his accustomed vim with his intimate friends he had entered upon a course of dissipation but little short of luxurious all of this gayety centred on diane it was she who did the entertaining and it was she who made the punches she had indeed been an apt pupil her unusual beauty and her quick wit her taste in selecting her gowns and her stylo of wearing them were the admiration of the foreign colony this appealed to the vanity of meissner and excited the envy of the native girls of jacmel

so the time had passed with him while he awaited the arrival of the dutch steamer from curagoa he was impatient to get back to port au prince to have an explanation from tinceau his engagements would not permit him to gain time by going overland even if he had not been too lazy to make the trip in the saddle he did not expect that skilful politician to commit himself to writing the bachelor dinner was to be the last of the entertainments and he had looked forward to it with most pleasurable anticipation the announcement of the death of the presidents son caused a postponement until after the day fixed for the funeral but it was not a thing to be missed and he was glad that all insisted upon having it

knowing that the greater part of the afternoon would be devoted to preparations for the feast meissner decided not to remain at the house after the early breakfast he bade his friends not to expect him at noon as he had another engagement he spent the entire day with diane since the news of the defeat of the revision had been communicated to her by papa pierre there had been a great change in the girl her moods of wistfulness and abstraction did not come to her she was as lighthearted as a child and delighted with everything

he remarked the change but he did not take the trouble to analyze the cause of it he was inwardly dejected and continually bored with the necessity of appearing indifferent it was enough that diane asked no questions that she was always cheerful and bright and glad on seeing him she was his salvation in these days he often remarked to to himself this morning on his arrival after the early breakfast she was absorbed in her work upon a filmy silk which she had decided to wear in her dance at the bachelors banquet he was not permitted to examine it at every approach he was driven away with an exaggerated cry of alarm he understood that he was to let her alone that he was to know nothing about it and that when it should be spread before him he was to make a great show of surprise and admiration

so he idled away the morning reading magazines which he had sent up from koffels talking with dianeâalways at a respectful distance from the gownâsmoking and otherwise doing his utmost to get away from the persistent burden of his own thoughts the defeat of his project he thought meant years more of this hell of waiting he could not content himself as his friends seemed to content themselves setting aside a few thousand marks a year squeezed out in the handling of coffee and drafts yet wait he must or return to the drudgery of a desk in hamburg this he would never do he must wait that was all and papa pierre said that only gods know how to wait and in waiting he must make himself as comfortable as possible he looked into the adjoining room of the cabin diane was still bending over her finery as busy as a child with a new toy

his reflections and his struggle to get away from them were interrupted by the call to the midday breakfast his own boy had prepared it and diane had already acquired the art of presiding at a meal only a few weeks before he had taught her her forks and now he watched her admiringly as she directed the boy whom he had trained thoroughly he marvelled at the adaptability of the woman the ease with which she made it all natural to her at that rude table in the unfinished cabin the arrangement of linen and silver and glass was all that could be required by even his fastidious taste

he slept after breakfast as was his custom and on awakening he found the fluff of silk ready for his admiring comment he was dutiful in his enthusiasm and he did not tell her that he found more keen enjoyment in her own manifestation of delight than he did in the thing itself he had only an hour or so to spare before returning and he passed most of the time planning with her for the return to port au prince

 i have fixed my mind on a house of my own she said  you must build it for me it must be near papa pierre papa pierre has plenty of land and he will give me enough for a house and a garden

meissner consented with an indulgent smile he was in for a long wait and he might as well do the thing thoroughly he thought the little money which he would spend for the house and its furniture some good wines and other liquors would be saved for he would spend less time at the club gambling and less in what was at least his ostensible residence in port au prince where he was a lavish entertainer it did not require a moments thought to calculate the real economy of the project

and so they arranged it allârather she did the arranging she was to have her little houseâall her own i and he was to spend much of his time there and when he was not there she would have papa pierre for company and she would fill the house with pretty things she must have a brass bedstead and a long mirror like mrs hauffmans and he would bring his friends and they would have good times he looked at his watch he had actually killed off two hours listening to the ecstasies of her charming prattle

 well i must go mon chãrie he said rising  be ready when the boy comes for you you can put on your new dancingdress here and come just so in the carriage throw a warm shawl around you the boy will come early you must hide you know he will serve you your dinner and all the champagne you wantâi know your capacity for that when the drums begin you wait for him as i will give him the signal dont forget she was too eager for the fun with the foreigners to forget

he hurried over to koffels to dress for the frolic his friends were still busy with the decorations growing palms young cocoanuts and luxuriant little cocomacaques had been set around in a charmingly promiscuous way and screens of varying greens had been put at windows and doors to permit free movement of air while giving a sense of privacy as well the large centre lamp of the room had been draped with slender vines the table had been set at one side of the large room near the rear balcony for the convenience of service the side table on which extra silver and china had been placed was out on the balcony and out of sight of those seated at the table a little chandelier of beaten iron with spreading branches exquisitely wrought holding oval lamps of polished brass had been suspended over the middle of tintable from the centre of this was suspended a portrait of the german emperor koffel was at work balancing two swords to complete the decoration

meissner had been walking around expressing his pleasure over everything but the two swords balanced under the portrait of the emperor particularly caught his fancy the chandelier was strikingly favorable for the effect which koffel had sought and secured meissner watched him as he worked the wire with skilful fingers balancing the two swords one of ancient french pattern and the other koffels own which had seen active service he gave the finishing touches and then made a running border of small ferns around the table

 that is fine koffel exclaimed meissner  where did you get the idea 

 i dont know said koffel smiling appreciatively  we raked up everything at hand for decoration and i stumbled over these two swords

 of course i know yours and you have reason to be proud of it old man said meissner heartily but this old one interests me curiously he examined it closely fearing to touch it the wires were practically invisible and the weapons seemed to be balanced in air the others attracted by meissners comments came to look at the work

 yes i bought that old sword from an old coffeebuyer here in the mountains do you know that some the poorest of the country people preserve very interesting things handed down from the days of the french and they guard sacredly these heirlooms as a ruleâ from their  grangran as they say

 by the way that reminds me that i have a curiosity exclaimed meissner  it came to me recently and i have not examined it thoroughly ill bring it out

he returned from his room with the dagger which the mother of the rescued child had forced upon him the handle was apparently silver oxidized nearly black by age it fitted snugly to the grasp of the hand and it was so heavy that it must have been loaded with lead while time had been permitted to work its mark on the handle there had been no neglect of the blade it was a long slender bodkin of the poignard type a firm yet flexible body glancing off to almost a needlepoint a thing of grace with all its suggestions of possible kinetic deadliness the men were all fascinated by the vicious little weapon and they urged him to leave it in front of his plate that he might show it to the guests of the evening

they had changed their original plan and had invited a few men who had been attentive to meissner during his stay and koffel had but little time to jump into his evening suit and receive them meissner took his time and from the seclusion of his room he listened to the bright talk of men who seemed actually contented in this isolation besides he had had a heavy burgundy at breakfast the midday meal which is really a luncheon and he was glad to escape the cocktails which were repeated with every new arrival they were all in for a good time âthat was evident and they had spared no pains to make everything nice well he would have them in port au prince some day and get even with them

it was quite eight oclock when they sat down to dinner a fine company freshskinned cleareyed bearing all the marks of vigorous young manhood the effective arrangement of the lights the tasteful decorations of the room and the dainty setting of the table were in perfect keeping with the correct evening dress of every man present the soup was served as they sat down a clear consomm accompanied by a chãteau yquem reserved for special occasions the beginning of the meal was marked by the touches of formality which nearly all young germans bring with them from the army koffel raised his glass to the level of his chin and sat bolt upright and looked around the table every other man sat bolt upright raised his glass and looked over its edge at koffel then koffel turned to meissner the guest of the evening it was a nice deferential bow with which the host greeted his friend though a bit stiff and every other man jerked his head forward in a cordial nod of welcome and sipped from his glass thus was the dinner begun and its manner of starting indicated that there were to be no speeches

with a magnificent red snapper came the german white wine the course was not quite served when koffel arose gentlemen to the emperor he said quietly

 to the emperor came the hearty response and every man stood to drink the toast koffel went to the piano ran off a little prelude and the entire company took up the emperors hymn  heil dir im sicgerkranz herrscher dcs vaterlands heil kaiser dir

the choral which the patriotic hymns of three nations have made familiar around the world was sung with deep feeling and the effect of the trained voices attracted an audience from the street with tropical freedom and assurance they grouped themselves at the head of the stairs entering the balcony to enjoy the merrymaking of the foreigners and to share the feast later on the courses seemed to them like so many independent meals for after each the foreigners lighted their cigarettes and sang and even left the table to group themselves around the piano instinctively they sang the songs of their youth the volkslieder which have done more to make the german nation than laws or courts as the dinner progressed however the moods changed until drinkingsongs and patriotic choruses were sung in seemingly exhaustless repertory they had just done  im kã¼hlen keller sitz ich hier when meissners boy entered and deferentially awaited the chance to speak with his employer

 diane is impatient he said when meissner joined him  she says she has eaten and drunk enough and that she is tired of being alone

when comes the haãtien course cried meissner

 it is the next said koffel  and they are bringing it in

and the company resumed their places while the gaping haãtiens marvelled that the foreigners could eat and drink so much

meissner arose and started the song  was ist des deutschen vaterland

there was a rollicking effect in their singing of the several verses with the refrain oh nein oh nein oh nein

sein vaterland muss gr ssser sein

but when they came to the last verses they seemed to sober themselves and to steady themselves for the solemn invocation  das ganze deutschland soil es sein

oh oott vom himmel stehthrein und gieb uns cchten deutschen muth dass wir es lieben treu und gut

das soli es sein das soli es sein

das ganze deutschland soil es sein

 the gros bouillon cried koffel pointing to the haãtien dishes for which they were waiting this course was evidently the haãtien feature of the evening knives forks and large spoons were passed and deep soupplates piled at the head of the table chicken and goat and plantains and sweet potatoes were skilfully portioned out by koffel and a waiter started around the table with an immense dish of  the national rice and red beans the rice garnished off with minute purple mushrooms much prized throughout the republic  as they now began the course skilfully using knife fork and spoon decanters of native white rum were passed around and an orchestra of haãtien drums hidden somewhere in the palms started up the rhythmical invitation to the dance

the white rum was not slow in manifesting its power before the course had well begun the entire party were passing from exhilaration to a noisier stage meissner asked permission to be master of ceremonies at this point as he wanted to contribute his part of the entertainment evidently the servants had been coached privately by meissner for at a signal from him they began putting out the lights the low mumble of the drums continued and the guests watched with amused curiosity as they sipped their tafia

the room was dark except for one lamp which was left burning in the chandelier over the table and for the large lamp in the centre of the room which was draped to throw a brightly illuminated spot on the floor beneath it

the spectators on the balcony joined the party at the table in applauding diane as she floated out of one of the side rooms to the rhythm of the drums her arms were raised in graceful posings as she performed a sort of gyromancy back in the shadow she made the circle of her movements smaller and smaller until it became a merely pivotal movement the entire body supported by the toes the men applauded frantically as she continued this movement back in the shadow sustaining the strain with an easy grace fairly swirling around her arms extended her body in perfect poise and as the applause reached its height she made a quick run still on her toes down from the shadow into the bright projection under the centre lamp and stopped with a sweeping courtesy to the men at the table

koffel stepped to the centre of the room and led her to the table the men had all become acquainted with her during her stay in jacmel and they crowded around her chair to compliment her champagne was thrust upon her from all sides one toast after another was proposed her grace her gown her beautyâanything everything so long as it served to require more drinking and though in the adjoining room she had followed the changes of wines she drank every toast with a gaillardise befitting the occasion

all were now in the mood for an orgie and diane herself was the one to give the cue for throwing off all restraint she left her chair and went over to meissner throwing her arm around him as she lighted a cigarette he drew her down towards him and she sat on his knee nonchalantly smoking and chatting wine was not wanting and presently meissner continued his part of the entertainment by starting a patois song the foreigner sang the thing with gusto but not naturally his accent and the really musical quality of his voice made the effect artificial she made up all for him however taking up the refrain after each line with voice gesture and facial expression she sat on the foreigners knee as she sang and she looked into his face with the irresponsible leer of partial drunkenness

meissner watched her curiously as he followed her lead with the song he had never before seen her so affected by wine and it was with a twinge of conscience even in his own exhilarated condition that he remarked how undefiled she was in spite of the pace which he had led her she was still the same simple child of nature how long could she stay so under his influence it was only a passing twinge however though disgusting enough while it lasted he was soon carried away in the swirl of sense which carried all even the street audience on the balcony along with the swing of the song

the excitement grew the musicians swayed their bodies to the movements as they bent over their drums the men were swaying and singing the native onlookers were swaying in sheer physical sympathy and diane her arms loosely curved forward was swaying with a sensuous grace that was the permeation of the spirit possessing them all

she leaped from meissners knee as if she could restrain herself no longer the drummers caught her feeling and their music graded itself down to a softly modulated rhythm they were all under the spell of her physical sympathy and her marvellous grace she was drunk with the consciousness of her power she abandoned herself to the feeling and just back of the centre lamp in the dark shadow began the bodydance of the country revels there was no perceptible motion below the hips ease and power were eloquent in their expression the place was silent except for the low voluptuous rumble of the drums she was moving forward there seemed to be no movement of her feet yet she was appealing in the light with a curious gliding the men were straining forward in their chairs held by the apparition so ethereal in its drapery in its motion without movement so carnal in its suggestiveness to them

because it was so suggestive to the men meissner found himself gradually growing more disgusted with himself he knew what was carrying away the girl and he knew what the men did not know what in his vanity he had withheld from them as he watched her his mind went back to the hillside beside the smouldering hut the same helpless guilty feeling came over him again he looked out at the little french steamer riding at anchor at the foot of the hill she had said that no other man could offer her wines and gay nights they would not be the same without him

she was still gliding towards him god that halfdrunken leer yet how clean she was the simple child of nature but his friends did not see her so it was he who had brought her to this and she was clinging to it because it was a part of him

the reflection sobered him he would redeem himself as best he could redeem her as best he could here before his friends he would confess his crime he would lead her away from the debauch into which he had led her

firm in his resolve he turned his chair to rise to go to her and before his friends to do his duty by her

 the devil of it all is that it was the president whom he insulted before that crowd  hauffman was very serious as he talked over with pirot the encounter of alcide and the president wiley had been an hour in the bath alcide had scrubbed himself and gone to bed  i cannot protect him here what could i say to the president the boy told the truth he would not apologize even if i should ask him to do so now pirot help me out what can i do i must decide at once  yes all port au prince is talking about the incident you may be sure of that and the rescue identifies him with you for some reason or other tinceau is determined to persecute alcide could you not see the president bring up the incident and let your course be governed by the drift of the conversation 

no i have thought of that said hauffman inwardly amused that pirot knew his method so well he had often followed that plan with the minister for foreign affairs  if i see him the burden of the explanation would have to be of the nature of an apology that i will not make i could speak for alcide and for myself i might say that he is young that he is pursuing his studies that he is still in the visionary stage and that he docs not see all things clearly i might even go so far as to say that the presidents method of striking terror throughout the community is probably the only way he can govern haãti now that the two or three hundred deaths of today probably obviate the necessity for two or three thousand tomorrow i might say all that but that would not be an apology i cannot see my way out of it

just then wiley joined them he looked bright and cool in fresh linen and flannels but he was still intently working away at his fingernails

 did you get it all off asked pirot laughing

 yes and half of my skin with it exclaimed wiley  of all the foul mud  if i had known i would have gone feet first but i dived ugh it must have taken quite ten seconds to get my head clear of the stuff then when i tried to look around under the water i was blind how did you manage to find him asked pirot for this was the first chance to talk that had presented itself

 well i stuck my head out for air he did the same we were side by side i had judged my distance right enough but he had rolled over to dodge the bullets as he saw me coming he grabbed me by the throat and began to pommel me i thought he was crazed and i jammed his head under water a halfminute to weaken him a bit

that boy is as strong as a bull on the way up in the carriage he explained that he thought i was one of the soldiers the truth is that i was as black as he i guess

 it was a fine rescue however disagreeable the mud said pirot heartily  i envy you that you have been able to do something i who ought to have been one of the most active down there have had to chafe here holding my hands the boy was right if it were not for the violence if we had law here i would have had a chance to do my duty i should have liked to see the old man when alcide poked that hard truth down his throat

 ill bet he looked the same sphynx carved out of anthracite said wiley  but he was doing some tall thinking you may depend on that ill bet he will not sleep until he does something about it what are you going to do minister

 i dont know said hauffman gravely  there are some things which a diplomatic agent cannot do

get wet and black with mud before a crowd for instance and look dignified though bedraggled i couldnt stand that thought thats why i took the dip gad  i can taste the stuff yet 

you see said hauffman very seriously as he continued expressing the thoughts that troubled him  you see i cannot intervene for a haãtien citizen who has grossly insulted or at least gravely attacked the head of this government as yet of course i have no official knowledge of the incident and so have time to think i can see no way of avoiding compliance when they ask me to deliver him over for punishment

wiley took no further part in the conversation and presently he went off to his room he did not remain long however he stole upstairs to alcides room and found the young man well scrubbed and resting

 well my chased patriot how do you feel asked wiley

 all rightâa bit unstrung but all right replied alcide cheerily  you are in a bad fix said wiley  you must get out of it and the minister must not know anything about your movements

 yes he is seriously compromised said alcide sadly  i feel i owe it to him to give myself up

 dont be an ass exclaimed wiley  you have added a yard to your ears already this morning do you know the road to jacmel does the german consul there know you

 oh yes said alcide  his name is koffel he knows me well besides i have my paper from the legation which identifies me it has the visa of the foreign office here and takes me everywhere good can you get on the road without passing through the city

 yes i can work my way around to the south over the hillside and  come out below the bisoton

 good now you must describe a safe place where i may meet you and tell me how long it will take you to reach it afoot so they hurriedly planned their meeting they were to have no words on the approach of alcide wiley was to start back to the city afoot alcide would mount his horse and get off

 here are ten twentydollar pieces said wiley  the money will see you through to new york and support you for a while get the german consul to secure you a transport as a dominican or as any old thing get on board either the royal mail for jamaica or the dutch steamer for new york if you pass here on the dutchman keep in your cabin while in portâdeadly sick you know it may be that i will join you here if not use this card on your arrival in new york and you will not want for anything until i get up then ill look out for you and get you off to the german school you are so crazy about wiley wrote on one of his cards dear taylor spread on bearers story you may believe every word he says scareheads for a week thanks for complimentary telegram copy goes

 wlley

 of course if i meet you on board you will not send it not at all swap the story for the service goodby dear boy not another word until we meet in new york or on board ship goodluck

alcide wrung his friends hand and immediately began his preparations wiley joined the party on the porch where the ladies were waiting to hail him as the hero of the day he laughingly complied with their demand that he tell them all about the rescue he protested that it was only the making of a story and remained on the porch long enough not to appear lacking in appreciation of their approval he asked for his horse and started for the city

alcide had calculated that by hard riding he could be safe in jacmel by dark fort bisoton lay before him a little fortress built three or four hundred feet above the sea level no trouble was expected from the south and the fort as seen from the road seemed deserted he did not try to bring himself to realize that he was fleeing from home to a strange country his heart was in jacmel diane was there

little houses began to show themselves along the trail and small patches of coffee legacies from the days when the french had such a grand cultivation throughout this district he passed several men and women on foot and overtook quite a party on donkeys none of them knew him and he joined them to kill the time into jacmel

we ought to be in town in an hour he remarked for want of something more informing to say

 in town  we are not going to town replied one  we are going to the dance it is right off this road and only a halfhour from here the dance exclaimed alcide in the instant his whole being was possessed of diane

 yes papa pierre himself is here and he has done great things why my brother had a big swelling in his neck and papa pierre gave him nothing but a blue grease to rub on his legs think of curing the neck by rubbing the legs but brother is better already then he has a priestess with him maman diane she is beautiful and she has a devotion so that nothing can kill her the devotion is so powerful that it makes her stronger than the strongest man

every word struck deep so after all diane had gone in for the quackery and she had done it as she did everything thoroughly she had even taken advantage of her phenomenal strength to delude these poor people he groaned inwardly as the others took up the conversation and told of the marvellous things she had done the familiar yearning to lead her out of it seized him again he would go to her he would see her in her role of priestess he would take her aside and expose to her her own charlatanism he would open her own eyes and awaken her from her own selfdeception

he would rebuke her with the severity born of rational fondness he would plead with her she would not resent it she loved him he no longer heard the talk of his companions he pressed his horse forward and they changed place with him what though papa pierre should interfere he would talk boldly to him and tell her to make her choice she would not prefer papa pierre he smiled confidently at the thought again he saw her sad strained face as the old fraud had hurled him curses the old wretch dear diane

 and maman is not like the others said a woman who rode over in order to address him directly  she will not take money nor anything else until we tell her that her cure is good my little henriette had such pains that she cried every night and could not sleep i took my best goat a beautiful goat that gives two bottles of milk every day and i offered it as a promise to the serpent if she would cure henriette she told me to take the goat home and bring the child i took henriette and she gave henriette a little white pill and henriette fell asleep in her arms and she gives me a pill every night to give henriette the next night and i give her the pill and she has no pain and she sleeps and tomdrrow night i am going to tell her that her cure is good and i am going to take her the goat

they approached the enclosure alcide had seen the celebration often and he had no difficulty in entering he knew no password but the word of one passed all the drums lay idly at one side of the enclosure and the little booths had not begun business a large depressed with the thought that he must wait to see diane alcide at once mounted and started for the jacmel road alone in the woods he became conscious of the excitement with which he had awaited seeing her it was too late to hope to see her that night and he would be in hiding during the day he made a few more fordings of the serpentine oranger and skated down the hillside into the town of jacmel two or three sentinels stopped him but they passed him as the messenger of the german  consit everybody knew koffel as the german consul and liked him though only a commercial agent for the consulategeneral at port au prince he had a way of making the consulate known and respected

he found koffels house usually ablaze with lights almost in darkness there was no sound from within except the low murmur of native drums he cautiously made his way to the rear stairway at the top he stumbled into the group of native loiterers who recognized him as one of themselves he took in the scene at a glance it was a dinnerparty and a woman was dancing

in order to see well he arose and stood by the little side table back in the shadow he saw a tall woman in a loose soft gown dancing with marvellous grace the figure reminded him of diane it could not be diane it must be diane there was meissner easily recognized though his back was turned it must be diane

as she approached the halflight his heart stood still in dread of the impending confirmation of his fears it was her face he had never seen it relax under the spell of alcohol

the dead silence of the place except the deep low rumble of the drums intensified the magic in which that woman held them all it was diane he could deny it no longer meissner was right she might go to the cures but the rest of her time was his she had fallen to this

in their excitement the haãtien onlookers rose to their feet alcide was standing too transfixed hugging to his breast his deathstricken husbandlove she was coming coming towards him she was on the edge of the spot of light she was in it the marvel of suggestive undulation holding everybody to absolute silence he could number of sick and lame had assembled and the tinkling of the bell within the shrine and the incantations of papa pierre told him that they were making the cures he stood at the side of the enclosure holding his bridle and nervously trying to decide what he should next do one of his companions of the road the mother of little henriette came to him

 she is not here she said in a tone of disappointment  she stayed in jacmel tonight she will make the last cures tomorrow night

see her distinctly now her head thrown back her eyes drooping her lips apart her pure mouth a lingering smile of passionate invitation

alcide seized a carvingknife which lay on the side table near him and took an excited step forward there he stood irresolute fascinated by the horrible ghost of his love a servant grasped his hand that decided him he threw the man violently from him

meissner was about to rise from the table as he turned his chair he heard the noise and looked towards alcide in the faint light on the balcony he saw the boy his face the knife he knew instinctively he readied for something with which to defend himself

he grasped the ancient stiletto and rose from his chair he stumbled slightly over it before he could recover alcide had silently darted forward and was upon him

but his murderous blow did not fall upon meissner diane had rushed forward and the ugly blade in alcides hand was buried in her shoulder as with power and precision she swung meissner out of reach

in his fury the boy leaped over her falling body to resume his attack he was promptly seized and held by the guests while koffel knelt beside the unconscious woman and examined the wound

 it was an ugly cut he said finally  but it does not extend beyond the muscles of the shoulder and back my god  it is alcide 

on rising he had recognized the ministers favorite for the first time meissner was busily at work reducing the hemorrhage from the wound while waiting the coming of the doctor he had recognized alcide and he would have killed him in selfdefence but now his whole heart went out to the boy who firmly held as he was stood with every muscle quivering deadly hatred

 i am sorry my boy this is bad work that you have done said koffel it is my duty to hand you over to the police have you despatches from the minister alcide did not reply he merely regarded the entire group with sullen defiance

the doctor came his orders were that diane should not be removed from the house he confirmed koffels diagnosis tenderly she was lifted and carried to a room where the doctor was left alone with her

 you must not arrest alcide koffel said meissner on returning from dianes bedside nor may your guests leave until i tell you a story it is a story of the beautiful devotion of a pure woman and i want to get on my knees and beg that boy to believe me while i confess myself the infernal villain that i am

the day after the battle and the death of maillard all port au prince was in holiday dress tinceaus return in the afternoon was a triumphal entry the palace had been thronged with citizens profuse in their felicitations over the victory and the restoration of order the president had been unsparing in his praise of his brilliant secretary of war and the community made the satisfying inference that there was an end to present intrigue

in addressing the crowd the president was brief he formally announced the suppression of the insurrection and the suicide of its leader he assured his hearers that the policy of the administration would be free from any suggestion of the spirit of retaliation that even exminister pirot who had sought asylum at the critical moment would be accorded safe escort on board the first steamer sailing for jamaica

hauffman waited his opportunity to draw the president aside in order to thank him for his clemency to pirot

 i did think of your friendship for him said the president  but i owe it to you to say that i would have let him go had he been friendless i know all about this affair now but pirot must leave the country innocent while i draw the guilty closer to me this is to you and to you only hauffman he concluded as he grasped the germans hand cordially hauffman thanked him and started to go

 dont go yet said the president  i want to tell you about alcide

 i have not the remotest idea where he is said hauffman with embarrassment  i know that you have not they have kept the secret from you that american reporter helped him out of the city and he took the road for jacmel send for him i want to know that boy i like him i will want him near me soon if you will let him come hauffman could only look his gratitude as he grasped his hand and turned away to marvel again at the strangeness of the character which all haãti dreaded as the chief of state

the last of the voluble congratulators had gone the smart breeze from the sea brought rest after the terrible work of the day the president and war minister sat near the balcony facing the breeze and the glory of the setting sun in sea and cloud the president sat silently looking out and presently he turned to tinceau with his quiet wistful smile he said  eh bien mon fils nous sommes deux negres nest ce pas 

hauffman had come over the mountain from port au prince as fast as his horse could bring him and it was he who had dissipated the shadowy doubts which had lingered with alcide in spite of meissners explanation

alcide and diane were the theme for jacmel during the three weeks which she spent in the koffel house the boys protest in the face of the president and the clemency which had been extended him unsought aroused public curiosity for a look at him but he did not leave the home of the consul he had been a devoted nurse and his patient had promptly responded to the treatment directed by the skilful haãtien surgeon of the town

one day he sat by the side of her bed reading as she lay sleeping drinking in the tonic breeze from the sea she awoke slowly and she reached out her hand for his her smile speaking her confidence that he was there   the doctor has been here diane he said returning her caressing handclasp  he says that we may start for port au prince by the french steamer tomorrow meissner went by the last dutch boat you were too weak and i could not telllyou he explained everything to me you are a fine strong woman diane

she smiled in a contented way and then they suddenly started hauffmans voice was ringing through the house as he pounded up the stairs his jangling spurs punctuating every sentence

 i have been off to see the woman whose child you rescued diane he cried admiringly on entering the room and reaching forth a boot for alcide who bent to remove the beaming germans spurs he added to the boyâ  and i tell you sir you are getting a fine strong woman

 i was just telling her so said alcide radiant  and in precisely the same words

and as he set hauffmans big pipe on the table and turned to take the inevitable mug of beer from the servant who had soon learned the penalty of delay in extending this attention diane looked out through the open doorway over the quiet green harbor out to the leaping glistening southern sea the french steamer now on her return trip to port au prince lay riding at anchor the little vessel was now bright and clear in the glint of the setting sun and she was bound for home
