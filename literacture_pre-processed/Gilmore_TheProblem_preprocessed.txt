youll be a reigning belle her mother said when you return and although i am loth to part with you it is for your future welfare

freda embarked for paris in charge of a governess to begin a new life mid foreign surroundings after four years of study she returned to her home the happy party that journeyed from washington to new york to welcome the homecoming of freda consisting of mrs fairfax and her son henry who had received the highest honors for his efficiency at west point was rapturously overwhelmed with the marvelous beauty of the girl who only a short time left the shores said there she is mother there she is freda attired in a natty traveling gown came down the companionway of the steamer oh im so glad to be home again paris is fine but america for me

fredas choice mid the s weet strains of music from the hungarian orchestra the perfume of flowers and the thousands of electric bulbs entwined in the shrubbery made rosewood into a garden of eden the night when freda was presented to washington society foreign noblemen men of wealth men of letters and men high in government and military circles were the guests of mrs fairfax and her son henry who had received the honorable appointment as surgeon in the united states army everywhere throughout the vast assemblage fredas beauty was openly commended and after the earnest solicitation of her mother she consented to sing the airia from aida was rendered with rare grace and simplicity which electrified her hearers who is this girl of the fairfaxs where did she come from these and other inquiring remarks were caught by the sensitive ear of freda which caused her to think and wonder and to ask herself the same distressing question who am i

accepted as the new belle and the acknowledged queen were the social honors conferred upon this debutante after the guests had departed and the family assembled in the tea room reaction took possession of her and though the fairfax family had achieved new social honors that who am i was a spectre of the past which came to blight the future happiness of this innocent girl

freda my child i was so proud of you tonight you looked so beautiful

yes mother and i was jealous of the attention she received from all of those great men but they cant have you can they freda

surgeon you and your mother are so good to me and the reception you planned for me tonight is only one of the many exhibitions of your kindly traits of character but i fear i must do something practical how could i be happy doing nothing when there is so much suffering in this world mother you will forgive me if i beg of you and the surgeon to excuse me so ill kiss you both good night

everywhere in washington society the marvelous beauty and exquisite grace of freda known as the adopted daughter of colonel and mrs fairfax was openly discussed and the dethroned belles would ask who is this budding beauty why did the colonel adopt her when these annoying questions were brought to the attention of freda she one day ran to her mother and throwing her arms around her neck bursting into a flood of tears she cried mother tell me who i am mrs fairfax distressed at the girls sensitiveness tried to console her with these words you are my own dear sweet child and what i have is yours so there dont cry

yes my dear miss waters the board of examiners have accepted your petition and you may report daily to the district superintendent of the red cross society you will find the work arduous but as you are blessed with a strong physique i have no fear but that you will make a successful nurse   this was the life freda chose after consulting her heart as to how to find happiness in this world surgeon fairfax and his mother were much distressed at the course taken by freda and society seemed shocked by the action of the crowning belle of washington

when remonstrated by mrs fairfax as to why her dear child chose that profession freda gently replied are you not associated with organizations that care for the afflicted and the unfortunate  have you not given up your time and money for the poor and the distressed did you not take me when i was but a child cared for me educated me and made me what i am today did you not tell me that our lives should be useful am i not following your precepts

freda can anything change you in this mad act can you not see that you have drawn a dark cloud over our bright sky of happiness what can we do to change your mad intent tell me what can we do

surgeon you can do something you and your dear mother you can give me your blessings in my new field of happiness would you see me unhappy or will you join with me in serving humanity like christ who gave his life for the world that all might be saved no surgeon i must go to those who need me and god will bless you and your dear mother for encouraging a heart whose future deeds will add glory to us all thus she won her wish and the following day reported to the headquarters of the society and was assigned to one of the barrack hospitals where she received practical instructions as to the care of the wounded

after the destruction of the battleship maine in the early spring the united states was like a hound held in leash ready to spring at the throat of the enemy and only wise counsel prevailed owing to the unreadiness of the country for war then came the declaration of war with spain and the mobilization of the regular army was promptly begun and troops began to leave their home stations for the scene of action it was at this period that the famous ninth and tenth cavalries were ordered to proceed to cuba whereby their deeds of valor made history

freda with a corps of nurses was sent to cuba surgeon fairfax wishing to be near her asked to be assigned to duty which was granted freda waters the beautiful red cross nurse began a new life amid changed conditions and distressing scenes

o thou child of many prayers

life hath quicksandsâlife hath snares

â longfellow

ben henderson was among the slaves of john henderson who lived near petersburg va where he held large possessions ben was known as the most handsome jetblack negro of his community his wife maria was tall and very dark showing all the characteristics of her african descent of the four children bom to ben and maria one was william known as lanky ben died leaving his wife with the care of these four children who were unable to be of much assistance to their mother

william henderson known as lanky among his associates received this distinction at the age of ten years being very tall and slender his mother being a widow he was denied many of the necessities of life they lived in a hamlet near richmond va he attended the village school and was known as one of the brightest pupils there at this age he exhibited a great trait of character for leadership his playmates never disputed his authority owing to his pugnacious disposition marauding parties led by lanky wrought much havoc among the neighboring farmers and caused much anxiety to his mother the weather was never too rough nor the distance too far for lanky and his band of marauders the bands depredations had become unbearable so it was decided to send lanky to an uncle who agreed to raise and educate him he was sent to the city of richmond where he attended the public school until he was eighteen years old leading his classes in athletic sports his oftexpressed desire to be a soldier was realized one day after a stormy scene with his uncle who attempted to admonish him for some of his misdeeds saying william i will not tolerate your acts any longer you must settle down to something that will be of service to you the next day a tall active young colored man applied to the recruiting station and asked to be assigned to a regiment having passed the mental and physical examinations he was sent to fort robinson where the ninth cavalry was in camp the many indian uprisings at that time required much scouting in these expeditions henderson was one of the foremost to volunteer his courage was never disputed and he won many medals in pistol and rifle contests he rapidly rose in rank from  until  when we find him receiving the appointment as sergeant

baiquiri and siboney near the entrance of santiago harbor cuba were very lively places when the ninth cavalry arrived in the latter part of june  to engage the spaniards the scene was one that shall never be forgotten men who had left their loved ones at home were in a new region infested with disease venomous reptiles and a hostile enemy who depended solely upon guerrilla warfare only those endowed with patriotic love for their country and who were willing to lay down their lives for the glory of the stars and stripes were there and the anxiety for action overshadowed all melancholy thoughts of the loved ones far away

henderson in charge of a detachment was sent ahead to guard the advance of the commissary

general there will be some lively times here and the boys are very anxious said captain jenkins of steamer mayflower to general funston and as our ships have only had rifle practice the boys aboard are anxious for some real work

oh they will get it retorted general funston but you fellows out there on the water can see what you are doing while we boys on shore can be picked off at leisure but everything is in readiness the transport bearing the hospital equipment and the red cross nurses has arrived and we have selected a very desirable site for them

my what a pretty lot of girls there are among them who is in charge of the hospital corps general

surgeon fairfax of washington d c a bright and able fellow i know the family well miss freda waters his foster sister is one of the corps of nurses

general i must get aboard ship id like to have you dine with me if convenient and with the usual military salutation the general and captain separated

how do you do surgeon i learned that you were here and with these words he grasped the hand of a tall military young man with piercing black eyes whose nervous temperament was not befitting a man of his profession

glad to see you general and always trust to see you as you are at the present time i would not have been here but i must be near freda you know she is inexperienced in this field and will need a strong arm to guide her

oh well she can care for herself and if she doesnt contract a fever you may have no fear for her safety

saluting the general the surgeon turned his footsteps toward the camp the general to his headquarters

on a beautiful hill shaded by palm trees a short distance from the road which leads to the harbor was a row of tents surrounding one large tent the emblem a huge red cross shone out clearly in the morning sun this little village as we may term it was all quiet and serene the simple arrangements of the cots white and spotless only bespoke of the care taken by those in charge that little army whose arduous labors bringing more personal satisfaction than honor achieved was as brave in the discharge of their duties as any soldier who fell under their care and that christlike influence over the unfortunate did more to bring back to health than all the medicine administered by the surgeons this was where freda found happiness

little did she dream that it would be here that circumstances over which she had no direct control would so shape themselves as to revolutionize her heartfelt desires and at night when she knelt at her bedside she prayed that she would be made strong to do the work ordained by him who said blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted those who were near her gazing upon the innocent face saw a picture of determined resolution and as she said good night her eyes shone with a spirit of content and love for all mankind without the silent tread of the sentinel the deep stillness of the night the anxious forebodings of impending happenings pictured a scene of mental unrest not very far from the hospital tent was a row of gray canvas houses presenting a village of mammoth proportions there were streets avenues and a large space to be used as assembly or parade grounds far beyond mid trees and underbrush sulked a race whose hottempered blood saw nothing knew nothing only the avenging spirit of conquest shrewd alert pantherlike ever ready to spring at the throats of their prey they the spaniards lay and wait for the inhabitants of the village to begin action and so the clouds of night slowly incasing the earth brought to a close a day of anxiety far away loved ones prayed to god that he would watch over guide and protect those who would give their lives for their country

the break of day found the soldiers resting on their arms and from washington throughout the united states the allabsorbing topic what will happen next was the prevailing question spain realizing the enormous task before her prepared herself for a long siege her best and most powerful battleships were sent to these shores the longdrawn out conflict between the spaniards and the cubans lasting ten years only served to make her more determined to crush the proud spirit of the united states this country knowing of the hard struggle for independence and freedom of the little island of cuba had in a small measure aided the inhabitants to secure that which we all love the noble manner in which they had fought a greater and more powerful foe gained for them that regard and respect due to individuals and countries so the sympathy of the world fortified by the will of god the united states had begun a war for the elimination of despotism and tyranny supplanting the same with the new reign of law and justice to all mankind thus we have the motive for this great conflict to be waged relentlessly until liberty stands predominant upon the western hemisphere

the sound of the bugle the tap of the drum brought the army to attention couriers were received and dispatched transports arriving on which was colonel roswell with his roughriders a formidable array of fighters strong active reared in the west known as cowboys and ranchmen not considering the dangers but like their leader was ever ready to be in the thickest of the fray

how far is it to the hill general were going to take the block house was the greeting the colonel gave when general funston received him in camp

oh not very far colonel but you must be careful those devils are lying in ambush and they are all sharpshooters and will pick you off at will

spaniards or no spaniards were frothing at the mouth and our object is to take the hill with these words he saluted the general and left for the camp of roughriders

henderson starting on a scouting expedition made the following report to general funston general we have found that it is almost impossible to make an open charge against these red devils owing to the growth of the underbrush which is even far better than trenches it gives the enemy perfect shelter and exposes us to a deadly fire i learn that the roughriders are about to take the hill you must persuade them to desist the act is not only foolhardy but suicidal and will cause a useless loss of life in making observations i ran across a spaniard lying in the ambush near the outpost after a little exercise with him i brought him in he is now in the guard tent i wish you would look him over we may win from him some information that would be of some interest

sergeant henderson and general funston wended their way to the guard house

pete known as a body servant to general funston who had lived with the general for years as his house servant uneducated unskilled loving his master better than he loved himself was destined to become a factor in this romantic life no one ever paid any serious attention to pete he was respected only for the position he held and often accepted abuse at the hands of others rather than complain to his master yet within that black body was a heart with as deep a feeling as any of his superiors it was this man who gained the regard of henderson and became his true friend it was this man who also became the true friend of freda it was the love for justice of this man that brought to a successful conclusion the many perplexing incidents connected with their lives his noble character brought for him that esteem and affection he so honestly deserved as circumstances forced him in his present capacity he was not endowed with that spirit of bravery and often shrank at the sound of shot and shell but as time went on and being so closely associated with danger pete was always there to administer to the weak and fallen rendering service of much value there was a sentimental part in petes life which was quite natural as he was but human and when fate brought him and quito together the incidents surrounding their romantic courtship were rather amusing

quito a young widow of a cuban soldier who was killed just prior to the opening of hostilities was found one day by surgeon fairfax lurking near the entrance of the hospital tent after careful investigation it was decided to have her wait upon the nurses speaking very little english but realizing her position she soon became the ward of freda who took special interest in this poor unfortunate woman looking upon pete as one in her own sphere they soon became great friends and were often seen together thus we find cupid playing pranks with the unlettered as well as shooting his arrow at the heart of sterner material

so we find a life of happiness amid gruesome scenes and who could foretell the climax of this eventful beginning for it was very shortly after that the sound of rifle was heard one clear morning long before those sleeping peacefully in their homes were awake and at gray dawn of that memorable day the word was passed through camp that colonel roswell and his roughriders were on their way to take the blockhouse a call to arms was hurriedly given out from that village black heroes rushed in the distance the firing of musketry could be heard and the first real battle was on the roughriders were being cut down and their fearless leader with his remaining comrades stood in danger of complete annihilation

who can save them who will save them couriers arrive with the news that hope is almost gone but without one word of command from superior officers sergeant henderson dashed forth followed by his true heroic comrades into the deep thicket they plunged disorganized in forces they fought man for man hand to hand body and soul in action

on through the battles crush with but one thought aflush driving their lords like chaff at the guns mouths they laugh at the slippery brands leaping with open hands down they tear man and horse down in their awful course all their eyes forward bent rushed the black regiment 

âbaker

far upon the road leading to the blockhouse surrounded by a few brave followers colonel roswell is seen sword in hand battling against superior numbers which must only fall soon by the advancing enemy the stars and stripes are trailing in the dust on the hillside the groans of the wounded and the shrieks of the dying added havoc to this foolhardy undertaking but above the din of battle a voice is clearly heard hold your own colonel were coming it was only a few yards between henderson and his comrades that the massive form of the colonel was seen to swerve but henderson had gained the hill

pandemonium reigned the day was saved and the stars and stripes again waved in the sunlight of that memorable morning reinforced by general funston the scattered army was again united and mid the singing of a hot time in the old town tonight the famous ninth and tenth cavalries returned to camp but the price of victory was high among the many wounded brought to camp was sergeant henderson the blanched faces depicting anxiety for this black hero were everywhere prevalent deep silence reigned without which was only broken by the arrival of general funston who had followed henderson to the relief of the roughriders

surgeon is henderson mortally wounded

no general but he needs care

surgeon you must save this mans life for such gallantry displayed by him i have never witnessed before

many cots in the hospital were soon receiving the heroic wounded and after they had been tenderly cared for and made comfortable as possible we find general funston standing at the cot of henderson with freda in attendance

tell us how it happened general tell us of the battle

it was this way we were resting quietly on our arms in camp thinking of our loved ones far away i was seated in my tent preparing my report to be sent to headquarters at washington hearing a few scattered shots paying little heed to the same until the sentinel came to me with the news that colonel roswell and his roughriders were on their way to take the hill not dreaming that he would put into execution such a rash act when all at once i could hear firing of muskets and with the aid of my glass i saw that it was all too true roswell and his roughriders had started and were being hemmed in on all sides and cut down like chaff before the wind at that moment sergeant henderson came in to me saying general the roughriders are being cut down and we must save them without waiting for orders he rushed from the camp i heard his orders and in less time than it takes to tell it those black demons had plunged into the thicket with the detachment i followed halfway up the hill i saw the colonel sabre in hand fighting like mad around him on every side were spaniards his men dropping here and there when out from the smoke and muskets i saw henderson sword in hand cutting to the right and to the left down he plunged into the thicket out again upon the plain until there only remained a short distance between him and the colonel i saw the color bearers shot down and i heard the groans of the wounded when over the prostrate forms of his own brave men henderson plunged and i heard his voice clear and distinct shouting charge and mid the shots of enemies rifles he reached the colonels side followed by his brave comrades they gained the hill and saved the day with confusion the enemy retreated with bowed head the general withdrew freda bent over the form of henderson and uttered a soft prayer that god would spare him to enjoy the fruits of victory and from that moment there awoke in that sleeping heart thoughts of future happiness and she pictured there that which she never had dreamed that life is worth living she was awakened from her reverie by the arrival of colonel roswell forcing his way past the guards and rushing to the cot on which henderson lay he was tenderly restrained by freda saying you must not wake him he needs rest i will nurse him back to health   i know you will replied the colonel for he is too brave a man to die and we need his service you will tell him that i asked for him when he wakes with these words the colonel departed

long through the vigil of the night a living angel watched over this semiconscious hero guided by the thought that duty commanded her to make a sacrifice and to remain awake that any physical turn for the worse would be arrested and as god had given this hero to the world for his recovery she felt that she was personally responsible the sudden twitching of the muscles that exhibited the restless nature of this sleeping patient at times startled her and after giving him a mild opiate prescribed by the surgeon he relapsed into peaceful slumber with the word mother escaping from those unconscious lips this magic word freda caught and again that thought who am i rose like a spectre before her it was not very long before henderson was able to take mild exercise this he would do in charge of his nurse they talked of home and the prospects of peace at times he would often stray from her watchful care and would be found at the headquarters of the general begging to be allowed to return to duty the general realizing his weakened condition admonished his nurse not to permit the sergeant to go beyond the hospital lines

sergeant youve walked enough and i as your nurse must see that you return to your cot now wont you come with me with these words she stopped to retrace her steps toward the hospital and the childlike appeal seemed to unman this fearless soldier he stood as one bewitched not knowing how to reply then his strength of power returned and he said miss waters ever since i have been under your care there is a deeper wound far greater than any given by this enemy a wound which medical science cannot heal the ravages of war only serve to make life glorious or inglorious there are men far happier whose bodies lie cold upon the battle field than those whose very soul has been condemned to eternal living why did you let me live when the chasm between us cannot be bridged why oh why did god in his infinite grace allow a heart whose whole thought was for the glory of his country to sulk and cower under the magnetic influence of one so weak in physical force yet unconsciously making a slave of sterner stuff leave me i return to duty thine eyes are not for mine thy soul belongs above

then as a criminal having confessed for a crime he attempted to leave her but freda restrained him saying wait sergeant hear me hear me you know not who i am i know not myself when a babe i was left in care of others reared in luxury of wealth surrounded by loved ones i never knew the love of a mother save that of my nurse one of your race who through her tears sang me to sleep i can see her now tenderly caring and watching over me and until i was taken from her i loved her as though she were my own dear mother the world was cold and dreary and the happiness of the unfortunate seemed to call to me crying mercy my life was a blank until that fateful night you were brought to the hospital tent and after bending over you a whispered word escaped from your lips the word mother then hearing the words of praise for the gallantry displayed by you upon the battle field of your sacrifice in the discharge of your duty sergeant henderson i saw in you that which all women see when their soul is awakened to the thought that life holds all that is dear to us and as you will leave me let this be our prayer that though the laws of the land forbid there is a higher law where souls may rest in peace in that world where parting is no more stop you have no right to tempt me let us forget this day let it become a part of the forgotten night let not even a symbol of reflection of our thoughts return let the memories waft on the distant horizon

before she could restrain his action he was gone but alas these declarations of two souls were overheard as though sent by the gods of destruction surgeon fairfax heard all

  what can this mean  can the woman who gave up all the pleasures of this world for the care of the afflicted and the unfortunate love this othello  can this woman whom i loved in my childhood be as desdemona that loved othello for his brave deeds is it true that she has awakened from her lethargy to see life as other women if so i swear by the gods to thwart every act of his that would rob me of the only woman in this world for me

in the stillness of the early evening while the breezes wafted through the palm trees this man swore to avenge a fancied wrong of a comrade mid the glory of victory sorrow took control of three hearts at the dictates of fate

here we find henderson in a weakened condition at the headquarters of general funston

general i am all right i feel well enough to return to duty dont send me back to the hospital again the boys all miss me

there he stood a hero of many engagements a man who smiled in the face of danger pleading to his superior officer like a school boy any place anywhere than back to the hospital tent where he would come in contact with the woman who was robbing him of his earthly existence the wounding of his heart was far greater than the wounding of his body for he dare not hope for that which was beyond his power and he stood silently awaiting the generals reply

henderson you are not strong enough for active duty and i command you to remain under the care of the surgeon until he discharges you as physically fit for service that is my ultimatum with a commanding gesture to put his command into execution he arose and without a word pointed his finger direct to the hospital tent with bowed head and a sad heart henderson returned to the hospital

and freda in the communion of her thoughts there arose these perplexing questions who am i what have i done that the gods of fate have crushed my ambition why is my life at one time a moment of sunshine blighted by the dark shadows of remorse are the sins of the fathers visited upon me as one of their children and in this solitude of melancholy she wept herself to sleep

fairfax the man of hot southern temperament reared in the luxuries of this world his every wish gratified no one daring to dispute his power stood as a panther at bay in a tent especially built and equipped for an operating room and laboratory seated at a small table was this soldier of medical science and the distressing incidents leading up to the present time changed this mans very being the teachings of his early youth had no influence over him at this time and with these words he must die he prepared a drug to be administered to henderson in the guise of medicine this is the last medicine he shall take for when he sleeps it will be his last and fate as if playing to the will of the gods of fate freda entered

surgeon henderson has returned and i fear he has overtaxed his strength will you go to him  

freda spoke fairfax reaching for his hat youll find hendersons medicine all prepared give it to him when you think he needs it i am in a hurry i have some important duties to perform as if sentenced by his conscience for his dastardly act he left the tent

with anxious steps freda returned to the hospital proper and there seated on his cot was henderson noticing symptoms of nervousness brought about as she thought by overtaxing his strength she again returned to the laboratory procured the medicine prepared by the surgeon and returned to administer it to her hero patient

here sergeant take this then you will rest

as if receiving a command from his superior henderson took the fatal drug the effect was instantaneous and with a languid yawn he fell back on his cot freda believing that she had administered only a mild opiate prepared him that he might rest comfortably and returned to her various duties

fairfax little dreamed when he prepared that drug that providence had ordained that its effect would not be as far reaching as destined by him and that its victim was a man of indomitable physical and mental construction and so instead of being in a state of coma awaiting the slow exhausting vitality of this black hero it had the opposite effect and we find the sergeant delirious having rushed from the tent running toward the headquarters of general funston as if making a charge at the enemy he shouted at the top of his voicecharge i say back back you dogs you shall not take her from me i love her i love her

the general having been notified of hendersons queer actions met him at the entrance of his headquarters henderson like a wild man fell exhausted at the generals feet by the aid of loving comrades he was assisted back to the hospital general funston gave orders that henderson should be returned to his home in richmond and preparations were made for his speedy departure

after several engagements with the spaniards in which much heroism was displayed the famous sea battle off santiago harbor and many minor incidents brought the victorious invasion of the united states troops to a successful close so we find them leaving the distressing scenes the latter part of fall  some to their homes others to various places where they were assigned it was at this time that we find fairfax and his sister returning to their home in washington he with the conscious dread for the guilty crime committed she with the anxious foreboding as to the fate of her ideal man

all this the world knows well yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell

the philippines being one of the many spanish possessions was allowed for centuries to map out its own destiny there we find an uncultivated country populated by an illiterate race the progress made by the japanese and the missionaries had little or no effect upon it and the country was under the control of bandits who existed by capturing the wealthy and holding them for ransom here lived aguinaldo who had gathered about him the most crafty of his race and whose power was never disputed it was this bandit chieftain that the united states had to contend with and the aggressive campaign to be waged was to be of relentless character

for years the guerrilla warfare between spain and this bandit chieftain was a source of much anxiety to the sovereignty of spain the progress of this conflict cost many lives with no result attained the rich rubber forest was an incentive revenue for grafting filibusters which netted them sufficient income for their adventurous conquest manila the capital situated at the head of manila bay the headquarters of the army was a very enterprising city it was here at this place where admiral dewey made history by entering over the mines laid by the spaniards it was here where he received the distinction by congress as being the greatest living admiral it is here in this city where the united states troops are stationed where plots and counterplots are being laid against the government and individuals but we will go back to when we left the shores of cuba

at the close of hostilities between the united states and spain the regiments remained under arms for orders a protectorate having been proclaimed by the united states over the islands was all that was necessary at this period the rebuilding the reestablishing of commerce and the removal of the troops was the cleaningup task of the united states thus the departure of surgeon fairfax accompanied by his foster sister freda and quito the tender affection of freda for quito and the thought that quito would again be thrown upon her own resources with no one to care for her were the reasons given why freda decided to bring her to washington under the tutelage of freda quito became quite proficient in english her loyalty to her mistress was unquestioned and they were always seen together seeming only to be happy when near each other they confided in one another and freda enjoyed many pleasant moments with this unlettered girl taking great delight instructing her as to modem customs in exchange she taught freda spanish and they were often found together reviewing each other as to the progress made they were discovered at one time by surgeon fairfax down near a brook running through the estate and the surgeon wishing to speak to freda alone commanded quito to return to the house it was here that her spanish blood asserted itself and she retorted you hava no righta to maka me go away misa freda go with me 

the surgeon was amazed and stepping forward attempted to administer a rebuke to the unfortunate quito but was restrained by freda saying surgeon fairfax no gentleman ever strikes a lady and taking quito by the hand she started for the house

one moment freda i have something to say to you

you will pardon me surgeon you may see me this evening and with a haughty mien as if hurt by the surgeons act she returned to the house

here were the lives of two unfortunates one blest with wealth but unhappy the other ignorant of the ways of the world but blest by having a benefactress and so although unhappy freda gleaned much pleasure by giving her life for the care of the unfortunate quito arriving at the house quito was sent to her room and freda sought her foster mother to map out the program for the following day

the many organizations for the relief of the unfortunate of which mrs fairfax was prominently associated gave freda an opportunity to be a valuable assistant she with others making garments for the poor visiting the distressed the penal institutions and calling upon the sick

one day while on an errand of mercy she was called upon to visit an old colored lady who was known throughout the neighborhood in which she lived as aunt maria this eccentric old lady had supported herself by telling fortunes but in later years her active mind became impaired by age and she lost manyof her patrons it was said that during her palmiest days she could relate the past and foretell the future of any one who crossed her hand with silver as they termed pay being well known the charitablyloving citizens cared for her in her cottage instead of having her removed to a charitable institution it was here that when freda entered she was greeted with sit down freda i knew youd be here astounded by being called by her name freda replied how did you know my name 

oh i know your mother i know your father then lapsing into silence she held out her hand

freda knowing the eccentric character of aunt maria opened her purse and placed in her hand a silver piece deep silence and a penetrating glance caused freda to feel very anxious and she wondered what could the old woman know about her could she really read from her eyes the history of her heritage with these perplexing thoughts she sat waiting for aunt maria to proceed still holding fredas hand in a firm grasp she said you were bom not far from richmond on a beautiful farm your father died when you were quite young your mother awaits your coming she has disowned you and is held by a great power her lips are sealed but some day the power that holds them will be broken and you will be happy with a satanic laugh she released her hand

freda knowing the weakness of aunt marias mind thought nothing more of the incident and having a basket of provisions to deliver she arose and to please the old lady she put her arms around her saying goodby aunt maria i will come to see you again

but there was no smile on the old ladys face and a penetrating look seemed to awe freda as she left the little home but once without her genial maimer returned and she felt that she had done one more commendable act in administering to the worthy poor

take me home james was the order given her coachman and very shortly she was entering the magnificent estate of rosewood

you must be tired my dear where have you been and what have you done was the greeting of mrs fairfax

oh mother i met the funniest old colored lady who could tell fortunes she told mine and the many things she said im going to see her again youll go with me wont you i cant tell all now im a little tired and hungry and laughing like a careless child she kissed her foster mother and rushed to her own room she was soon joined by quito who was to prepare her mistress for dinner and with the words what will you wear she began to disarrange her mistresss hair

seated around a beautiful dining table that evening was the happy fairfax family mrs fairfax just passed the prime of womanhood was tall and majestic one looking upon that aristocratic countenance would liken her unto the queen rose with every petal unfurled all of which added to its grace and beauty seated at her right was the pride and heir to the fairfax fortunes whose deep black eyes displayed the strong southern temperament inherited from his father in contrast on the left is freda whose childlike innocent expression seemed to have power to allay fear yet endowed with strong force of determination a sumptuous repast was being served and enjoyed and the world seemed to be at peace with all mankind each one seemed to be involved in his or her own thoughts as if awaiting the attack of the other

the surgeon realizing his hasty act during the afternoon sat waiting for a word from freda

mrs fairfax noticing the calmness between the two seemed at a loss as to how to break the monotony until she at last pleasantly remarked well is this a mum party 

freda not wishing her mother to know of the unpleasantness laughingly replied i was just thinking of the fortune teller after which she again related her experience

the effect was marvelous and that sombre party of a few moments ago are convulsed with laughter after the last course was served the party retired to the library mrs fairfax saying pleasantly surgeon you may smoke if you join us i have some plans to discuss with you and freda what do you say to a grand ball in honor of your past achievements

after many exchanges of views of which freda took little or no part the affair was settled and rosewood again extended to the social world the congenial hospitality it was so well noted for

mechanical genius coupled with the natural beauty of rosewood made a picture rivaling the splendor of the arabian nights on the occasion of the grand ball given in honor of surgeon fairfax the massive ball room with its mirrored floor the conservatory with its rare plants and flowers the extensive lawn with its many nooks and byways where little teteatetes could be enjoyed made rosewood an improvised garden of eden everything that wealth afforded was brought to bear to keep from this ball any approach of sorrow the foreign embassy the glittering uniforms of the american army and navy and the gorgeous costumes worn by the eastern potentates added lustre to the superb decorations mrs fairfax attired in a worth creation nobly bore her position as hostess freda in a very rich but simple gown was the center of attraction surgeon fairfax came in for his share of attention by designing young matrons while many retired widowers and bachelors past middle age gave an interesting glance at the hostess under the exhilarating influence of the inspiring strains of the musicians hid from view by huge palms the dancers flitted in and out

count schenzi of the spanish legation was very ardent in his attentions to freda and she seemed to encourage him coquettishly taking his arm she led him to the conservatory the surgeon noticing the flattering attention of the count seemed a little piqued but made no comment it was evident that he was ill at ease the count finding freda well versed in spanish was deeply interested

where did you learn my language he asked in his native tongue i would have thought you were bom in spain

i have a spanish teacher whom i dearly love and i will soon be able to speak as well as you count 

the count taking fredas shapely hand in his looked deep into her eyes and said miss waters ever since i first saw you i admired you and i have only awaited this opportunity to tell you that i love you i would deem it a rare privilege to return to my country with you as my bride

noticing the pallor depicted on that innocent face he released her hand then her selfcontrol returned and rising she said in a soft voice count schenzi i have known you so little i am sorry that any act of mine influenced you to make the declaration you have there are many more interesting girls than i and it is my wish that one so noble in birth may find one equal to grace the honored position as countess not one word more as he was about to speak you will take me to the ballroom and as if leading a tamed animal without one word passing between them freda returned on the arm of the count at the entrance of the ball room she was met by the surgeon who claimed her for a dance and she was soon a part of the gay throng

it was shortly after midnight that this gathering began to disperse and three tired souls glad of the social distinction achieved and to be alone once more rested

it was on the following day that a new phase in fredas life was to be encountered for it was while she stood looking out of the window of the library deep with her own thoughts that she was approached by the surgeon taking her by the hand he drew her to the big leather chair and with a motion of his hand bade her be seated then standing close to her and in a strong persuasive voice said freda my mother is getting old and she is all that is near and dear to us you remember when but a young girl you were brought to us by my dear father as a playmate for me you recall our childhood days romping over the hills and galloping over the plains those days were the brightest days of my youth after you became a young lady you were sent abroad to finish your education skilled in music and art you returned to us to brighten our home you went away a bright sunshine you returned a crushed flower instead of being full of life and joy you cared very little for the social world at your own sweet will you laid aside those talents that would make you the most admired of all women to enter the field of useful labor im not censuring you that is far beyond my thoughts and my sole reason for speaking to you now is to tell you what i have told you before  i love you if you refuse me it will break my mothers heart it is her lifes ambition i have everything to offer youâwealth and position tell me that you will be my wife and then as if his request was granted he attempted to take her into his arms

but freda like a frightened deer brought to bay gained her feet and standing erect she raised a restraining hand and in a clear voice replied surgeon it is far too true that i owe all to you and your dear mother for what i am today the care and education i received through the kindness of her heart i am extremely grateful for why did your father bring me here who am i why do i exist in this hall of mystery i see i live i love not in the world of life and happiness but to soothe the wounds of the unfortunate i give my all it is true that you have asked me to be your wife many times before and as i owe a debt of gratitude to you and your mother i now promise to become your wifeâon one conditionâthat when the mystery of my parentage is clear and you think then as you do now i give this frail life in payment for the blessings i have enjoyed in my youth now surgeon your plea is accepted leave me leave me i want to be alone   surgeon fairfax stood for a moment as one awed then bowing gallantly as if being satisfied with the progress made he left the room

once alone freda gave way to her sentimental nature and burst into a flood of tears quito in search of her mistress found her weeping as if her heart would break knowing that something unusual had occurred she gently raised her mistress and placing her tender arms around the slight form she was led to her room

surgeon fairfax went straight to his mothers apartments to tell her the joyful news

god bless you my son god bless you both and that mothers heart went out to her boy whose every wish was her prayer the world seemed full of joy for those two hearts without a cloud to darken the future but who can tell what will come to blight our lives and change our plans yet unseen providence allows us to go on and on catering to the dictates of our hearts until we arrive just at the goal and then exercising his superhuman power as to the success or failure of our wellset plans makes his choice

after a restless night freda awoke with the determination to live up to her hasty contract and with the sublime consciousness that she was paying a debt she again looked the world squarely in the face with that utter regard for the happiness of others

all without was joy the birds were singing their carols to their mates flitting from bough to bough while the rippling stream danced over the rocks and pebbles the trees bowed in supplication to the soft breezes that blew through their ponderous arms and gods sun looked down and smiled giving warmth to the earth that all the subjects of providence might be blessed

is there a man whose judgment clear can others teach the course to steer yet runs himself lifes mad career wild as the wave 

here pause and through the startling fear survey this grave

âburns

seated on a charger acknowledging the military salutation of subjects and friends rode general funston not far behind him came pete astride his favorite horse titus general funston was a wellknown figure in the capitol city and had gained the distinction of being one of the favorites of military society pennsylvania avenue was lined with many military and civil folks and beautiful carriages were seen everywhere the general being a widower it was hinted among the knowing ones that his mission to rosewood was not always to visit the surgeon he was a welcome guest at all times and we find him this beautiful afternoon galloping toward the grand fairfax estate

upon arrival the general ordered pete to take the horses to the stable and there await his order pete seemed very pleased to accompany the general as he too was anxious to pay an impromptu visit to one of the fairfax household after placing the horses in charge of the stable man pete decided on a course that would bring him near to the one whom he was so anxious to see when general funston was announced quito cast an anxious look into his face as if to say wheres pete and it is not strange to say that a way was found by these two to see each other

mrs fairfax greeted the general very cordially saying she was very pleased that he called at this time taking the general by the arm she led him to the library he noticing a gleam of pleasure pictured on that stately countenance gave himself credit for its appearance there

my dear mrs fairfax how beautiful you look today i know you must have expected me and im glad that i came i have been thinking of you since our last meeting

oh general i hope you wont allow me to charge you with flattery although i look upon you as my champion yet i have something of importance to say to you freda has promised to be my sons wife that is why i am so happy isnt it just grand i know you will agree with me that it is a perfect match and you will help us to arrange the plans for the wedding  

accept my congratulations i heartily agree with all you have said and im sorry that you will be alone therefore i should think

there there general this is no time for frivolity let us talk of the future prospects of the bride and groom

these two matured minds discussed the plans that would join a caged soul to a heartless keeper little knowing the deep thoughts of the captive or realizing the result of a loveless union

in the orchard down by the brook away from the shadow of the mansion were quito and pete forgetting the cares of their mistress and master wandering aimlessly from place to place seated on a rustic bench in one of the arbors they were startled by the sound of  pete pete   and looking up they saw the form of a military man they readily recognized an old friend and as henderson stepped forward grasping both their hands in his they were at a loss as what to say or do

dont be frightened my friends ill tell you why im here i came onto the grounds by the river bank and seeing you i knew i was safe so i waited this opportunity to give you this little surprise you well know that no one knows im here and no one will know if you have to tell them is this not so

as if thoroughly understanding the exact meaning of his words pete grasped the hand of his soldier friend and said sergeant no one saw you come in no one will see you go out im glad you came i know miss freda will be glad to see you shall i tell her you are here  

no you must not do that it will spoil my plans i have a very important message for her and must have an answer i can trust you thats why i came this way so as to avoid any unpleasantness in meeting miss freda and drawing from his pocket he placed into the hand of pete a sealed letter with these instructions give this to no one but miss freda get a reply and i will await your coming here will you do this for me

sergeant i would give my life to serve you you have been my friend and i will do anything you may ask me taking the letter in his hand he bade the sergeant to await his return and as if he were glad to do his friend a service he started for the house

turning to quito henderson bade her be seated but realizing how long she had been absent from her mistress she confidingly remarked no mr sergeant i must go back you know they misa quito and they all the time callâ quito coma here quito geta this quito geta that where hava you been quito so i musta go you waita right here mr pete will coma back soon and again grasping the hand of her soldier friend she dashed toward the house

she was none too soon for on entering the rear door she heard the frontdoor bell ring and rushing to answer its call she admitted colonel roswell

come right in colonel your friend is here the general funston soon the colonel was one of the party

i knew you were here general for i saw your horses in the stable where is the surgeon my dear madam i came especially to pay him a call

he is in his private study shall i call him

 oh no i will wait until he joins us

colonel said mrs fairfax im very glad you came i have a pleasant surprise in store for you and you shall know all about it very shortly i will serve refreshments to you gentlemen if you permit me arising she touched the bell which was answered by quito

serve the colonel and general with refreshments was her command and by the way quito tell the surgeon that colonel roswell is here now ill claim you two gentlemen as my prisoners until the surgeon arrives perhaps he may have something to say to you

when quito returned with the refreshments the party was joined by the surgeon

welcome friends twice welcome on this most auspicious occasion i have a surprise in store for you but first i must complete the details by procuring the principal in the affair you will pardon my short absence

after giving the usual salutation of his rank to his superior officers and with a smile that denoted contentment and satisfaction he went in search of freda he found her in the conservatory surrounded by palms and rare flowers gazing listlessly out upon the lawn in her hand she held a crumpled missive and being taken unawares was at a loss what to say when turning hastily around at the approach of footsteps she beheld the surgeon whom a short time ago she had given unto his keeping her future happiness

  are you looking for me   i am my dear there are some dear friends here who wish to see you i want to tell them of my happiness arid would like to have you at my side to receive the good will and congratulations

as he was about to draw her into his arms for one fond embrace she shrank from him and like a child playing tag she ran laughing to join the visitors followed by the surgeon

out in the shrubbery stood henderson having been joined by pete who said in a whispered voice i done it sergeant and when i seen surgeon fairfax come where miss freda was i had to scoot but i gave her the note and i know she read it cause she seemed to feel glad now you wait right here and ill run back to the house the general may want me make yourself miserable till i come backâand away he went

again left alone sergeant henderson took from his pocket a false beard remarking to himself if any of the watchmen or gardeners should see me they will not know who i am little did he dream while seated there alone with his own thoughts that he was discovered

there he sat dreaming dreams of the impossible happiness picturing in his mind faroff cuba a hospital tent an angel face bending over his prostrate form bathing his heated brow whispering soft words of sympathy imploring him to be brave will i see her again surely she would not let me go without saying a fond goodbye this was all he asked and why he wrote these words my dear miss waters i soon leave for the philippines and before going i want to again thank you for your past kindness to me i have refrained from doing this rash act for some time i know you will forgive me for becoming a slave to my weakness but there is one heart wish that i crave i must see you and say goodbye before i go i fear not death i could die happy after seeing the woman whose soul has made a slave of me grant me this one wish i will wait in the shrubbery for you or your answer devotedly yours henderson this was the missive entrusted to the care of pete for its safe deliverance and this important message was what she was reading when surprised by the surgeon this crumpled note was hidden in the folds of her dress next to her heart it was no wonder that she was perplexed as to what to do or say when ushered in where the guests were assembled and she stood as though sentenced to be hung awaiting the will of the executioner

friends miss freda waters the playmate of my youth has consented to be my promised wife i crave your blessings

there she stood in all the loveliness of her youth yet with a dark guilty conscience accepting the good will of her friends

let us drink to the health of the future surgeon and mrs fairfax was the toast tendered by general funston again and again the happiness of the pair was drank by the friends here the gods of happiness reigned while near by out in the shrubbery a bitter personal encounter was being waged henderson having been discovered by the gardener attempted to hide passing in and out among the trees closely followed by his pursuer he was about to make his escape when fired on by the gardener the shot attracted the attention of the mounted officers on the road and they soon had henderson under control being disguised he did not resist arrest

we found him hiding in the shrubbery was the answer given to the inquiry of what has he done

henderson believing that silence was golden refused to state who he was or why he was there

we will take him to the house and let the family look him over they can make the charge

fitting the action to the word henderson was brought to the house the little family gathering was ruthlessly interrupted

we found this man hiding in the shrubbery preparing to break into your house said the gardener when the prisoner was led before the guests in calling upon him to surrender he attempted to escape i fired at him closed in on him and after a pretty hard struggle we brought him here a look of consternation was pictured on the culprits face and under that disguise his guilt was quite apparent

why should you harm us who are you mrs fairfax asked but before an answer could be returned the surgeon rushed toward henderson as if about to do him bodily harm

stop surgeon wait said general funston let me talk with the prisoner

this is no time to talk replied the surgeon this black dog secrets himself in the shrubbery of our home there to wait the coming of darkness to force himself into the house to rob and perhaps murder he should be shot at once and ill see to it that judge lynch shall take full charge of this black villian

freda regaining her composure scanned the prisoner carefully for some sign of recognition and in her natural quiet manner she implored forgive him mother he has done no harm in honor of this day we shall forgive him

general funston noticing the broad shoulders of this military man said i will talk with him and going toward henderson he tore the mask from his face and there stood a hero of numberless battles dethroned and disgraced branded as a burglar with a look of utter dejection unable to say one word in his defence he awaited the action of that impromptu court accepting a decree of those judges

with a superhuman effort freda regained her self control inspired by that bitter personal hatred for henderson surgeon fairfax again attempted to draw his revolver colonel roswell stepped between and in a commanding voice said one moment fairfax he may be a burglar and he may be guilty of an attempted crime but the laws of the land must be respected he must have a fair trial henderson what does this mean  it means that i have been drinking and without funds and wanted money i am guilty of all you say come officers do your duty and take me away

as the officers were about to leave with the prisoner freda rushed toward her mother throwing herself at her feet mrs fairfax when a child i was brought to you and from then i have known no other love but yours all that i have received you gave me all that i have is yours i am your slave body and soul there is no wish that i ever craved that you in the kindness of your heart ever refused and i have never asked for anything only that which my heart craved i now pray to you the prayer that we will make before the judgment seat of him who will judge us as we have judged those who have sinned against us to release this man and you will be granting me the wish of my life

before she could be restrained freda fell fainting at the feet of mrs fairfax rushing to her side colonel roswell tenderly raised the fainting girl and giving her into the care of quito who assisted her mistress to her room he turned sharply to the surgeon and in a soft but commanding tone said surgeon fairfax this man whom you accuse is not the man who would commit a crime and when i look back to the time when i was surrounded by the enemy and my comrades were shot from my side there i saw out from the smoke of battle this man fighting his way towards me when hope seemed almost gone i saw the whiteness of his teeth and heard his strong brave voice cry hold your own colonel were coming they came and that day will never be forgotten i trust that in the memory of those days you will forgive and release him henderson i am sorry and i shall personally see that mercy is shown you though you may be guilty

fairfax about to lose an opportunity for revenge with his hot southern blood boiling to a fever pitch shouted it shall not be i the master of this house command that this selfconfessed criminal be punished he did not deny it why should mercy be shown he is guilty and i shall see to it that hell never cross my path again and with a wave of command henderson was taken away

thus the gods of fate played their allimportant role to blight the lives of those who so short a time ago were blessed by the gods of love

a mind thats truly brave stands despising storms arising and cant be made a slave

in the district of columbia criminal cases are handled by agents of the national government the proceedings and the course pursued by the prosecutor are in a measure the same as used by the prosecutor of the states or counties the charge of burglary made against a united states soldier one whose past military record had brought him prominently before the higher officials of the government was most unusual the newspapers in glaring headlines described the crime and from a prejudicial viewpoint laid great stress on the confession made by the culprit the day of the trial brought to court men of every race creed and position

henderson declining all legal aid places his friends colonel roswell and general funston in an embarrassing position he had declined all proffered offers of assistance saying they caught me with the goods why should i squeal i will take my medicine like a man and within the silence of his own melancholy thoughts he was proud to think he was making a sacrifice that would protect the fair and untarnished name of the woman who was all and all to him he would willingly suffer the ignominy of his own future that no harm might befall her thus we see that the position of his friends who would give their lives for his freedom was most arduous when visited in his cell by colonel roswell henderson feigned illness that he would not be subjected to examination by his friend which might lead him to miscarry his own set plan

henderson a word with you you must tell me the truth you are charged with a grave felony and you are an honored member of the military family of this great country if you go down into disgrace youll blemish the character of your comrades you will darken the prospects of your race and bring sorrow and pain to those who love and honor you  i know and you know that you are not guilty it is your duty no matter whom you wound to tell the truth

colonel i thank you you have known me for some time but you only knew the good that was in me nothing more i have confessed what more is there to do the law must take its course you have been kind to me and i appreciate your noble sacrifice i am decided upon the course which i will take and i will not change i trust you will think kindly of me for what i once was and not what i am today

colonel roswell for the first time in his career as a soldier lost his manly composure and wept like a child and as he left that cell he swore that in spite of all henderson would never serve one day for the offence charged against him

sergeant henderson to the bar

silence reigned in that crowded court of justice the heavy breathing of those seated was most oppressive a tall dark manly form was brought forth as the clerk read the charge and the learned judge asked how does the prisoner plead henderson with a strong manly voice was about to speak when a young woman dressed in black with a veil covering her beautiful face arose and with both hands outward stretched toward the prisoner as if to mutely say i will save you said stop this must not be and as if carried away by the excitement of the moment she swooned

tender hands assisted her to the anteroom of the court and when order was again restored there was a hurried consultation between attorneys on both sides and colonel roswell at its conclusion the prosecutor for the government arose and addressed the court saying judge your honor we ask that the proceedings in this case be postponed for future investigation there are some perplexing facts to be brought out and i ask you to adjourn these proceedings and the prisoner admitted to bail

thus we find even though we sometimes are willing to make grave sacrifices for others right will triumph over might henderson was released under bonds reported to his commander and it was not very long before he was enroute with his regiment to new fields of military activity

the outburst of freda in the crowded court room was credited to her sentimental nature and it was said that she could not even bear to think that misfortune would come to any one fairfax chagrined at the unexpected ending philosophically accepted fates decree roswell elated at the outcome knowing full well the innocence of henderson and the scandal averted congratulated himself upon the success

there was not a word spoken between freda surgeon fairfax and mrs fairfax on their return from the trial and as the big touring car drew near the gates of rosewood only the sudden stopping of the machine aroused them from their reverie after assisting freda to alight the surgeon seemed lost within his own thoughts

is it true that this woman whom i love and who has promised to share my future could be in a conspiracy with this black othello could she be as desdamona who gave up wealth and social position no it can not be he has bewitched her and the power he has exercised over her can only be obliterated by death for as long as he lives she will never cease to think of him from that moment a determined resolution was made by fairfax strengthened by that deep southern hatred to remove once and forever the only barrier between him and the woman he loves

after the evening meal freda retired to her own apartments throwing herself prostrate upon her bed gave way to her womanly impulses and wept

mrs fairfax was perplexed and said to her son im glad it is over why henderson should come here in the manner in which he did is a mystery to me my son what do you think 

surgeon fairfax decided to confide in his mother all he knew relative to henderson and freda he recited to her the charge of the ninth cavalry on san juan hill the rescue of colonel roswell and the wounding of henderson the story told by roswell of the bravery displayed by henderson how freda being in charge of henderson heard it all and that they were often seen together after he was able to be about

this story was a revelation to mrs fairfax but with a mothers deep love for freda she permitted herself not to think ill of her foster child and laughingly remarked oh you great big baby could you be jealous of this impossible rival you know that freda loves you or she would never have promised to be your wife so lets take an optimistic view of the situation and forget the disagreeable happenings of so short time ago come my son you cant afford to be morose we must all be happy for our future is of the brightest possibilities

but what had the future in store for this passionate lover who could foresee who could foretell the impending climax our future and our destiny are shaped by the guidance of providence

we have no alternative only to accept the allotment granted us we may plan and look forward to a time when we may achieve some great undertaking in love as well as in other pursuits we are but an instrument in the hands of him who controls the earth the sky and the seas with his mighty power he controls the storms in its rage of destruction saving those of his will we know not why and there is no appeal only to accept the divine decree

having taken possession of the philippines the united states issued a call for nurses which was readily responded to by the red cross and many other societies freda was one of the first to answer the call giving as an excuse that she would submit to the call of her heart in administering to the wounded finding entreaties of no avail mrs fairfax with a true motherly spirit gave freda her blessing with this provisoâthat surgeon fairfax would again resume his duties in the army that he could be near to shield his promised bride

abroad the transport america speeding ten thousand miles away from home and loved ones to take up the arduous labors of doctor and nurse for the glory of the stars and stripes were freda and sergeant fairfax anxious hearts wished them bon voyage and prayed that god would care for and return them to those who loved them it was a sad day when mrs fairfax returned to rosewood what was wealth what was social position what was this world to her when all that she had was separated from her but she was comforted by this thought that they would soon return with new laurels and nothing then could take them away again this noble woman who had done so much for charity and assisted the unfortunate sat and sighed when she thought of that passage of scripture which reads the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of them that hate me these distressing thoughts made her ask herself this question must i suffer the sins of my father she knelt and prayed that she would be one of the last verse which reads i will show mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments these comforting thoughts had a tendency to reassure her that her life was of such that would bring reward only to the faithful

like a huge swan rode the transport america over the raging sea she was one of the products of american genius and majestically buffeted the angry waves in mute defiance on board were hearts thrilled with patriotism soldiers and seamen each man eager to reach the scene of action so that he may add one more star to his individual crown in company with those rough and determined sons of liberty were a number of soft soothing hearts whose interest was to bring a godlike influence over their companions and to tender aid in times when only the physical power gives way it is then that all men look to the soft hand of a woman as a child looks to the caresses of its mother

among that number of living angels was freda clad in a delicate blue with an emblem of the red cross upon her arm the america after a few days out from port with her machinery working harmoniously and all well on board seemed to be proud of her burden and coming proudly out from a few storms rested quietly on the smooth sea it seemed as if she was guided by an unseen hand and although piloted by experienced and trained masters the allseeing eye looked down and shaped the successful course

to break the monotony of time diverse sources of amusement were proposed and among the many was a musicale to be given in the salon and on the program was the name of freda who had volunteered to render two vocal selections after the evening meal the band played the opening number a medley comprising patriotic airs concluding with my country tis of thee all present arose joining in the chorus near the last miss freda waters was introduced and she chose for her selection that old inspiring song just a song at twilight and in the course of its rendition her thoughts seemed to leave those who surrounded her to join with those who were far away and when she came to the part of the song which says  though my heart beat weary sad the day and long

a tear escaped from her eye and she pictured a tall dark military form standing in the shrubbery awaiting a fond good bye

the song ended and amid deafening applause she was asked to sing again awakening from her lethargy and realizing that she was only an instrument of pleasure for those aboard she responded singing coming thro the rye the lightness of the character of this vocal effort seemed to lift her heart from a load of depression she was soon one of the happy throng and the center of attraction surgeon fairfax seemed a little piqued at the attention shown her and instead of feeling proud of her accomplishments he sulked in an envious mood that brought forth much criticism and words of derision why the surgeons jealous see how cross he looks i feel sorry for the poor fellow   and other taunting remarks were passed

freda noticing the attitude of the surgeon towards his comrades went to him and looked tenderly into his eyes saying come surgeon you may take me on deck where i can enjoy the nights cooling breeze and we will talk of home

these words had a comforting effect he gallantly gave freda his arm and they were soon strolling the companion deck

after the program was completed dancing was indulged in until the wee hours of the morning here we find out on the boisterous billows life in all its tending glory beaming and smiling on hearts far from home in the care of his infinite power quietness reigned supreme only those on watch were awake to guard against any possible harm that may arise and the ship rolled on

land a hoy was the welcome cry one pleasant morning when far out in the distant horizon a dark narrow strip was observed by the man on watch as the bow of the america  forged forward seeming ever eager to decrease the longitude that would bring her nearer to port the pleasure that had surmounted many faces gave way to one of serious thoughts of what the future would bring forth orders were given by the officers in charge to prepare for landing and soon this craft bearing the sons and daughters of liberty was at anchor

the welcome demonstration to the america by the seacraft lying in harbor gave a new impetus to the ambition of those on board the shrieks of the smaller craft and the booming of cannon of the old seafighters seemed to say to the america we are glad that you have come soon tug boats and lighters ran alongside and the task of unloading was begun a launch bearing the crest u s n was one of the first to reach the transport important cablegrams and cipher messages were given to the commanders and officers they contained orders from washington as to the plans laid out by the commander of the army and navy the health officers giving a clean bill permitted soldiers to leave ship the nurses were taken ashore and proceeded to the legation at manila all seemed pleased to be again on terra firma but oh how different from home and what work would be expected of this large family it was but a short time when a separation was effected by the commander in charge detachments were sent hither to one place or another some to guard the roads leading to the capitol others the commissary and some were sent on scouting expeditions in the harbor of manila lay several transports which had preceded the america on board of one of these was sergeant henderson in company with his famous ninth and tenth cavalries he had been ashore for some time and knew nothing of the coming of his souls ideal and his arch enemy surgeon fairfax will he never escape him will it bring him happiness to learn that although he will soon see her yet he will be hounded like a criminal the memory of that fateful day clings ever to him the note the shrubbery the discovery the accusation the trial and his release were like a specter ever ready to haunt his dreams and to appear at all times when life seemed bright it is thus the will of fate that no matter where we are or where we go its everpowerful influences are keenly felt by us how to escape we know not only the power of faith brings us peace in the seclusion of our thoughts when night overshadows the earth and we are alone with only our conscience it is then we must bow our heads in earnest supplication to him who makes all things right that we may receive blessings for noble deeds and kind acts to all mankind

henderson the transport america is in the harbor and among the many passengers are surgeon fairfax and his fostersister freda this was the surprising news that greeted henderson when he returned to headquarters by his commanderinchief a rush of blood to the temples followed by rapid palpitating heart beats took immediate possession of the almost perfect physical man never before in his memory had this feeling of awe taken control of him there was a presentment of grave forebodings there are times in our lives when apprised by an enemy we are able to place ourselves on guard as a panther crouches for an attack when suddenly confronted by an approaching foe this intelligence perceived by henderson had an opposite effect and he knew not what to do what to say or how to act the dictates of his heart craved for a meeting with freda but the knowledge in satisfying his hearts desire would only incite acts of hostile intent by the surgeon in open conflict he had no fear of him or any other man but to harm him would wound her so after the temporary feeling had worn off he resolved that from that moment he would cease to see her thereby avoiding all unpleasantness he looked his commander straight in the face saying general it is a pleasure to know that our friends will be near us again but i trust our time will be short in these climes while here you may assign me to foreign duty if you like i would much prefer it   the general honored henderson and the deep admiration he had for this black hero was of such that he would lay down his life to serve him he thoroughly knew the situation and the innermost thought of the sergeant he pitied him and firmly grasping his hand he said henderson i am your friend and i charge you to be on your guard at all times and to be guided solely by your conscience

i have no doubt as to your pure and good intentions and i trust you will ever be able to do what is right in the sight of god and man we have some unpleasant tasks to perform and i will need you after receiving reports as to the whereabouts of the enemy we will begin to straighten things out here without much loss of life and time you may return to your detachment and there await my orders it was during this period that scouting parties returning to headquarters reported the many bands of guerrillas who menaced the lives of the outpost and committed numerous depredations against life and property the destruction of these bands of marauders was a task to be attempted by general funston and his men many wealthy men had disappeared and were being held for ransom it was even unsafe for a young lady to be on the streets of manila without being properly guarded numerous detachments had been sent against these cowardly assassins but their knowledge of the country gave them ample protection many a brave soldier was shot from ambush without even a chance to fire in return in the city of manila the capital where the united states had chosen the headquarters for their army was found located at this place a modernlyequipped hospital with its corps of efficient nurses and doctors under the supervision of surgeon fairfax

on one pleasant afternoon a gala fete in honor of general funstons birthday was celebrated flags and bunting were draped on all buildings in honor of the occasion the bands from the various warships lying in harbor were present an extensive program was arranged including daring horsemanship a drill rifle contest wrestling fencing boxing and many other athletic exercises for which suitable prizes would be awarded to the successful contestants the hour arrived the guests assembled even the wounded were brought from the hospital in their invalid chairs the drill presented a most spectacular sight the difficult riding of the cavalry rivaled the feats of the russian cossacks the grecianroman bouts of wrestling demonstrated to the onlookers that there were men among them who had the brawn of the ancient gladiators the boxing bouts were of the most spirited and scientific character in all the day was spent in a glorious burst of patriotic exhibitions

amid the glow and splendor and the pleasant exchanges of the day there were some who could not share the pleasures of their comrades the men on guard at the outpost the scouting parties and the many detachments sent into the interior took from that fete many brave men who could have proven their worth as aspiring athletes among that number that had other duties to perform was sergeant henderson who was in charge of a detachment to round up the marauding guerrillas he had been gone for some time and no word had been received from him a feeling of apprehension for his safety was felt by his commanders after the day was well spent in pleasures befitting the occasion a grand ball at the legation being the climax and which was in the height of gaiety henderson returned a hurried consultation between him and the general of the condition of affairs was held and a new plan of action was inaugurated at this time soldiers brought to the hospital a wounded comrade while bending over him they heard him say send help at once a band of filipino bandits have captured some of our men before further information could be gotten from this wounded soldier he lapsed into unconsciousness

henderson said the general i must have reliable and trustworthy men to go in pursuit of those devils will you accept this commission it is beset with many dangers and requires a cool and level head select from your number only those whom you can rely upon in the face of danger when will you start   at once replied henderson

nearby unnoticed and unobserved stood surgeon fairfax they little dreamed that this man who had sworn to be true to his flag and country would plot the destruction of a brave comrade the feeling of hatred was so great that the desecration of the honor of his country was a small matter to him after the conference the general returned to the revelers and the legation was soon deserted

when all was quiet and the city asleep forms of five men were seen in the dim moonlight skulking in and about the legation anyone familiar with those forms could readily see that they belonged to a band that meant no good to those sleeping citizens there was one who did see them surgeon fairfax saw them while on an unfriendly mission and he soon recognized the leader whom he well knew fairfax alert followed the leader who was none other than pinto after several detours fairfax came upon him pinto feeling secure that he was unrecognized was about to pass when a rough hand was placed on his shoulder and he found himself looking into the muzzle of a revolver held by fairfax

throw up your hands pinto i know you what are you here for you are here for no good purpose how did you manage to evade the outpost speak low for if you make one cry i will send a bullet crashing through your brain

pinto surprised stood as commanded me mean no harm

you lie now listen i know who you are i know what you have come to do you have come here to rob the legation and perhaps murder come with me i have something to say to you and keeping his captive under cover he marched him to a secluded spot far away from the sounds of any of the guards he lowered his revolver and said pinto i have a job on hand and if you help me i will help you there is a man whom i want to put out of the way if you will do this i will let you go and give you one thousand dollars after you have done this work

 me do it surgeon said pinto

there are soldiers sent to bring you in and they have gone down by the four forks you will find them at the bridge they are in charge of a man named henderson now if you will guide me to the place one thousand dollars is yours will you do it he has an hours start of us but as you know the road we can overtake him

me do it me do it

in the gleam of the moonlight these two arch conspirators bonded themselves for the death of an innocent hero whose whole thought was to do his duty for the glory of his country pinto was allowed to go and give orders to his companions and in a little while two figures were seen stealthily evading the guards and were soon out on the highroads

henderson with a small detachment of men after reaching the four forks gave orders to separate each man taking a different course while he himself stood near the bridge in the stillness of the night this brave othello stood there his thoughts seemed to drift back to many incidents of his past life and in that faroff wilds he saw a face that smiled inspiring him with confidence to do his duty as his conscience directed he pictured a hospital tent and a sleeping woman resting in repose after a strenuous day dreaming of nothing but her duty toward mankind in the deep stillness of the night he prayed to god that no harm would befall her while thus employed with his thoughts he heard a sound and before he realized he stood face to face with surgeon fairfax disguised as a filipino they sprang at each other and were soon in a deathlike struggle taken unawares henderson was unable to draw his revolver fairfax attempted to pierce henderson with his sword but discovered that it was no easy task he was soon joined by another whom he recognized as pinto henderson being of an athletic build was almost a match for both of them and after wrenching the sword from fairfaxs hand he was able to draw his revolver and fire the shot was heard by some of the men and fearing capture they escaped

before accompanying pinto on his dangerous mission fairfax assumed a disguise which in his mind would assist him in carrying out his nefarious project after his escape from henderson he was forced to leave his sword behind he little thought henderson recognized him but the knowledge that henderson had his sword with his name engraved upon the blade gave him foreboding thoughts of impending danger how to establish an alibi he did not know after arriving at the legation he returned to his apartments and from all appearances was surgeon fairfax again

henderson being joined by his comrades who hearing the report gave orders for a courier to return to the legation he fully recognized his assailant as fredas foster brother then looking at the sword his suspicions were confirmed

what shall i do if i denounce this man as a traitor it will break her heart to remain silent is a gross neglect of duty the general shall know  with this determined thought he too returned to the legation having been preceded by the courier who in a measure exaggerated the facts as to the encounter when henderson arrived he was met by the general and other members of the staff

freda hearing of the skirmish in which henderson was personally engaged was the first to greet him with are you hurt

the general heard the report of henderson in which he told of his meeting with pinto henderson looking into the face of freda decided to remain silent as to his real assailant and turning said general there is a traitor among us you shall know who it is later but before he answers to uncle sam i swear by the gods he shall answer to me

from the dark ages of the night

men of brawn men of might come hence to fight for right

âgilmore at the mouth of the james river in the state of virginia in the year  a strange vessel dropped anchor opposite the little settlement of jamestown this ship carried twenty negro slaves and was the first slave ship to enter these shores but history tells us that prior to this time slaves were sent to the west indies as early as  from the beginning the advent of negroes into the united states as slaves and their natural physical power made them valuable assets to their masters to do hard work and suffer hardships these qualities would naturally make him fit if properly trained to be a good soldier

negro soldiers have fought in every war and have at all times proved their worth in the war of  they were conspicuous in the battles of new orleans and lake erie no race ever fought more earnestly to gain its freedom than in the civil conflict in the revolutionary war the negro soldier did not fight side by side with his brother but was scattered among the white soldiers and at that time history tells us his sacrificing love for his comrades brought him into favor with his commander it is well known that the first blow for freedom in the revolutionary war was struck by crispus attucks on the boston commons and as the first blow for freedom was from a negro from that time natural love for country and home grew from the war of rebellion april   the th massachusetts volunteers was raised and recruited for service they comprised the free negro from the northern states the first engagement in which the colored soldiers took part was the assault on fort hudson la may   made by the troops under general banks although suffering heavy losses they fought with bulldog tenacity and determination

the assault on fort wagner by the th the battle of honey hill and other numerous engagements taxed the true worth of these brave men it was in the assault at fort wagner when general shaw fell dead at the head of the negro regiment and there mingled some of the best blood of new england with that of these black men whom he had volunteered to lead in the fight for the freedom of their race it was in the same battle that sergeant william carney of the th massachusetts though wounded in the head shoulder and in both legs carried the national flag of his regiment across the open field which separated him from safety where he handed it over with these words which made him famous dey got me boys but de old flag neber touched de ground

in the campaign which resulted in the fall of richmond june   colored troops captured seven guns in front of pittsburg and on july th they took part in the disastrous attack at the  crater in which four thousand men were wounded lost or captured in the fruitless and hopeless assault when general weitzel took possession of richmond on april   he was commander of a corp made up entirely of negro soldiers it was a negro soldier who hauled down the confederate flag and it was negro soldiers who assisted in quenching the fires which had been started when the confederates evacuated the city thus saving the helpless citizens who were left behind much loss and suffering

this illustrates to what extent the colored troops were called upon to maintain order in the confusion and anarchy which reigned at this time in the capital of the confederacy two years before the same general weitzel who was in command of the negro troops and who at this time took possession of richmond wrote to general butler to be relieved of his command in louisiana because as he said he could not command negro regiments

the services which the negro troops performed in the civil war fighting for the freedom of their race not only convinced the officers who fought by their side that the race deserved to be free but it served to convince the great mass of people in the north that the negroes were fit for freedom it did perhaps more than any other one thing to gain for them as a result of the war the passage of those amendments to the constitution which secured for the colored race the same rights in the united states that are granted to white men

the troopers of the ninth u s cavalry bards have told the ancient story how horatio held the gate and preserved the roman city as her chronicles relate

men have wondered at the gallant charge of englands light brigade on balaklavas bloody height by tennyson portrayed  but i will tell you of as brave a deed a grander nobler sight than rome or balaklava saw a deed of courage bright the halo of whose glory adds new luster to the charms that gild the world of chivalry with valiant feats of arms

on colorados distant plains a small but gallant band beleagured round by savages had made a desperate stand

outnumbered by four to one they bravely made dispute with those cossacks of the western world the wily vengeful ute and though comrades fell around them to be numbered with the slain and others writhed in agony upon the sodden plain yet the living never faltered but with cheer and rifle crack boldly flung the foe defiance oer deaths beaten bloody track

small hope had they of succor sure relief was far away while between them and assistance scores on scores of foemen lay

they were hedged about on every side pent up in dread corral of savage hearts implacable as demons hot from hell

but yet though belted round with death their hearts were undismayed though breathed upon by fiery breath no soldiers cheek betrayed the fear that makes men cowards but like spartas deathless band each won a name and linked with fame the honor of his land

full three score leagues and ten away from wars red slaughter pen with dodge and hughes of saxon blood are eight and thirty men aye men as you shall truly own though on each dusky face the god of nature has affixed the seal of africs race

and men whose deeds shall live in song whose story shall be told to generations yet to come and be inscribed in gold upon the page of history to show how saxon daring once captured fame with sons of ham the great achievement sharing

the men are loitering about as soldiers do in camp while up and down along their beats the watchful sentries tramp the horses picketed close by the blankets all outspread the tents and wagons and the sky serene and blue oerhead make such a scene as painters love a sceneâhalt who comes there

rings out the challenge clear and sharp upon the crispy air

a friend advance and at the word rides rapidly in view a haggard form who quick dismounts within the ranks of blue

your captain i am here said dodge what message do you bring

a wordâenoughâblow trumpets and make the echoes ring

our comrades are surrounded but though foes are ten to one well ride them through or die like men ere sets tomorrows sun

then sounded boots and saddles and the troopers gathered round

a moment more and every form was lifted from the ground and upon their good steeds seated all were galloping away to the place where danger threatened and their comrades were at bay

those eight and thirty troopers with their leaders true and tried abandoning their baggage wagons tents and everything but their carbines and their sabers and like birds upon the wing from the golden light of morning until sunsets latest glow sailing swiftly oer the prairie with their faces to the foe sailing swiftly on and steadily to reach the distant goal with their hearts as true to duty as the needle to the pole

morning came and when the sun began to build his golden bridge oer the mountain tops and valleys there looked down from lofty ridge forty horsemen who had ridden all the livelong night in fear lest they saw not on their coming what their vision made appear

below them in the valley lay a scene to make men quailâ a handful of their comrades stormed upon by leaden hail while from rocky bluff and canyon to the valleys velvet turf lay the shattered wrecks of heroes cast ashore by bloody surf

sound a call upon your bugle then said dodge and at the word the trumpeter gave a blast that sleeping echoes stirred and merrily the music swelled and floated far away bearing hope into the valley where the leaguered blue coats lay who gazing eagerly aloft first caught the brilliant gleaming of weapon bright and then beheld the troopers guidon streaming

then cheerily they answered back a joyful hopeful greeting and bugle spoke to bugle echoes clear the sounds repeating

the heavens looked in wonder at the signal bugle callâ down rushed a living avalanche while ring and pop of ball and foemens shouts and cries of pain resounded on the air as the horsemen rode to glory through deaths intervening lair as they cleft the savage phalanx like a mighty wedge of steel leaving here and there a fragment crushed by valors iron heel

then the heroes in the valley saw a gallant deed well done then the troopers of prairie fame immortal honors won

on that ride from hill to valley not a trooper held his seat for of all their forty chargers never one had kept his feet but had fallen neath the leaden blast that swept the fearful path leading down from the summit through the dwelling place of wrath

yet the god who rules the tempest warded off each fated stroke till within the frail intrenchment they had planted sure relief building bulwarks of their bodies until succor came in chief

twine a wreath o grateful nation to adorn each dusky brow they have proved it true that chivalry is more than empty vow

honor too their gallant leaders who have scaled the heights of fame and whose valor adds new luster to the anglosaxon name

tell the story to your children o ye mothers of our land to each their noble daring tell them how a faithful band won the royal right forevermore to wear the knightly crest when they carved their faith to glory through the cossacks of the west

since the death of old hezekiah williams the homestead had been maintained by a firm of solicitors who was in charge of the estate of colonel fairfax it was said that the colonel made provisions in his will for the maintenance of amanda williams hezekiahs daughter she had lived there for years with one or two near relatives who were companions the farm was in a prosperous condition and it was said that hezekiah left his daughter well to do amanda williams the mistress of the farm had been a sufferer for a long time and it was said by knowing ones that she would not live very long any one who had talked with amanda saw at a glance that the sweet kindly face of this woman had a deep sorrow that no one had ever been able to fathom

one day there came to this ancient homestead a bright and cheerful woman whose glowing eyes and kindly trait of character bespoke of one endowed with the spirit of godliness the coming of freda to this home brought a ray of sunshine into the life of amanda williams it was here that freda first saw the light of day the invalid mistress was her nurse she had not seen her for years as they had never met since freda was five years old amanda always longed for her return and she prayed god nightly that he would spare her life that she might again see the child whom she loved as her own realizing that the shades of time were about to be drawn on her eventful life she wrote to freda praying her to come so that she might once more see the child who was all and all to her when freda received the summons in these words my dear miss waters you no doubt have forgotten me as you were but a babe when taken from me i was your nurse and i am soon to leave this world you will grant me this request come to me that i may die happy

from your old nurse amanda williams

she hastened to comply and once more she was in the home of her youth

when freda arrived the effect upon amanda was miraculous the pallor left her cheeks the luster in her eyes turned to brightness and the melancholy expression turned to laughter the household commented upon the marvelous change of the invalid freda too seemed happy for here in this humble home she found true love and it seemed as if a severed link was again united it was here in this home that the secret of her heritage was guarded this woman whom we know as fredas nurse was the keeper of the knowledge that would clear a mystery of long standing which meant all and all to the future happiness of this red cross nurse

once when alone with amanda freda placed her arms around her neck and said to her amanda you can make me the happiest of women if you will tell me who i am who was my mother who was my father  amanda you were my nurse you know all if you love me as you say you do you will grant me this wish my life has been unhappy from early youth because of the knowledge that i was a stranger in a strange land

amanda overcome by the entreaties of this fair girl broke down and wept and feebly she pleaded i cannot i cannot the voice of the dead forbids  forgive me forgive me   freda fearing a nervous breakdown tenderly embraced her and said  there there i will wait until you are a little stronger

on opening her mail one morning freda was surprised to receive a letter from henderson which read my dear miss waters it has been some time since we have seen each other after returning from the philippines i found that you had preceded me i have been in my home town since arriving in america through an indirect way i learned of your whereabouts and if you will pardon the liberty i take i will ask that i may see you for a short time it is of vital importance to the honor of your foster brother and i feel that my duty as a soldier and loyalty to my country must be regarded above all else you may assist him and myself your decision in the matter will be final i await your reply

faithfully yours sergeant henderson

carefully reading this strange missive freda resolved to send for henderson and she immediately wrote the following answer sergeant henderson u s army washington d c

my dear friend your ever welcome letter at hand it is needless to say how pleased i was to be honored by a word from you here in the home of my nurse i will be pleased to have you call i will make preparations for your coming and any assistance that i may render you or my foster brother i beg you to command

yours truly freda waters

p sâi anxiously await your arrival

this interview was not very beneficial to the physical improvements of amanda and she was forced to remain in her room

it was but a short time after the receipt of this letter that henderson arrived the meeting between the two was very cordial and incidents leading up to the present time were discussed freda stated that after she returned from the philippines life in the home of her foster parent was not very pleasant and she told henderson of a stormy scene between the surgeon and herself she also stated that at that time she received word from amanda and knowing that she knew the secret of her heritage she hastened there

do they know who this woman is will they not attempt to reclaim you do you fear the surgeon asked henderson

i do and im glad that you are here for i feel safe when under your protection answered freda

and well you may for i hold here the evidence against your foster brother charging him with treason and when presented to proper authorities he will be courtmartialed and made to suffer for his crimes and henderson then related to freda all that had happened on that eventful night when he was attacked by fairfax and pinto the struggle in the dark the capture of the sword with the owners name engraved on the blade the return to the legation his silence for her sake and at last his returnto the united states

the narrative deeply moved freda and she begged him to spare the surgeon for his mothers sake saying that she had released him of his promise as her affianced husband and that her future life would be devoted to the nursing back to health one who was all and all to her she had misgivings for the future and she told henderson that she had written to general funston who had taken such a fatherly interest in her asking him to come and help her clear the mystery of her early youth

you will not go sergeant until the general comes asked freda

no i will guard you as i would guard my own life until i know you are in safe hands i will always be near to serve you answered henderson

very soon the arrival of general funston was announced and the little humble home represented a military barracks

amanda seemed to improve with the arrival of the new guest and she laughingly remarked that the soldiers had taken possession of her home but she was a willing prisoner with freda on guard

general funston having taken a personal interest in fredas welfare and knowing of the will of the late colonel fairfax decided to acquaint freda with all the facts connected with the same after supper had been served the general called freda to one side and said i have something to say that will interest you do you want all to hear

general im here to clear up a distressing mystery associated with my past life and any information you may volunteer will be greatly appreciated do let us all hear your story said freda

all right then turning to henderson the general said well youre here sergeant im glad to see you here i learned that fairfax was the man who joined pinto the bandit to rob the legation and that he attempted to murder you at the forks when you led your men against his band of bandits now hear me from what i can learn colonel fairfax father of the surgeon and fosterfather of freda left a will in which he bequeathed ten thousand dollars to freda when she became of age as guardian of freda mrs fairfax has failed to turn over to freda the amount left by the deceased colonel the interest on that amount gives her enough money to use as long as she lives it was the object of the mother for surgeon fairfax to marry freda which would keep the fortune in the fairfax family

freda with a surprised look said can this be true i care not for the money all i ask is to be allowed to remain in peace to care for this dear old soul who is all and all to me i have no claim upon the fairfax fortunes so why should the colonel leave me anything i was nothing to him it was only through the sympathy of his dear heart that i was adopted

amanda sat as one stunned

the general thinking this was the opportune time to assist freda in clearing the mystery said mrs williams you will pardon me for taking this liberty in asking you a few impertinent questions i assure you that it is no degree of impropriety and you may answer or refuse at your discretion this girl freda whom we all love has made a deep impression upon my life her noble sacrifice to duty her tender loving nature and melancholy reserve has inspired me with the thought of assisting her in clearing the mystery of her life that one wish is her daily thought and nightly dream you alone hold the key as to who she is and who are her rightful parents

i cannot i cannot the voice of the dead restrains me oh that i could speak it would not make those happy who knew for the curse of cain would haunt them as long as they lived freda my child when a babe you nursed at my breast you loved me then you love me now i am happy too for you are with me when i die i die with the thought that you are happy now promise me no matter what ever comes you will not cease to love me even though you may learn the truth o lord my life struggles are nearly over inspire this heart to do thy bidding and if i should err judge me only for the sin i have done to myself thou hast forgiven me take me to thy home

there there amanda you have overtaxed yourself quito take amanda to her room said freda

when freda left the room with amanda and quito the general said it is all too strange i cannot understand henderson im going to ride to the city hall you remain here as i want a good soldier on guard this is no place for me i love to fight and i love to be opposed but when women cry i lose my heart 

freda on entering the room said sergeant henderson tell me what have you been doing since we last met    oh answered henderson they have shipped us from place to place and we have had no real action since our return to the united states freda i have some news for you my term in the army has expired now i want to leave with you a little secret will you keep it freda some time ago when lifes scenes were blank to me and no one seemed to care for me i gave my heart my life my soul to one whom i thought would give to me in return that which all men craveâlove from that time i have courted and have been true never giving a thought to another at the expiration of my enlistment i will return to that love and i wish you to bid me good cheer give me your blessing 

sergeant henderson your words are astounding oh why am i here to suffer more misery you might have gone to the other end of the world and i would have gone too praying that an enemys bullet would pierce you that i might care for you that feeble prayer will not be answered now oh why did you tell me this why is fate so cruel as to take you from me  do you find pleasure in crushing the heart of one who would give up her life for you who may i ask has won the heart of the bravest man in the world  questioned freda

my country freda pardon meâmiss waters as i told you before my term soon expires after seeing your safely into the care of one who will shield and love you and the fortune you have inherited being enough to satisfy your every wish i will marry my first love the only love i ever knew to fight for the glory of the stars and stripes before i go i will leave this sword the sword i took from fairfax the night he attempted my life i charge you to guard it and if he attempts to harm you the knowledge that you have holds the only evidence of his treasonable acts and will deter him from putting into execution any of his plots

a magnificent home but all that wealth and culture could add did not relieve the sombre influence that prevailed rosewood seemed cold outside all was grandeur and life nature had done her duty in blossoming her buds within the master and mistress struggled against the loneliness of their lives and the long association of freda and her fostermother brought only deep remorse to this good woman for the tenderness she had exhibited to one who was as near to her as her own child fairfax conscience stricken and fearing he would at any moment be arrested for treason seemed unable to get any comfort or peace of mind after the evening meal a loving mother and a hottempered man sat and talked

why did she go away mother when will she return

she has gone to the home of amanda williams who is dying who requested that she might see freda before she died answered the mother have no fear my boy she will come back as this is her home and although she is of the most lovable disposition you know she is decided in her views

mother she is my promised wife i will go and beg her to return if she refuses i will use force i will leave for virginia tomorrow you will accompany me for i cannot trust myself alone

fearing that her son had become desperate and knowing of the influence she could exercise over his movements she decided to go with him they made ready for the journey to begin the next day

separated from time to time by duty to their master and mistress the lives of quito and pete were not to their own keeping at each parting it was extremely heartrending from their meeting in cuba while pete was an attendant for general funston and quito became the ward of freda these two hearts met loved and longed for the time when they could claim each other general funston not knowing where he would be stationed and not anxious to lose his true friend and attendant never encouraged pete in his love affair but as providence brought these two lives together it seemed that there would be a fitting climax to this drama of affection quitos love for her mistress miss freda as she called her soothed her in a measure when she was separated from pete from cuba they met again in washington and again in the philippines peace was declared and freda returned to her home in washington when she was summoned to the home of amanda williams we find quito with her general funston receiving the request from freda and knowing the thoughts of his bodyguard pete decided to have pete accompany him pete little dreamed that he would again see his hearts desire thus we find the plans of cupid being carried out to the letter the meeting between the two was carefully noticed by freda and the general the surprise and pleasure depicted on the faces of these two dark lovers was a great pleasure to the general and was equally enjoyed by freda

wlio could foretell what was in store for all concerned the shaping of the destiny of lives is not with individuals in this humble home after many trials amid foreign surroundings and eventful happenings these hearts embodied with true sincerity of purpose high and lofty aspirations on one side mute and tenderness on the other is the problem soon to be solved by fate there is no denying the fact that no matter how wide the social gulf between freda and henderson the tender regard for each other was very prevalent it was admitted that freda regarded henderson tenderly accepting him on the ground that he was an extraordinary man a hero and though of a different race than she he occupied a position that brought him in favor with the entire world could she love him her childlike simplicity and christian feeling for every one was an apology for her acts toward henderson the sergeant realized that a union between the two was impossible and unable to combat the dictates of his heart he permitted himself to be a willing slave with no reward for the sacrifice

the coming of surgeon fairfax and his mother was like the arrival of a day of execution and henderson was perplexed as to what course to pursue he sought the advice of the general who could offer him no immediate relief but advised him to allow the events to take their own course and await the result

fairfax was accompanied by some civil authorities who had in their possession a warrant for henderson on the old charge and there was great excitement when an attempt was made to put into execution the serving of the warrant fairfax pointing to henderson said to the officers seize him arrest him

as the officers were about to execute his command henderson said one moment you are in the home of a dying woman and if there are any charges against me i will readily accompany you without force but i charge you that the first man who lays his hand on me will do so at the peril of his life miss waters will you please join amanda for a few minutes i have something to say that would be unpleasant for you to hear mrs fairfax i beg you to join the ladies you may return shortly now fairfax you at one time attempted to settle an old score with me why you should call it an old score i know not as i never laid a straw in your pathway but for some fancied reason you sought my life now the worm has turned and you shall answer to me for all you have done your charge for burglary will not hold these men dare not arrest me as i am sent here by the government of the united states to arrest you for treason and i hold as evidence this sword your name engraved upon its blade and the sworn confession of pinto your accomplice now fairfax there are two courses for you to choose you with your seconds will meet me tomorrow at five in the morning at the turn of the old road leading to the swamp you may have the choice of weapons and there shall be a fight to death i have no fear as to the result for one so despicable who will sell the birthright of his country to a hostile tribe cannot hope for success in an equal conflict if you fail to meet me i will haunt you to the four ends of the earth that you may be brought before proper authorities courtmartialed and shot down like a dog that you are you need not restrain him officers hes before his master now

like a wild animal held in leash it seemed as if fairfax frothed at the mouth the surprised look of the officers in charge as the accused became the accuser brought consternation upon the scene the hot southern blood of fairfax fairly boiled with indignation and revenge and with difficulty he was restrained from attempting personal assault upon his accuser at this juncture general funston arrived and taking the situation in at a glance he assumed personal command and gave orders that fairfax should be placed under arrest fairfax realizing the utter hopelessness of his case became calm and demanded that he be heard about this time freda entered the room and in a gentle voice said gentlemen you are in my house and i trust you will respect the same what have i done that i am indebted for this unusual visit surgeon

my dear mother and i have come to take you back to your home she is your guardian and you have promised to be my wife this is no place for you you have no right to be here it is true that we have had little differences but they should be overlooked i now demand that you prepare yourself to accompany us back to washington answered surgeon fairfax

mrs fairfax hearing the appeal came upon the scene and with outstretched arms she imploringly said freda freda my child say you will go general funston knowing the exact condition of affairs interrupted saying one moment mrs fairfax there is a fortune left this girl by the deceased colonel why have you not acquainted her with the fact why have you denied this girl that which is rightfully hers

mrs fairfax with bowed head and tenderness of love which characterized her deep feeling for freda and tears streaming from her eyes sobbed it is all too true the fortune is hers i have the papers here with trembling hands she drew from her bosom a small packet of papers

in an instant like a crazed tiger fairfax snatched the papers from his mothers hand and with an oath he screamed by the gods she shall not have them i swear she has promised to be my wife and i will hold her until her dying day

there were sounds heard from the other room as one trying to restrain another from coming upon the scene first the voice of persuasion then almost a command but it seemed of no avail the door leading from that little parlor to the room occupied by amanda williams was thrown open and a woman who but a short time ago was weak from a nervous depression stood erect in the doorway the fire showing in her eyes clearly depicted that a great load had been lifted from her heart unassisted she came upon the warring faction and with outstretched arms toward freda she clearly and distinctly said freda i am strong now god has released me from the vow i once made he will soon call me to my lifes account i have suffered all these years that you may not know that which would make you unhappy the remainder of your days you were taken from me when a child i was given a sum of money because of the fairness of your skin you were taught to believe that i was your nurse and that you were a waif upon the world i vowed never to divulge the secret you are my own child my own flesh and blood your father was none other than the father of surgeon fairfax

mrs fairfax almost overcome by the declaration of amanda exclaimed is it true is it true

it is true answered amanda and i vowed to the colonel never to reveal the secret the secret would have died with me but i must spare you and your son from a greater wrong freda forgive me forgive me   after hearing the confession of her mother freda rushed to amanda and throwing her arms around her neck cried amanda my mother my mother there is a millstone lifted front this aching heart that was bearing me down but the knowledge that you are my own dear mother who has suffered so much that i might be happy is all that i want in this world you will live you will live and we shall be happy mrs fairfax you have been good to me and you will forgive my dear mother as you hope to be forgiven surgeon in the memory of those days when we were young i forgive you for all you have done to me may we be friends as long as we live

the scene was one that left an indelible impression upon the minds of those present the declaration of amanda disclosing the secret imbedded in her heart for these many years the explosion of the shattered romance of surgeon fairfax the humiliation exhibited by his mother at the disclosures and the sublime contentment of freda demonstrating only the satisfaction that she had learned the truth concerning her ancestry made a vivid picture the gods of fate supplanting the gods of hate was a fitting climax to this eventful life

henderson stood as one stunned and with a thought that the realization of his dreams was near he seemed unable to grasp its great import she can be mine she can be mine   funston realizing a duty he was to perform was the first to regain his composure and stepping forward placed his hand upon fairfaxs shoulder saying surgeon you are my prisoner i charge you with treason consider yourself under arrest

a look of utter dejection was stamped on the face of surgeon fairfax and as the officers who were nearby were about to put into execution the command of general funston fairfax turned imploringly toward henderson i did not know that life could be so sweet i did not know the hours could speed so fleet till i knew you and life was sweet again the days grew brief with love and lack of painâ i was a slave a few short days ago the powers of kings and princes now i know i would not be again in bondage save i had your smile the liberty i crave

âpaul laurence dunbar

when old hezekiah williams purchased the farm from colonel fairfax he little thought what fate had in store for him and his colonel fairfax was known as a man with a kind heart always solicitous of the welfare of those whom he befriended bom an aristocrat reared in the luxuries of life a scion of a proud and noble family it was said that this man of prominence would not stoop to a degrading thought or act but we find that the dictates of conscience often varies to supply excuse for wanton acts as a welcome visitor to the home of hezekiah williams no suspicion ever entered the mind of the owner as to the intent of their honored guest

amanda williams the beautiful daughter of hezekiah received the colonel in the line of the family benefactor and she admired his noble traits of character his military bearing and often remarked that the colonel was like one of the family after the death of her father the financial difficulties confronting them and paying off the mortgage on the farm gave the colonel an opportunity to display greater acts of philanthropy towards these unfortunate friends

dont worry amanda he said one day after the death of her father i will be your friend and no harm shall befall you neither you or your mother shall want for anything as long as i am able to serve you but what was the price judge not ye that ye may not be judged

with full confidence in the colonels honesty of purpose amanda little suspected that those kind words coming from the lips of the man whom she regarded in the light of a family friend would leave her sorrowing for years to come

amanda said the colonel to her one day if you will guide me i would like to look over the farm there may be some improvements needed

all right colonel like a careless school girl eager to be of some assistance she took the colonel by the hand and they were soon wending their way to the farthest end of the estate coming to a little brook whose waters irrigated the soil and being tired they sat down to refresh themselves finding a part of a cocoanut shell which they used for a cup tenderly he stooped and with that gallant reserve of a knight serving a princess he dipped from the brook the cooling water as he gave it to her their eyes met and as she took from his hand the shell that contained the water a feeling of awe took possession of her trembling as a lamb would before the king of the forest the hot passion of blood rushed to the temples of the colonel which seemed to blind him his moral instinct paralyzed before he realized the enormity he threw his arms around her neck and kissed her passionately helpless in the arms of a stronger foe surprised beyond measure amanda was unable to defend herself or to offer one word of protest the tears rushed to her eyes and sobbingly she cried colonel oh colonel

releasing her for a moment and realizing his awful act he tenderly took her in his arms again saying amanda i love you forgive me for what i have done we are not responsible for conditions we have no control over ourselves it is true i have no right to approach you to subject you to any act that would blight your future say you will forgive me

colonel fairfax until now i looked upon you as the noblest of men never stooping to one degrading act it is true that my mother and i are your wards if it is your will you could drive us from our home my father being dead i am left unprotected i appeal to your noble manhood and if there be one spark remaining one sense of noble duty one thought of regard for your family i implore you to forget this day as god forgives so do i take me to my mother   these ringing words of censure coming from one so weak in physical force brought the colonel back to himself raising his hat he assumed his former gallantry and bowed saying we will return to the cottage we will forget the colonel vowed to himself that from that moment he would never see her again only when she was in company with her mother for he feared his weakness that he would never surrender to it

come colonel i know you didnt mean any harm we will finish what we set out to do see this is the storehouse for the tobacco it needs repairing

as if nothing had happened they discussed questions of interest for the improvement of the farm taking note as to what was to be done the colonel and amanda returned to the cottage after a few words with her mother he returned to his home amanda to think over the happenings of the day what could she do where could she go what would become of her mother if she should leave

in the solitude of her chamber she knelt and prayed to god that he would shield and protect her in the stillness of the night she was awakened in her dreams and a voice was heard to say amanda i love you do whatever she could she was unable to drive the echo from her mind and thoughts realizing her position the difference between the two races and the knowledge that the colonel had a family she saw in him her ideal but she must not entertain any thought that would bring her into disfavor with the world or to cause one pang of conscious remorse amanda vowed to be strong to defend herself for any indiscretion in the future

in a few days workmen and lumber arrived and the needed improvements were done after the painting of the cottage bams and outhouses amanda and her mother were surprised beyond expression what did the colonel mean to do were the improvements made for the disposing of the old homestead truly he could not hope to be financially repaid by two helpless women not hearing from the colonel they were left in anxious doubt a feeling of uneasiness was entertained by both amanda and her mother fearing at any time that they would receive notice that the colonel had foreclosed and would take possession of his own property one day a large van arrived containing carpets chairs and other household goods the man in charge handed a sealed letter to amanda the contents read my dear miss williams i am sending you some things which may be of service to you i am refurnishing rosewood and i trust that you will accept these in the true spirit of an old friend

very truly yours colonel fairfax

mrs williams overjoyed instructed amanda to send for the colonel that she might personally thank him not long after that the colonel arrived to look over the improvements and to receive the appreciation of those he befriended

how do you do colonel was the pleasant salutation given the colonel by amanda mother is not feeling well i will take you to her room

soon the colonel and amanda stood by the bedside of her mother

colonel said the mother i am so glad you have come im not so well today but we wish to say from the depths of our hearts we thank you for your kindness how can we ever repay you 

there there never mind all i ask is that you recover and now i must go and see how the work has been done

all right colonel amanda take the colonel around

it was this simple command unconsciously given by amandas mother to her that brought years of trial and sorrow for within a year a stranger appeared in that cottage its birth did not bring joy but remorse this advent shadowed the lives of two hearts mrs williams began to age and became weaker and weaker until at last she was called to her lifes account

the death of mrs williams and the care of the new arrival shattered the health of amanda but realizing the care of her child and the true mothers love gave her strength to fight the battle of life this beautiful baby girl showed not the least trace of negro blood we recognize our heroine   freda   carefully nursed by her mother she received the best attention that could be given any child the colonels visits were more frequent at the homestead amanda being the mistress no questions were asked by those who served her for more than four years amanda had the care of freda when at that time the colonel decided to rear the child train and educate her so that she may never know her true ancestry it was extremely heartrending when amanda gave freda to her father she onlysurrendered her child with the knowledge that she would protect its future the consideration of the annuity given amanda by the colonel did not influence her to make the sacrifice it was the mothers love for her child that freda would be far happier not knowing the true state of affairs

so we find freda at the age of five years adopted by her own father at the rosewood mansion her early life education works of charity and the engagement to surgeon fairfax were all eventful we find her now at her former home the home of her birth seeking some knowledge of her ancestry when amanda heard the declaration of fairfax that freda was his betrothed wife the breaking of her vow and the pleasure it gave freda for the knowledge she had so long sought was a fitting climax to the many perplexing problems

at the action of general funston placing fairfax under arrest it seemed to take from him all his manly power of resistance and his utter helplessness was evident who would save him appealingly his eyes turned to the man whom he had hounded and whose life he had sought would he exercise his prerogative or would he show mercy

the picture of a scion of a noble family condemned to punishment by one who was socially his inferior the weeping mother the rigid hand of the law and a happy woman made a contrasting foreground that no artist or poet could describe in word or brush fate is the artist and living souls the characters

after a deathlike silence the voice of henderson was heard to say general to convict surgeon fairfax for this grave crime you must have evidence that evidence i hold and may god in his infinite grace forgive him as i forgive suiting the action to the word he tore the confession of pinto into pieces two saddened hearts wended their way home to renew life under different conditions

the generals work being finished he gave freda his blessing but it was a sad parting for the general as he left behind one who had been with him for years when the choice was made between the general and quito pete said general i loves you you has been good to me and i would give my life for you at any time you know im gitting old and i cant travel like i used to miss freda told me i could stay here on the farm and quito has promisedâ to emphasize his thought he poked the general in the ribs general go to mrs fairfax you know dat woman needs you and you need some one to care for you its better to be head of rosewood than a target for the enemy although the general seemed loth to admit petes charges he decided within himself to adopt the course advised well goodbye friends i suppose a minister will be needed soon and you must have witnesses as he moved toward the door he added remember general funston after an exchange of departing formalities there remained but three

amanda turning to henderson with a look of tenderness overspreading her calmlike countenance said sergeant tell me your plans for i feel too happy to have one dark cloud appear

miss williams said henderson i must report for duty uncle sam has not released me so i will report to headquarters for orders

and taking the sword which was meant for his destruction in a determined directed blow he broke it across his knee

mrs fairfax unnerved by the act of this black hero threw her arms around his neck and cried god bless you  god bless you  sergeant god has sent you to this humble home to shield and protect two lone women it is true that the country needs your service but it is equally true that you are wanted here promise me that you will return to us that promise and the thought that freda will be happy will make my declining days peaceful

come mother let me take you to your room i fear the reaction will be too great for you excuse me for a moment sergeant i will join you in the arbor and with the tenderness that had characterized her whole life freda led her mother away

henderson left alone stepped to the door and called pete after passing a few pleasant words with his old friend he was joined by freda pete realizing his unwelcome presence made an excuse and was soon gone

a large grape arbor drooping vines rustic boughs that would grace an entrance to the garden of eden was where freda and henderson were seen to enter

the sun shone with gleeful radiance nearby the careless dancing of the water of the brook over the rocks the merry caroling of the birds in the trees and the perfume of the flowers were the homage given to the principals of this romance all was bright and gay and it seemed as if providence had prepared minutely the details that were to make this occasion most fitting cupid with arrow drawn ready to release at the given signal was the last important act

screened by the bars of nature the declaration of two hearts with the birds as the only living witnesses can best be described by the wordsâ  two souls with but a single thought two hearts that beat as one

emerging from their temporary haven there was a ruddy glow seen upon fredas face

i will look for you as soon as you are released

freda the time is all too long before my return but as god has been good to us both and if it is his will that nothing intervenes i will soon return to claim you as my own until then you will nurse your dear mother back to health and perfect all plans for the great event two strong arms were thrown around the slender form the seal stamped on the lips of the one who had given her future for the man who was her souls choice

a village church a noble gathering a perfect day solemn words prompt responses the pealing of the organ these were the crowning acts that cemented severed hearts
