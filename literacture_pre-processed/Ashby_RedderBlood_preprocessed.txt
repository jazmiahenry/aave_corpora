redder blood 

the most prominent and respected man in new york twentyfive years ago was stanton birch he was thirtyfour and he possessed a mind good looks and riches

there was nothing with which he was not conversant and concerning many things he had a profound knowledge art history science invention fiction womenâwith all these things he was more or less familiar if he had entered any of the several clubs of which he was a memberâthe albion the gilbo the east end athleticâwhile a controversy was going on in which neither participant was willing to admit that he was wrong they would have exclaimed heres birch let him settle the dispute and so much did they honor him that whatever he said was accepted ex cathedra and the disputations ended yet he was not a man of the world

he knew women and liked them but he detested the mothers that were ever sending him invitations in order to catch him because he was unmarried unrelated and wealthy

he did not even care for their join us tonight at wallacks box i to see modjeska ellen terry mac cullough or jefferson the invitations generally came from persons who were narrow devoid of artistic sense or unappreciative he sometimes accepted them however because he was sociable and he could not ignore kindnesses even though they were often shams or subterfuges

there was not a charity organization in new york that had not his name on the list of its contributors and he always responded to such appeals with liberal donations

but his pastime and his hobby were horses and the trainer and owner of the most fashionable ridingschool in the city said that he was the best horseman he had ever seen

he was a striking figure one bright morning late in november as he rode down fifth avenue on his superbly caparisoned arabian mare and turned at seventysecond street into central park

the air had in it a crispness that was enlivening a freshness that was energycreating with her head high in the air her eyes spirited her ears vacillating and her step lively the mare might easily have had her prototype in one of besnards sleek lifelike animals jaunting over a red sunlit moroccan hill

he rode her at a good gallop through the park until he came to sixtyfifth street near the animal cages and then suddenly a cry went up

he saw men women and children running like savages making the strangest and most hideous noises

turning he saw not far distant from him and approaching with accelerating speed a fireyeyed lion that had broken loose from one of the cages

the imperturbability that he always possessed did not forsake him so he put spurs to the horse this he thought his only hope but the mare had already been terrified by the roars of the oncoming beast and she ran wild

before him seemingly lay two paths to death if he could not fight out some way of escape the lion approaching him from behind would tear him into bits the mare if he could not drop from the saddle unhurt with her mad reckless running would be very likely to throw him against a tree or stone and dash his brains out

he quickly drew the reins to turn the mare behind a hedge but by his sudden drawing of the reins he turned her into a park bench which she had to jump her front feet went over like those of a trained foxchasing animal but the hind ones hung on the bench

she went down and stanton birch was thrown against a huge tree the wild beast alarmed did not stop for the fallen prey but kept on across to eighth avenue and through sixtyfourth street

one of the park employees ran to the spot where the mare had gone down there lay the rider limp and unconscious and the mare with a broken leg

as the fallen man was lifted up some one said my god its mr stanton birch every park employee knew him

the man felt stanton birchs pulse it moved faint and weak send for an ambulance he commanded hes still alive

from his pocket he took a flask of whiskeyâ one could not vouch for its qualityâand forced a little of it down mr birchs throat to warm him until the ambulance should come

in a few minutes the big red hospital wagon from bellevue arrived and took him away

in those exciting moments news of this accident had spread rapidly throughout the city every paper in town had an extra publishers and newsboys are always glad when something happens to a personage

over the whole city one could hear their yells extree extree  stanton boirch hoirtâextree extree  stanton boirch almost kilt by accident wid his hossl git em here two cents a coppee

as fast as the driver could he rushed the unconscious man to the hospital on twentysixth street

an examination showed that the blow had produced a blood clot in the cerebrum

every noted brain specialist and surgeon was sent for at once an immediate consultation was held undelayed action was imperative

scientific surgery was then in its incipiency even the most experienced surgeon would attempt so serious an operation with the gravest fear it required the most masterful piece of trephining one little mistake meant death yet it was the only hope

the operating table was put in order and the unconscious man was placed upon it his skull was opened and the wielder of the sharp instruments moved them with skillful accuracy around him stood the other surgeons with faces serious âhopefulâanxious

pretty young girls upon whom he might have cast a meaningless smile heard of the accident and hoped sincerely for his recovery who knows they soliloquized i may yet win his heart

the old darky headwaiter at the albion club ceased praying for the blessings of the deity on himself and his family and now supplicated him to restore to health missah boirch cause he sho is a good man he knew that mr birchs life meant fifteen or twenty dollars a week more to him the directors of the charity institutions were in a quandary whether they would rather have him die and thus take a chance on what he might will them or whether his yearly donations to them meant more was a problem that required close calculation but they too concluded that it would he better to hope for his recovery than to assume an indifferent air whether he died or not was immaterial to them so long as they were remembered

i believe the operation will be successful remarked dr post the head surgeon with confidence when he had finished the expression on all their faces became less tense more hopeful more confident send for miss marston the doctor continued

shes the pretty blackhaired nurse is she asked dr munn

without an equal to my knowledge answered dr post looking hopefully at the patient

a young lady of twentyâwith widely set tender generous expressive eyes â entered a sprightly little smile played around her lips

miss marston began dr post this is a very serious case and one that requires the utmost care thats why i sent for you   you are not to leave his bedside until orders come from me ill give you an attendant to wait on you if you notice any change if he seems to regain consciousness notify one of the surgeons at once you understand

i think so sir she answered

then i may trust you

ill do the best i can she replied

the doctors turned and left the room and miss marston went about her work with more than her usual assiduity and earnestness

for two days the patient lay in a state of coma the doctors came frequently always to hear the same reply from the pretty nurse no change

on the third morning miss marston who was dozingâshe had slept onlya few hours during the three days confinementâwas awakened by a cry of jump dell  jump my girl mr birch was regaining consciousness and was calling his mare to jump the park bench into which he had pulled her

the nurse immediately sent for dr post who found the patient sitting up in bed his eyes blazing with a wild expression

did she get hurt he asked curtly

did who get hurt returned dr post soothingly

my mare where am i anyway he demanded

in bellevue hospital was the reply

i want to go home i want to go home he said determined to have his own way

you are not well enough yet the doctor tried to convince him but without effect

i want to go home home he kept repeating

how do you feel this morning asked miss marston as she came into his room

never hungrier in my life he answered smilingly i should feel a thousand times better after some grapefruit broiled chicken and a pot of coffee

fish is a better food for you said the nurse

a flood of sunbeams searched into every nook and corner of the sumptuous room that overlooked fifth avenue and central park and a flood of the sunshine of happy hearts made glad by the approach of christmasâthe season when everyone everything is gladâcrowded stanton birchs heart as he looked out and saw the peddlers with their holly cedar and mistletoe as he heard the dingalingaling of the salvation army bell the happy children asking one another what is santa claus going to bring you and all the other messengers announcing the joyous holiday

just why miss marston should have been more anxious about this patient than about any of the others that she had nursed she couldnot understand

fresh in her memory were many distorted faces and numbers of painracked bodies some of which she had nursed back to health and others that the unconqucred conqueror had taken for his own

to all these she had been faithful dutifulâ she had given to them every attention in stanton birchs behalf she had given even moreâ her prayers she was certainly too sensible a girl to imagine herself in love still the little fancy came and she beat it back with all her might but each time it returnedâreinforced

oh pshaw she would say a thousand times a day i have no feeling for this man why then would come the inner response do you drop every spoonful of his medicine with so much more care than you ever did for others why is the touch of your hand so much more gentle and soothing when rubbing his bruises why do you always end your prayers with and most of all god grant me my earnest supplication and restore mr birch to health 

she turned to give him an aftereachmeal dose from the bottle labeled shake well before using and found his eyes fastened on her for a moment she was confused but she regained her composure almost instantly

before eating his breakfast stanton birch fed his eyes his heart his food for thought had been miss marstons mass of black hair of incomparable lustre under her stiff white circular cap her kind poetic eyes deep set beneath heavy lashes her youthful girlish figure every line every curve of which was perfection

what young flower could have died prematurely and left its roseate tint upon her checks and its fragrance on her breath he thought as she was about to give him the spoon

come on my lady aesculapius he remarked with a smile as he took the medicine

aesculapius had divine power she retorted

so would you have were this mt olympus he went on

but he could cure by mixing medicines she added

yours is a subtler and more advanced science of therapeutics he continued

she would not go on further instinctively she knew that he had watched all her little overcarefulnesses and had interpreted their meaning

mr birch she said im going to leave you

her words startled him how had he offended her

come miss marston he said with a look of contriteness ive been brusque to you youll pardon my rudeness wont you

no no not that no one could hae been kinder to me only iâ she stammered for a word

salary then he broke in well name your price and i shall pay twice the sum demanded only you must stay

please mr birch it isnt that she began twitching her lingers you see you are quite on the road to recovery now and i must go back to the hospital where others need me

but who told you i was well he protested i understood that you were to nurse me until i had fully recovered

she did not answer she could not she felt the warm tears gathering in her eyes and she thought he saw them

nor did he press further he felt strong emotions tugging at his heart and he thought she read them through his eyes

stanton birch had had everything he had wanted in life and a great deal of it he had got by asking for it yet here was this beautiful girl lovely in every way and his lips refused him that which his heart wished to speak he was not afraid he was ashamed his covert manner in his lovemaking to her had been unworthy of the way in which gentlemen make queens of the women whom they love

if he had dazzled her beautiful white neck with jewels if he had brought her orchids and roses if he had sent her bonbons if he had taken her to operas and suppers he would have felt differently about it but not one thing had he done for her pleasure there had been no lovemaking save the fervent glances and friendly words that had passed between them in his room

but to let such an opportunity pass would have been madness he knew that he loved her each day since he first saw her he had been telling himself so more and more positively in her he recognized qualities that he had found wanting in the girls of his set she was natural she had a knowledge of the things in life that are worth while and she had a willingness to learn what she did not know added to this nature had given her the crowning piece of all things that according to a mans way of thinking go to make a womanâbeauty

he got up resolute and went over to the girl caught her in his arms pressed her to him and showered passionate kisses upon her lips

zelda you are not going to leave this house you say i am well but i am not my heart is sick with love and if you refuse my wish it is sick with an ill that can never be cured until our souls meet in heaven i knew from the moment i saw you that i loved you i had never loved before neither had you but we each knew from the first that we loved each other theres but one way for our happiness will you choose it with me

the girl was frightened and she tried to wrench herself from him

why do you say such things to me she demanded still trying to free herself

but his grip became firmer i say them because they arc the things my heart wants to say and because they are the things your heart wants to hear    you called me well from the accident i may be but do you suppose it was because of those badly putup drugs that i was healed no i took them because they came from your sweet hands the kind look in your eyes the sweet words from your lips the soothing touch from your handâthey were restorative

but please please let me go mr birch she begged you do not know my past between us stands birth wealth position and i could never make you happy

if your past were as black as midnight he said passionately your face would still have its heavenly light for me between us stands nothing but the unbreakable chain of love to which every human being must link himself if he would find happiness

wont you release me please  she whispered i must go back

she felt herself beginning to weaken if he had taken his arms from her waist then hers would have wandered up and clung to his neck she felt his pulsating heart she breathed his warm breath was she conscious of what she was doing when she asked to be released

why not stay in my country he went on jestingly

where is your country her words were scarcely audible

 tis this old fifth avenue home the walls of which are embellished with paintings and tapestries made by men when men had patience genius the floors of which are covered with bear skins from the frigid arctic and tiger skins from torrid indiaâskins that foolish adventurers have given their lives for in the closets are the costliest porcelains and there are a few jewelry chests that contain many valuables over all this rules king love let us be his neversleeping neverwearying bodyguards

how do you know i can stand the immigration test she asked almost with a smile

i am the sole inspector and will pass you with honors if you but enter my port

do you think youll always want me for an inhabitant she asked troubled uneasy

i swear to treasure you always as my most prized citizen will you enter

she did not speak but stood on her toes and kissed his waiting lips

he rang for the butler to come for the breakfast tray

john he said as the butler came in tell andre to cook with more care then turning to miss marston he continued hes an oldtime cook but he makes far better bouillon and roasts than that irish chefess you had at the hospital john took the tray and went out

a few days afterward stanton birch and his nurse were married

the years passed

they were happy and why not when every gentle breeze that bearing the winged messenger of love and striking the cords of their hearts made the strings reverberate lyrelike with perfect harmony when glitteringheaded gold had opened her vault and poured her treasure into their hands until they were running over and when in themselves was that bigness of soul and soundness of mind that taught them the best use of their blessings

moreover to crown their happiness the future of their twentytwoyearold son blazed with brightness

they held up to the world a mirror of wonderful transparency and the world smiling back at them said i am not such a bad thing after all if only cynics critics and pessimists would boost sometimes rather than knock always

if on this mirror they saw a blurâa hungering soul a painful body a diseased brainâthe philanthropic spirit within them said at once i am here your ever ready and willing servant send me as a comforter to do the best i can for them

naturally they were happy

their costly home stood on the top of one of the mountains in clairmont and its bronzed roof caught the suns first rays as they awoke in the morning and the last danced on it as they retired at night

perhaps it was the deep reddish golden rays streaming over the tops of their house that gave inness the inspiration for some of his masterly landscapesâwho knows

a convention of representative americans had recently met in a southern city to discuss means by which the american people might be bettered but one learned gentleman had digressed from the purpose of the meeting to hurl bitter philippics against a certain element of the nation nor would he take his seat though the cries of sit down and shut up made his speech inaudible

they were in the library she sitting upright in an oldfashioned chair while he was half reclining in a morris chair on the opposite side of the table

the light from the bluishgreen shade of the electric light struck the side of his face accentuating the noble outlines of his intellectual temples he had been reading an account of the abovenamed convention in the tell tale which journal discussed american problems and conditions more liberally with greater judgment and with less injustice than any other american periodical and to a man of his unbiased mind the bitter philippics were naturally disgusting he seemed annoyed

oh botheration âthis was his favorite and strongest expressionâwhy cant they let these people alone he said with force and a frown between them and us lie centuries of african wildness and two hundred and fifty years of american bondage 

the colored people you mean she questioned

yes quickly i dont see why a people that have proved themselves thriving earnest and willing since weve freed them should not be allowed civil and human rights without always being attacked by fanatics

remember the hewers of wood and drawers of water story stanton she said apparently unconcerned

my dear wife he replied a little impatiently beating the palm of his hand against the table be sensible thats a perversion of ignorance that has caused the blood of a million souls i tell you we are all the same in essence whether you believe that man was evolved from the plastic little amoeba whether you believe that life was hurled on earth by some flying meteorite from another world or whether you wish to be oldfashioned and accept the biblical explanation of thingsâ

i accept the biblical explanation

as you please he went on but in any case the basis the essence the one little cell that makes one human being has the same fundamental parts that make another

they were silent for a moment she was more troubled than she seemed

but why not leave that problem to the south where there are more negroes and where they are better understood she asked

leave it to the south he demanded turning himself around its not a negro problem it is not a southern problem it is a human live american problem should the settlement of the immigration question be left to new york because most of the immigrants come to new yorks harbor and because many of them settle in that city no just so then with these people

are you sure stanton that if you lived in a community where there was miscegenation you would not resent it

i am sure i would always abide by the laws of nature justice and god they are indestructible and irrefutable he answered

he turned to her for a reply but it was not forthcoming then he resumed his reading and she continued to turn over slowly and carefully the pages of the latest edition of may mantons magazine trying to select some patterns by which she would have the next dresses designed that she would give to the little children among whom she worked in newton

they did not hear adrian enter as he was returning from a dinner that had been given to him because he was to leave for pemberton on the following day

well bookworm he addressed his father not gone to bed yet

hello ad said the father

and you awake too mother he had gone around and now stood at the back of her chair framing her face in his hands

we waited for you because it was the eve of your departure and the mother affectionately pressed his hand against her face youve come home early she continued

yes bob norton was taking some friends to the station and i came up in his car

youve enjoyed yourself i hope adrian immensely you know eloise makes the most charming little hostess and roy houston was never more facetious than he was tonight it was a whole round table of merriment and good cheer elsie van deman sang some of the arias from the latest french operas and charlie gave by request a performance of the last creation of the parisian tango

mrs birch was particularly delighted to hear about the van demans elsie had been one of her favorites and though she had never breathed it to anyone she had at one time fancied that she would like her as a daughterinlaw but charlie van deman had captivated elsie they had forsaken america immediately after their marriage for a european stay of five years and had just the day before this dinner arrived in new york from paris

how is elsie mrs birch asked eagerly

she has as much verve and beauty as ever replied adrian she said shed be in to spend an afternoon with you tomorrow shell be awfully glad to see you mother

i shall be glad to see her too and charlie and her little children they must be beautifulâ perfect dears

her little what mother asked adrian

her children

why do you suppose shed be so oldfashioned as to have children

adrian you shock me

i am sorry mother but why he asked

because elsie is sensible

but her mind is not the mind of a woman that would stay at home and teach children their prayers good manners and culture her most serious thought is wondering whether she has more trumps than her opponent at bridge or trying to unravel a mystery novel after she has read its first page she would far rather wipe a tear from the eyes of a babe of one of her favorite servants than place a kiss on the lips of one of her own becauseâbeing irresponsible she wants no maternal anxiety or pain she is a butterfly

you cannot be serious my boy you must be jesting

as you please mother but you must admit that my jest has truth as its fundamental principle

truth demands proof

this particular truth is easily demonstrated

but how how she asked with emphasis

he took her finelyshaped little bejeweled hand in his now mother he began hold up your hand count on your fingers every girl of our set that you remember who has married in the past five years and see how many of them have progeny

in her mind she saw beautiful girls to whom the best of the earth had been given at their nuptialsâmansions tiaras diamonds millions everythingâand on her fingers she enumerated sixteen to whom hymen had come during the preceding five years

youve counted them asked adrian

yes

how many

sixteen

now how many have offspring mother

she tried to convince herself that the little foster daughter of mrs conover and the little foster son of mrs woody were their own but each of these children was seven and both mrs conover and mrs woody had been married only five years

how many children among them all he asked again

six answered the mother thoughtfully dispiritedly

a whirlwind repeopling of the earth adrian went on a little joyful at his victory

but you are critical and unfair to them protested mrs birch

they are unfair to themselves he replied

perhaps in the little skirmish adrian had had the advantage at least he felt that his mother had been come upon unexpectedly and his manner when he leaned over and placed a filial kiss upon her check revealed his penitence

he had been narrow in judging so narrowly if he had gone out and studied other classes of people as he had his own would he not have found them different

perhaps but usually a mans judgments do not go any further than his own experience takes him his opinions are formed and his conclusions are reached while he is under the influence of the things he secs about him of the things with which he is most often in contact

of course at great intervals there appears a philosopherâthank heavenâa student of the world a student whose mind goes far beyond that which immediately encircles him and such a student makes keen generalizations

stanton birch who had given little or no attention to what had been said by his wife and their son now turned around taking his glasses from his eyes and said youre leaving tomorrow are you ad

yes father

what train

oh early but i shall motor down am picking up some of the others in newton do you want to take a spin to pemberton with me father

no i thank you adrian an appointment prevents

we shall miss you greatly put in his mother

i shall be sorry to leave you mother

the minute hand of the dock on the mantel was now moving toward midnight

adrian was the first to rise and he slowly sauntered upstairs to his room

i shall see you at breakfast he called from the top of the stairs

yes goodnight son the parents replied together

adrian arose early the next morning for more than one reason

in driving his big gray racer the preceding afternoon at a gait that was certainly greater than that allowed by the jersey speed laws he had met with an accident which retarded the speed of the car and had greatly upset its smoothness of motion being an amateur mechanic to tighten a bolt here and loosen one there had a fascination for him

at six oclock he had put on his oilcloth suit and with a big stillson wrench in hand lay flat on his back under the car in his garage helping him was one of the gardeners a sort of handy fellow with toolsâwho had been out in the garden robbing the vines of the last of their tomatoes and lima beans

after many drops of perspiration had rolled from his strong young forehead and not a few drops of the vicious noxious machine oil had fallen into his mouth and eyes adrian crawled out from under the big machine being satisfied with his work

breakfast was an hour earlier that morning than usual and his father and his mother ate with him plainly they were sorry that adrian was going he had gone three times before but their reluctance this time seemed even greater than when he had gone down to become a freshic he saw that they were depressed and he tried to dispel their gloom with jokes and had it not been that she expected the van demans that afternoon adrians mother would have yielded to his persuasions to take the trip down with him

as for the servants who had nearly all been on the birchs payroll before he had come into the world they were both glad and sorryâsorry because young mr birch was so gay they always felt so at home with him he always had a smile and a pleasant word for them all and glad because every time he left for college each of them got a crisp new tendollar banknote from him

his parents stood on the large veranda and the host of servants like a young troop of badly disciplined but ready soldiers straggled over the velvety green lawn waving their handkerchiefs and hats and calling goodbye to him as he whisked the big car by them mr birch and mrs birch were glad to sec that their son was so well liked and when they went into the house a look of gladness mingled with the tears that stood ready to drop from mrs birchs eyes they thought that with them all was peace all was happiness

but one can never foresee how long domestic equanimity will last discords upheavals breaks are always lurking about

a lake under a warm sun appears a neverending sheet of loveliness serenity placidness but let one drop a pebble into it even of the tiniest sort and it becomes for a moment ugly its face becomes full of frowns and wrinkles it is agitated and disturbed

so in a home if not one thing another happens to disturb tranquillity for a time suppose you had had a french chef who had been with you for more than twenty years even though he had made your telephone bills ten dollars a month when it should have been only five he would not be intolerable for he would still see that your food was well cooked and on time suppose then he should fall passionately in jove with bridget mccoogan femme de chambre at the house nearest your own and should threaten to leave you and marry his adorable bridget she is so petite suppose he would lovingly say with his black upturned moustache and with a shrug of the shoulders when she was a good heavyweight one hundred and ninetythree in a bathing suit measuring thirtytwo inches around the waist or suppose he would say she has such beautiful blue eyes when they were a cattish yellow or she has such tiny little feet when she had walked home from the car one night in a drizzling rain with a pair of sevens in her hand and her eyes full of tears because her shoes had cramped her feet

and suppose this valuable houseman encouraged by his love should some morning when you needed him most run off with his fiancee leaving a note behind announcing in broken english that he had gone to get married and did not know when he would come back naturally your household would be upset for a while

when mrs birch returned from her morning ride she found her household in a very distracted condition

just what had happened she did not know and although the thought of what andre had so often told them flashed across her mind she dismissed it she even allowed herself to think that his madness about bridget was insincere and that even if he were to marry her it would make no difference for he would still remain with them

whats the matter she asked of anne one of the maids

the maid did not reply but picked up a silver tray on which was a letter addressed to monsieur and madame birch she tore it open hastily

anne she breathed in a voice a little louder than a whisper i am so sorry

she sank down into a chair in a sort of apathy what she had not really feared had now become really fearful

he was such a good workman wasnt he anne she went on

he was a brute the maid burst out taking up her white apron to hide her face and the tears that were coming she could not stand the sweeping plaudits of her mistress when she herself had been disappointed she had hoped that andre would marry her and his sudden elopement with that big irish thing had caused her no end of envy and hate even though he dont love me she would say she had thought that his pleasantnesses to her meant something and that their years of association would eventuate in a union why not they understood each other and could at least get along

why anne returned mrs birch im surprised at your saving such a thing i thought everybody was so fond of andre the maid did not respond immediately

perhaps continued mrs birch thats the reason you abuse himâbecause you are fond of him    well anne cheer up patting the still sobbing girl on the shoulder you have a chance yet thirtytwo isnt so bad

the maid understood that what mrs birch had said was intended as a goodnatured joke rather than as a reminder that she was getting old

mrs birch went into the sunlit conservatory where the air was heavy with sweetness and where flowers of various colors bloomed in riotous confusion when she entered meg a handsome redbeaked african grey parrot flew toward her

good morning said the bird in an unmusical contralto

good morning returned mrs birch

the little canaries began their song too and flitted from one to the other of the bars in their cages

shut up you cats screamed the infuriated meg

oh meg meg girlie said mrs birch thats awfully unkind and impolite of you to talk like that

the bird paid no attention to the reprimand i saw andre run across the lawn this morning it said

yes meg andre is not going to be with us any more

mrs birch was watering the flowers

why queried the bird

you wouldnt understand if i told you

why again it asked

hes going to get married

oh hes crazy cried the bird

the doorbell rang and the maid announced mrs van deman so overjoyed was mrs birch that she rushed out and scarcely missed upsetting a beautiful tender plant in a handsome japanese pot that sat near the door and the two women embraced and kissed each other lovingly

it would have been extremely difficult for anyone to tell which was the younger of the two women elsie was indeed a pretty girl with a wealth of exquisite blonde hair a lock of which always strayed loose and fell over her pretty forehead keeping her finely shaped hand continually putting it back where it should be while her pretty blue eyes had the tenderness of youth in them but in zclda birchs face though she was fortytwo and elsie only twentyfour there was a youth that had been born to live always a neverfading beauty

why elsie said zclda you are as charming and lovely as when i held you in my arms as a chili  what did you do girl spend every moment of your absence in the youthrenewing healthgiving waters of carlsbad and wiesbaden

it seems zelda as if youd found the spring of youth for which ponce de leon looked here in america age does but one thing for youâit makes you more youthful and beautiful she answered a smile on her lips

and charlie what did you do with him why didnt you bring him with you

hes playing off a match game of tennis with artie darnton that he promised to play five years agoâbefore we went abroad he said hed join me here about 

but elsie my girl what have you been doing where are

i knew that was coming i expected it to be the first thing youd ask me interrupted elsie who had divined what was in zeldas mind

well why

elsie colored just a little i have not that in me

me

havent it in you zelda said with profound astonishment be reasonable girl why try to make yourself a new type of womanhood i tell you that the intense desire to be a mother is as strong in every married woman today as it was in the woman who frantically cried to her husband give me children or i die why should it not be in us do we not start every girl off in babyhood with that end in view we give to every little girl a doll at christmas we like to see her hold it we let her make its little clothes tell it little stories sing it little songs rock it to sleep prattle the little maternal things to it that she thinks it understands we make every girl a mother before she knows shes a child

then perhaps i was afraid elsie said

of what

charlie

what do you mean child doent he love you

sincerely but i dont think he loves me in that way

you little idiot dont you know that you are letting slip the only thing that makes a union happy

one of the things that makes a union bearable you mean zelda you sec you dont make allowance for the difference in natures fortune favored youâshe gave you a husband who loved books his home charlie loves merriment play and

oh bosh interrupted zelda every man naturally loves his own home he can get as much exercise by playing with his own child upon his knee as he can by saying im going to take a walk for exercise and then goes instead to another house simply because it is kept in better order than the one that his own careless uncheering wife keeps

but charlie is so young and free and i wouldnt want to keep him at home im afraid hed love children like most men love womenâ theyre mad about our smiles but a tear a frown chases them away

dont talk of the dislikes of the men zelda said a little impatiently let the women find their likes and cater to them and thus make them at once master and slave

there you are zeldaâas zealous and as serious as ever said the younger woman

what about yourself

myself she answered with a little carefree smile i am still a shining bubble floating on lifes tide tending nowhere purposeless free laughing hoping only that it may ever buoy me up and that i may never run into any gurgling whirlpool to swallow me up you know zelda i think that my kind of people are put into the world as a reminder and a stimulus to your kind of people to keep them from forgetting that there is something in the world for them to do

what makes you have such a fancy about yourself

it isnt fancy my every act makes my shortcomings more clear and real

a moment of silence passed between themâa silence that was broken by the entrance of their husbands

look see whom i picked up on the courts this morning zelda said mr birch

oh charlie im so glad to see you my boy was zeldas greeting and charlie warmly pressed her hand

how do you do father birch said elsieâ this was what she had always called mr birch how splendidly you look she continued and as handsome as ever why tell people youre fiftysix when your looks tell them that you are only forty

the same little flattering girl said mr birch trying to make me believe what isnt true

 tis true she protested

my teeth my dear are beginningto wear and a surer proof there never was than that to tell one that hes getting old

how was the match charlie asked zelda

fine i won as easily as a big boy thrashing his little brother

honest she asked

as i ever was he answered

you were not always honest with me

then accuser recall to me my robbery twas a very serious oneâand one that hurt

i am so sorry

arc you sure you can exonerate yourself

i shall do my best

at what price

that of my honor and my life if need be oh charlie im not tired of you yet said elsie jestingly

but dearie my honesty has been assailed he returned

well said zelda after all the joke is on me

me

whats the joke he asked

you robbed me of elsie

what do you mean

dont you know that i had always planned to have elsie for my daughterinlaw

they all laughed

and to think said stanton that zelda was going to give me another child without even letting me know of it

but im satisfied with the steal said zelda and now well have some luncheon

i have engaged a new chef said stanton one morning after breakfast about three weeks after andres departure he had just returned from a western trip having been to texas to look over his cattle ranch and to montana to arrange to sell some of the stock that he owned in the copper mines

on his way home he had stopped in buffalo to see an old clubmate billy dodd who was just about to go on a yachting trip on the mediterranean and down the nile with him of course were going many of his servants but his chef refused to take the journey therefore stanton engaged the man and took him home with him

i am so glad stanton said zelda things have been in a miserably bad condition will he suit us do you think

billy says that he cant be beaten zelda suppose you show him what to do

then with his golf bag he rode over to the balastol club to put in a morning at the sport that was now rapidly coming to an end because of the cold weather

zelda stood for a moment in the embrasure of a bay window in the morning room watching the leaves that were being blown from the trees and formed into little whirls by the wind the strength of the breeze through the halfopened window made diminutive hills and valleys in her dress

she pressed the tapering manicured forefinger of her right hand against her lower lip while the other hand pulled nervously at a little grey button on her waist

she was mentally greatly depressed in her heart there was a heaviness that was uncommon to her her trepidation so far as she could see was without meaning yet for that very reason she was all the more disturbed

why she asked herself why this fear

perhaps fate fortune or chance sometimes tells us of the approaching shoals windstorms and icebergs while we arc wandering on lifes ocean and we human ships do not more often escape these dangers because we are so utterly heedless of their benevolent admonitions

pshaw nothing can disturb my happiness she persuaded herself

she never had but one thought that worried her and while it was and had been for twentyfive years a daily visitor she believed that it was now merely a habit and she even ventured to say to herself with confidence that the possibility of such a thoughts becoming a reality was impossible

yes fate does sometimes warn us of dangers but soulless thing she is too jealous of her own power to let us into her mysteries thereby revealing to us the means of escape she likes at times to make highsalaried actors of us all a tragedian with his stirring bursts of emotion and pathos a comedian with his lightness and humor while sheâthe audienceâweeps laughs or derides according to the way our performances impress her

zelda dismissed her forebodings and went to the kitchen to tell the new man what his duties would be

but as she went her heart became heavier and heavier

when she entered the kitchen the man stood with his back to her with one hand on the valve of the boiler that was roaring thunderously so deafening was the noise that leon the cook did not even hear her entrance

good morning she said to the new man

the chef heard her and seemed a little startled but he quickly regained his composure and turned hat in hand to respond not only politely but with a courtly bow zelda had an uncomfortable feeling that she had seen the man somewhere before

why she colored she perhaps never knew and she would have stoutly denied ever having done so had she later been told of it yet she was certainly conscious of the hot blood as it rushed to her face

why should she be excited because she had always the constant fear of meeting one man in this man though there could be no danger she was the employer he the employed

she eyed him from head to foot he was dressed in immaculate white and his clothes fit him faultlessly

had he had on a cap with a green crescentshaped brim golden cords around the band and a few silvery stars sprinkled at intervals one might have said that he was the millionaire owner of a yacht instead of stanton birchs chef

youre the new chef zelda asked

yes was his somewhat laconic but polite response

we expect you to do all the ordering and to arrange our menus breakfast is at  âthis is the one meal that mr birch always wants on timeâluncheon at one and dinner at 

spot her fox terrier had been jumping upon her pawing and barking for recognition ever since she had come into the kitchen

the dog is very fond of you mrs birch

he is of every one he makes friends quickly if one does not look suspicious

yes he and i are good friends already come on spot he coaxingly called patting his hand on his knee

mrs birch glanced up sideways from bending to arrange the pink bow in spots collar and she started to speak but instantly the thought that was uppermost in her mind ran away from her she stood in utter bewilderment for a second and her only escape was oh i shall speak of that later remember luncheon at one

she rushed from the room and when she reached the diningroom she reeled and would have fallen but a chair saved her one glance at that man had been enough to send her into a world of distraction

before her rose images that had for twentyfive years been napping or dissembling sleep in her breast ready to spring up fully awake at any timeâimages of fear disgrace exposure death

if she had been in a room where there were thousands of people and had not seen this man she would have been conscious of his proximity to her i she would have felt him his cold cynical searching eyes would have sought her out

each day of her life she had hoped prayed against this moment yet this terrible thing had come to herâthis terrible thing from which there was no escape

oh god she sobbed hysterically have i merited this in your sight

dismay and tribulation had almost overwhelmed her but fortune had been moved enough by her sorrows to keep away all the servants who might have come that way during her moments of indescribable grief

after all she might be mistaken this might not be the man that she feared there was a resemblance between this man and the one she had known in her girlhood but his manner had been straightforward not suggestive of any former acquaintance

yet she was not happy over her hung a cloud of the blackest sortâmenacing threatening destructive if she had not seen this man before she had certainly met one exactly like him she was tormented by that haunting ghostlike memory that she could not shake oh

alexander the worlds conquering conqueror never enjoyed a sweeter moment of revenge and satisfaction than did this leon a truer master of all i survey never lived the hour for which he had longed had come as he always believed it would

i shall make myself the greatest man in all the world was the determination with which he had started life i must prove worthy of zelda and if i failâoh i shant fail 

for this woman he had made and unmade himself with her god only knows to what peaks of glory he might have reached without her grief despondency had seized him and last and worst of all he had started in search of a goal where were to be found relief of mind repose of body but the road to it had been clouded with opiates on fire with rum and other indescribable forms of dissipation

if however he could have found her in his travels all would have been happiness would she follow him  certainlyâdid he not know the strength and the weakness of every thread that sewed up her past dare she rebel against his faintest wish if she should be so firm as to deny him anything he would have revenge no matter what the cost

she was to have a committee of ladies meet her at her house the next afternoon to discuss plans for the betterment of workinggirls and she decided to tell leon to have some bouillon and sandwiches for them

she opened her mouth to say something but the utterance was never heard

he seized her in his arms encircling her waist and rained hot impetuous kisses on her face

zelda zelda zelda  he burst out with theatrical passion my idol my love  this is the most blissful moment of my life my famished heart sickened by the want of love had almost given up its search for you but on and on and on i coaxed it feeding it with the unsustaining food of hopeâhope hopeâtelling it that some day it would be fed to satisfaction and now that moment that heavenly moment has come

are you she got no further her whole frame became limp almost lifeless in his arms for the moment she was too horrorstricken to resist him

yes i am he broke in hotly removing the disguising moustache and rolling up his coat sleeve to show her a mark that he knew she would recognize zelda my dearest i knew that i would find you i knew that all the years of my hearts yearning would not be fruitless

what do you propose to doâwith me she questioned in a tone of one almost dead

to take you with me he said passionately firmly holding her hand while she tried to wrench it from him to live every moment of my life in your presence worshiping you adoring you loving you my own forever

but i am married she begged

what does that matter to me he retorted hotly did david give up bethsheba because she was the wife of uriah or did the wonderfully beautiful paris give up the still more beautiful helen because hymen had united her and menelaus

you say you love me

as god loved the youthful earth when he repeopled it

then wont you for your loves sake give me up

bah he scowled wrathfully talk sensibly my kind of love is not the liberal selfdenying kind its the sort that seizes robs pillages wants the whole everything for itself there have been heroes in war heroes in religion but the world has never known a hero in love men who win trophies of women never sacrifice themselves that others may enjoy their prized booty they want them foreverâto feed their aged eyes on when theyre old to quicken the retarding beat of their hearts when they are declining the man that gave up the woman he loved of his own volition never lived and never will live such men are but the phantastic figures created by the brains of novelists after a night of revelry or when their minds are saturated with dreambringing dope

but leon leon be merciful she begged cant you see what this would mean to me think think  oh please try to forget dont tell leon dont tell she pleaded frantically dont you see my dishonor disgrace shame the happiness of my whole life my hopes the things i had set my heart onâall would be shattered in one instant forget leon forget dont dont ask it she sank to the floor in a heap too distressed to say more

dishonorâshame your happiness fled he reiterated scornfully a frown on his domineering brow his eyes again aglow with a look of revenge for what do you think ive allowed my soul to burn as if on the fiery brands of hell turned over by the piercing tridents of the devilish imps for what do you think ive fought battles won conquests lost all the sweetness of life to become this morbid wretched dissipated vagabond that i now am if it was not in the hope that some day i might find you have you for my wife have you alwaysâan atonement for my wrongs a compensation for my sufferings come i leave here in three days you shall go with me

listen please listen she struggled to her knees her whole frame shaking leon if you but spare me i will give you anything you wishâ i will build you country homes city homes yachts give you every comfort every luxury in life shall be yours only you must must spare me money i

ha ha he broke in with a mocking laugh you bewitching little feminine mephistophiles you would have me sell my heart my very soul to you no no i wont do it not even to such an adorable little angel as you are money money he went on contemptuously what shall i do with it all desire to live decently except with you have gone from me now you propose to pay me a salary  i do not want it food free sleep free and mr birchs clothes would fit me perfectly if i wanted them he doesnt mind you know hes so rich has so many wouldnt miss them would he then he continued in a haughty triumphant manner moreover i

his keen ear heard the muffled tread of mr birch coming toward the kitchen over the soft rug in the hall in fact he had been listening all the while

he quickly picked mrs birch up and set her in a chair near the door then he snatched a carvingknife cut his finger so as to get a good flow of blood and was at the sink running cold water on it when stanton entered

good morning leon he said then he turned and saw his wife on the chair

excited he exclaimed goodness zeldal what is the matter speak dearest speak 

i beg your pardon mr birch said the chef with a courtesy the sight of the blood from my hand caused her to faint i carelessly hacked one of them nearly off and she saw it she will recover in a moment

stanton was bathing her head with the water that had been brought and he had ordered a maid to bring some whiskey in a hurry

she soon revived and as she opened her eyes slowly she saw her husband standing over her

it is you is it stanton

yes darling his strong arms lifted her to his breast i am so sorry come lie down awhile

i fainted at the sight of the blood she said as she sat up on the couch her back leaning on her husbands arm she was not as truthful as she should have been for she had never seen the blood but in her semiconscious condition she had heard leon speak of it

yes her husband answered consolingly his soft hand still rubbing her forehead the blood shook you all up shall i send for a doctor oh no stanton she protested i shall be all right in a moment im sure

wont you let me call in the doctor he again said appealingly

certainly not im perfectly myself again to show you that im not the least nervous im going to play you something on the piano

at the piano one would have thought her some russian virtuoso about to give her farewell concert as her little fingers ran over the keys

wont you sing something stanton she asked after she had played one of chadwicks brisk allegrettos adorable chadwick  how splendid he is at times but even in his gayest brightest moments he cannot help being sad for every laugh in him there seems to follow a tear

yes what shall it be that mysterious rag or everybodys doin it first he asked jestingly

zelda had heard these songs from the lips of the little urchins in the tenderloin district where she had the home in newton

what do i know about such songs she asked

as much as i do my dear lady he replied apologetically i heard your own maid singing them

he went to the cabinet and taking therefrom a sheet of music that adrian had boughtâa jove song in one of the seasons popular operettas which he had heard somewhere along broadway âplaced it before her

are you ready she asked

he had not noticed her disquietude and he began to sing you know i love the light that shines from distant worlds above the birds that sing in joyful spring are also mine to love

the flowers that bloom whose sweet perfume makes fragrant all the air all this is but a shadow of the love to you i bear

chorus my love my life my all in all thou art my souls guiding star

my greatest gladness my hope in sadness thou leadst me when near or far hid what thou wilt ill gladly do

what care i what befall

to show how great is my love for you thou art my love my life my all in all

if death should take you from this earth to go to worlds unknown why should i live my life id give in search till you id found

and when wc met wed neer forget that no more should we part

my love is like a love divine for you my dearest heart

wonderful stanton i declare i should far rather hear you sing that than to sit at the metropolitan under the voice of some heralded baritone from across the water you are just splendid spot had come in and jumped up on the divan and was now rapidly beating his stubby tail upon the top of it which was his way of showing his appreciation and meg the parrot shrieked from the conservatory keep it up pop bravo  bravo 

at luncheon she appeared radiant adorable they had never seemed happier together

in the kitchen leon was boiling with anger jealousy revenge his blood did not run but it leaped in his veins here was this man singing love songs to the only woman he had ever loved âwished to loveâcared to love

a quarter of a century before he had held her in his arms as stanton now did and had been made happy by the promises she had made to love him always now she was the wife of another and heâa knave a menial a servant in her house

god to what desperation the thought of such a thing drove him then he calmed himself

she must be his or be wrecked by him if he had passed these last twentyfive years in search of her and had at last found her certainly he could endure anything a few days more in order to get her for his own

you go to the home this afternoon do you not stanton asked when they had finished luncheon

yes and you she replied and asked as she dipped her fingers into the little silver fingerbowl

a society of young men have asked me to speak to them soon so i shall probably pass the afternoon in the library preparing something to say   you have done wonderful work at the home zelda

i could have done nothing without your help

you are wrong im not responsible for your success i am proud of you

well stanton were both trying to live so that others too may live    now goodbye i must hurry she kissed him on his cheek and left him at the table to finish his cigar

perhaps there never was a worse district in all the world than the tenth ward in newton was ten years before zelda first went into it to begin her work longsilenced babylon with its innumerable houri rome with her wicked nero even sodom and gomorrah could not have been worse

zeldas first night down there had almost cost her her life she had advertised for days that missionaries would speak on a certain night at a certain time on a certain corner but those people didnt want to be good they wanted no reforms so they prepared to make trouble

when she got up to speak palefaced blackeyed women threw pails of beer and dirty water all around her drunken sots uttered the vilest profanities in her hearing little ragged dirty urchins marched around her beating tin cans blowing horns dancing and yelling to drown her speech lascivious youths hurled putty stones and broom handles at her lights and having broken them left her in total darkness but she did not swerve and when they saw her persistence a gang of cuthroats rushed upon her to bear her off and take such of her clothes and jewels as were salable

but the leader of the gang prevented any harm from being done to her when they had taken her into a dark cellar in which there had never been a ray of light since the builder put the ceiling over the room he questioned her and seeing her unbending determination he said to her well youse kin come as often as youse likes see but what youse says wont do godâwhoever he isânor nobody else no good see dese kiddies dont mind if youse buys dem a pair of shoes once in a while and the rummies and touts and cadets will stand for a cup of coffee or a drink from you now and den and well all be glad to git in a tanksgivin and christmas dinner outer you see but dey wont pay any mind to what you say anyway youse come whenever youse likes see and ill break any damn guys neck what tries to put one over on you see cause youse is a game gal and i likes a gal what aint scared of de rummies see so now youse kin go let her out boys

and they all snatched off their hats and eyed her as if she had been some whitewinged goddess from another land when she passed them but to assure her of the truth of his promise the leader went with her to the boundary line of the district wherein he was king but he dared not go farther for there were innumerable rewards for his head if caught but he knew that he was safe so long as he was in his own precincts

but in his prophesies he had erred in ten years zeldaâby her charity to the little children her benevolence to the youths and her kindness to the grown peopleâhad changed this dirty confused chaotic wicked district into a clean orderly decent one she was called the lady of god with the greatest respect by the men and the lady bountiful by the children

skinny hagan nigger jones izzy greenbaum dutch smultz woop damfino all called off their corner crap games pitching twobit notes dealing threecard monte and as soon as they saw her automobile approaching they all stood hat in hand and bowed courteously as she passed and they did not dare to resume their gambling until she was well out of sight and the wife of the scotch fitzmaurice one of the liquor dealers in the ward had now become the greatest temperance lecturer in the city in mrs birchs missionary home were the children of poor and unfortunate americans italians jews germans negroes irishâand they all regarded one another as human and humane which was due to the work that she had done among them

in going from the assembly room that afternoon mrs birch passed out into a long welllighted wellventilated corridor then through a pair of opaque glass doors that stood at the head of the dark stairs that descended to the basement between the top step as one ascended from the basement and these glass doors which made indistinct anyone behind them was a space about four feet square mrs birch had pushed the door open and had gone two or three steps when a voice said you arc in a hurry

startled she turned and looked quickly around there stood leon to her left behind the door his cold dissipated eyes fastened upon her and his evermoving smile on his lips

you here she asked alarmed

my dear he answered i love to see those pretty little lips at work they are indeed the most beautiful piece of human machinery god ever fashioned but why waste that fragrant breath of yours on unnecessary questions  certainly you would not ask if the stars were in the heavens if you looked up and saw them do you not see me here before your lovely eyes

what do you wish now she asked bluntly she had never taken her hand off the door and it still stood half open

you are cold to me was his response in a pleading tone why not close the door that we might be alone

i do not care to be alone with you

heavens be merciful he threw up his palms like a worshiper to think that my most adorable lady would deny me my fondest wish when we have been so long apart

how did you know i was here

to what end will the world come he said mockingly his feelings being piqued at her query do you not yet know that my love for you tells me everything that between you and me there is a telepathyâa wish on your part that i should always be near you come kiss me let us be ourselves again we did not finish our happy reunion this morning before mr birch broke in on us

she had had time to compose herself and she now closed the door noiselessly she also told herself that some tact must be used that to repulse him would be a mistake believing that he would stop at nothing if she was not pleasant to him

we shall probably be here for some time shall i tell your chauffeur not to wait

not i shall go in a moment

and with whose permission did i say so

no but youre a gentleman and would not forcibly detain me

my gracious  he exclaimed sarcastically your clever words have awakened my pride have knocked at the door of the manhood in me that has had a rip van winkle sleep in truth if all the world had called me a gentleman i should have called them liars you excepted but you would make me believe that i am almost genteel again what a wonderful influence your nearness to me has over me for good i believe before weve been two weeks together you will have me like the sacred old patriarch ready to mount into my chariot and ascend heavenward on the first strong breeze

he slowly stepped toward her but she repulsed him and shrank back into the corner

please leon she pleaded do you intend always to shadow my life as you have done since you came must i be always fearful always expecting the worst with never a moments peace

certainly not he returned boastfully i shall make you happy

but leon she begged do you not sec that if ever in my life i have done any wrong to anyone i am trying to atone for itâwith my whole soul i am trying to be charitable benevo

charity benevolence philanthropy he said superciliously oh hypocritical humanity what gorgeous and dazzling cloaks thou purchaseth to hide thine own real nakedness thy sin and falsehood tis all a sham a puton a friend dies a devastating disease comes a war is declared and ignorant foolish souls then give to the poor to charity that some ever protecting mist may obscure them from the calamity god like selfsacrifice is hidden in a cloud of superstition that makes a fool buy a knave a pair of shoes that the murrain may pass over me they give to the poor and lend to the lord in the hope that he will protect them    charity  love of good i tell you no one does anything without the hope of a recompense its all an exchangeâa loan with a big interest attached the lender always issues a statement for his pay jacobâseeing all the wonders of heaven its streets of blinding brilliancy the angels ascending and descendingânever would have gone his journey to the sons of haran to meet his beloved rachel had his covenant with god been less than his masters promising to furnish him with gold food and raiment i tell you they give no more sincerely than did the rich young lord whom jesus told sell all thou hast and follow me the woman who throws her babe in the whirling ganges has a far purer motive than have you philanthropists

he paused a moment then he continued sneering but i wont be hard on you my love although i know your imperviousness to blandishments youll accept my profound congratulations for your matchless work here will you tell me how you did it you were always so good such a genius did you when you first started turn water into wine to frighten them to gain their confidence and do you send out every day a boy to purchase five loaves and three fishes to be changed by your magic into enough to feed a large crowd and then have twelve baskets left over

he stopped for a second but come he resumed you shall be ready in three days wont you dearest

her feeling was one of anger rather than of fear yet she realized her danger she silently prayed for some intervention and her prayers were answered the heavy tread of the night watchman was heard coming down the hall

leon seized her and tried to force her into a closet but she broke loose and declared she would scream for help

give me fifty dollars thenâquickly i want to treat the rummies

she quickly drew the note from her gold bag and handed it to him

then she turned hurriedly as he hid himself in the closet and walked out into the hall meeting the watchman

good evening horace

he noticed her curtness and was surprised at her unusual manner

pemberton had won the newspapers had large headlines reading pemberton wins for a long time it had been the other way but today the pemberton halfback had got loose at a critical moment and run down the field for a touchdownâshaking off tacklers as he ran

never before had there been such rejoicing such weeping that day on pembertons campus thousands of dollars had exchanged hands

splenetics and rheumatics threw away their crutches superannuated men whom time had robbed of their voices made their presence felt by ringing cowbells powers in finance lawyers doctors ministers congressmen senators governors and even an aspirant for the american presidencyâall graduates of historic pembertonâ had returned to see this great game

the romping energycreating soulstirring zigzag snakedance had lost none of its fascination and up and down waldron field undergrads recent grads and alumni danced this unique dance until they were almost without strength the songs of old glory and  thrilled as they had never before done the customary bonfire was received gladly as is a new born child by its expectant parents

a hotheaded patriotic grad now paid a dollar for a lemon and blue pennant that might on the morrow be bought for a dime souvenir postcard dealers were glad for to them it meant extra money post office clerks swore vociferously for to them it meant extra work

in the cities from the theatre stages the score flashed pemberton âhall o around the bulletin boards in front of the newspaper buildings so thickly had humanity collected that to pass was impossible thousands of cafe suppers were won and lost hundreds of pemberton students sat in the boxes at the winter garden and watched gaby delys in her rhythmic glides and after the performance they proposed marriage to her which under any other circumstances they would never have done

the crowds departed but ecstatic enthusiasm was not to lapse into quietude in pemberton for many days after this historic happening

and who had been the hero of this victory adrianâadâaddie it was his last year and his brilliant performance placed him among the pemberton immortals at his asking that night the world would have been given to him had it been in the power of the students and graduates to give

this tall muscular welldeveloped boy of twentytwo with an abundance of dark brown hair growing full on a slightly receding forehead had been immediately after the game seized by a contingent of the student body who styled themselves worshipers of dionysus and sons of epicurus to be taken by them to new york in order that they might show him what real life was along broadwayâin the cafes cabarets and whatnots

they took him on their shoulders to his room and made him promise that he would pass a night with them in new york during the christmas holidays

so greatly did he wish to be alone that he was still debating whether or not he would attend the senior prom but there was no rest for him in his room after the departure of the worshipers of dionysus and sons of epicurus whose motto was everything goes with us another fraternityâperhaps of a somewhat more respectable typeâcame calling at his door adrian  adrian  they knew he was in his room but when he refused to answer a skeleton key was brought out and they unlocked the door then they pounced in on him dragged him from between his sheets and becoming selfappointed valets soon had him in his dress suit and pumps ready to attend the annual prom in the spacious gymnasium

perhaps there is no place in elegant luxurious ostentatious america where so much of its creme de la creme at one time gathers as at a hallpemberton football game and the prom which follows on that night

newport narragansett bar harbor the berkshires atlantic cityâno one of these can gather together all the elite in summer for they vie with one another as do palm beach nassau california and the west indies in the winter but on the day of this game nothing like it happens in the world

mothers do all they can to adorn their daughters for this occasion and they pay unbelievable sums to have their pictures put in the popular dailies an emaciated divorcee whose name is better known in reno than elsewhere fancies that among these inexperienced youths she may find her second husband an old maid tries to make pinauds costly cosmetics take away the parentheses around her lips darkens the few red brows that arc left imports a gown from worth and places her poor deluded brain under a wig by hepner hoping that she may come back to something that she never was in marked contrast arc the sweet lovely unsophisticated girls whose naivete and youthful innocence make them too good to be associated with some of the wild students with whom chance might thrown them at this prom

here never sleeping cupid sports here he breaks and makes hearts here he wins stakes that startle even himself he plays a thousand games but in every one he is master holding every trump in every deck nor docs he resort to sleight of hand but steals their hearts right before their eyes

a senior wrangler avoids a pretty heiress a devout y m c a member falls into the net stretched by a wily little widow two pals dissolve an almost sublime friendship because some blushing beauty may have danced with one more than with the other promises are made oaths are taken only to be broken

what man of the world do you permit your lovely daughter to go into a gathering like this can you not see the evil that is in this crowd of hotheaded undisciplined boys do not take such chances

you see them all together you think that they will all be great successes in the years to come how silly of you do you not know that some of them will fall that some of them will be a disgrace to themselves and to their alma mater

you sit in your box and watch your daughter as she crips over the floorâshe smiles she laughs âshe is happy to whom is she talking pardon me for telling you save her while it is yet time look how she smiles into that fellows face they call him a good fellow everyone docs bah there is no good in him he is called good because circumstances have always favored him he is handsome and clever granted but look do you not see his sinister expression see how he smiles his peculiar smile as the dainty girl looks up at him run i run little innocence

youre a new kind of flower and heâhe is dangerous

they say he is a south american andârich what a lie i but he is not to blame for that the mystery with which he has always surrounded himself has caused others to originate that story and romance is close kin to mystery he in truth was born not ten miles from where he now stands and rich oh no listen ill tell you a secret observe his broad shoulders his great strength his virility well there are three very rich women of middle age who admire that young man one is across the hall now watching the little girl her face is hot she is furious because he is talking to this pretty debutante but she cannot create a scene when she sees him alone she will cry and say you dont care for me any more but he will lie to her and say that he doesâhe has no heartâand they will make up again the other two women are at home oh  run from him little innocence

in the summer time he makes many trips across the ocean beating the sharps at their own games

have you really fallen in love with him if so one is sorryâthat is if one knows you both when he goes abroad this summer he will not return can you forget him as easily as he can you perhaps

who is the stunning woman in the crimson gown red red is always a danger signal what a shame that that inexperienced youth of eighteen should become a victim to her wiles what a fool you are boy that woman had broken many hearts before you had yet learned how caesar built his bridge she tells you pretty things and sets your head in a whirl she told other men the same things when you were in your swaddlingclothes can you not see becky sharp in her eyes and irina on her lips she has no feelings she has broken every toy with which she ever played but one forgets that you do not know women yet you were brought up in sunday school on bible stories gracious did not esther and delilah teach you anything they were both wreckers of men you rave about the color of that womans cheeks and the lustre of her hair why dont you look at her closely she pinches her face to bring the blood every time you turn your head and her hair a fifth avenue coiffure specialist finished that wig for her only yesterday what she told you she was only twentyfour and you believed her how can women say such things she is thirtysix years old where are your eyes

what wretchedness and what happiness are mingled in such a gathering

some of these young men will be great some of them are as pure as untainted snow and as sincere as truth itself some of them will see in the faces of their sweethearts everything that makes life worth while

what is that tune they are playing the blue danube and without knowing it they all thank herr strauss for gladdening so many hearts

then home sweet home will follow and good nightâgood nightâgood night

believe me drawled roland bullock about six oclock the sunday evening after the game as he burst into adrians room she is some girl

adrian who was entertaining himself with one of o henrys latest productions was half reclining in an easy chair with a silk pillow at his back and his legs stretched out obliquely resting his feet on a hassock he neither took his eyes from the book nor replied to the intruder

a crowd had just returned from the station having gone there to say goodbye to their sweethearts of a days acquaintanceâor of a years devotion and of course the parting had cast a gloom over the university the past twentyfour hours had brought to some of them pleasures that they would never know again

they sauntered back from the station lauding adoring worshipping some recentlymet girl and speaking disrespectfully of some others but bullock who wished to play a game of solitaire with his thoughts had jogged on ahead to be alone in order to think only of one girlâto be by himself with the memory of the most beautiful the sweetest the pleasantest girl in the worldâa memory from which he wished never to part

bullock sat down for a moment but rose shortly thereafter and began pacing nervously up and down the floor with his hands thrust deep into his pockets and with a step heavy like that of a german soldier on march thrice he looked at addie who had not yet spoken and whose silence irritated him and at length unable to keep quiet any longer he burst out for heavens sakes old top cant you say anything solacing to a fellow whose heart went away with that girl

pardon me roland said adrian i did not mean to ignore you old chap certainly ill comfort you either go after that heart and bring it back or batter down the door of the science building and get a cats heart they dissected some there friday

cut out the nonsense please i dont want to laugh

i beg of you then roland not to flood me with tears o henry has just awakened lightness of heart in me and i am not willing to throw it into a gurgling pool of tears especially when they come from a man

youre impossible adrian go back to your reading

you wont hold me responsible for your feelings will you

no only i thought

the door opened and in came the rest of the boys that had returned from the station bullock had never stopped trudging the floor and one of the newcomers noting his nervousness said facetiously well roland your actions are perfectly justifiable i guess well all be somnambulists for the night

you know one thing said one of them as they sat down around the room pulling up their trousers pushing back their hats rolling and lighting their pall malls egyptian dainties or bull durhams

yes and only one thing put in a second and that is that miss croydon is the prettiest girl i ever saw

some pippin yes chirped a third

then zack tamer spokeâzack the former bowery bartender who was indebted for his education to shark wilkins who was known as the slickest guy on the bowery and whose attention had been drawn to zacks pellucid mind on a summers day when that youth had mixed for him a rickey with a california orange instead of a lime for zacks vocabulary neither the east side classics of that masterful writer of underworld life chuck connors nor the faultlessly compiled encyclopedia britannica would be responsible for some of his words had their antepenult in arabic penult in hebrew and the last syllable might be either icelandic or an expressive motion of the hand to bring out its meaning yet he affected an air of refinementâhis hair was pompadoured he was dressed in a blackandwhite pinstriped suit with a fraternity medal suspended from a gold watchchain that stretched from one to the other of his upper vest pockets and at one end of the chain was an ingersoll watch but he had never altogether lost the bowery coarseness of cither his manner or his speech

i tell you fellers broke in zack shes got any filly that has ever run on these fast pemberton tracks beat a thousand ways she could give em all a half mile handicap in a mile race and leave em at the last quarter

i protest against your speaking of such an adorable girl as a filly shouted anton scutter

remember gentlemen returned zack that my language was only figurative

then make it more sublime retorted scutter and you know fellows shes heiress to a million too put in bob atkinson

thou hunter of fortune  jeered zack already in your brain little devils of sloth are conspiring to do the first piece of work of their existence they are intent upon winning this girl for you believing that if they could get her they would retire to their downy laissez faire couches to rest forever in beatific tranquillity

you dont suppose id want to marry a pauperized dairymaid do you my father quits me cold as soon as he buys my railroad ticket home in june

certainly said bullock love in a cottage is the only kind what would life be without its struggles sufferings disappointments

you are absurd said atkinson poverty and love do not go together do you suppose xantippe would have been a quarrelsome illtempered henpecking wife and socrates a patient goodhumored henpecked husband if old soc had been a prosperous athenian merchant instead of a lean hungry illfed philosopher lecturer on morals and ethicist

bravo bully for you bob shouted zack i thought that youd lost all of ancients that you ever knew and was sure that you knew no more of socrates affaires du coeur than i do of practical church government but i was mistaken as far as i can see fellows we might dispense with circumlocution and come back to the real subject said adrian

ha  ha  they all laughed then you are interested just a little are you

only to the extent of hearing your wonderfully beautiful eulogies about the young lady beside her venus must have looked like a stone woman if one may judge from your expressions concerning her beauty

but we had consigned you to the class of misogynists had believed you as unimpressionable where girls are concerned as is adamant beaten upon by a baby with its toy hammer said zack

say whats this asked atkinson motioning his head at adrian will he be the mad lover wholl wildly rush forth in pursuit of a resisting maiden

what she resist adrian you say shed give every penny she owns this very second for a smile from him put in scutter

and where did you get so much inside dope asked zack with a distinctly bowery pronunciation

she told a lady friend of mine as much replied scutter all girls have chums you know even when they are in love

urnâphilosopher sneered atkinson

but i thought im not shaped for sportive tricks not made to court an amorous lookingglass sighed tom blackwell a long thin gawky westerner as he picked up a handmirror from the dresser and looked at his almost inhuman face with its prolonged chin that began behind a pair of large cars and ended on his chest between his eyes and his upper lip there were as many reddish brown freckles as his father owned dollars in the western railroads

his frank confession and his lack of sensitiveness because of his homeliness brought forth a roar of laughter

the bard was inexpressibly generous to you tom for having written those lines put in atkinson they fit you every word of them even to the letter

well id like to have your chances adrian said blackwell

why my chances i am not at all sure of them remember the fool that rushed where the angel feared to tread replied adrian in an admonitory manner

taking them all in all put in ted matthews the girls were beautiful last night dont you all think so

yes but so shallow and untrained objected mart downing

blackwell who was a champion of womans rights said let them sit beside us in our classroom for a few years give them an equal chance in all our activities then come to a prom fifty years hence and youll meet with another type

sorry blackwell began mart nonchalantly i cannot call you an innovatorâmill said that half a century ago

yes and havelock ellis would say the same today said a voice from the corner

and pray let frau olive schreiner complete that trio chimed scutter

shut up how do you know shes german snapped matthews

say what you wish about women broke in zack they have gone beyond their capabilities now and are retrograding the greeks had the right dope when they kept them making biscuits in the kitchen

cynic snarled blackwell

i should like some recognition from miss croydon said atkinson

in that you are not alone agreed the others

the bell for the vesper services in one of the city churches pealed forth and silence for a moment filled the room

dr carey speaks on phillips brooks tonight fellows said addie slowly and i think i shall go to hear him

they separated some went to hear the lecture some went to their rooms and others thought that midnight might as well find them in town as in the dorms

dear adrian  because of the wonderful part you played in the football game saturday you no doubt have received a thousand congratulatory letters and telegrams most of which speedily found their way to your wastebasket unread but i beseech you to treat this letter more kindly

you are very likely going to call me a bold adventuress  what matters that to me i have enclosed my sensibilities in walls of adamant so that i may not be hurt by anything that you may say to me

no doubt the centuries that your ancestors believed that this is a mans world still have their influence upon you but the eyes of wisdom of your father adam and of my mother eve were at one and the same time opened together they ate the wonderful fruit that the beguiling serpent had led my mother eve to steal but your father adam took none of the blame he relegated her to domesticism put on her the must nots and claimed everything for himself my pleading for suffrage is neither bellicose nor passionate at least i shall never smash windows i admire femininity hut may not the antelope once in a century leap upon the lion unawares gore him to his heartstrings and get away unscathed

may not iâalthough of a gentler sex you sayâbe daring enough to advance a little to you without your thinking ill of me

yes your game was wonderful but in it all i could see nothing but you you in one dance in our brief conversation it was all the great soul of adrian not the outward adrian at all that i was conscious of

i am forward familiar unconventional yes yes i know yet i am not apologetic how much too long people have already allowed the shadowy filmy barrier of convention to stand between them and their own good

the congenial souls of the earth yearn to understand to know to love one another hotter then let us learn to know each other let us lay to the ground the conventional walls that lie between us walls built of the rock of mistaken modesty

i have said some things i wished to say but not all

let me know what you think of me

remember im the antelope and you the lion

yours wanda croydon

adrian found the letter awaiting him on his return from classroom one morning he hastily replied dear miss croydon your congratulations are highly appreciated but you hint at sentiment

i am a prosaic creature not the sort of person you would care for

to be your friend i should count a very great privilege but loveâwhy it is not in me

sincerely yours adrian birch

she wrote back dear adrian i did not mean to hint at i did not mean to suggest sentiment what i want you to understand is that you have awakened in me what no one else in all the world could have done

no until i saw you i never wanted a lover not even in thought but now i have one and it is you adrian dear you have been reading your plato with your eyes not with your brain does platos theory after all these centuries still have followers i was sureâpoor ignorant little iâ that men had buried it face downward and written upon its tomb this epitaph gone forever certainly he could never have intended it to be interpreted as it has been interpreted

you propose a friendship between two persons of opposite sex preposterous adrian it can no more be than a fairhaired boy can kiss his elbow and straightway be transformed into a beautiful blonde girlâyou remember that nursery story

and even if we would have it so how could it be adrian god did not start us off that way the emotion that he planted in the first two people was later to be the awakening of love between the opposite sexes an emotion stronger than any friendship can ever be and the only kind that can exist between a man and a woman

look into your soul adrian and confess to me that i am right wanda

when adrian dropped the reply to her first letter in the letterbox he resolved to drop from his mind the memory of her but her second letter shocked him greatly disturbed his thoughts

she was skeptical regarding his knowledge of plato she had made a weak attempt to interpret biblical love and most appalling of all she supposed him interested in her

beneath the violet of her dark eyes was entombed a soul not of the pureness that he had supposed but steeped in vulgarity the words from her pretty lips were children of a brain that was carnal sensual

she was a shatterer of conventions a wrecker of a decorum that was a thousand years old she had a religious face a devilish heartâshe was a truthful dissembler a perfidious angel

in her was not one jot of the modesty that he had believed hers she was even unworthy of the feminine fineness of her handwriting her girlish talks and actions were for the prom and that being over she now revealed her real self he was angered because he had allowed himself to think so well of her

but wait adrian you misjudge her you are ignorantâbound by conventions when one reveals his real self to you you do not like it you prefer shams

if you had written first to wanda and told her that from the milky way you would pluck enough stars to make a string of pearls to adorn her lovely neck if she had set aflame in your heart an imperishable love and you had told her so would you have been forward bold

young man lover of the old despiser of the new you pretend that you like sincerity but you do not you want delusion counterfeit humbug you have always wanted it you would not know the truth if you could you cry for that which you do not understand and what you understand you do not want you want dissimulation prevarication you like the mysterious the shadowy gilded things attract you

lamb chops eaten from a plain platter would not taste as well nor send as much good nutritious red blood coursing through your veins as would chops eaten from a silver platter garnished with lettuce tomatoes and parsley

nobody likes to be told the truth a poor man soon leaves the church where he is told that he desecrates the sabbath when he goes to sunday morning baseball the rich clubman will not permit his minister to tell him that he breaks the sabbath when he passes the holy day in playing tennis golf poker and pinochle even though these men know that such admonitions are good for their souls they will not listen to them they want to be lied to they do not want to know their real selves for them to look into their own souls is scarcely bearable but the cold critical scrutinizing insight of another person is something that they cannot stand and so they make masks of their faces and tell lie after lie in order to conceal their poor pitiful real selves

wanda knew that she had been moved her thoughts of adrian gave her happinessâa happiness that she had never known before in her breast swelled up emotions that to her were new yet as old as the sun itself warm yet as pleasant as a gentle breeze after a shower turbulent yet as calm as a lake at dawn fearful yet confident with overwhelming assurance

as plainly and as truly as she could she had tried to tell adrian how she felt believing that he would understand but her letter had met with disfavor had been ignoredâwas repulsive

yet when he thought the best of her his very soul shamed him for having allowed his thoughts to be steered by the aged halfblind pilot of convention into the foaming channels of what it seems ought to be because it seems always to have been

was not this girl to him the loveliest of all that is lovely the most beautiful of all that is beautiful the most womanly of all that is womanly in woman

zelda rode home greatly perturbed after a strenuous day she was completely fatigued body and mind

leons persistent insistence that she go away with him was like biting stinging acid poured on her wounded heart

judged by the standard of human goodness zelda was a good woman she tried in the midst of her trouble to look optimistically upon life she tried to believe that adversities and disappointments are but temporary evils sent to develop ones character

she wanted to run the race set before her to endure to the end to travel the narrow path to get up when she stumbledâshe wanted to keep the faith

centuries ago some philosopher said that nothing was unchanging at rest the earth the seas the trees lifeâeverythingâis in incessant motion each life changes and the mind the beliefs the thoughts that make it up change with it

if some person in whom we had unbounded confidence should commit an act that would shake that confidence we would lose it with regret admitting that to err is human but if we were to tell an ascetic chat our faith in christianity was wavering to him it would be a shock almost unbearable yet sometimes it seems in the midst of tribulations that ones faith must waver must sicken almost unto death everything changes but the difference between faith in god and faith in humanity is that though faith in god may at times seem to be breathing its last the healer of healers gives new breath new inspiration and our faith revives

the thoughts of the past combined with the forebodings of the future sickened zelda she questioned the justice of a supreme being the rewards of a life of usefulness was there any difference between the fruit of an evil tree and that of a good tree if one did not taste the fruit each looked equally pleasing could she be mistaking appearance for realities had her life been a failure

she thought of the following story that she had recently read a careless sower aimlessly scatters grains of corn upon uncultivated soil he goes off and leaves them to care for themselves let nature take care of them he argues why should she not they are her children the seeds are hearty and try to live and nature looking compassionately on them gives them rebirth sprouts them nurtures them they spring up grow maturc and yield ears the grains of which are large regular full and juicy he invites his neighbor to come over to see him reap to see him pull the ears from their stalks his neighbor is a judge of produce wonderful  ejaculates the neighbor when the husk is torn away revealing grains fullsized beautiful in whiteness i should win a prize if i could farm like you he continues sincerely after his host has told him what results he had received from so little care

another sower plants corn in fertile soil when weeds would choke the shoots he chops down the intended murderers when it does not rain he turns cooling water on them to cool their little parching tongues they grow they mature the stalks are thin but strong and sinewy their tassels meekly bending a little

the two sowers live on adjacent lots and their harvests are ready at the same time for reaping he too invites the neighbor to see his pulling

with assurance he pulls back the husk the neighbor sees a small grain regular full but not with the bursting fulness of the corn of the careless sower the grains are yellow not white but he again exclaims wonderful his exclamation now however is not sincere and he feels ashamed of his hypocrisy

would the observer passing by the show window ever know that one ear of the corn exhibited there had been given more attention than the other

the neighbor to test the worth of each took them home and prepared them for eating seasoning them to please his palate

small insignificant things should be out of the way first soliloquized he so into the small ear he stuck his teeth it had all the freshness and sweetness of youth ravenously he ate it at each bite wishing that by some magical power the emptied space on the ear might again be straightway filled that he might feast forever it was so good

then he took the large ear grown in stony ground from all sides he admired it and praised its producer at last he bit into itâtwas like biting into chaff it was tasteless tough almost bitter it was fit only for swine and goats not even a chicken would thrive on it while a lord would willingly have paid a good price for the other

then he said to himself i have been fooled  i have taken the shadow for the substance i have trusted deceptive treacherous vision i have taken appearances for realities

then are both sowers deserving of equal praise isnt it the welldirected useful life thats worth while both ears of corn had been natures children yes but one was her child with chance as one of its progenitors while the other was her child too but it was also the child of reason one was a child uncared for unaided the other had been protected nourished and nature striving always to perfect everything she produces had cooperated with reason in its nurture

zelda looked out through the windows of the automobile

the grass was dead the shrubs lifeless at a distance she could see a tree naked stripped of its foliage

on one of its branches there still clung a leaf which was being blown hither and thither by the wind beneath this branch she could see a blueheaded woodpecker thrusting its bill into the trees body as if moved by a machine but among all this wintry death zelda could see some life the round strong evergreensâfirs and cedars

the wind swept over the mountain at a merciless terrific gait into the face of her driver above her head when she looked heavenward in the november sky clouds were collecting and disintegrating a storm seemed imminent the sky was black not a star in sight yet this threatening heaven fascinated zelda

presently she caught sight of a star that shone but dimly and just as she saw it the envious jealous clouds must have seen it too for the clouds rushed to it and so obscured it that it faded into nothingness but still she watched

suddenly the moving clouds came together and formed a cross as perfect as the one on which the saviour gave his precious life an atonement for the worlds sin

from the point of intersection of this cross shone the once bedimmed star now with unbelievable brilliancy it seemed to light up heaven and earth it seemed to zelda a covenant a light from gods own hand a light similar to that which emanated from the dying jesus head

so she thought is every lifeâa star life at twilight it is born bright then the night clouds come and hide it but at dawn it shines brilliantly because it is stronger steadier after the nights darkness

leons threats were clouds nights come to darken her path to make her lose her way from these thoughts she was aroused when the chauffeur stopped the car and opened the door

at dinner stanton said but very little to her and for this she was truly glad his natural reserve and his unobservant manner when he was engrossed in thought were to her a great boon at this time for it relieved her from answering the questions that he certainly would have asked her concerning her disturbed lookâa look that she had tried to conceal she had passed an extra quarter of an hour before her dresser trying to cover up the dark linesâchildren from the wombs of worry and anxiety and fearâunder her eyes and she had rested hoping to bring some color into her sallow cheeks

the whole afternoon her husband had been in the library studying the systems of taxation preparing for the speech that he was to make that night

our present system is wrong he thought the man of moderate means who improves his property beautifies his home surrounds himself with good pure air in an elevated location should not bear the greater part of the taxes a gross injustice is committed    the burdenbearers should be the rich real estate owners and dealers they push their tenants into low marshy places âbirthplaces of malaria and typhoidâinto houses with leaking roofs paneless windows watercovered cellars where tuberculosis is king in these squalid rooms idiots are born weaklings anarchists evilminded creatures without moral codes away from christian and uplifting environment these hotbeds of disease endanger the health and peace of the community for them the state must have sanitariums for tubercular patients madhouses schools for the weakminded homes for weaklings why not make the very wealthy improve their property thereby increasing the chances of life for the rich as well as the poor by providing better healthier surroundings 

zelda as she was to be alone that evening would have time to compose herself to rest her jaded mind

but thought she as she kissed stanton goodbye suppose leon should be here at which fearful thought rapid waves of heat followed by still faster waves of cold ran through her body her spine felt as if it had been taken from between two cakes of ice her knees shook like a windblown leaf

she made one step but her feet did not seem inclined to move grasping the big brass knob of the door she steadied herself against it and suddenly â happy thought â she remembered that leon too had gone out for the night

out into the nights blackness she stood gazing âseeing nothingâthinking thinking thinking

in her warm bedroom laden with the odor of fresh cut flowers she prayed the deep crimson light cast its bedimmed reflection over the ornamented walls over the embroidered curtains and woven rugs she was surrounded by all the luxury the taste the voluptuousness of the sensuous orient

in her kneeling posture her gown of silk which clung to her revealed every line of her perfect formâher curving shoulders the almost masculinely strong muscles of her back her small waist her slightly curving hips from which she tapered down to her little feet which heels upward in juliettes of baby blue tint stuck out from beneath her gown in her ivory white arms folded before her she buried her face

the crimson light throwing itself upon the two big black plaits of silken hair that hung over her shoulders gave the effect of a sinking bloodeyed sun pouring its last rays upon the wings of a crow upon this boweddown suppliant leon gazed i he could hear her beseeching gods mercy for the worlds redemption asking him to feed the hungry clothe the naked warm the chilled he heard her resigning herself solely to him imploring him to make her more compassionate less selfish and last of all he heard her say in tones of pleading humility oh lord show leon thy goodness greatness thy mercy and love down beside her he started to throw himself and penitently exclaim yes lord i am thine show me thy ways thy goodness thy mercy and i will follow

but straightway some imp within him said thou fool i thou prayest to the wind and it bloweth harder in thy face to the sun and it burneth deeper into thy skin the waters and they engulf thee in more rapidly gurgling pools what have his goodness his mercy his love done for thee when thou stoodest on the apex of the mountain of success he swept it from under thy feet when thou wert sober he made thee a drunkard a vagabond when in love he stole thy loved one from thee now fool revenge thyself with all the mad mercilessness of an avenger

zelda arose like brighteyed rosycheeked aurora issuing from her nightly prison she seemed undaunted yet shy austere yet gentle commanding yet forgiving human yet angelic

as she turned buck the covering to get into the bed she felt herself within the grasp of two flabby arms sidewise leon had seized her and was raining hot kisses on her checks neck arms forehead he rendered her speechless the fright made the blood rush to her face the vein in her round neck showing itself above her nightdress stood out

she was almost senseless and he began drawing her close to him so that they felt the beat of each others heart his breath blew into her face

before she could regain her strength he began in a drunken manner zelda i tell you you are my breath my blood my heart my life without you i can no more live than can a striving weed in a mountain glen where it never catches one ray of the warming sun i wither i suffer in the desire to preserve my own existence i die in the struggle

no no  zelda do not reproach me hate me i know i am a dissipated vagabond do not think that i am ignorant of the fact my brain though diseased is a reflecting glass revealing to me my whole sordid mean debased drunken licentious soul but god zelda cant a fellow have a chance

in the noxious filthy pestilential marshes of brazil grows a flower of the rarest sort perhaps men would never think of going to this pestiferous insalubrious bog to get it were it not for its purity its sweetness its beauty but over the bad soil that gives it birth it throws out its sweet odor it stands up majestically commanding all who go near behold  i am a thing of wondrous beauty living in the swamps because they are kind to me and i will grow nowhere else forget my muddy unclean mother and the great struggle you have had in reaching me for i am worth it all so then let your lilypure self be a rare flower a prize worth a struggle growing nowhere else but out of my black muddy grimy life but diffusing your sweetness throughout the world

i was not always a marsh life for me too once held joys sublime enchanting like those they tell us arc to be found in heaven then you were my all i wanted you until i thought zelda thought and thought zelda until i lived zelda and nothing else

when i had made fortunes when men feared me and respected my brain when i was honored when fathers pointed me out to their sons and said theres a great young man when reporters sought me like hungry pups following a bone that i might say one word for them to print when i was a successâthen somebody told them that i was a

good god  dont say it shrieked zelda frantically but he went on that i could have stood the world was large and i knew it i knew that i knew more of the paths that lead to success than do most men and i could go somewhere else change my name if need be

i say i could have stood that stigma could have found myself again but god your godl zelda when they told me you were five years married that you had a son and he did not bear my name the world ended for me i what had been paradise was now poisoned by the venomous serpent the floods came and wiped away all life mens tongues confused me their voices irritated me the earth rushed back into the void whence it came and god withdrew himself from it

all that had been sweet now became bitter happiness became wretchedness from being healthyminded i became morbid then i thought that perhaps your husband might die that i might come again into your heart

i always saw your eyes gleaming like the light that shines in heaven above making bright the way to each traveler with all the fervor of our childhood i still adored you worshiped you as when you dominated me as when as children we slept in each others arms as when we declared our love for each other in old marks ratinfested garret say that you love me zelda

sobbing deeply and too weak to make an attempt to release herself from his grip she said almost inaudibly i cant

cant he retorted angrily you did

in childhood i thought i did

thought you did in childhood then why not now

forgive me leon i was ignorant a child i did not know i knew nothing you knew nothing except childish love we did not know each other but now it is different do you suppose i could love you now

oh rot answered leon irritated by her refusal you dissimulator you didnt know why it is the first lesson a woman learnsâto wring a mans heart to steal his soul to make his life miserable her bewitching smiles the lovelight in her eyes the allurement of her voiceâ these she is born with or soon learns as she looks with vanity into a lookingglass i want you and i am going to have you no matter what it costs

she had now regained herself and her well preserved strength stood her in good stead for she wrenched herself free and threw him back against the wall with a crash so that he tilted the dresser as he stumbled

there  she said youre a coward

you are mistaken he replied love is a warrior he fights to win

if mr birch should catch you here hed kill you

if the loneliness of a pining heart or the joy it gets from having found the one for whom it longs docs not kill neither can the fire of lead nor the ice of steel

anne the maid stood in the door and looked at them amazed she had heard him declare his love to her had seen him kiss her had seen her in his arms had seen her crash him against the wall and now she stood white as a statue speechless wondering what it could all mean

if zelda had known that she had been seen she would not have lived another minute the thought of having been seen by one servant while another made passionate love to her would have caused her to die by her own hands

youre going away with me said leon coming upon her again but carefully for he was a coward he was conscious that he was no match for her knowing that his persistent indulgence had robbed him of his strength but he had a weapon to use upon her that was far more powerful than forceâhis knowledge of her past life his knowledge of what she was

im not going to spoil the years ive spent in making my life happy by letting you with your threats come between me and my husband she said feeling confidence in herself

you wont he sneered then ill spoil them for you what will they say when i tell them youve lain in my arms all night that you promised to marry me that you solicited my presence in your room when your husband was away

stop  stop  liar hypocrite those are all lies and men will not believe them cried zelda almost crazed

i know theyre lies went on leon but men love to believe lies about women what will they say i ask when i tell them that i sent you checks while you were in school that my picture was in your locket that you kept until the day your child was born your husband not knowing it what will they say when i tell them that you are a

have mercy leon she begged

then promise youll go with me

i cant

promise

still stoutly she answered i cant

do you want the world to know a slam of the front door was heard hes coming promise 

ill meet you she whispered and fell senseless on the bed while he glided out of the door

zelda arose after a sleepless night all night long she had lain awake waiting for day and it seemed to her that ages had passed before the dawn came she had managedâhow she did not knowâto gain sufficient strength to get herself properly into bed before stanton came into the room they were oldfashioned in this respect âthey shared the same roomâand few words passed between them while stanton was preparing for bed

during the night she had been careful not to awaken stanton who was a very light sleeper for she felt that had he awakened and questioned her she would have broken down and told all her troubles

when she arose her face was anemic her eyes were old with worry myriads of years had passed over her

she had promised under compulsion to meet leonâfor what to have him slip the noose around her neck

no she would meet him he was mad her husband kind stanton would protect her would defy anybody to say aught against her but could she ask him for protection against a secret such as hers

in a murky room on the fourth floor back of one of the oldfashioned houses on the lower eastside near the haunts in which the monk eastmans and other eastside gangsters had hidden after they had played a disastrous game zelda found herself the place had had no proper ventilation for generations but now the swift morning wind rushed through the broken panes and apertures where the mortar between the bricks had crumbled away in fact not even her heavy furs afforded sufficient warmth to zelda and the rusty oil stove that leon lighted gave out but little heat

on the walls hung carelessly a few disgusting pictures and tacked up here and there were cards on which baseball players and prizefighters figuredâdonations from the cigarette factories that send out these specimens of art into the world through piedmonts trophies fatimas then there were favorite race horses matinee idols of the star and garter shows and two or three kodak pictures of the annual saloonmens outing

the floor was carpetless and a step in this hollow room sounded as strange as the breath of a ghost in a graveyard at midnight over toward one corner was an old darkcolored washstand that had no spread on it except a covering of gray dust about half an inch thick and on it was a dilapidated wash bowl and pitcher

the musty appearance of the place had disgusted and sickened zelda

listen said she as she sat down in one of the two chairs at a square uncovered table in the center of the room the chair screeching as she sat down this is the last time i shall ever follow you because of your threats

leonâwho had either not heard her so busy was he with fixing the stove or if he had paid no attention to herâobserved blandly this shall be made a comfortable little apartment when you with your domestic skill have fitted it up i selected it because it was out of your world away from the people you knew away from the people who knew you here we may remain in perfect peace until weve matured our plans then we shall go to spend the rest of our happy existence together

i repeat that this is the last time i shall ever follow you

pardon me dearest had you made that remark before indeed i did not hear you he went on affably but as you like perhaps i shall not ask you to go farther if you wish otherwise we may stay right here and the world will never know where we are

from her inside pocket zelda drew a long book and tore therefrom a slip it was a check for fifty thousand dollars she handed it across the table to him saying leon here is a check for  which i shall place in a downtown bank today and for which you may call whenever you wish to it i shall place ten thousand yearly to your credit isnt that enough to pay off the old debt between us wont you let me live my life for that amount

coming around to her with a pleased look in his face he drew the other chair up beside her placed his knees in it took her hand in his looked into her deep eyes and said coldly almost thou persuadeth me then he turned away with a diabolical laugh

she controlled herself still hoping to win him over

but zelda dearest he said with fifty thousand we could fly america go to the isles of the sea and live like lords with it you could make me a man i should soon be making our own money we would change our names i should be useful in affairs of government and before we knew it they would have me the popular candidate for a responsible official position in one of the south sea islands when shall we start

i cannot go with you here you may be independent you may have valets enjoy art have luxuries live happily as you once did when you were yourselfâwhen you had moneyâmay entertain your friendsâmay

money money he broke in with it and without you my sun would turn to darkness what shall i do with money tis you zelda all of you i want he came and caught her in his arms you want me to live happily independent as i once was i tell you not one minutes happiness had i seen from the time i left you years ago until my eyes rested on you again independence would be nothing without you to have fine homes luxuries wealth and to be loveless with no childs voice yelling through the halls with no mothers tender words calling the sweet infant to herâwhat happiness could there be in that but leon have you no humane feelings left are your sympathies dead have you no sense of right my husband is good to me he is all in all to me he loves me he is true to meâare you going to shame me before him must i be a scandal before the world a hypocrite before my husband wont you have compassion believe me i want to be truthful to my husband to you to the world do you

huh he sneered you speak of truth truth changeable creature of mans idiotic brain i where can we find you among what peoples in what lands to what two men do you mean the same to what two families to what two countries to what two nations to what two races because of a truth in new york one would be made governor for that same truth in jersey city he would be electrocuted at trenton a lie in boston is the truth in capetown the truth in london is a lie in pekin there is no such thing as general truth every truth is individual i shall make my lies what i will and call them truths and you are going to do so because i ask it leon are you made of stone dont you see my plight the leaves of my life are white every page is open for the worlds eyes except oneâand that is as black as the hinges of night made so by fear hypocrisy the want of equal chance the wish for equal human liberty made so but you arc the only person that can interpret that strange dark page leave it unread leon dont let people know i have befriended you dont be an ingrate

silence he broke in listen the fall comes the swine are turned loose in the woods through them they roam hunting their food to an oak they come the earth beneath it is tiled with acornsâthey eat their heads always down always grunting never looking up to see whence the bounty falls never ceasing to grunt as the only appreciation of their givers kindness

thus is the whole human raceâhogs ingrates wanting to seize everything to give back nothing and if under the tree of gods bounty we find ourselves do any of us thank him praise him without a grunt no and iâi could be nothing other than an ingrate when for twentyfive years i have been like tantalus reaching for that which i wanted had it at my fingers tip yet never able to seize it to get it within my grasp you condemn everything that is good but men were not born to live the life of brutes said zelda

let me see your look of love again let me look at the world through your eyes of happiness believe me one of the worlds evildoers who needs your help love me because you once did because you can make me love the world again

from his pocket he drew a halfpint flask and drank from it with great swallows a long silence intervened they did not hear the merry laughter of the children they could not hear the unbroken sound of roller skates nor the punt of a cheap football the silence of the room made it seem as if the world were taking a noonday nap they both heard their hearts beating the dirty stove was getting hot and the stuffy room grew suddenly warmer zelda began to unbutton her coat but before she knew it she was holding her gloved hand near the stove to warm her fingers which were strangely cold

leon having noticed her unbuttoning her coat said affectionately thats right dearest take off your coat and be comfortable  although there is as yet no boudoir you shall have one as soon as youve arranged things tastefullyâwe may do very well for a while let me assist you

she said nothing but she looked straight into his eyes as he stood opposite her

how much will you take to lock up in your soul what you know about me and leave america i dont know he replied how much will you give me

every penny that i possess

why be so foolish with onehundredth of it you could hire thugs in new york they could put me out of the way they probably would never be caught and you never even suspected so grand and philanthropic a lady

i do not want to commit murder

but i shall kill your husband if he longer stands between us i cannot bear for you the only object in the world that means anything to me to give him willingly all your heart and life while i must take your icy kisses look at your cold eyes force caresses upon you only because i frighten you with my threats of divulging what youd give all your happiness to keep unknown if i can get him out of your life away from your eyes perhaps then i may return

oh shameless manâmurderer  she said starting back horrified of what are you made have you no conscience

ha  he said coldly looking at her out of the corner of his bulging dissipated eyes i tell you conscience is a dangerous thing it makes cowards of men it makes them fear to avenge a wrong done them fear to smite back when smitten although they know that their own book says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth they spare the wretch who has ruined their sister who terrifies a community who stands in the way of their happinessâhappiness is lifes chief end by the wayâsimply because they fear what fools call conscienceâconscience which makes them see indescribable monsters at night which makes them jump at the slightest sound which burdens their minds until maddened they jump into some swift stream or turn on the gas or take a drink of some poison or most thrilling of all they blow out their idiotic brains he laughed a triumphant laugh and stalking over to the back window looked out upon the great town

for a while she sat motionless then she began to beat her fingers nervously but noiselessly upon the table such misery as hers she would have until now believed impossible she wondered if there was any good anywhere in the world she knew that she must have some shadows but must she not have some sunshine too

the woman in her wanted to burst into tears she longed to cry help help the listening world would pity and aid her but then their curious exacting and critical tongues would demand to know the culprit and could she ever tell

what to do she did not knowâshe had tried every possible way she knew to win him over all with no avail she had appealed to his sympathies to his sense of right and wrong she had offered him her every penny she had prayed god to change his wicked heart her appeal to leons sympathy had been scorned to his sense of justice had been ridiculed and her check had been snatched torn into bits and flung into the streets

all this mattered not to him he wanted her or ânothing

to have her child her husband the world know that she was a hypocrite to have them know what she wasâall this was distracting but to give herself up to this man who though once brilliant had now by his sensuality dissipation and shamelessness sunk so deep in degradation would have been worse than death

calmly and deliberately she arose from the chair and began to put on her coat

he turned from the window and faced her

she said in a very determined manner i shall no longer be intimidated by your threats i shall no longer be humiliated by your unrelenting tongue which snaps at everything good in the world  i have appealed to that which was good in you have appealed to the friendship that you had for me in childhood have tried to soften your heart have offered you every penny i have in the worldâif you would only leave me in peace all you have refused now do what you like come what may im going to face it all your terrorizing me is at an end tell them everything let them know i do not fear their curses as much as i hate your presence and she reached for the door to open it butâit was locked

a fine piece of emotionalism said leon calmly but you must be yourself certainly you do not wish people to know that

i tell you it is at an end she said as her quick eyes discerned the key that he had carelessly laid on the mantel

she reached for it but he seeing her did the same and their hands met

her defiant manner and the strong liquors that he had been continually drinking angered him he rushed at her throat as a maddened bulldog at his opponent but she being on the defensive protected herself they struggled in each others grip against the table upsetting it and it fell with a crash

the strangled cry of help help i was heard as when one is being choked

another crash was heard and thenâa double shot from a pistol

at her cry of help the feeble door had been broken down by a strong young redfaced man who fired two shots from his revolver to frighten off leon but he crazed by liquor and his passion was heedless of them and had to be torn away by the rescuer who would have used him badly had not zelda interfered

knowing that unless leons requests should be granted he might attempt some violence to her she had hired a plain clothes man whom she instructed to follow her closely and to come at once if she called

this man now led the way down the dark dirty stairs and when they reached the street they all separated zelda met many people who eyed her closely because her presence in the neighborhood bespoke something unusual the regular eastsiders know every person who regularly comes into and goes out of their boundaries

just how long one can endure anxiety everpresent fear and worry is uncertain but one fact is beyond disputeâthese dark mental troubles make themselves startlingly visible by circles under the eyes by freshcut paths around the once perfectly smooth mouth by the pallidness of the check that was once roseate

these alarming changes in zelda naturally could not escape the notice of stanton nor indeed of any one who had known her prior to leons coming

all the cosmetics in the world and all the beautyrestoring devices could not bring back to zelda the lustre of her eyes nor cover up her wrinkles all the suggestions of a skilled nerve specialist with his rest cures could not make her stop jumping at the slightest sound

the only cure for her was to get leon out of her life and out of her sight beyond the possibility of his returning

she had the sympathy of her husband and of everyone who knew her for they thought the sudden change in her was due to her unceasing devotion to the home and to her indefatigable efforts in caring for it

when she returned home that afternoon after the painful experience with leon stanton became more than ever apprehensive of her condition he postponed his proposed western trip three days and called in the family physician who straightway ordered her to bed and her attempt to show them that there was no cause for their disquietude was ineffectual

her husbands gentleness and kindness to her made her trying position all the more bitter her conscience tortured her her whole life had been one of hypocrisyâto her husband to her son to the world god the magnitude of her sins was beyond calculation she had transgressed one of the most serious commandments of the decalogue why not she thought make a clean breast of it and tell stanton her whole story

she thought that she might lose her mind and in her ravings tell him everything that weighed so heavily on her heart would it be better to tell him while she was sane no the chance was too great as it was she might be for years tortured by leon and still be able to smile once in a while but without stanton without adrian without her work life would be nothing if leon once opened his mouth she could never hold up her head again

stanton before leaving pleaded with her that she would not work so hard and begged her to promise that she would go to the home no more until she felt better

the rapid approach of christmas however made her forget his cautionings since her first christmas in the district her custom had been to have a great dinner on that day and to distribute little presents to the children with so much to do she could not long remain at home inactive

it was an unusually mild december sun when she started from clairmont for newton except for the many things suggestive of yuletide one might have thought it a may day

as soon as the daily services were over she started for her regular rounds of inspection just inside the doors that led from the corridor of the main floor to the basement where he had only a short while before met her leon rose up again apparently from nowhere

we meet again he said tauntingly

i thought she replied that the severe treatment given you in new york had been enough for you

dull scissors do not cut he said they only snag that brute only sharpened my anger only made me crave more for my hearts satisfaction only made you my earthly goal and heavenly end loom up brighter and nearer to me

get out of the way that i may pass she demanded

ill open my arms that you may pass into them zelda he mocked

if you touch me i shall scream for the engineer

as you please he retorted but remember that when you scream this time it will be my men who will answer not yours your engineer is not in this building nor is your watchman both are being securely held on the outside with your own money i have bribed them now ha  ha he laughed will you yell

she realized her danger

why did you come here again today she asked

why did you leave me in new york we might have made our plans there and might now be out of the reach of all possible meddlers i came to ask you for the last time to go away with me if you do not go voluntarily iâhe spoke with emphasisâam going to force you away leon expected that she would fall on her knees and beg his mercy but he was mistaken and her selfconfidence disconcerted him

im not going with you no matter what you do she said i shall face it all i am going to stay right here with those whom i love and who love me im going to stay with stanton with adrian with the poor little crippled childrenâ the homeless illclothed cold needy fatherless unprotected im not going to turn my face away from the sun of heavens kindness just because you a dark shadow have come back into my life do you think that i believe that god in his goodness would let my life of usefulness be wrecked by yours when you poison every living thing you touchâi who nurse his sick help his poor feed his hungry and

shut up woman he yelled you do nothing unselfishly why dont you do what you wish because you wish to because its in you because youre human youre afraid napoleon was the nearest to human perfection that ever lived why dont you imitate him he loved with all the human passion of his soul he spilt human blood he took human life but he also had mercy compassion he was not always making apologies he did not have that everlurking fear of afterpunishment he saw what he was born to do and did it caring not what others thought or did    oh zelda and his voice broke you belong to me but you wont give me the hand that pulls one out of the mire

leon she said sadly i want you to do good ill help you to do good i will give you money to go anywhere in the world and act with freedom without poverty care or want but it must not be near me if i should act kindly toward you you would misinterpret my motive will you go 

yes but you must go with me

but i said i couldnt go

you must

i cant i cannot i tell you

i give you this last chance

ill never leave

then zelda misery is misery if you fear that you would be miserable with me and wont go im going to make you miserable here im going to make your loving stanton kick you out as he would a dog i am going to make your son shrink from you as he would from a leper calling you a false lying mother im going to make the kiddies who call you lady bountiful call youâ im going to make the world call you hypocrite liar im going to tell all i know

stop leon please she cried

then will you go

i cannot

ill force you 

he blew a whistle and before she could turn around she was being taken out bodily by several strong men

oh thank you thank you she mumbled feebly as she was helped up the steps did they kill himâi mean did they hurt him badly will he come back do you think she ran on incoherently and then said apologetically i dont know what im saying but youll pardon me wont you you see the fright quite upset me

oh thats all right madam i understand i understand he said consolingly i knows dat little tings like dat will make you noivous but its all right its all right you see we couldnt figure out dat guys game when hed come in fitzs joint and buy everybody a drink and den make his gitaway we knowed right away that something was wrong somewhere see so i frames up and puts me gang on him to watch we thought he might a been one of de bulls in plain clothes see so we always had our peepers open to see when hed come in den we seen him go in dc home one day and wondered what dis guy was doing see and today when we seen him wid a bunch of strange boobs we knows right away dat somethin was wrong so i gits on de job and stations me men on all de corners we watched de auto dat stood out in front of de home and when i seen him rush you out i blows my whistle see de way dat guy started off wid dat machine i thought hed wreck it

oh dont go yet said zelda let me thank you again for all that youve done youve saved my life for im sure they would have killed me if you had not prevented them when i came among you to establish my work ten years ago you remember you saved me then from being torn to pieces by some of your own gangâ you rememberâand here you have done the same again cant i thank you in some other way

well i must be going now me and oreillysâyou know oreilly de copâgot a deal on tonight and hell be sore as blazes if i dont be dere at seven when he come on his beat see so long madâ

wont you come in and have dinner she interrupted

oh no madam dats all right and dont fear well git dat head guy all right so long

he ran down the steps and jumped into the taxicab and zelda went into the house bewildered with frightful reflections and still more frightful anticipations

she looked over her mail and found a telegram from stanton and a letter from elsie van deman wishing her a happy xmas the message from stanton she answered immediately

she did not dress for dinnerâwhich had been prepared by thomas the butler as it was leons day outâbut went as she was when it was announced

she ate alone perhaps it was better so she sat at the table with her head sidewise resting on her left palm the bisque was forced down and she merely nibbled at the roast and took no salad nor dessert at all

not even the visit from the brocktons who were always the most agreeable company aroused her from heavy gloom she even welcomed their goingâa thing that she had never before done

that night in bed she lived over every event in her life analyzing it and then synthesizing it again

each happening of her early years passed like so many gaily colored flowers in a gardenâ flowers of indescribable beauty and variety they passed like slowly moving scenes in a moving picture ever moving ever beautiful each one more attractive than its predecessor she saw herself a happy child with her mother at yorktown she remembered the brave and companionable leon of her childhood the school in mrs marks garret and she remembered with infinite pleasure even mrs marks herself oh the happiness of childhood i she remembered with satisfaction the things that she had done for the patients at the hospital she rememberedâso vividlyâher love and her marriage with stanton oh the sublimity of a marriage of love

she remembered how her heart began to swell how she lived in a world in which there were only stanton herself and her little child that was yet to be born how she would dress him when he was a month old what college he should go to what a great man he would be she remembered how she had fairly worshipped that baby when they had brought it to her two hours old oh the heavenliness of motherhood

she remembered the first days of her work at the homeâthe disappointments that she had in the beginning all past now and those same disappointments now seemed as pearls in the sunshine of her life for she could see that some one was being led aright that some one was deriving benefit from her work what a joyful satisfaction there is in good works 

and then the scene changed in the films now are countless devils tormenting the soul of one who would evade them this horrible picture appears and there stands not the leon of childhood but leon morbid skeptical tormenting this picture docs not pass on and make way for another as the beautiful ones did it lingers it does not even move heavens is the machine out of order will it never turn from the ghastly satanic scene

her head becomes hot everything is in a rapid rotary motion she thinks herself in a room with countless doors of escape yet whenever she opens one in rushes a fire that would cat up her very soul

she was sleeping now and the unforgettable nightmare seemed interminable

adrian was alarmed at his thoughts he had never imagined that at any time in his early life he would have any time for thoughts of sentiment yet they came now unsummoned he wished to become a lawyer and he gave up many pleasures in order to give his time to his studies he wanted later on to become one of the worlds great to hear his voice in the senate of the united states to see his picture in the temple of fame but while he was ambitious he was not avaricious nor heartless he wanted to meet men who were men to battle with them and to win and nothing seemed to him too great a sacrifice if he could accomplish this

he did not play football because he liked it but because the college honor was involved and he knew that his playing would bring joy to his fellow students he tried to keep clear of anything that might stand in the way of his ambition

he had to acknowledge to himself however that miss croydon had made a very great impression upon him he could not put her out of his mind

he now buried his face in his hands and tried to fix his eyes fast on the cold pages of a scientific volume but at the beginning and end of each line his mental eye saw her standingâsweet lovely radiant she followed each line with him she went into his brain and helped it interpret the meaning she said always go on adrian push forward i want to help you

he closed the book to shut out the vision but he could not

he did not try to bring her to his mind she came herself uninvited and more and more he was beginning to find that he was welcoming her yet he would not be truthful to himself he liked to think i shall be a man of the people i have no time for love but even so the smile on her lips stayed in his eyes her voice like music stayed in his heart

in the hurrying crowd that between five and seven oclock comes nightly out of new york going to different towns in northern new jersey over the lackawanna adrian was rushing

he had barely stepped off the ferry in hoboken when a voice which he immediately recognized said invitingly why dont you save your ticket until the next time however much he tried to make himself believe otherwise he was glad to hear that voice

he turned and beside him he saw a dark brown limousine through the halfopen door of which wanda looked with a smile

wont you get in she asked and before adrian could frame an excuse he was in the car speeding offâhe did not know whither

i am very glad to see you again miss croydon he said as he seated himself since i saw you last i have heard enough floral speeches about you to fill a volume of a thousand pages what do you mean she asked the little smile that adrian remembered so well playing on her lips

i mean my fellow students your admirers have said the most complimentary things about you that can be said about a woman they have made you a queen a goddess with them you are as lovely as was diana and each of them wishes to bow his knees at your shrine

she laughed a rippling little laugh for his flattery had pleased her vanity

but tell me he continued goodhumoredly where are you taking me fair abductress i shall scream for help if you do not tell whither i am being carried

i am taking you home

then you are not going to boonsville not tonight

then where

to clairmont i shall spend the night there with the brocktons what are you doing away from pemberton today

i came to see my father off he has gone for an extended western trip

are you sure that was your only reason

why what do you mean he asked quietly oh i suppose ill have to sayânothing she returned evasively since your curiosity makes you search for answers

they were silent for a moment

how was the concert he asked breaking the stillness

then you know where ive beenl

yes

how

youre a personage

dont be enigmatical i dont understand you do you suppose miss croydon that the cholly knickerbockers whose living depends on their social columns in the popular dailies are going to let you the prettiest and most talked about outoftown girl in this vicinity come into town to a theatre party dance or dinner without giving all society a notification of your intention

then you knew by the papers

of course how else should i know

and youre still sure she said with a searching look in her eyes that to bid your father goodbye was your sole reason for coming to town today

the boys contend that i came for a different purpose he said with a merry look in his eyes they say that i am selfish because i do not divulge to them your whereabouts that they might call themselves even if not invited

oh adrian wont you have done with the boys she asked in a pleading tone it is of you i want to hear let us talk of ourselves  yes i have been to the concert at carnegie hall to hear vronski whom they call and rightly i am sure the greatest living violinist with his bow he can do wonders under its spell one sees the flowers growing and enjoys their perfume hears the babbling of a limpid stream coursing down a mountainside in springtime feels the biting wintry blast hears the thunderclaps the rain torrents the hail sees the snowflakes falling and feels the suns warmth he makes one understand grief sorrow gladness anger hate jealousy sympathy mercy and greatest of allâ love in fact addie if i could play as he does i should whisper my love with my bow knowing that it could convey my meaning far better than can my weak words i should whisper my love with my bow and then i should subdue your stubborn heart

adrian had not been prepared for such expressions from her and he regarded them as forward and immodest yet when he dared be truthful with himself he was greatly interested in her therefore he hesitated before he replied

if she had smiled perhaps it would have been different his discomfiture would not have been so great but her matter of fact manner made it impossible for him to treat lightly what she had said

to hear her speak of capturing his heart aroused in him a feeling of pleasing unpleasantness so when he tried to fence with her he stammered iâim afraid wanâmiss croydonâ

go on please say wanda as you started and wished to do she interrupted

you have misunderstood me i am not stubborn and my heart needs neither a master nor a companion its only love is its hope of success before me lies the business of life im trying to realize its seriousness while i am young so that i may go about it properly i am not sure that i am capable of such sentiments as those that you have spoken to me i am sure that no one will prove it to me any time soon my only wish now is to make my life successful for me everything else is too ephemeral to be considered

i must leave affairs of the heart to men who oh adrian she pleaded tightly pressing his strong gloved hand in her own tiny one the touch like an electric current sent through his being many mingled emotions how selfcentered you have allowed yourself to become do you suppose that god is going to permit you to be different from all the rest of the human type do you suppose that he is going to begin with you and create an emotionless race how can you so misunderstand yourself god is not experimenting he knows us all and making allowances for our individual idiosyncrasies he knows that we are all alikeâall directed by the same thingâlove warriors bold gowned monks cloaked friars bearded philosophers all suppressors of their natural feelingsâtheir age is dead do you want to be less human than you are    you say that you cannot love that is because you do not yet know how to be truthful to yourself you have thought of everything else except love and when it wanted your attention you beat it back

she drew closer to him and continued listen adrian im going to help you find your real self im going to make you love love me alone im going to come up to the front door of your heart ring its bell and you when you know yourself better than you do now arc going to open the door to me welcome me with gladness with all the joy with which one lover welcomes another you say you came to new york today to bid your father goodbye how many times he has gone before and you thought nothing of it you came to new york today to see me but you wont admit it

but wanda wanda he interrupted i cannotâ she could hear his heart crying for utterance through his eyes

i know you cannot now adrian she waved him aside with a motion of her hand i did not ask you to yet you are yet lost to yourself you stand in your own light you hunt for your soul but glaucusiike you have hidden it among the seaweeds of your future days among your hopes of making a mark in life

but he protested stoutly i tell you a young man about to start out on lifes business has no time for love it too quickly engulfs him in the marital sea and then what all the chances of a possible successful life arc hampered he can never have his freedom any more his wife cannot hold the high social position that he had dreamed of for her his child cannot be taken for its morning air in a limousine money is scarceâthe theatre parties fine gowns luxurious homes are now tumbled air castles he wants her to be like an elderly society leader whose husband has lived long enough to gather millions but it cannot be because of his masculine pride he docs not wish to see her below the other women of their early acquaintance then comes an awful moment to satisfy his pride he steals a little money and then a little more and still a little and then because he is unsuspected his recklessness makes him steal all the money he can get his hands on he is caught tried convicted look wand he caught himself again as he uttered her first name look at the number of wrecked livesâhis his wifes his childs their aged parents or worse yet suppose the hasty couple before they have lived together a fortnight agree to separate on the miserable plea of incompatibility of temperament or suppose each one having soon after their marriage found a soul mate decides to go his or her own way these are all mistakes of youthâblind impulsive impatient youth

but the pictures you have drawn are absurd pictures sensible people marry because they wish to climb together all mountains to sail together all streams to bridge together all chasms to feel together all joys sorrows griefs and disappointments no adrian you cannot mean what you say you must know better there is no incompatibility after marriage that did not exist before love is plain open kind it docs not deceive it does not lie hidden each soul knows its mate from its birth and each can find its own in a crowd of millions does a mother have to search all through a great gathering of children in order to know the joyful playful voice of her own never the soul of the mother calls to that of the child and the soul of the child responds to the callâso it is with love and marriage there is no business of life for a man alone he must make a business for himself and also for the woman of his choice this kind of business you are going to plan for me

just how long their limousine had been standing in front of the brocktons fine home in upper clairmont they did not know but a servant in livery interrupted their conversation by announcing that mrs brockton was waiting

wanda answered in a flurry and they got out

she bade him goodbye and he walked home five blocks away

oh you perfect dear said mrs brockton smilingly as running downstairs she caught wanda in her arms and kissed her on her checks

mrs brockton was a dear woman turning fifty with chestnut hair streaked with gray but her face was still almost that of a girl in temperament she was everything that one could call kind about her was an ineffable charm that impressed itself unforgettably on everyone that met her nor was she void of the astuteness and the wit that makes one a power in society she and wandas mother had been inseparable companions from their childhood until mrs croydons death which occurred when the girl was yet an infant mrs brockton had then taken care of wanda until she went to europe to be educated and now although the girl with a host of servants lived in the mansion that had been built by her father in boonsville she still acknowledged mrs brockton as a fostermother which was gratifying to the maternal instinct that was in that good womans bosom

they talked cheerfully while wanda chilled by the cold air warmed herself by the open fire and then she went up to dress for dinner

there were no guests to dinner that evening but the conversation was none the less spicy on that account as mr brockton a man a score of years older than his wife remembered very vividly antietam chancellorsville and shenandoah and in his stories he mingled pathos and comedy with such cleverness that wanda radiant in a black dinner gown felt she had lost some precious jewel if she missed one word from his lips

moreover the pioneer days in the west were still fresh in his mind he had been a globetrotter a great reader a critic and withal had had time to gather millions of dollars so that an hour in his presence was sure to be very instructive as well as most agreeable

why were you so late in coming mrs brockton got the opportunity to ask during one of her husbands narratives

wandas eyes could not conceal her gladness when she thought that it was addie to whom her lateness was due and while the older woman saw the clear eyes before her dancing like sprites she could not interpret their meaning for wanda replied evasively giving her ear to mr brockton

i wanted to ask a young broker to meet you this evening mrs brockton said but dearie appreciates you so much that he would not hear of it wasnt it selfish of him

no wanda replied with a winning little pout on her lips i think daddys fine id rather listen to him than to any other man i knowâ exceptâanyway someone came with me to your door and she looked at mrs brockton

who asked the fostermother with maternal inquisitiveness

call j clairmont when you have finished dinner miss croydon interrupted one of the maids

thats stanton birchs said mrs brockton in surprise dropping her fork on the gold and white china and hes now in the west

it wasnt he it was

adrian

yes

well precious little girl why didnt you bring him in whats he doing away from pemberton today here i idiot that i am have been trying for three months to arrange a meeting between you and him and youve outwitted me youve played my own card from my own hand while i looked at it drowsily wondering waiting for the best chance to put it down

as soon as dinner was over mrs brockton rose from the table and rang up the number that the girl had given wanda

meanwhile adrian his dinner over was sitting with his mother in the library holding her nervous hand in his own strong one and caressing her filially when a maid called him to the telephone

hello having taken up the receiver

adrian im not going to like it a bit came a familiar voice from the other end because you didnt come in

i couldnt be an intruder he apologized but im sor

no apology she cut him off curtly you were right at my door and never came in to say hello  now i want you here in fifteen minutes she said commandingly ill send the car right down for you

but mothers not well he pleaded and i shouldnt like to leave her alone tonight

then well come down there she answered knowing how deep was the boys devotion for his mother

you may go adrian put in zelda who had heard his part of the conversation i shall be quite well alone

you eel said mrs brockton who heard what the boys mother said you are trying to slip out of my way but your mother will not permit such neglect

turning to his mother he asked are you sure mother that i may go out for an hour without your missing me

i miss you if you are out a minute adrian but go for a little while i shant be lonesome

dear mother he said with a voice full of mingled emotions

im waiting came over the telephone

ill be up shortly he returned and mrs brockton went back to her seat with a triumphant look on her face

down on your knees ingrate and do penance to me for your blunder mrs brockton said as he came in the door

i will priestess offer up to thee a bull and an ewe if thou wilt but attire thyself in a sacerdotal robe and lead me near a fire to warm my icy hands

and now you mock me after having so openly ignored me

heaven forbid blessed mother i ask thy forgiveness in all mercy humility meekness and he with a smile on his lips began to stoop as if he were going on his knees

get up called wanda from the dimlighted parlor as he kneeled ill have you going on your knees to no other person but myself

ah said adrian some unseen hand saves the lamb just as it is about to be offered a thousand thanks dear rescuer he went on smilingly my tailors bill is already far beyond my power to settle it and another dollar would have been added to it if the knees of my new evening trousers had been mussed on this persian lambs wool

he gave his fur coat his hat and his cane to the man at the door and mrs brockton leaning on his arm led him into the parlor

how like a priestess every man makes every woman ventured mr brockton to adrian after he had shaken his hand warmly and the young man had greeted miss croydon to her he sacrifices everythingâriches health time business success soul love

stop there interrupted wanda adrian âshe took the liberty to call him by his first name even in their presenceâis not a sentimentalist

but he has an eye for a pretty girl and a heart to give her

id like you to make him believe it she said

adrian changed the subject by speaking of vronskis concert

he then asked wanda to give them some music and she played one of the latest tangoes after she had executed something more classical and adrian could not resist gliding around the room a little with mrs brockton who was a good dancer

later however wanda coaxed adrian to play and the older people caught her with her deep expressive eyes looking down affectionately upon the young man as his fingers ran over the keys

the brocktons retired to the library to play cards

adrian arose from the piano and wanda seating herself sang my souls own heart of my heart wilt thou in me believe

light of my life if thou depart from earth my soul shall leave

there was a crackling and sizzling of the dying embers in the oldfashioned fireplace the light from which cast a soft dim crimson over the room the electric lights had not been turned on in the front parlor where they sat

i am singing to you she said as she ended the song

it is useless he said sadly raising one of his hands and placing it on the top of the piano as he looked into her face i hear but i cannot respond if there be any lyrelike chord in me which your words strike it is out of tune it is like the mother saying caressing words to her babe which answers only with feeble emotions and incoherent sounds

but a child will speak after a while wont it she asked

im afraid this child will never learn oh wanda dont you sec how futile must be your attempt cant you sec how barren is the soil in which you are sowing the greatest thing in the worldâlove

adrian how long will it take you to learn that hearts were not made for time but time for hearts to learn that all the other great things in the world are the servants of a great thing âloveâworshipping and adoring it and doing everything to show appreciation of it no adrian i am a child i do not know all the great ways in which one person makes another love the more my arms have not the witchery of an enchantress my eyes have not the lovelight that glows and fascinates my tongue does not know honeyed words except to mumble them badly but i know all that a woman needs to say to a man when she loves him and that is i love you do not turn away from me addie she pressed her hand on his shoulder while he sat sidewise to her on the revolving stool i love you she reiterated they are not new words adrian they were as old as the earth when they were born they were as old to eves ear when adam told them to her as they are to yours now but adrian they are the only words in the world that are at once young and old and sweet

she looked down upon him and her eyes of dark gray seemed in their lustre to float upon the gory rays of light emitted by the fireplace

they seemed magnetos adrian knew that they were focussed upon him and try as he might to turn from her he was helpless

oh the sting of eyes like wandas  that of an insect an animal a reptile they are all cured but the sting of such eyes striking the innermost recesses of a mans heart brings both joy and pain to his soul for it there is but one cureâit takes the sweetness of love or the bitterness of death to restore life to the person stung

wanda did not know the power of her eyes she was not sure that she had interpreted his feeling aright when his cheeks lit up and he nervously twitched and beat his palms together

he knew that he must get away from her if he was to carry out his youthful resolve he knew just how much beyond the bounds of everything he would go for this adorable girl for having called whom forward a few hours ago his remorseful conscience now thrashed him his intelligence now reproved him for having called her bold because he saw that she was only a natural girl with a girls innocent love he knew that greater strength than that with which he had led a pemberton team to victory was needed if he was to put her from him his determination to win success in lifeâeverything crumbled before this beautiful girl

there was a deep silence

the fire in the fireplace would have seemed as ice if it had been compared with the passionate heat of their hearts

i must be going i shall leave early in the morning for pemberton he said breaking the silence

will you spend an evening with me in boonsville during the holidays i shant be away for that season

i thank you im afraid though of mothers condition she is not at all well now and i shall spend most of my time with her

im sorry she said quietly

he got his hat and coat and was about to open the door

may i write you a letter she asked

you did once he replied with a faint smile on his faceâa face that was flushed with youth

with very little encouragement to write again wasnt it

he opened the door and made a step forward may i write you a letter she repeated

wanda do you not see how hard i am trying notânot to love you and he was gone

do you think so adrian

i cant say you see i know so little of art but you have an opinion

yes in fact i think gericault made wonderfully better horses in oil than our own american remington did in water color

indeed what of bonheur is she overrated

perhaps not but troyons animals are far more animallike in their movements than hers she seemed to forget that animals are beasts you dont like my salad wanda put in miss crews the housekeeper

oh yes i do she answered gaily its great isnt it adrian

splendid he replied

we grew this romaine in our own hothouse and i superintended the planting added miss crews

really you are a wonderful housekeeper miss crews he said

do you think i look matronly at the head of a table adrian asked wanda

you arc scarcely old enough to look matronly yet but why do you ask me he returned

alex some more butter for mr birch please she said changing the subject

have you heard about caribelle and guy hessden asked adrian

no what about them 

suing for divorce

you dont mean it i am so sorry

did i not tell you of it in one of my letters no you told me only of your own dear self and that was all i wanted to hear but their faces told the world that they were happy why this sudden break asked wanda

my dear girl many peoples faces tell the world that same story its a case of laugh and the world laughs with you

how easy it is for people to dissemble but i cannot understand their case what is the trouble inquired wanda

oh the old storyâa bad man and a good woman but of course theyll never ask for separation on such grounds

im sorry they are not happy she said and her perfect head set straight up on her wellshaped neck

she looked out of her eyes as a child does when he has gotten hold of a new idea that puzzles him

adrian she asked suddenly wouldnt it be wonderful if all the good people could be put together and all the bad ones put together suggest that idea to some novelist

look your glass is empty she replied

this wine is great it is as good as some that my father hasâsome he bought when he was in paris on his honeymoon

what do you think of the french she asked do you think that they are as immoral and insincere and parsimonious as we americans think they are

certainly not they have their own way of doing things and in many ways they are the best people in the world of course some of their customs seem strange and bad to us because ours are so different

i wonder if any race is naturally any worse than all the others

i doubt it he answered

they arose and adrian went into the music room

shall it be the piano of the victrola she asked

the victrola please

of course i might have known you wanted to talk to me while it is playing

interpret my thoughts as you like youre always right and i shant protest

they were silent for a moment while the music was playingâplaying softly sweetly plaintively

life is so tiresome in this house she then said half seriously

why asked adrian you have good servants a splendid housekeeperâeverything that you could wish

thats it i do nothing for myself i dont even lace my own shoes or do my hair why even my breath seems to be drawn for me by some one else i am as helpless as if i were an invalid every moment of my time is filled withânothing i get up in the morning have breakfast then there is a ride a morning call or shopping after noon i have luncheon take a nap go to a concert or a dance or read a novel after dinner i go to the opera or a dance then to bed again it all seems so purposeless meaningless empty

but objected adrian you rebel against the spirit of the age dont you know that every other girl would want to pass just that sort of an existence

no adrian you are wrong the time has passed when women liked to live empty lives why then if it is so empty dont you get something with which to fill it

there is but one thing that can

get that one thing

im trying but it is hard adrian i know what you must think of me i know what people would think of me because of my actions toward you they would call me a bold forward girl im not i differ from all the others only in that i express fearlessly and unconventionally what every girl feels and would say to the person who has awakened her love if she were not afraid let their glib tongues rattle let them talk i get more pleasure in saying that i love you than garrulous people can ever get in calling me bold

why do men set aflame the soul of a woman they have not the power to put out the fire yet they chide her because she herself cannot put it out i speak as i do because i love you you would say as much to me were you honest with yourself

wanda wont you understand that i want to make a start first i want to see that before me lies a possibility of getting on

oh yes i know you want to be great and i want you to be great adrian but i want to help make you so i want to go down into the quarry of life and help you dig the rough stones i want to hand you the water to cool your parching tongue while you dig them out i want to help you build the great stone steps that lead to greatness i want to climb them with you and when theyre finished i want to sit on the top step with you not because of the little ive done but because you are there and i should be with you

why dont you tell me how you feel and have done with it you smoke your pipe in your every revery in every little ring of smoke that you blow heavenward i am in the center you build your air castles and in each castle it is i you see darting through its halls and rooms

he looked at her her girlish beauty was exquisite her candor admirable she was the most adorable thing he had ever seen he struggled with the swelling emotions in himâemotions that would have leaped out had his will been less strong

he said i cannot do as you wish wanda i must sever sentiment wholly from my actions for a long while yet to say that i love you would mean that i should like to marry you now marriage for me could not mean anything without children and some one has truly said that he that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediments to great enterprises you see wanda i am on my way now to success i can do big things better alone i wont let you enter this race im going to use all my strength to keep away from love for a while but i do love

oh go on adrian go on her face lit up and she clapped her hands buoyantly youve said almost all i wanted you to say you have almost made a confession you almost see your own soul it is better to tell your feelings to a statue or a picture than to let them stay in you and smother you could not stop death were it at hand you know that death and love are alike âunchangeable they will not be deniedânor can they be hidden tell me the truth why shouldnt you do you think it shames me to talk to you as i do it does not to say i love you is the truest thing ive ever said it is the only thing that sounds absolutely true to my own ears

im going to battle hard adrian and im going to win not so much on my own account but because you want me to because you want me to go into your soul and let you look into it through me because you need me as a mirror reflecting your own dear good self to you you may discourage me but you cannot stop me

adrian could stand no more to attempt to repel the dynamic force of emotion then seeking recognition in his heart would have been impossible to deceive himself further or to whip his feelings into servitude when they were demanding their freedom was a thing he could no longer do

in a moment of ecstasy he unconsciously sprang to his feet caught her in his arms and kissed her warm lips fervently

wanda  wanda he said you do me injustice you wrong me you wound me terribly girl when you say that i discourage you oh wont you forgive me dearest i did not mean to do so i thought all of myself in me was all i i i forgetting the greatest of all truths that no life on earth is a single life that somewhere in the world is the counterpart of every heart i knew you were mine i knew it unmistakably as soon as i first saw you but i could see no one else in myself but myself no one entering but the thoughts the hopes of my future life i fought to keep my thoughts so filled dearest hut you had a greater weaponâlove and you battled with me in my own territory and won won and oh how glad i am how glad    you say i think you bold forward how could you think that wanda to me you are the purest thing in all the world had angels been copied after you heaven would have been no less perfect wanda wont you forgive me

she looked up at him her cheeks flushing her eyes glistening like stars in the youth of the night and around her lips played a smile that would have wooed all the world to happiness

oh adrian she said ecstatically how good and strong you are surely this is heaven such happiness is not known on earth hold me tight tighter in your big strong arms press me closer to your strong warm heart can we not go through life loving each other like this adrian that is what we shall do dearest he answered

but it will be so long before we start she said sadly

do you remember what i said to you at the howell dance about engagements

how could i forget i remember every word youve ever spoken to me since we met

what then little girl did i say

you said she turned her head thoughtfully for a momentâoh you said that if you ever kissed me we would be engaged and

i have kissed you tonight

and you said that you did not believe in long engagementsâthat we must be married very soon after our engagement what a dear boy you are  now come sit down by me and we shall set a date for our she hummed mendelssohns wedding march her hand tightly held in his while they sat and looked into each others eyes

now when shall it be i wont be put off long you know

no dearest im not going to keep you off long do you not know that im madder more passionately in love with you than you are with me

nonsense adrian impossible when shall it be

in june dearest when they hand me my diploma

think she said with childish glee think l you will have two commencements at once

yes but you will be the biggest diploma i shall ever get

june june wasnt heaven kind to give us such a month with its beautiful warm kind days it is all so wonderful you know adrian i have pictured our little home in the countryâi could never stand the cityâwith honeysuckles entwining its front its yard filled with roses the fragrance of which we shall get on the soft winds of the morning and evening and in the back a little garden dearest all our own from which i shall with my own hands pull vegetables for you i dont want luxury i was born with that curse i want to live simply to laugh to hear my own voice to be like people who are happy i want a house where there are not servants to talk over our loving each other and to call us mad because i am mad about you a house where i myself can make your coffee and muffins for you in the morning and broil the steak for your dinner how lovely how blissful it will all be adrian and she leaned over against him and pressed her glowing cheeks to his

that will be heaven dearest you have built up a wonderful home for us but did you not leave out the one important thing

what she asked somewhat puzzled think

i cannot what

the nursery dearest

oh no i could never have forgotten that it shall be the first room in the draught for the house and then when some sweet little voice comes to fill up the room how proud i shall be we shall stand together in the door adrian and watch her tear up her little dolls and see her as she tries to read the mother goose stories she will run in and tell me mother dadas coming oh wont it be heavenly how will it sound to hear me say to her no dearest you must not do that dada wouldnt like it 

its going to sound perfectly natural and sweet coming from your lips wanda he said

but adrian we have not seen her yet what will she be like i will tell you she shall have your kind eyes and your dark hair but my lips dont you think oh vain woman that i am i dont care we arc all vain when we get the man we love yes my lips and nose and checks and as she grows i shall teach her oh the nicest things but when she grows up she is not going to be one of those women that kill in them what should be most alive i hate hedda gablers she will be one of those warm loving sensible selfsubjecting judiths such as kellerâisnt it adrianâportrays in green henry and she must

miss wanda called a voice from the hall its your bed time

thank you miss crews wanda replied you see she continued im twenty and still a child i must have some one to put me to bed from this time forth i shall obey no one but adrian birch

will it not be better for you to obey miss crews sometimes she has known you from your birth and knows whats best for you

yes but i have some discretion and do you forget that i am to be mrs adrian birch soon how can i forget it are you happy dearest

beyond words your vacation began today how long have you

twelve days

how lovely 

yes i shall come up every day if i can but you see my mother is

stop there adrian our mother if you please how i shall love to call some one mother i never knew my own

but she is far from well adrian continued and i shall be a great deal with her

why maynt i come down sometimes too wanda asked

you may and you shall but youd better go to bed now before youre called again

do you command me to go or is it a request i shall be your lover not your sovereign he replied

at any rate i obey  i hope you will sleep well said wanda as they parted on the stairs

im sure i shall i am so happy he replied

the morning after her dreadful experience zelda arose at seven not one minutes peaceful sleep had she had during the night that uncanny diabolical picture had tormented her relentlessly

she wondered if it would not have been better if leon and his gang had been successful in taking her awayâshe knew not where the world then would never have known the truthâwould never have known that her whole life had been a lie no future torture could possibly be as great as the pain she now endured

death to her was nothing it is to no one the fire in her mind was infinitely hotter than that of the inferno she did not even think of trying to escape

her only thought was was it best that i was rescued from those potential murderers

had she been killed all her acquaintances would have proclaimed her a brave courageous charitable woman but now if they knew if they only knew what she really wasâwhat a confusion of tongues there would be heaping upon her the vilest epithets in the english language

the lookingglass did not lie to herâmirrors are not flatterers it showed her herself as she really was

there were her bloodshot tired eyes her swollen and drooping lids her colorless cheeks her drawn lips try as she might she could not escape the close scrutiny of anne who would have commented on her mistress looks had not zelda avoided her

she had no appetite for breakfast as soon as it was over she went about her usual duty watering her flowers in the conservatory but she did not have sufficient strength to finish it

from the parlor window she gazed out what beautiful what ugly what courageous what cowardly thoughts ran through her mind

today was december the twentysecondâthe anniversary of her marriage twentythree years ago she had stood in the fifth avenue house in stantons arms that moment was the moment of her whole life

stanton would soon be coming now and adrian dear adrian too she would see him every day for the twelve days of his holiday did these thoughts bring happiness scarcely stanton was far away in the west suppose he didnt come that could never be he had never been away on one of their anniversaries he would be home soon and good loving tender stanton would bring as he always did some token of his devotion no they never had anniversary receptions but they never forgot that day yes he would be sure to come she wondered if he thought that she had forgotten the day but that was too impossible even to be considered of course he knew that she could never forget that day

but she knew that leon had escaped from her rescuersâthat he was in the kitchen her coffee had told her that no one made coffee like leon not even andre

good morning said leon blandly

had you really the boldness to come into my house again after yesterday she asked

flow can a man change his last day oaks dont break they dont even bend after they arc full grown

leave me or ill call the servants she said astonished at her own calmness

they will not hear theyre far upstairs why zelda they could not injure me im in love and love is greater than death i once saw a duel between love and death they each had weapons of equal quality and size the battle was hot but love conquered so with me i cannot stop now i love you

he ran to her and seized her she struggled to free herself but without success

come on come on kiss me he said there is sweetness in the cruelty of your words warmth in the iciness of your eyes a power in your unresponsive lips i would rather die because of your cruelty than live resting my head on the pillow of a queen you cannot stop me

he did not hear the opening of the door his passion had crazed him

zelda zelda   called stantons familiar voice while he and adrian took off their coats in the hall

rut no response was heard

stanton turned to his right and he would not could not believe his eyes an oldfashioned mirror showed him leon with his arms around zelda who was struggling to get away

enraged he rushed at leon he seized him by the throat and tore him away from zelda and would have struck him with his cane if she had not shrieked dont strike leon wrung himself away and the lick went wild

that womans a nigger i he yelled pointing to zelda

for those words stanton would have killed him if he had not been for the moment robbed of his strength he tried to raise his arm but it was limp

zelda had fallen on the floor

leons words were plaving games in stantons brain

say that again and die he said feebly and leon repeated with energy that womans a niggerl

tell him he lies zeldaâmy own dear zelda its calumny hes defaming you dear he said still weak from the shock tell him he lies i know youre not but i want to hear it from your own sweet lips zelda    zelda this maddens me dear tell him he lies he pleaded

she caught his words but scarcely understood their meaning

tell him he lies urged stanton

i cannot she whispered it is true

like lightning his strength came back

you hellcat  he shouted fire leaping from his eyes his body swelling let me tear you in shreds

lionlike he sprang toward her

as he touched her adrian checked him

stop youre wild do you intend murder father he said coldly im surprised im ashamed of you

ashamed  surprised yelled stanton she is a deceiver an adventuress let me strangle her to death that woman is a negro and he sprang toward her again

that woman is my mother said adrian warmly and you shall not hurt her see what this fellow says    now you turning to leon what is this

leon was very pale he even looked penitent

it is true he said slowly but she is blameless i am the guilty one let me bear the burden kill me i am not the leon you call me i am clarence williamson the williamson that was the machine in the state of for years i am the williamson that had fought from the bottom and succeeded the williamson that people were proud of and respected i am he who tried to act honorably toward every one but circum stances turned against me

you act honorably thundered stanton you damned common hound

yes went on leon im a common hound now but once i was a thoroughbred i had blue blood i made the world know me i was a success and then some snake in the grass told them that i was a nigger then of course that ended all power went friends went the world turned against me but still i struggled on until i found that zelda was your wife then i changed everything changed me i cared for nothing but a chance to get even the world kicked me and called me dog i barked back at it but my strength was gone and it no longer feared my bites then i set out to find zelda at all costs and tear her away from you i went back to my old tradeâcooking âwhich had been my support while i struggled through college i found her but she would not leave you she is as innocent as a spring flower

i say no more he drank something from a small bottle the pain of a thousand years suffering cuts loose my heart strings

lie dropped and when adrian looked at him he was dead

mother mother begged adrian is this true tell me mother am i a

you shedevil shouted stanton viciously

cleopatra was a goddess beside you i could uproot your very

tell me mother is it true  persisted adrian as someone groping in the dark

she struggled to her feet and collected herself as well as she could supported by adrian

yes she said almost inaudibly i will tell you all i will open the unread page in my life it is blackânot with sin but because of misfortune

i was born in virginia the illegitimateâyes illegitimate does that word shock youâchild of john marston as his last will upstairs will tell you

my mother a beautiful mulatto had been a house girl of his in the days of slavery when liberation came he retained and supported her until my birth after that she refused his aid and gave her life for me

leon and i were children together went to school together i never knew fully that i was a until my mother was dying

i wanted to get on in the world but the fact that i was a  put the world against me

but i had the white mans brain and beauty and i wanted a chance to liveâan equal chance

why let my ability atrophy because i was black 

there is more moral in telling one lie in order to live decently to live as god would have us live than there is in all the worlds truth if that truth leaves one a vagabond a beggar surrounded by squalor stanton i longed to be somebody

so i went to school and to work i wanted to get on i worked at the hospital and proved my ability

then you came stantonâthough you despise me let me call you stanton still i shall call you that through all eternityâyou came and with you a new world with everything in it new

i loved you when i heard your groans i slept not a wink for three days while you were at the hospital i knew that if i would live myself i must bring you back to life you got better you took me to your home you got well when i would have left you would not let me i could have gone then and lived out my own sad life but you asked me to marry you i told you my life was black but you would not hear it you said you loved me better than the world i believed that here was my opportunity do people cut their own throats when chances of success come to do so would not be human why should you expect it of me we were married even then i might have gone but our boy adrian cameâa tie to bind us the more closely together how could i leave a heaven like this you became sick again and i made you live because i knew you trusted you and loved you better than you will ever know

our boy grew we loved him i thought the only person who knew my past was dead or if not i hoped i should die without ever seeing him again but some uncontrollable hand was against me i saw myself doomed i could not help myself why should i leave all that i love all that i have in this world

when we sat at the table three months ago i asked you what you thought of miscegenation i shall not repeat your answer you remember i do not hold you to that answer my end must come tis at hand i ask no mercy i do not ask you to let me love you you cannot stop that even though you make atoms of my body do as you like i ask no mercy

she dropped her head and fell limp in adrians arms he put her in an oldfashioned chair

you see father said adrian almost heartbroken

she lies  shouted stanton angrily uncompromising man your heart is going to make you rue those words you feel you have been duped it is true but wait

she lies he repeated she does not know how to love she is a traitress

father how can you say such things after all she has gone through for you after she has spent sleepless nights been your slave given you me made you the most comfortable and happy man alive youre not yourself now or else you could not say such things if what she has gone through and done for you do not prove love what then is love you feel that you have been tricked but it isnt that that hurts you you now hate a color not a soul

i tell you dear father the only thing in all the world worth while is love it is the only smile from gods own lips that imprints itself ineradicably on mans heart and returns again to god it is the only human thing that is unchangeable unchanging and unchanged and yetâand yetâ his voice broke he dropped his eyes to the floor then raised his head and began again see father she loves you take her and forget in her love for you she is no different now from what she was before you knew

take her you say do you suppose im going to be made the laughingstock of society she is not my kindâshes different said stanton

yes she is different because society says so not because her soul is different i tell you that every life that is ushered into this world comes from one pure undefiled source of love and purity we are not conceived in iniquity anger envy hate jealousy are the qualities that men give to themselves the soul itself comes into the world with one predominating attitudeâlove for man and love for god

see father those two little children in the driveway look how they play the black one is the son of the cook the white one the son of a man of millions in their voices in their actions toward each other there is no discord children see deeper into the love of human beings than men do they do not mistake appearances for realities shadows cannot deceive them see how they play

all the bliss of heaven is in their little hearts now let them go on this way let society not meddle with them and they will live endlessly in that same happiness in which you now see them

i say that hate between man and man is not natural but children are taught nigger nigger never die black face and shiny eye in their nurseries they are taught eeni meeniminy mo catch a nigger by his toe in their games at school such epithets as alligator bait shine snowball chocolatedrop coffee nigger heaven they learn when they are young men this is the hate that is put into them it is not inborn you cannot build up a world of love with color as its basis love is not that sort of thing

ahl protested stanton with a wave of his hand i was tricked into this do you think i could mix my pure blood with common stock were all here in one land began adrian some of pure some of hybrid stock one would not get rid of the other if he could i tell you fearlessly that it is as impossible to keep us apart as it is to keep a white rooster no matter how pure from being the father of a black hens chicken if they be in the same lot attraction does not always work along a line of sameness love brings hearts together and love knows no law and are people happier are they morally better when kept apart by such legislation no one knows father take her again and forget you said you would always act in the light of law love and god

prove it if you be true to yourself for you love her better than your life and when your fury ceases you will acknowledge that you do

do you propose to drive me into further making a fool of myself into further disgust and abasement by such maudlin sentimentality im stanton birch it cannot be i am done

adrian adrian cried zelda is stanton leaving me    this is judgment isnt it adrian there is no more life is there is not everything at an end stantons leaving me is not everything at an end

the last will and testament of col john marston to whom it may concern

be it hereby known that i john marston of james city county virginia direct descendant of a founder and promoter of the london company grandson of one of the signers of the declaration of independence do bequeath my entire savings deposited in the bank at williamsburg virginia and my farm of four hundred and fifty  acres in james city county to zelda the daughter of cathering edwards and myself

i loved her mother more than she could ever know but between us there was a gap which prevented my marrying her

in her life time i would have helped her but her pride scorned it i would have given anything to my child zelda though born out of wedlock but she too refused my aid which hurt me beyond words

she is married and happy now may she ever be 

she cannot refuse my last request if she does i shall never know it

zelda is my own bloodâall that is left of me

i hope she will ever be happy and remember me as one who loved her

this will had been signed by colonel marston and was undoubtedly valid

you see father said adrian after the bequest to zelda was read she has good blood in her veins

but stanton was inflexible

no pleadings will move me he responded its all over i shall leave

yes but how what will people say to this abrupt separation when they know that you and mother have been so happy for years what will she do

i shall leave her well cared for no one shall ever know

but protested adrian insulted she does not want your money

you must go with me adrian you are the only care in my life now you belong to me

and what of the part of me that belongs to mother

youre my son shouted stanton irritably

and shes your wife responded adrian with equal force

then you refuse to go with me

yes unless we all go you are moved by unjust hate you think the thoughts of fifty years ago mine are of today newer thoughts he said passionately my blood is redder blood redder bloodâthe corpuscles of which are not hate envy prejudice but respect and kind feeling for others how can you be such a fool adrian

im going to stay here with my mother father im going into the world and work to bring back to her some of the peace and happiness that should be hers

a hungry ragged loafer sat upon a bench in a park his thick and matted hair his unshaven face the rags that hung about him made him a loathsome sight not even a fellow loafer would sit by him but he had not been like this always he despised all life everything to him was contemptible he had made for himself a world and everything in it was wretched base abject he wished himself dead

of a sudden on a nearby track rushed madly a train he caught faint glimpses of the faces in it to him they all seemed to be laughing and happy the train disappeared and he said why cant i be as happy as they all are and bound for some definite station  i am no good why doesnt the end come

he continued to sit in the park still despising still cursing life

an hour later he roused himself picked up a newspaperâan extraâthat had been dropped by some passerby and read the headlines train derailed all killed

it was the train that he had seen at once he exclaimed how glad i am that i was not on it

inconsistent man you rejoice over that very thingâlifeâwhich an hour before you called useless the thing that you wished to rid yourself of

fool  they were not all happy on that train some of them were as glad to get out of their misery as you would be many of them fearing other methods of ending life might have even then been praying that such a thing might happen

but trains trains what is each life but a train running slowly or rapidly upon rails of chance some running on time others always late some reaching their stations other never getting there how can one tell when his engineer has the complete mastery of his machinery how often are we derailed and wrecked by such robbers as disappointment and sorrow by such brigands as calamity and misfortune even when our definite stations seem in view 

adrian felt himself as complete a wreck as did that loafer his plans were scattered his hopes deadened everything worth while was goneâ irrevocably lostâas he thought

for him this had always been the greatest seasonâchristmasâwhen everybody was happy when his mother and father usually seemed even happier than ever but now what a change

whatever he did now some one must be wounded gracious what a distracting thought

his mother he knew he loved with an immeasurable devotion to him she was the dearest mother that heaven had ever sent how she had watched him when young what care she had taken of him what interest she had shown in all his affairs  how she had inspired him

his father too he reverenced his allegiance to him was unbreakable had he not been to him everything that a father could be

and then wanda a few hours before he had held her in his arms and they had both been transcended into beatific joy the night before the passion for her which he had been so long suppresing had burst out like a volcano and they had planned to go through life together in perfect harmony

how different now

heavens how much trouble life can bring all of a sudden to a human being

through his mind ran millions of distracting and maddening thoughts each one as indistinct as enigmatical yet as full of foreboding as the worlds most profound mystery

he saw nothing as a wholeâeach thought began then chopped itself off in the middle as coherent as the tail of a horse joined to the head of a rhinoceros but through it all there ever appeared one face the sweetest of all how long must he endure such torture 

poor wanda

she must know the truth all was over between them to say that it was over was the same to him as saying this is my heart ill crush it and go through life dead before my end comes

but she must know and he must tell her but how

to tell her that he was a could he ever say such a word to her and watch all that had before been dear to him become transformed into deadly disgust

ingrate ingrate that i am he thought wanda would never think such things she is too pure too loving she can never change

stop she can change she may not all life changes all human beings change you thought right at first do not make the thousands of years of experience of human beings a lie because of this one girl

along the street he walked aimlessly knowing not whither he was going and he would not have cared if he had known

nothing would have made any impression on him now he neither heard nor felt nor saw anything about him

he continued to wander aimlessly

two hours later he found himself almost stupefied ringing wandas doorbell

a servant showed him into the parlor and announced his presence to wanda

she did not stop to wonder why he had returned so soon after having left her only a few hours before she was too glad for that

into the room she rushed buoyant radiant smiling dressed with the exception of her cloak for an afternoon call

throwing her arms about him and kissing him she said gleefully how glad i am that you have returned so soon dearest i shall not make my call and we may remain at home together unless you will go with me

no no wanda you must make your call i shall be going shortly said adrian

nonsense you shall be here for the rest of the afternoon

no please wanda i just came to say one thing and then i must go perhaps forever

alarmed she turned and looked at him what could he mean by those words go forever

she noticed how troubled he was she could see that there was something hurting him beyond words something that he must tell her she was frightened

why dearie what do you mean she inquired tremulously

wanda he said his head down and plainly in agony its all over between us

the blood rushed to her face the blow had struck her like some powerful engine how beautiful her flushing skin appeared to him now as she stood so that he looked her full in the face as she raised his head her cheeks showed all her girlish youth and charm

stammering she said dont jest adrian i cannot stand it even from you about so heavenly so sacred a thing surely you dont know what youre saying

i wish it were a jest he said perhaps then i too could smile at it

was he serious thought wanda why should he choose such a subject to play with their bond had been fastened so short a while before why should he come back to say such things 

every moment was increasing her fear harder and harder she tried to control herself

through adrians mind ran all the great things that he would have done twenty years hence how happy he would have made her how blissful their lives would have been now all is wrecked he sees as he thinks the end of the love of this adorable girl if the end be now he will at least tell her that he loves her better than life and then he will go out of her life forever perhaps

she came to him and wrapped herself in his arms smiling half fearfully come adrian the jokes at an end now youve enjoyed it enough

he looked into her face what a perfect contour what lips what eyes what hair  her beauty and his love for her maddened him he pressed her to him and said passionately o wanda wanda the things ive planned the big things ive planned for you for us both are at an end but dearest at the thought of losing you i have but one overwhelming desireâto have god take my soul to him the thought of losing you makes me wish by my own hand to send my soul to heaven to find out if there is there greater bliss greater happiness in loving and being loved or to hell to find out if there is there greater sorrow greater misery in loving and not being loved i cannot let you go wanda for

his words had reassured her to know that he loved her was all she cared for

but adrian she cut him off you are not going to lose me you could not if you wished to for i would not let you why do you think such things

oh i know that i am wanda i know that youre going away from me

he pressed her close to him and suddenly he remembered the scene that had so recently taken place in his own home remembered that he was different from her he would apologize for thus jetting his passions rule him tell her what he was and go

he dropped his arms from her and said im sorry

sorry for what asked wanda sorry because you have held me and made me happy because you have kissed me is it not your right am i not yours why then are you sorry for what are you sorry she asked greatly puzzled

because i kissed you wanda there is a difference between us i have come to tell you that you are done with me

what can you mean any way adrian she asked with despairing emphasis you have spoken in riddles ever since you came what does it mean

it means that we are dead to each other

his face became white he moved nervously over him ran hot and cold waves no one could have seemed or been more miserable to give up such a prize would have caused the world to weep

wanda wan  he choked

she caught him again and held him tight and kissed him yes addie say it what is it what is it

wandaâi am a negro he stammered

his confession had in it unerring conviction to have him repeat it would have been useless

she thrust him from her as one would drop a burning metal

there was fire in her every breath she was furious she had been fooled she had laid bare her heart her soul to this thing

you leper she burst out you cancer in a mans form you imp let loose from limbo  you deceived me acidlike you ate into my pure soul knowing all the time what you were knowing that you were as black as midnight let me wipe away your kisses let me tear my flesh from my frame

i was pure your black skin has corrupted me polluted me get out of my sight forever she fell exhausted on a chair

adrian made no protests he wished to explain nothing he had been honest with himself and with her no remorse could now come to him for his actions compunctions of conscience would not whip him for what he did not do his only regrets would be his heartaches because of his love for her

he went into the hall took down his coat and started to open the door

but wandas burst of hatred had passed she saw him going outâsaw herself losing him forever

she knew if he went away from her her life went too she knew that she loved him whatever he was

she rushed to him as he opened the door and pulled him back

adrian adrian she said as she caught him forgive me dearest it was not i speaking to you calling you those bad names not your wanda whom you love and who loves you more than life it was the voice of hate that has come down to me through a thousand years forgive me dearest wont you wont you adrian i know you will    whatever you are you are mine have always been shall ever be when out of the void god hurled the earth he started your soul and mine together knowing that somewhere on this globe we should meet to be forever with each other in order that we might be one paradise was corrupted wars have been fought the high seas crossed new lands found and settled i say youre mine adrianâmine mine if you do not believe it look on gods eternal book and there you will see written in indelible ink the names adrian birch and wanda croydon

she hung like a vine to him

he freed himself from her and said cooly it cannot be wanda we are not for each other even your church and your laws are against it

the church the law she retorted hotly i dont want a church i dont want a law that would rob me of my life

a protestant cannot marry a catholic said wanda the church forbids a jewess cannot marry a gentile religion forbids a negro cannot marry a white person law and prejudice forbid here in fastidious america if a millionaire marries his typist his friends stand aghast and howl thou fool  in more cultured europe a duke marrying a peasant loses his dukedom how silly is it all

the very thing over which the church should rejoice adrian the only godcreated thing which has not been defiled polluted desecratedâlove âthey cast out as one would poison oh god i how beautiful and wonderful is the world you made i is it to be robbed of its goodness by weak human beings

i say it can never be wanda you would not be happy you could not mingle with your kind society would make you an outcast would ostracize you you would be like

because i love you because god made my life that it might be yours because society says that youre a i must climb around the edges of the world thrust from its center away from its business out of its critical eyes alone and an outcast all right adrian let it be so the farther we are away from them the more i shall have you to myself

we can never know each other perfectly wanda could never get into each others souls thousands of years of training have made us different in me there is something negroid that you could never understand in you there is something caucasian that i could never fully understand and know we could never get into each others souls 

look here adrian she said taking up a beautiful piece of coral from the bahaman waters see the coral is it not beautiful look at its varied colors how clear it is what harmony in it all it is composed of millions and millions of cells and adrian none of them can get into the other but what a beautiful whole they make no little atom no little seed no great tree no animal no man can ever quite understand another when god spins each out from himself he gives each a selfhood into which no other self can ever get perfectly into which he cannot even get himself and be himself but what a wonderful piece of work is it all  how all his creation does work together   you can understand can know me as well as any one on earth youre going to know me  youve got to adrian youre mine i sayâmine if you let these things on earth keep you from me you shall have to answer for them in your last day for in heaven we are married were one no matter what the world says he was unbending not because he did not love her but because he distrusted himself

we must live apart dearest i cannot ruin your life because mine is ruined

adrian i she burst out inexpressibly distressed

they say wanda that the offspring of a quagga and a mare will have its markâwill be striped    some people call me a quagga he turned and quickly opened the door and rushed out

adrian adrian dont go dont leave mel she moaned in a frantic sob as the door slammed

a year had passed since stanton left zelda immediately after the separation stanton complained of some malady and said that he would take a long trip abroad which he hoped would make him himself again

he traveled in europe and asia and egypt he visited galleries cathedrals museums seeking everywhere a rest for his mind he attended the great receptions given by his european and american friends he walked on the various boulevards went to the operas the music halls hoping to see beautiful women or something that would divert him

but did he find satisfaction in any of these things he often stopped and asked himself for what am i looking

the answer was always the same

when he went into the various galleries when he sat at the operas he had with him only a part of himself the other partâwell he did not acknowledge this even to himself

why dont i go back and get the thing that i want most in life he at length asked himself numberless times a day why dont i get that which will complete me i am myself but only in part why dont i become whole again

so far as the world knew he and zelda were still the loving couple that they had always been why then do i not go back he asked himself

he was not afraid of people he was not afraid of zelda his love was too deep for that and love knows no fear

he sought his own happiness and whatever others thought or said mattered little to him he wanted happiness whatever the cost

that he was just in his breaking away from zelda as he had done he could find no reason to doubt he had been deceived grossly deceived

one night he sat in his room in a fashionable district in brussels he was greatly depressed his mind was not in the room it rested on nothing in particular but reviewed his whole life he cast his eyes upward and midway on one of the walls hung a madonna how sweet her face how adorable she was her pure soul her kind face lent light beauty radiance to the room he admired her dark hair her pretty eyes her rounded cheeks and how she adored the child in her arms

he was not sure whether it was zelda as he had known her or whether it was she as some great master had caught her and put her on canvas centuries before she had come into his life

it brought him back so many thoughts it seemed so real to him that he stood before it placing one hand on it he seemed to hear his own voice saying zelda  zelda  i was crazed would all the world be enough to repay you for my mad act if i could offer it to you

from the time i left you it has been your face your soul which i have followed and which has followed me everywhere in the wilds on the sea on the mountain summit in the cities in the night in the morning in the day in the cold in the warmâit was always you that led meâ and followed me

i cannot get enough of the sight of you

i see you as i did the morning when i awoke from my unconsciousness as i saw you when you were married in my arms when we were both so happy

i see you zelda as i did the morning when i left you not knowing then what i was doing this picture hurts worst of all i hear your voice as you asked if i was leaving how i love this picture of you about it is something so humanly divine from your head even in your misery there seems to radiate a light that would save the world

do you remember dearest when i sang the little songâmy love my life my all in allâ after i had revived you from the faint i never knew the meaning of those words then oh that i might sing them to you now

my voice is broken so is my heart but to tell you that my love is like a love divine would make them both whole again

our boy was right love is the only thing in the world worth while it is gods greatest gift to men

i am crazed zeldaâcrazed i am coming to you you love me yet dont you i believe you do i shall find out

call me what you may call me worse names than i did you let others do the same if they will names do not hurt i have no feeling now which is vulnerable to the world only you can hurt or heal i am coming to you do or say what you will

zelda had kept on with her charity work she got great satisfaction out of knowing that she was helping others she left clairmont and went to live in a small house near a large city in northern new jersey her visits in society now were very infrequent she went only enough to keep from being interrogated whenever she might chance to meet one of her former associates

she had often felt far greater desire for stanton than he had for her perhaps but to her now he was gone forever

now and then in the foreign columns of the papers she would see his name what pangs of sorrow they would cost her if only a few words were mentioned about him yet she was happy because he was happy and she thought he was from what she read she could still sit alone and call him dear good stanton and love him as she had always done

she wished him back but in vain she would still carry her broken heart within her and smile at the little children and other people whom she met

one evening in early march about fifteen months after their separation zelda sat at the piano in her small home playing softly an old favorite of hers and stantons the wind blew fearfully outside as it often does in march and drove the heavy drops of rain down at a terrific gait

suddenly the bell rang but she paid no attention to it her one servantâshe kept but one nowâanswered the ring

she heard two people talking in subdued tones in the hall and waited for a few minutes for the servant to announce the visitor but she did not

the visitor had asked the servant to direct him to zelda assuring her that no harm would be done

the suspense irritated zelda and she arose from the piano to come to the hall and find out who had called she made a few tteps forward and was about to step from the parlor door into the hall when the visitor turned to go into the room where she was

at the entrance they met

he seized her in his arms and said zelda zelda dearest

are we to live again stanton she asked
