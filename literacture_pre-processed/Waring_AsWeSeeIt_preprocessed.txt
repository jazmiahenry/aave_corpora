as we see it waring robert l  nonfiction
about the year eighteen hundred seventy six in a beautiful section of the old state of alabama there sat upon the large and commodious veranda of an old southern home in the golden twilight of a perfect sunset two old friends whose friendship was of lifelong standing who were alike in many respects but yet essentially different

one a white man and owner of the place the other an aged negro of the old school were smoking in perfect harmony the white man a meerschaum pipe of queer workmanship and of great age having been in his family for three generations the negro the old corncob pipe so common among negroes of that day

abe you are a cunning old nigger i cannot forget these things but conditions are not like they were in the old days the old homestead is mortgaged and the crops are getting worse each year and every dâ nigger on the place is talking about going to college what am i to do in the next year or two this dirty sneak lashum holds the mortgage and he wants to live on the place where the hound used to boss the niggers and i hear that that whelp of his wants to go to college too what is this world coming to niggers and worse poor whites talking of going to college and being lawyers and doctors

it was early in the year eighteen seventysix that these old friends both of the royal blood the kind that never knows a friend but as a friend and never breakc from a friendship but in death were thus engaged in a warm discussion as to the future of their sons

a word as to the place where we find these representatives of their respective races and as to who and what they are

about the year seventeen hundred and two there came to this country a sturdy scotch family consisting of father mother and three sons possessing nothing but their vigorous bodies and a strong determination to get along in this new world after many wanderings and hardships they selected this spot in alabama upon which they settled and built their ancestral home and upon which we find them they did not belong to the people who   gloried in the holy  institution of slavery but owning slaves they made their burdens as light as possible

when the great war of the rebellion came on the overleys were not eager to join their neighbors in their cause so as a consequence they lived under suspicion and were in constant dread lest they should be assassinated or burned out by the poor whites who were in those days just as they are today ignorant idle and vicious

the rebellion finally ended leaving this family with its ancestral home intact but much reduced in wealth all of the stock and animals of value having been carried away by bands of patriotic  rebels for use at the front

abe overley came of a stock of natures noblemen he was tall straight broad of shoulder strong limbed good featured and very blackâa typical africanâbut the kind of man that inspires trust and confidence at a glance

abes parents for four generations had enjoyed the confidence and esteem of the overleys the first abe was bought by one of the first overleys at a public auction he being sold because he was considered an intractable nigger having refused to be whipped by the overseer of the plantation upon which he lived it was said that abe was stolen and brought to this country and sold in slavery his wild and independent spirit was never broken

overley saw at a glance what the trouble was as soon as he had closed his bargain he took the manacles off abes arms and said abe you are to be my righthand man can i trust you after a long and searching glance abe replied you can always trust me but you nor no living man shall whip me

abe i do not whip my people

this bond was never broken

before the rebellion the overleys had an overseer whose name was lashum nick lashum a long gaunt typical alabama cracker whose father grandfather and greatgrandfather before him were overseers and who never aspired to anything higher this mans sole ambition was satisfied when he became known as malcolm a overleys overseer

when the war came on it soon began to be whispered about the state that nick lashum was engaged by the confederate government to press animals and stock of all kinds into service for the good of the cause there appears to be no doubt that he pressed the animals into service but according to the whisperers he did not or was not able owing to the press of business to account for hundreds of them it was even whispered that numerous droves of cattle gathered by him found their way to the union lines much to his profit

however at the close of the war this individual found himself so well supplied with ready cash that he concluded to buy a large plantation and settle upon it and live as a capitalist and planter should what place should he buy

there was but one place in all the state of alabama which suited him that was the home of his former employer malcolm a overley but this place was not for sale the adjoining plantation was however so he acquired this place and moved upon it

mr nick lashum was a man of family a large and growing family a growth peculiar to this particular family of crackers as the wealth and numbers of this family increased their churchgoing parties regaled in all their finery came to be the sight of the county a sight that strangers never failed to enjoy this great manformer overseer who had grown so wealthy in such a few years and one of whose sons was clerk of the county court and another about to be sent off to college was looked upon by the crackers of his section of the state as the man who was to lead them back to the good old times when a niggers hog was the property of the first cracker who could steal it

how fared the overleys as the years sped by having been left after the war without stock to work the plantationâ thanks to the disinterestedness  of nick lashumâon behalf of the cause and without farm hands to work the cropsâsaving the strong arm of old abe and his familyâthings had been going back for some time poor crops poor cattle and only a few of them had been the rule until after a family council it was decided to mortgage the place and raise money enough to stock the plantation as it was in the old days and begin again after much dickering and many heartaches it was decided to borrow  from the pioneer savings bank of a county alabama nick lashum jr cashier never once did malcolm a overley think that nick lashum sr would advance the money and hold the mortgage but after it was all over malcolm a overley had  and nick lashum his former overseer held him bound for five years for  at  per cent this mortgage had eighteen months to run when we find him discussing the advisability of sending his son together with old abes son north to college old abe felt that his boy should go to college with the white boy

after long and deep thought old abe with intense feeling spoke i thought when i stan by de bedside of yo mammy an she place our hans togedder and she say we war alays to stick togedder an to hep each odder an when yo boys mammy die she say de same thing dat we was to hep each odder i thought when dem yankee sojers come an dey say old man you kin go i say no i dun promise his mammy to stay an hep him through dis life i thought when i teach my boy he mus  stay an  he p i thought when i tell dem odder niggers joe an he oman jack an he oman an cleo an her gals to stay dat i was doin my duty dat i was keppin my word to de daid ise worked on dis ole plantation well nigh seventytwo yeahs and ise good for twenty mo but never did i tink dat de time would ebber come when de overley would break he word

after old abe had delivered himself of his speech there was a long deep silence finally it was broken by malcolm a overley with a voice trembling with emotion abe you old black fool who has broken word with you

i said i do not see where the money is coming from that dâ hounds mortgage is due in eighteen months and i havent the money to pay it he will surely sell me out

now what shall i do take this money and send the boys to college or pay this mortgage

old abe answered solemnly send de boys to college an  trus  in de lawd

trust in the lord that is all you  niggers  think about

you had better learn to trust in yourselves however i have made up my mind that both boys shall go to oberlin college

you can tell that boy of yours that he can go with my boy when he leaves for college this fall but i want all the work done on the place before they go

thank god j said old abe  i knowd dat yo  heart is in de same place dat all de rest of de overleys is

as a fit finale to this discussion mammy cleo blew three shrill blasts on the supper horn

soon the field hands are coming in as is evidenced by the vocal sounds of melody that float soothingly to the ears of the two old friends first to come through the yard to the great house is a tall youth with a delicate face lit up with clear blue eyes with a wellformed head covered with thick light hair which hung about his ears in ringlets the face head and carriage of the man of good blood and breeding this youth was abe sixth white he took a seat on the floor of the veranda leaning his back against a post looked up at his father and laughingly inquired why dad what is the matter have you and uncle abe been quarreling over the stock or over some passage in the bible or what

no we have not that old fool thinks i ought to send his abe to college with you this fall answered the parent

why dad i think he is perfectly right abe ought to go to college he certainly deserves it

at that moment a tall young negro of manly appearance a perfect counterpart of old abe came up to the veranda and sat down he also observed the faces of the old men

why dad what is the matter he exclaimed have you and mr overley disagreed again on some point in the bible or some point in farming

no dâ your black hide spoke up overley sr we have disagreed on you

why what is the matter with me have i not done my work well ever since i have been old enough to work

oh dâ your work i wish i could find some fault in that line this old fool insists that i pay  a year for your schooling until you get through college that is what i mean

for several moments there was nothing said by any of the four friends finally the younger overley said father if the money is not to be had let us fix it this way let abe here go the first year and i will stay home and keep up the place the next year he will keep up the place and i will go he can give me the benefit of what he has learned when he comes home

abe protests that the white boy is entitled to the first year but overley sr cut the discussion short by announcing that he had determined that both boys should go to college together therefore he didnt want any more dâ talk

both boys then moved away to the corn crib their favorite resort to talk the matter over

abe says the black boy your father is a mighty good man to spend all that money on me

yes but you and uncle abe have been mighty good to us

what would we have done after the war had your father left us or had he said to the rest of the people let us go north we would have been left without help or hope he remembers how uncle abe and the rest worked for five years without being paid one penny and

yes but your father has paid us in full paid every penny interrupted the black boy

yes but off of whose labor

no matter he has paid up where in all this state will you find another white man who having had twentythree colored people working for him for five years without pay would have paid them one cent very very few your father mortgaged his plantation if he had not paid us he would not have had that to do no abe he is a mighty good man

yes says the white boy he is a dear old dad then adds say abe didnt he cussâwell so we are to go to school together

i am sure i do not know what college are we going to 

oberlin college

that is the one college in this country that i want to go through they say they do not know color there just to think of anyone failing to see whether i am white or black and both boys laughed heartily

say abe  the white boy said i hear that buck lashum is to go to college this fall

what college

i do not know answered the white boy

well we must not let him know what college we are going to attend nor that i am going with you

why abe what difference does that make

well i must say that i feel it would be better to keep our plans from him until we are gone at any rate

abe you will see what will happen to him if he has anything to say to me about your going i havent forgotten the thrashing you gave him when he tried to force himself on my sister lucy when you drove her to deaconsville to the camp meeting last fall laughed the white boy his black eyes were such beauties and they lasted so long say but dad forgot his rheumatism when he was told what happened

when they told him that the sheriff had put you in the cababoose for licking buck lashum for insulting sister lucy gee how he ran to the harness room and got a saddle and bridle and ran to the field and got old ben and such cussing and riding you never heard nor saw i on nell kept as close to him as i could but old ben seemed to be cussing mad too for i never saw that old horse go so fast before

didnt the whole lashum family fall back when they saw him coming and didnt the sheriff get you out of the pen mighty quick but poor buck was a sight and mr nick lashum how he made excuses for buck but dad wouldnt listen and wanted to lick the whole family abe you must have soaked him some good ones dad was talking about that fellow to us last night saying he would just as leave be kicked by uncle abes old mule as for you to hit him now i know that those lashums and particularly buck do not like you abe but i cant see why we should care a poor white man abe is no good

yes yes says the black boy i know that but you cannot view a poor white man a cracker from the same viewpoint that i do compared abe with the race of white men that you and your family belong to the cracker sinks away below any living thing he is meaner and dirtier than any reptile that creeps on the face of the earth or swims in the water beneath the earth there is nothing too mean and low for him to do to a negroâpshaw what is the use of discussing a cracker anyhow the question that concerns me most just now is what will we need to take with us when we go off to college

i dont know said the white boy let us ask father he has been to college

for the benefit of my readers who are not familiar with the alabama crackers i will give an historical sketch of the lashum family that they may draw their own conclusion this family dates back to the last years of the war for independence at least that is the time of the first record which the state has of its existence the following can be found in the western bulletin monday september   nick lashum who lives in a log cabin on a small clearing in foggy bottom on mars creek was taken out of his cabin by a vigilance committee and given nine and thirty lashes on his bare back

it appears that the indians have been drinking and causing a great deal of trouble lately the source of their supply of whiskey could not be ascertained it was at last determined by the vigilance committee to search foggy bottom where a few disreputable crackers have squatted the search revealed the fact that nick lashum was making corn whiskey and trading it to the indians in his neighborhood the search also revealed the further fact that nick lashum was the leader of a gang of moonshiners who were making corn whiskey and trading it to the indians and negroes in all the lower counties of the state

nick lashum and his confederates will be tried at the next quarter session of court and are likely to get long terms in the penitentiary

thus the lashums are ushered into the limelight of history

no mention is made of what finally became of this nick lashum but tradition has it that he came back from the penitentiary to his old haunts and resumed his old habits until the time of his death which was hastened by a vigilance committee after nick had been caught with some cattle upon which the brand had been changed this man appears to have been the progenitor of this race of lashum many of whom proved to be worthy of their sire

the nick lashum of this sketch was a long gaunt lean cracker with a thin sharp face lit up by a pair of small gray eyes full of low cunning and treachery that never looked you in the face his head was topped off by a crop of thin stringy hair that was entirely unused to care his garments which were gray in color might have been homespun or anything else and hung in loose flaps about his person the trousers  stuffed into ragged cowhide boots

this gentleman a typical cracker overseer having heard that malcolm a overley wanted an overseer owing to the death of pete quickly who had served the overleys for twentyfive years betook himself to the overley plantation to apply for the position

with much fear and many misgivings he finally mustered up courage enough to pass the portals of the big gate and make his way to the great house where he expected to find the master as nick neared the house he removed his hat and walked slowly up the gravel path where he was accosted by old abe who inquired of him who he was whom he wanted to see and upon what business

at first nick was inclined to feel insulted and hurt that a big black nigger should ask him what he wanted but upon second thought he remembered how near old abe was to the throne so he answered very civilly that he wanted to see mr overley and wanted the job of overseer

after some thought abe concluded he would conduct him to his master this was done with many misgivings as to the future should he be selected nick was cautioned to keep close to old abe lest the dogs should attack him as they did not like no po white man nohow and to keep his hat under his arm where it belonged all of which nick was glad to do but making a mental vow however that he would skin old abe if he succeeded in getting the place of overseer

turning a sharp bend in the path nick without warning came suddenly upon mr overley and his family under the shade of a large tree and the sight seemed to deprive nick of power of speech he stood looking at his ragged boots and holding his hands before him mr overley sprang to his feet looking first at old abe then at nick not seeming to comprehend the meaning of the intrusion at last he spoke and demanded of old abe what this man had done and why he had brought him there the mans demeanor leading him to believe that he had been trespassing when he was told that the man wanted the position of overseer mr overley laughed heartily and the women drew close and examined him very attentively

abe said dis po  white man come up de walk an  say he want to see you bout being yo oberseer i say he kin see you but i guess he kin talk for heself maybe say mr oberseer dat am mr overley kin you talk you hab to talk morn dat to git work outten dem  niggers  back in de cotton patch

nick thus goaded by old abe finally said sah mr overley i heah thet old pete was gone an  daid an  that you war in need of a man to look arter yo   niggers  my oman she say you mought take me on in old petes place

ive been hankerin arter yuse job for a long time sah

wellâyou have have you where did you work last and why did you leave

i worked for mr jim connors down on the bottom in grove neck he sol all his niggers an gone way he never did lek plantation life he gin me one nigger but i couldnt feed him so i took an sol him he was as no count nigger as you ever see couldnt git him to do nothin sell a bad nigger sah same as you sell a bad hoss

i have no bad niggers neither have i any bad horses all my people are happy and content i am afraid you would cause them to become dissatisfied what do you want per year  mr jim gin me  a yeah an house an ten acres the house free i git along on that very well sah

well you can see me in two days

yes sah my oman she say

that is all sir you may see me in two days abe see that the dogs do not molest him

nick with his hat still under his arm bowed most profoundly and turned to leave by the path through which he came

old abe called to him saying come dis way white man dem dorgs will eat you up down dat path by yosef what you go dat way for nohow

you mus tink yo mars jim cornors de nex time yo come lieah yo come in de way i am now showin yo out if dem dorgs had seed yo fustâwell dey dont like yo kin people nohow

it strikes me abe yuse a mighty peart nigger i suppose yuse is boss heah

yes ise de boss of dis house an dem stables an dat garden patch an all dem chickens an fowlsâyo dunno dat does yo

oh i tink it war somethin  like thatâyuse welcome

by this time their walk had led them to the barnyard out of which a lane ran through the cornfield to the main road

abes parting shot was look out white man for dem dorgs when yo come back through dis corn patch an git yo hat off befo yo come through dis gate

abe you kin do me a good

dat am all sah yo kin see me in two days said old abe with the most aggravating composure

nick stood for a moment glaring at old abe then he turned and walked hurriedly down the lane toward the main road

owing to abes thoughtfulness nick had about threefourths of a mile farther to walk to get out to the main road on his way home abe watched nick until he passed out of sight then he laughed and remarked to himself dat man goin raise de debble on dis heah place some day

turning to a large brindle hound that watched nick very closely during his visit abe said to the dog joe yo jus watch fo dat po white man day arter tomorrow an if he try to open dat gate yo jes stop him dats all

the dog seemed to understand what abe had said for he gave nicks direction a contemptuous glance and walked away with abe

true to his appointment nick appeared at the barnyard gate hat in hand but afraid to open it for there stood joe looking at him in no uncertain way abe was in the harness room cleaning harness when joe by his growl let him know that nick had arrived abe looked through the window and saw nick at the gate and resumed his work as composedly as if he were not there

dat po white man am com well he can wait or he can com in an joe an de res of de dorgs will look arter him

after about threequarters of an hour abe appeared at the door of the harness room and said man alives is dat yo  i couldnt magine what dat dorg dun saw at de gate why yo  not cum in spec  mars abe cumin to see yo heah man yo aint nebber goin git long on his heah place yo  too slow

i was afeared of that dorg said nick

well dat dorg he dont lek no po white man dat sho cum on an see what mars abe goin say you sich a noble lookin critter dat i sho massa goin have you said abe after contemptuously surveying nicks tattered appearance

nick made a mental note of abes observation and vowed to get even if the time ever came

nick was engaged by malcolm a overley after a long lecture in which he was told plainly that he was not to curse nor abuse any person on the place and that no whipping was allowed when he could not get work out of the field hands they were to be sent to the great house nick did not know at first what to make of that kind of treatment for negroes but he soon learned he quickly discovered that he could get more and better work out of them in that way than he could by the lash he continued in the service of the overleys until the war of rebellion

the time finally came for the overley boys to leave the old place for college quite a discussion arose as to the names of these hoys each having been known all his life as abe overley one white the other black it was seen by them and very properly that they could not be thus distinguished while at college it was finally decided that one should be malcolm a overley jr and the other abraham overley jr it appears that the negroes had never been called malcolm the senior overley on the day of their departure called both boys into his library for a final word

he said with great earnestness you boys are now leaving this place for college this is the first time either of you has been from home you will meet with temptations but i expect you both to overcome them you will meet them within and without the college walls i repeat that i expect you to overcome them you both bear a name that has remained unsullied for a century

i expect it to remain so i have no fortune as my ancestors had i have but their name left i entrust it to your safekeeping

you malcolm must remember your mothers last words that abe is your life friend and abe you must remember that malcolm is the son of your fathers best friend need i say more

abe extended his hand to the elder overley who grasped it heartily he said i cannot express what i feel sir when i consider what you are doing for me i can but say that you will never regret what you do for me if i live to get through college i will repay you i thank you sir with all my heart

i do not want your thanks you deserve what i am doing for you all i want you to do is to get through college and bring my name back as you take it from the old plantation

the next morning at sunrise both of the old men met at their usual place on the veranda they smoked a long time in silence which was finally broken by a remark from the owner of the place

abe what do you think those boys will want to do when they get out of college

i guess your boy will want to go to congress and my boy will hep dese po niggers git back som ob de ian dat has been tooken from den by dat lashum fambly 

that would be a good thing for him to do but i am afraid his hide would not be worth a picayune when he tries it

ise hearn him say dat too den he say dat he intends to try so he jp him god when he cum back dat boy he mean what he say

well abe what do you think of that boy starting a legal fight with these poor whites they are in control of the county and the courts and everything else that i know of

then abe do you think that it is right for a nigger to fight a white man

well i tell yo fore de war when all de niggers long to sombody ese all dat i hearn am dat de lawd made a white man fus an dat de white man war made specially by de lawd to own an boss de nigger den i belebe dat de nigger jes natchuly long to de white man but when dem white sojers cum heah an lick de debble outen dese white folks an  i see how meek an  humble lek dey cum to dem den i say what am dis am i right nohow is dese white folks what dey is cracked up to be den i see dat lashum fambly puttin on airs an silksâthe same folks dat i seed fore de war in missus ole work apron den i say what am dis world a cumin to but when i see all dem trash fishiatin round lection day an havin all de say den i say dat de debble am de boss arter all an dat de po nigger am de feed for his fire an dat if de men lek yon an mr jim cornors an mr big joe wheatly dont took an do somefin dis country aint goin to las whoever hearn of anything lassin dat dese po white trash does does i tink dat a nigger oughten fight a white man dis is what i was teached dat i was to spect a white man an not answer him back nor hit him but dem was slavery days what de difference now i dunno

i does know dat dem po white trash on de neck is a whole lot wus den me or my people is an dat you an mr jim an mr big joe is a mighty sight bettern dem niggers what gits drunk all de time an hangs round de crossroads but is i as good as you an  de res  ob yo  friends dat keeps me wake ob nights my boy he young an read de books he say dat all men is bornd ekil an dat a man is what he make heself he say dat a man hab no right to say he am as good as dis one or dat one because he am a man but he mus make heself a man he say dat ebry man will find he strata in ciety what he mean by dat

he means his level

he say dat a nigger or po white man dat say he got a right to cum to yo house an cum in an set down widouten you ax him in am a fool dat what i tink i dont let dem trashy niggers cum to my house nor does yo low dem po white trash to cum heah but den i jes dont feel dat ise fit to mingle wid yo gess no i dont tink so now when dem boys cum back from college dey may or dey may not be chums but dey will say how dey will treat each odder at dey own house it pends tirely on who dese people is i tink dat a nigger oughter fight ebry po white man dat dont treat him or he kinfolks right dat what yo an yo friends does

that is so abe but i did not think that you felt that way all together

after old abe had relapsed into silence malcolm a overley pondered abes remarks for a long time

what a change a few years have wrought old abe dâ his black hide feels that he is almost as good as me and my friends he has doubts on that score well who the hâ would have thought it but he has sense enough not to push himself he holds himself above the low niggers about here

he is looked up to by all the good niggers far and near he is right to hold himself above these dâ poor trashy whites i could never understand why these poor whites hated abe and his boy so i see now there is a natural antipathy between the two classes abe and his kind represent all that is honest and true while the poor whites are just the opposite but can this boy afford to start a fight with these people just at the time he comes out of college and with nothing to live upon

in spite of myself i can but admire that boys pluck and spirit

well i guess i will come in for my share of trouble for sending him off to college why i must be getting babyish

who the hâ will dare to question an overley as to his reason for doing what he thinks proper

thus he smoked and dreamed for an hour suddenly he exclaimed abe you have changed somewhat in the past year or so it seems to me

i dont reckon yo ever axed me dat question befo my boy say dat dere am no mo niggers but all am merican citizens free an ekil befo de law dat what he say now ise a citizen an has de rights what  goin to let dem po white trash bamboozle me oughten dem fo

abe why do you continually refer to the poor whites

are they the only people who do not treat you right

why man alives said abe with wrath dont yo know dat de po  white trash am de onliest people in dis whole world dat am alays hollerin nigger jim crow social quality nigger marrying white oman  an  de debble knows whatâall sich fool talk dat causes trouble dem very same trash dat kotches our likely lookin  gals on de road an  drags dem in de bushes dem de people dat sees a hardworkin  nigger wid a home an a mule an a fix to go to church wid dat gits up de mob an hollers dat dis nigger is arter he wife or gal

den dey burn he home an barn an take he life an mule an hog an fix to pay de damage dems de trash dat gemmen lek you an mr jim an mr big joe oughter hep us for to fight fore de war when dem same critters did steal hogs an de lek yo all did ride to dere cabins an take dem out an flog dem on dere bare backs now dey do de same thing more bold holler rape an de whole country is ridin an beatin ebry nigger dey meet an if he owns a good hoss dat is bettern dearn dey swops hosses wid him whedder he wants to or no

why man alives said old abe with increasing wrath dese things am nuff to make a man bus  wide open an  dey is gettin wus when dat drunken smaly boy kotch my sally jane on de road dat night when you an mr jim hearn her holler hit was a good ting dat yo abe hide dat gun i run for de gun fus but yo an mr jim git dere fus i sho would hab killed him

but lawdy how my abe did walk on him i think sho dat de padroller would git him i nebber tol you dat it war my abe dat beat him up so no sah i was afraid dat yo would think dat a nigger oughten lick a white man

this last sentence was spoken in such a solemn tone that both men laughed heartily

abe you are a sly old rascal you know perfectly well that i have abused your boy time and again and told him that he was a coward for allowing that poor white hound to get off without a thrashing and you would not tell me you told my boy though i can now understand why you three devils always grinned in my face every time i spoke of that case

told my boy hut would not tell me why not me

well when dem boys cum to me an abe tol me what he dun done yo abe say dat you better not know bout it i say no you dun got nuff on yo mind thout dat dat i war abes daddy an dat i war de one to bar de trouble so i say no an dat end it

well abe that was very kind of you what you say about those poor white people has long been a source of worry for me and my friends only last night we determined to get together and try to put a stop to these deviltries it will be a hard job these poor whites are in the saddle now we have been asleep too long and they have taken advantage of everything we are going to try to stop them by fair means and if not then we will try the same method we used on them before the war

it appears that the negro referred to in a previous chapter as belonging to nick lashumâhe having been given to lashum by mr jim connors and sold by nick as a worthless niggerâhad after the war accumulated some property and had a good home upon which he reared a family of nine children the eldest of whom was a man of family and taught the county school for colored children this young man had a wife and three children he rode a very fine colt to and from his school which was some distance from his home

there was but one other horse in that end of the state which could hold his own at the county fairs with this colt and that horse belonged to young malcolm a overley this negros horse was the envy of every poor white man in that section often was the remark made that that horse was too good for a nigger and that he must have stolen it

finally the man appeared who lost  the colt although it was well known that this colt was sired by malcolm a

overleys horse ben known all over the state by its color and markings

one warm july night while this old negro and his family were sitting about the front of their home a party of horsemen were heard coming down the road nothing was thought of that until the sound of horses hoofs was heard coming up the back road toward the rear of the place suddenly all sounds ceased then a pistol shot was heard then a rush of horses hoofs and before one of the astonished negroes could gather his wits volleys from shotguns and revolvers were fired amongst them killing and maiming men women and children alike the old father the young schoolmaster and his youngest child who was asleep on his lap were killed the wife who was about to become a mother was trampled to death beneath the horses hoofs before she could drag herself out of the way the dwelling and barn were fired in a dozen places at once both buildings together with their contents save the colt in question were consumed

the alabama news the leading newspaper of the state at that time had the following conservative account of this tragedy george burrell a desperate negro whose desperate deeds date back before the war and his son who was following in his fathers footsteps and two more of his desperate family wiped out by sheriff c lashum and a posse of citizens

it appears that a deputy sheriff went earlier in the day to the cabin of george burrell to replevin the colt that burrell had stolen the deputy sheriff was met at the door by burrell and his son both armed with doublebarrelled shotguns and his life threatened if he dared to serve his papers

the sheriff was notified and the papers were served with the above result it appears that in the fight which ensued upon the service of the papers the lamp was overturned and the cabin was soon in flames which in turn spread to the barn both buildings being entirely consumed

it is to be regretted that a negro woman and two small children were trampled upon by horses but the citizens claim that the horses became unmanageable when the fire started

a coroners jury which was empanelled on the spot exonerated the sheriff and his deputies as it was clearly shown that the negroes resisted the service of a legal paper

it will be well for the negroes and all concerned when they learn not to resist the law but to submit to the lawful service of papers as white men do

this conservative account of a most atrocious and bloody deed was heralded to the outside world as another example of negro depravity degeneracy and disregard for the law and its representatives this paper sent out this account without investigating the case and based its report upon the statement made by one of the parties who participated in the killing

the facts are as follows the party who sought to replevin the horse well knew that he could not maintain the suit if it were presented to the court in the regular way so it was determined to put the two principal witnesses the old negro and his son out of the way which was done very successfully the finding of the coroners jury which was composed of members of the midnight marauders empanelled on the spot was not questioned

the sheriff was there with his papers and the deputy sheriff who swore that he was at the place earlier in the day and was met by the old negro father and son with guns in their hands was also there although as a matter of fact he was not on the place prior to his coming with the mob who were bent on killing a prosperous negro and his family all these things were known to persons in the neighborhood but the machinery of the law was in the hands of the murderers and nothing could be done the attention of the governor of the state was called to the case together with the fact that what was left of the family had been driven from that section of the country and their property practically confiscated the governor was informed by his special agent garrington that the negroes resisted the lawful service of a legal paper and that all the killings naturally followed the unlawful acts of the negroes

the loss of property and the driving from home of helpless children by the lashums was not gone into everything was regular and according to law

this outrage is what brought malcolm a overley and his friends together we shall see later what good was done by this combination of lawabiding white citizens

about one week after the boys had gone two letters arrived both began dear father we arrived safe and sound so did buck lashum

each father instinctively looked at the other and read the others thoughts each felt that this announcement meant trouble for his boy

the letters contained the statements that the boys were through with their examinations that both had passed with credit and had been assigned to their respective classes

they had secured adjoining rooms but were very much disappointed to learn that buck lashum had secured a room on the same floor across the hall on the front tier overlooking the campusâone of the rooms sought by the rich boys

they also spoke of the boys of different nationalities who were attending the college there were englishmen scotchmen italians spaniards japanese chinese negroes frenchmen germans and one persian of a noble family

as all the young men spoken of in the letter met in the chapel at devotional exercises and at the mess table the southern boys led by buck lashum not understanding the sentiment which prevailed at this college promptly waited upon the president the grand old dr finley and requested that the negroes also the japanese chinese and the persians be seated at a separate table so that the gentlemen of the south could enjoy their meals without feeling that they were degrading themselves by eating with niggers

the president of the college listened very attentively to these students then asked do you know who these young men are and what is your objection

mr buck lashum being the spokesman of the party and not having had that early education which would have fitted him to act in such a matter blurted out   they are niggers

sit down gentlemen said the good man let me tell you who these gentlemen are

he then called the secretary and had the roster of the college brought

now let me see who these people are to whom you so strenuously object first we have the two japanese one the son of baron yoshida the other a son of count nagayana both old aristocratic families whose names have been interwoven in the history of the eastern world for more than a century

next we have the chinese four in number who are descendants of families the youngest of which antedates the building of the great chinese wall years before the christian era

the persian is a prince of the royal blood brother of the present ruler of persia whose family dates back  b c

next we have the negroes from jamaica whose fathers are british subjects included among the wealthy cultured and progressive men on that island

the next five are sons of afroamericans some of whom you gentlemen may have known before you came to this college i understand that one or two of youâlooking at buckâhave personal acquaintance with some of these afro americans

now i notice among you some native born southern men and some who have never been south what am i to infer

that you young men have gotten together and come to the conclusion before you have been here long enough to know the sentiment or learn the rules which govern this institution that there is something radically wrong in the management of this college and that all that is needed is just a little care at your hands and all will be set right

you young men who come from the south may think you are right because you have been taught these ideas but you young men who have never been south must have borrowed these ideas which are no credit to you

as president of this college i will inform you gentlemen that the college will continue to stand by its old rules and customs and live up to the sentiment which has always dominated it and if in any way the table does not suit you gentlemen you will be permitted to have a table at which you may enjoy yourselves as your sense of dignity may dictate

these young men are students here in the same sense that you are entitled to all the rights and consideration to which you are entitled it is not the policy of this college to humiliate one student at the behest of another i am rather astonished at this proceeding you gentlemen have just entered college you have been here but three weeks and yet you come to me with a request for me to unsettle a policy which was established forty years ago am i to consider you a disturbing element

my advice to all of you is look well to your books look well to your lectures look well to yourselves lest these same boys whom you now hold in such contempt outstrip you when examination day comes and leave the management of the college to those upon whom that duty devolves

with these words spoken in a kindly voice but in no uncertain way the president arose and the interview was at an end

when this delegation was well out of hearing of the presidents office buck laslium burst forth with an oath saying who would have thought that a white man would have said that a nigger is as good as a white man and that a white man can eat at a side table if he dont like the niggers being present

i for one will write home and tell my pappy that i am sick from eating with niggers and want to come home he will send for me by the next mail

the next speaker was a boy who came from a copperhead

family of southern indiana by the name of bloxum this family possesses nothing but a reputation for aping aristocratic people and forming friendships with the newly rich of their neighborhood

there appeared to be something in buck lashum for bloxum hence the newly formed friendship

buck dont do nothing of the sort stay right here and lets give them hâ these niggers have no business here we can freeze them out

that is right spoke up the rest we can arouse enough sentiment to force the faculty to put them out

we can write home and ask our people to write here saying that the nigger must go said bloxum

then spoke up young bucker well you fellows can do that if you choose but i am going to take dr finley at his word and let this thing alone

i didnt want to mix up with this affair in the beginning anyhow my father has no money to waste on me fooling with other peoples business i must make my time count while i am in college

just like you said bloxum afraid of your shadow

well i guess we can find enough white men in this college to carry this thing through

we will try without you said the rest

that is what you will have to do replied bucker

when this visit to the president became known and what these young men had attempted to do the foreigners were astonished being of royal blood they could not understand what was meant by the attitude and the request preferred and took just the opposite view thinking that the common people were afraid to sit with royalty and therefore undertook to explain to lashum and bloxmn their willingness to waive the point in etiquette so long as they were in school

when the students learned that the foreigners had condescendingly endeavored to waive this point in etiquette and were willing that these protesting hoys should eat at the same table with them the jibes and shafts of wit and sarcasm thrust at them by the students would have been unbearable to persons of refinement and culture but were completely lost upon these boysâone the son of a former overseer of six generations of overseers the other the son of a copperhead

whose natural characteristic is what the word copperhead

is meant to imply

consequently in the density of their ignorance and selfconceit they failed utterly to appreciate the ridiculous position in which they had placed themselves both buck and his friend bloxum failed to pass the examinations which had been passed with credit by the boys whom they presumed to condemn but they were permitted to go on conditionally

buck felt that he was white and that that was all that was necessary

by the end of the first quarter he had learned better

it is now christmas time following the departure of the boys we find the two old abes before the great fireplace smoking and discussing their absent sons suddenly overley changed the conversation by remarking abe i am expecting some friends here tonight mr jim connors sent me word that he would come over and stay a couple of days so i have invited some of the old family heads to join us as i think it a fit time to discuss ways and means to put a stop to these cussed crackers carryings on big joe wheatly the postmaster sam hurry and the only one left in office who belongs to my circle of friends dr jack cushing the minister kev dr snell and

the minister interrupts abe i hope sah dat you will member he presence an not forgit yo presence ob mine an say nothin dat he will feel called on to pray fo you fo

abe observed that his friends eyes were filled with tears and that he was greatly affected by his reference to the past and asked him if he would not then and there throw himself upon the lawd overley seemed on the point of opening his heart to god when there was a knock at the door and lucy announced jim connors and big joe wheatley as both men strode into the room overley stood looking at them with a tearstained face but unembarrassed abe observed the interruption and noted the harm done by their untimely arrival but he bowed his head and murmured lawd thy will be done

to their question as to what ailed him overley said quietly and with great seriousness that abe had almost persuaded him to become a christian big joe wheatley laughed and observed that from his appearance abe must have persuaded him that he was an infant again he also wanted to know how long abe had been doing missionary work among the heathen

jim connors took a more serious view of the matter and wanted to know what abe had said connors had had a very pious catholic mother and had never forgotten her last words although he had not followed her parting advice when he was told what abe had said of the deathbed scene of mrs

miranda overley he too was visibly affected the words brought back to his memory a similar experience he sat silent and thoughtful for a long time finally he broke the silence which had become painful with the remark malcolm i remember your mothers death as well as if it were yesterday instead of thirty years ago of course i remember my own mothers death better although she has been dead more than thirty odd years but they were both good christian women and both left us with the request on their dying lips that we trust in the lord has either of us done so i will say that i have not what have you to say for yourself

jim at times i have considered this question of eternity very seriously but have never gotten to the point where i could reconcile all the various obstacles that have arisen in my mind i do honestly wish that i had

yes yes malcolm i have no doubt that it would have been better for us both had we followed our mothers parting advice we are old men now

is it too late now exclaimed a voice from the hall and the good minister rev dr snell came into the room in the seriousness of the discussion lucys announcement of dr snells arrival had not been noticed he had heard the latter part of what was said while being relieved of his hat and outer coat

i do not feel that it is too late nor do i feel that there is any particular hurry about the matter i just cannot get my mind around to the point where i feel that it is necessary for me to become a christian answered overley

doctor that is also the way i feel concerning the matter r said jim connors

oh brothers let me tell you what the lord has done for you you are poor insects as compared with him he could have crushed you out of this life long ago but he has spared you for some good purpose you are old men now well nigh eighty years of age though still hale and hearty have you nothing to be thankful for

oh yes we have our fallen fortunes to be thankful for

said big joe wheatley

oh my brother you always strike a bitter chord when you speak of our fallen fortunes years back when the colored people were our bonded servants we always had the means of raising ready money but now we have to content ourselves with the crops and rents some years are good but most are bad god in his wise providence may send the good old days back again

god forbid said the three men in chorus

i was born on a plantation where there were over one hundred slaves i came into possession of all those men women and children i fought to maintain our cause but god forbid that those days of bondage may ever come again

was the remark of jim connors

big joe wheatley remarked i too was born on a plantation peopled with dozens of slaves the old place belongs to me now my former slaves are now my tenants some few have bought the places on which they live but i never want to see these people in slavery again no i hope that our fair southland will never again be cursed with human slavery

but doctor i do not understand how you can wish for what you call the good old times you lived north before the war and saw nothing of the slave system only when you visited your old uncle here at christmas time how do you know that those were good old times

i always heard uncle refer to them as the good old times

was the doctors hesitating reply

old abe had been seating the guests a number of whom had arrived he had also been a close listener to the remarks of the good minister

upon leaving the room he mumbled to himself dat preacher man he beate de debble he a good man one way he sho can zort de sinners to tun from dey crooked ways but den he al ays droppin  sumfin  sly lek bout de good slavery day bout de war times bout he wish dat slavery cum agin bout de yankee sojers when he a yankee hesef he onny cum heah to lib arter his uncle die an lebe him datplantation my abe say he a sturdin element well nobody in dis heah house wants slavery to cum agin i thank god fo dat

after abe had gone overley called the attention of his friends to what was done and said at the last meeting

it was soon agreed that a set of resolutions should be adopted and published as a warning to all persons engaged in these midnight killings

the resolutions were as follows whereas murder arson rape riots and outrages of varying degrees are of frequent occurrence in this county and whereas it appears that the regularly constituted authorities do not seem able nor willing to cope with the perpetrators of these outrages therefore be it resolved that we the followingnamed lawabiding citizens do pledge our support our purses and our persons individually and collectively to the county authorities and to each other for the suppression of all kinds of lawlessness

it is further resolved that these resolutions be published and posted in order that all persons may learn them and govern themselves accordingly after much discussion it was finally agreed that a contest should be made in an effort to wrest the office of sheriff from the lashum family little joe wheatley was named for the office after an oldfashioned christmas dinner enlivened by wit and goodfellowship the committee adjourned subject to the call of the newly elected chairman james connors

when the two boys had started to college as previously related they were both shaken by conflicting emotions neither had ever been from home before but both were determined to succeed

abe suppose i fail in the examination how could i look father in the face again said malcolm

you fail how could you possibly get that idea in your head you will never fail said abe did you notice those lashum and smaly boys at the station what a nasty look they gave us when we got on the train well they are far behind now and we have nothing to fear from them it is awful to live among people whom you have to watch all the timeâpeople that only let you alone because they fear you those smalys are surely going to do me some harm some day i feel it

abe you are getting daffy i have seen those people drive in the ditch to let you pass in the center of the road why do you look for trouble from them

that is just it you dont seem to understand the nature of these crackers when they show their teeth or obsequiously drive in the ditch to let you pass them on the road or offer to shake hands when you meet them look out for yourself guard your haystacks and barns and keep off the dark roads at night when alone i have seen the result of so many accidents  to haystacks and lone negroes that my heart grows sick and its getting worse

well abe said malcolm do not take the gloomy side of this affair to rest your judgment upon there are other things to talk about just now what will we do when we get to oberlin i think it a good thing for us to see president finley as soon as we get there and ask his advice as to the courses we shall take in school continued malcolm

i think that is a very good idea indeed we certainly should have some definite object in mind we must explain to president finley what schooling we have had and what we want to do in the future and let him advise us

well abe we will do that abe there is another thing about which i want to have an understanding with you you have already said that you would not agree to room with me even if we could get a large room with two beds i do not blame you for that we must have adjoining rooms however

what do you say to that

that has been my desire from the first but i did not so express myself because i am not malcolm a overley jr i am simply abe overley jr and have no right to make my expenses at college one cent more than is absolutely necessary

well that is just what i expected you to say father told me and he told you that you are to have and fare the same as i do now abe you know my father and you know me you know that if you were not to have the same advantages that i enjoy you would never have been sent from home

you will wound my fathers feelings very much if you ever let him know that you entertained any such ideas now that is settled there is one other thing i promise you that i shall join no society no team without your knowledge and i think we should consult before either of us does anything that may affect our relations or our futures do you agree to that

i do i agree most willingly i suppose you will come to me if you see a girl you like and say abe i am sweet on miss silks do you think i had better try to win her  

well what would you say to that asked malcolm

i would ask you for twentyfour hours and then i would look up her family and if she had no cracker blood in her i would say go in and win her

the next day but one after their arrival they were able to get a few minutes with the good president dr finley after they had stated who they were and whence they came and the circumstances under which they came to college to the president he after some thought dismissed them with a request that they come to him again

the boys story had greatly impressed dr finley and he was desirous of consulting his friend george billings donewell as dr finley and mr donewell sat next evening in the doctors library their conversation turned to the college and new students

donewell said the doctor i have two students here this year whom i shall watch with a great deal of interest

they came here together under most peculiar circumstances

first let me describe them both are about six feet tall one is very white with curly chestnut brown hair blue eyes ruddy complexion he does not look nor act like a southernborn boy

the other is as black as the first boy is white six feet good features with curly black hair of a peculiar texture a perfect specimen of physical manhood they appear to enjoy each others confidence to an unusual degree they gave me their history and how they came to be here it appears that the white boys father is of an old family of alabama as old as the state itself and the negro comes from a slave family that has served the white boys people for generations it appears further that the respective fathers are close friends and the white father though reduced in circumstances with a heavy mortgage hanging upon his home is sending his black friends boy here to college with instructions to me that i look after them both and that they are to fare alike i tell you donewell these southern people are a puzzle to me

doctor you do not know them you know that i have lived and traveled in every state in the south both before and since the war i have had an opportunity to study them psychologically and commercially there are two separate and distinct classes of white people in those states as separate and distinct as if they were not caucasians i refer to the old blue blood families and the people who are commonly designated as crackers the old blue bloods these days are reduced financially but their blood remains pure they would not consent to a daughter or a son marrying a cracker any more than they would consent to a marriage with a negro this cracker element was before the war the overseer class now they are the policemen and street car people and men working along those lines they are nonprogressive always have been and apparently always will be

there are rare exceptions however where you will find one of this class possessed of any amount of brainsâbrains in the broad sense of the word men of this class prefer negro women to their own and they are entitled to their share of responsibility for the very large number of mulattoes that are found in the southern states in traveling through maryland i heard in fact i saw all the parties to the following story a white man by the name of scotch lived with an old black woman who bore him several children two girls among them the eldest of whom was a large welldeveloped country girl about twenty years of age when i first saw her this father persuaded his daughter to come to him in a cabin where he lived the girl was gone from home for two days and nights

the cabin the girl the man all bore evidence of the two days  struggle this is an extreme case but it will give some idea of the nature of this race of white men who live south of us and who are fast coming amongst us bringing their uncouth and semicivilized manners and customs the other class while they will risk life and fortune for a handsome mulatto or octoroon will also educate their offspring

yes but this does not appear to be a case of that kind

this boy is a fullblooded negro there must be some tie that binds these people other than that referred to by you i shall watch this case with great interest they have asked my advice which i shall gladly give them do you remember having met a man by the name of lashumânicholas lashum âin a county alabama

oh yes i met him or rather his family ten or twelve years ago one of the family was sheriff of the county and i think that one of this family has been sheriff of that county ever since the war it is a very large family and one of whom some of the citizens of a county are not very proud the elder lashum was notorious in the state during the war he made his money in some questionable way during that period i met them in the course of business while in that county i also met some very fine old bourbons in that part of the state

these young men to whom i refer both came from that county overley is the name said dr finley

why i remember the overley plantation very well i spent two days upon it i was greatly impressed with the cordial welcome extended to me by the overleys i remember the perfect friendship that seemed to exist between mr

overley and his former slave abe than whom a more perfect specimen of physical manhood i never saw the two sons were like their respective fathers and each seemed to enjoy the complete confidence of the other i was struck by the simplicity and beauty of the lives of the people on that plantation there appeared to be only one thing lackingâfunds

i sold the lashums a large bill of goods but overley told me frankly that he had no money and could not purchase anything at that time i offered to send him what he wanted and take his word for the money explaining to him that i owned the plant and no one would ever push him for payments

after a consultation with his black man abe he refused my offer i will always remember that home

you will have an opportunity to study that family from another point of view these boys are no doubt the little fellows whom you saw while at their home

when you see them again doctor i would like to be present i want to note what changes ten years have made in them

mr george billings donewell was one of those rare characters sometimes found in this selfish world who have been successful and who delight in helping others he advanced a peculiar code of ethics as he termed it based wholly on the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do to you his theory was that all men are born free and equal but as god in his wise providence endows some men in a greater degree than others that those persons so endowed hold their endowments in trust for their weaker brothers he believed that dr finley having been endowed with great mental faculties and the power to comprehend and digest great educational problems was in duty bound to disseminate his knowledge and to hold it in trust for all mankind so also with the man endowed with the faculty for accumulating wealth he believed that he was required to use that wealth for the benefit of mankind mr donewell argued and lived up to this theory first that a mans duty is to god who made him

second that a mans duty is to the family that god has given him

third that a mans duty is to his distressed worthy brother

should a man be successful in this world financially his first duty is to provide for his family but all over and above their wants and needs he holds in trust for mankind

many are the young men who have passed through oberlin college and felt the aid of a helping hand but never discovered whence this help came so careful were dr finley and mr donewell that their good offices should not be heralded

two days after their first conference with the president dr finley sent for our alabama friends and had a long talk with them at which mr donewell was present the doctor advised them as to the courses he thought proper for them to pursue in order to finish their respective educations the boys departed highly elated over the friendships they had formed dr finley and mr donewell both had invited them to visit their homes whenever they found it convenient

abe said malcolm while on the way back to their rooms who is mr donewell he says that he remembers us he certainly has been on the old place or how could he locate the corn crib the spring house or the big cherry tree on the hill do you remember him

i cannot say that i do but i shall always remember him now he appears to be a very fine old man when shall we visit him at his home

whenever you say abe

well tomorrow is saturday let us join the boys who are going to black river to fish

i will be glad to do that said malcolm but we must be careful i have heard that river spoken of as being very dangerous

in the early morning following the two boys together with several other young men set out for the river

they had gone but half the distance when they were overtaken by a bus load of young people boys and girls bound for an outing as the bus passed malcolm noticed several female classmates whose names he had not yet learned

who is the young lady with the dark hair and eyes the one on the end of the seat asked malcolm of young forbes a resident of oberlin

why that is miss donewell she lives on main street

her father is worth a million but you would not think he had doughnuts if you saw him on the street the other girls next to her are new yorkersâsistersâchiswellsâfather is a wholesale druggist they will graduate this year i believe

i will take you up to see them tomorrow if you desire to be presented

certainly i will only be too glad to avail myself of the opportunity but what about my chum abe will you be as glad to present him as you are to present me asked malcolm

why of course i will he is black enough but appears to be a gentleman

what do you think the young ladies will say questioned malcolm

you do not seem to realize one thing answered forbes

i have lived here all my life and i know the sentiment of this college there is a fraternal feeling that prevails here

all students are treated alike these young ladies will receive him very cordially take my word for it

the young men soon arrived at the river some busied themselves digging grubworms others prepared a camp the others strolled about the banks looking for a good place to cast the lines

malcolm and forbes were amongst those who went up the stream just as they turned a bend in the river a short distance from the camp abe who had remained behind heard malcolms voice ring out clear and sharp stop that stop that you are upsetting the boat

abe knew from the ring in malcolms voice that something unusual was happening and he hastened to the bend in the river as did some of the others to see what the trouble was

they observed a boat containing five personsâthree girls and two young menâcoming down the stream one of the men stood in the middle of the boat rocking it violently the girl who was sitting in the bow of the boat lost her balance and was about to slip overboard this young man whose name was rattles heard malcolms warning but in defiance gave the boat one more violent tilt which caused it to careen and when it righted again miss donewell fell overboard dropping headfirst into the water as the boat lost her weight mr rattless position caused it to careen violently to the other side and he was thrown into the water also when each came to the surface the current had carried the boat out of their reach mr

rattles grasped miss donewell about the shoulders and held her head under the water while trying to keep his own above

malcolm and forbes both sprang into the water and were soon at the girls side but could not loosen rattless hold upon her

she was apparently being exhausted by being kept under the water so long abe saw the trouble from the shore and springing into the water was soon within reach of them without a moments hesitation he dealt rattles a blow between the eyes which dazed him abe then pushed rattless head under the water which caused him to loosen his hold on the girl and to grasp abe malcolm and forbes soon got the young lady to the rivers bank which was not more than twenty yards distant but abe came near losing his life rattles succeeded in getting a hold on him which abe could not break

abes only recourse was to keep under the water and swim toward the bank which was a trying thing to do with a struggling man hanging to him a person possessed of less strength and coolness would not have succeeded when he reached the bank there were willing hands to help him with his burden rattles in his terror could not be induced for some time to loosen his hold on abes arm not realizing that he was on terra firma and away from all danger the young man in the boat was unable to render any assistance owing to the fact that one oar had fallen overboard he tried manfully however to scull the boat close enough to abe to enable him to grasp the side but did not succeed miss donewell was resuscitated by the young ladies under malcolms instructions and was soon ready to return to the bus the girls at first wanted to walk back but malcolm assured them that he and his friend abe could manage the boat and get them to the bus much quicker

miss donewell smiled and said you and mr forbes have just pulled me out of the water

i can trust you both to get me back to the bus

we did not do it all ourselves miss donewell answered forbes if mr overley there pointing to abe had not come to our rescue when he did i am afraid four of us including mr rattles would be at the bottom of that river now

mr rattles what a pity said one of the new york girls he lay on the ground limp and motionless staring at the water as if he were afraid that a wave would come and engulf him and carry him back beneath its surface

when it became known at the college that rattles had nearly caused miss donewell to lose her life and that abe had blackened rattless eyes in helping to rescue her there were many and various comments on the occurrence most of the boys were inclined to praise abe for his bravery but lashum and bloxum true to their natures sought to stir up strife they sought out rattles with a view to poisoning his mind against abe malcolm and forbes rattles was a western boy of good family truehearted but a little faulty in judgment at times

say mr rattles began buck i hear that you were given a wrong turn on black river last saturday that nigger abe overley is bigger than you are or he would never have dared to do what he did

no said bloxum if i were you i would not stand for such treatment at the hands of a nigger he is running about now crowing and saying how he smashed you between the eyes that fellow he came here with makes a fool of him the idea taking a nigger to call on a white woman

why mr rattles again urged buck are you going to stand for that look at your face just think of it a nigger hit you go to the dean and complain we will go with you and help you out this nigger is too free with his fists buck evidently remembered his own encounter with abe

rattles come and go to the dean said bloxum buck and myself heard him say what he had done and what he expected to do before long

what did he say that he had done asked rattles

why that you are the biggest cur he had ever met and all he wanted was just one chance at dr finleys son and he would be satisfied

well that seems strange to me abe refused to go with the young ladies that day but insisted on staying with me

he not only stayed with me but reduced the swelling in my face smoothed the matter over with the faculty and went with me to mr donewells home when i offered my apologies in fact he has acted like a man in the whole affair he is my friend he has just left my room maybe you gentlemen would like to have me call him he is with forbes and two or three others across the hall

we dont want him we dont associate with niggers 

said buck

rattles surprised them both by springing to his feet and opening the door saying go go and go quick who sent for you who asked for your advice who asked for your aid you are both liars i do not believe one word you have told me i say this man is my friend and you dare to come to me with your lies about him i never want to see your faces in my room again

the three young men were now in the hallway rattles in his anger had elevated his voice above the others and attracted the attention of several of the young men who were in the adjoining rooms among them being abe malcolm and forbes

what is the matter with rattles asked forbes

he has his western dander up he is out on the prairie now not out on the water said hawkins rattless chum

oh hes got it in him say rattles old boy what is the matter asked hawkins

these fellows have taken it upon themselves to come to my room to insult my friends said rattles what do you think of them

come in my room fellows said one of the young men we are not permitted to stand in the hallways do not leave gentlemen he added noting that buck and bloxum were moving away you are welcome and further it will be necessary for you to explain the nature of this insult of which rattles complains

all the boys about fifteen in number crowded into the room buck and bloxum among the number though they were not very willing to enter

gentlemen said hawkins an unusual thing has happened one gentleman has passed the lie to two others and further has ordered those gentlemen never to put their faces in his room again according to the unwritten law of this college the offending party must apologize or tight it is also the law that a committee hear the case and pass upon it

now mr buck lashum you are the insulted party what complaint have you to make

i have nothing to say nor have i any complaint to make

was bucks answer

mr squealer bloxum you are also one of the insulted parties what complaint have you to make

i think that mr rattles was a little excited when he used the word liar and that he did not mean

that is not for you to say interrupted hawkins  it is no part of your business to make apologies for mr rattles

the lie has been passed the question is have we two liars amongst us or have we two men amongst us who knowing they are not liars do not possess the manhood to resent the insult now what have you both to say i will say further that you gentlemen must either obtain an apology from mr

rattles or fight or be branded as liars and cowards that is the law

buck and bloxum both remained silent not knowing what to say

what is the matter lashum asked a tennessee boy

are you afraid to talk do you forget that you come from the south where all men are free and where you only find true manhood

yes these fellows are a sample of your southern manhood spoke up a long yankee boy i venture they have lied about somebody and now they are afraid to own it just to think of it a true southern gentleman afraid of the consequences of his acts

this bit of sarcasm was followed by a peal of laughter

gentlemen let us have no crossfiring said hawkins adding mr rattles you have violated the unwritten law of this college inasmuch as you have called fellow students liars

what have you to say for yourself

i will simply say that these fellows

 gentlemen interrupted hawkins

well students said battles

no gentlemen insisted hawkins

students came to my room continued rattles and lied to me about my friend whose name i may not mention it is enough to say that he is my friend and that no gentleman of honor will hear his friends slandered behind their backs in this case i know they lied i so expressed myself and i reiterate what i have said before they are contemptible liars

my god lashum are you a southern man have you any blood in your veins will you allow your name to be handed down in this college as a contemptible liar again urged the tennessee boy

oh this is not the first lie he has told nor will it be the last while at this school said rattles

well fellows these gentlemen by their silence acknowledge that what mr rattles says is true there can be but one conclusion for you to reach which is that they have lied on somebody who it is does not matter what will be your decision

that hereafter all honorable students refuse to believe anything they have to say unless corroborated by a third person spoke up the long yankee boy

this decision was mild in form but severe in operation no matter what they said even that the weather was cold would be met by the retort whom have you to vouch for that statement 

after the boys had separated buck said to bloxum that nigger always gets the best of us we will fix him yet

buck lets go to elmyra tonight and have some fun said bloxum

i dont care we can stay until sunday night answered buck

elmyra is a town about eight miles from oberlin in another county where the students of loose habits go for relaxation

after the train bearing malcolm and abe had left the station and they were off for oberlin college buck and the smaly boys watched until it disappeared around the curve at coons tree

well thats the limit said buck  niggers going off to college did you hear to what college they were going

yes to the oberling school or some sich place said one of the smalys

is that so why i am going to that school who told you that i ll go home and tell pappy and he will see about niggers going to school with his son i bet he wont stay there long yoll see said buck as he mounted his horse and left in great haste

when he reached home he found his father sitting on the fence by the hog styâthe old man not having been able to outgrow his early habitsâtogether with several kindred spirits discussing the resolutions published by the citizens who had met at the home of malcolm a overley sr

i say that them people they think that they is goin to run things to suit theyselves but as sure as my name be nick lashum they is mistook ole mai overley hes at the bottom of this heah whole dâ business hes a mighty white man he is sendin niggers off to college dâ if i dont fix him yeah ater nex yoll see ill

just at that moment buck dashed into the barnyard his horse almost ready to drop from hard riding

what ails yer boy what yer ridin that critter like that fer

 nuff ails me malcolm overley has gone to oberling college with that nigger abe do you think i want to go to school with niggers yelled buck

yes jis knowed that why i mistook yer haid fer a place fer brains yer lettle sister arabella she told me that two weeks ago what yer think i kin do bout it now go on to college and see what they do with them niggers then let me know and ill settle the whole matter then thats what yer do

yes pappy but that nigger is at the same school and i

how long yer been runnin this heah place yer better a darn sight do as yer is tole an not stop to augrify wid yer betters i know morn a minit than yoll git outen books in a lifetime yer rub thet air critter out and see that she dont git stiff morrow mornin i wont have my critters worked that way pears to me thet i have sed thet offen nuff said the father with warmth

mr nick lashum prided himself on the fact that he was the boss there was but one person on his place over whom he had no control and that was an old negro woman of uncertain age the mother of several doubtful looking children of variegated colors who resembled the lashum family

this old woman claimed that she had known nick lashum since   long fore de wah and that he was bound to take care of her until she died all of which appears to be true from the fact that she lived in a cabin within a stones throw of nicks wife and children without doing labor of any kind and having free access to everything on the place this old woman who was known in war times when she traveled about the state with nick lashum as black sue and who appeared to know a great deal of nicks innermost affairs was a character within herself no person on the place appeared to know exactly where she came from nor on whose place she lived before the war suffice it to say when nick came into possession of his present home she came with her six lean yellow children and took the cabin in which we find her as her share of nicks assets and lived there with her growing family we shall see something of her later

buck not having gained his point and only succeeding in arousing the wrath of his parent took the mare to the stable yard and proceeded to obey his fathers injunctionâto rub her out

after bucks departure nick lashum and his cronies resumed their talk

why in course ole mai is the bottom of the whole darn thing said si weedles a citizen of large family and small resources whose business was crossroad politics and juryman and furdermore i hear that little joe wheatley is to run gin casper lashum for sheriff

the hâ yer say si said nick who tol yer so

wal i dunno zackly who it war that tol me but i hearn hit today thats what i earned heah ferâto talk this thing over i tol them darn hothead smalys and wardemans to let them  niggers  alone thet thet hoss was burrells and sich doins war goin to make trouble now this is only the beginnin yoll see said weedles

so thats what the matter wid them big bugs is hit

takin up fer niggers hey beetle joe wheatley hims the one they expects to beat cas fer sheriff wal i mus say them people is smart that darn boys suttenly well thought on in this heah county doggon if cas an his pals aint got to git out an hustle said nick

si yer tell all the boys to meet heah sunday arter nex on matters of great portance said nick as the friends separated

on the sunday afternoon long before the appointed time the good citizens of the county began to gather at the home of nick lashum the first to arrive was si weedles clad in his best which consisted of a large hat a large pair of boots a large pair of pants which were suspiciously like a pair that sheriff lashum used to pride himself upon owning a hickory shirt and a large corncob pipe attired in this outfit the alabama statesman appeared early because his selfimposed duties as handy man exofficio at all political meetings were well understood by himself soon the big barn loft an ideal place for an alabama political council was well filled there were great men galoreâjudges and former judges clerks of courts and former clerks of courts sheriffs and former sheriffs justices of the peace and former justices of the peace road commissioners school commissioners lawyers doctors school teachers and plain country gentlemenâall come to see the lights of the alabama democracy flash flutter glimmer sputter and finally become extinguished

the hour soon arrived for business to be proceeded with

without the formality of the election of a chairman nick lashum by virtue of the meeting being held neath his vine and fig tree  and by virtue also of his acknowledged superior ability took upon himself the right to conduct the meeting

he said gents we is hyre on a mos momentous occasion

dese hyre big bugs is not satis by the way things is bein run in this hyre county if i war not satis i would move outen the county i dont give a doggon fer any of them

they is stuck up and has been always

right right came from the crowd

now they is goin to try to beat cas lashum fer sheriff

and who is they goin to run agin him leetle joe wheatley is he one of us

no no responded the hearers

wal we is got to git tgether an beat the whole darn bunch i tell yer fellers that if them people ever gits us onct yer will be jus lek yer war fore de war i knows what ise talkin bout i war hyre on the spot at that there time you boys that has been to school offen yer po pappys labor may snikker an grin kase yer aint got no more sense now gents this whole thing is up to yo ll

after a few moments silence a young man by the name of goodrich called out mr chairman i move that we do now proceed to the election of officers silence i therefore place in nomination for chairman the honorable judge

no yer dont do no sich a darn thing said nick ise the cheerman of this hyre meetin an nickolas lashum junior is the sctay aint that right fellers

sho yer is spoke up si weedles an anybody thet dont lek them officers we puts out we dont pose ter have this hyre meetin  sturbed by nobody

mr goodrich relapsed into a discreet silence but remarked to his companion that hed be dâ if he would vote for such people the chairman announced that the coming election was for sheriff county judge and one road and school commissioner each whom would they nominate to run for these offices the allimportant matter to nick and his friends was the office of sheriff to bring about caspers nomination was their determination

si weedles was on his feet at once

mr cheerman i rases to my feet fer the puppus of puttin in nomination fer sheriff that battledscarred hero that patriotic citizen an farmer that alabamy gent an fiancier that stock raiser an father that man of the world an the church him no other than the man that carried the bloodstained banner of alabama mocraey down to victory him no other than the man that has always kept nuff niggers in the chain gang to woric the roads so no white men dont have no woric to do on the roads him no other than the one that knows how to keep niggers in they places him no other than the man thet aint heppen no niggers gin white men him no other than the wise an provident casper lahsum

after this flash of eloquence the yell so well known peculiar to the savages of the west and the crackers of the south was given with such good will that the barn seemed to vibrate with its volume not a voice raised in opposition to this nomination nick declared as soon as he could be heard that the unanimous voice of the caucus was casper lashum the holdover officers judge and commissioners were renominated nick then adjourned the meeting sine die

just twentythree minutes had elapsed since the meeting was called to order the county bulletin the official organ of the county had the following announcement at a convention attended by hundreds of delegates selfappointed from all parts of the county held in the large hall on mr nick lashums place the following persons were named as candidates for the offices of sheriff judge road and school commissioners casper lashum sheriff

josephus wiggles judge

william runeasy road commissioner

jackson contention school commissioner

young goodrich and his friends engaged in a very warm discussion as they drove away from the lashum place declaring they would do all in their power to defeat casper lashum for sheriff

young goodrich and his friends true to their determination set about to defeat casper lashum for sheriff knowing well the strength of the lashum following they were compelled to resort to strategy first they made a canvass of all the better class of people in the county and obtained their promises to vote for little joe wheatley when the time came but in the canvass up to the last day they were to appear to be staunch followers of the lashums judge wiggles and his supporters who had long wished for an opportunity to throw off the lashum yoke also promised to come out at the proper time and advocate the election of wheatley so well was this game of politics played so complete was goodrichs organization that the lashums did not suspect that the enthusiasm on the part of the big bugs meant defeat for their kinsman

the evening before the election the county bulletin came out with a burning editorial denunciatory of the lashum regime denouncing their methods and charging that for years they had been corrupt in office so sudden and complete was the attack coming from so many unlookedfor sources that lashum and his followers were at a loss to know how to combat the new issue nick lashum casper lashum si weedles and a few others among them the smalys and wardemans met at nick lashums down by the pig sty nicks favorite corner and engaged in a lively discussion

the smalys were in favor of going immediately to the office of the county bulletin get the nigger who carried the copies of the paper about the county to the subscribers and hang him as he was responsible for the paper being in the hands of all the white people in the county who could read

after a very lengthy argument it was finally decided that should the lashums lose the nigger the driver of the wagon owned by the publishers of the county bulletin should be taught a lessonâshould be taught not to distribute papers unfavorable to lashum and his followers the ownership of the paper of the horse and wagon and of the paper route never entered into their thoughts the nigger was responsible wholly and entirely they vowed to run him out of the county

when the votes were counted the following day it was found that casper lashum had been defeated by  votes while his associates on the ticket had been elected without a dissenting vote

si weedles reported that great fraud had been practiced inasmuch as a report had been put in circulation by goodrich that the lashums were trying to steal the county court house and that nick lashum had a deed already drawn which he would put on file as soon as his brother was reelectedâall of which the crackers believed and acted upon

little joe wheatleys election to the office of sheriff gave the negroes great satisfaction it forecasted for them a possible chance of a square deal

they were not disappointed

as we turn our attention again to the boys at oberlin we find the school year has come to a close buck and bloxum barely passed their examinations and were severely lectured by the dean though they were permitted to go on with their classes malcolm and abe made good marks and were congratulated by the dean each bore a letter from the dean to his father commending him and urging his return the next school year their homecoming was made a time for rejoicing each person on the place vied with the other in his endeavor to make them welcome

the parents of the two boys were greatly elated over the record made by their respective sons the vacation time passed very quickly and the boys could hardly realize it was over when told to get ready to return to school malcolm and miss donewell had become great friends and he had promised to return a few days before the school term began in order that he might spend some time with her in pleasureseeking

when the time for homegoing drew near buck lashum extended invitations to several young men whose acquaintance he had made while at the college to be his guests for a week at his fathers plantation bloxum was the first to accept but his railroad tickets were not forthcoming and they were stumbling blocks which he set about to remove he knew that his parents could not spare the money to cover the expense of this trip nor would they permit him to go south with buck if they had to make a further sacrifice than they were making in sending him to college

he had however another reason for wanting to go he was aware that he would have to work if he went home for the summer vacation and he therefore determined that buck should bear this expense for the trip and also that he would stay the whole vacation through buck and bloxum had formed the habit of going to elmyra to spend saturday night and sunday in recreation on a return trip after one of these carousals when buck was feeling exceptionally good bloxum opened the subject by remarking buck i am compelled to ask you to withdraw your invitation to me to take that trip down to your plantation

no yer dont whats the matter with yer havent yer passed yer word that yer would come havent yer learned yet that a gentleman never goes back on his words didnt i write pappy that yer particular was coming now what yer goin to back out fer

this was just the position bloxum wanted buck to take

of course i know all these things that is just the reason i am telling you now i am so sorry i wanted above all things to meet your sister clemmie i know she must be a stunning girlâand little arabellaâoh well i guess i must forego all these pleasures

all this was said solemnly with a view of impressing buck

why bloxum what is the matter with yer hope nobody aint daid

no nobodys dead but the fact of the matter is we have been burned out that is our barn and farm implements have been burned father says in his letter  come home and go to work 

then bloxum soliloquized just to think of it two months restâclemmie and arabellaâand nothing to doâwith niggers to wait on me

now two months workâwork from morning till nightâall because i lack a few paltry dollars father says he cannot possibly send me one cent but to come home and go to work

then he added why are you grinning can you see anything funny in that i will not see clemmie nor arabella for another year

i am not laffin at yer said buck i am pleased to know that is all why i can fix any moneys all right

what you take me fer think i am a nigger going to let you buy my tickers and

yer shut up aint yer my guest how yer get down there is not yer business im responsible fer yer til nex year so that ends it yer write yer pappy and tell him that yer is in the hands of mr buck lashum of acounty alabamy

buck you must be a great man down in your county

when you get through college the people of a county will see that you go to congress from your district i tell you buck you are a wonder

yer can bet i am going to run things when i git out o college said buck

yes when i come down their electioneering for you then you can pay my expenses and you can then present me to clemmie and arabella

bloxum i tell yer i dont want no more fool talk yer goes with me as my guest pappy say fer me to bring yer

i will write yer mammy and tell her that i will look after her little boy and buck laughed at his own cleverness

when bloxum left buck he laughed long and heartily to himself at his success in obtaining bucks promise to take him south as his guest

well that fellow is easy sure enough but that gives me an idea if i can handle him so easy what may i not do with the whole bunch of meadow hogs in a year or two what in the world does clemmie look like wonder how she dresses

old man lashum must have lots of money bet your life i will find out this summer

such thoughts ran through bloxums mind until he finally fell asleep buck being of the same state of mind congratulated himself upon the clever way he had induced bloxum to accept his hospitality

bloxum is too darn sensitive but i must take him down there or pappy will say that i lied when i wrote that i was the leader of all the southern boys in the college i dont know about that tennessee fellow he is so darn proper and stuck up he may refuse anyway i can get four or five to go that will prove what i wrote pappy

buck was much concerned lest the young man from tennessee and a few others who belonged to old aristocratic families should refuse his invitation as he had written home giving the names of the young men whom his father might expect as his sons guests for one week

well de vaux said the tennesseean to his louisiana friend i hear that you propose to visit that lashum fellow at his home this summer for one week

not guilty said de vaux what do you take me for

how long since i commenced to take these crackers on terms of  social equality  i am under obligations to you since i got the invitation through your friendship for him

oh of course i am responsible for all your ills did i also make you acquainted with miss donewell did i also cause overley to cut you out laughed de vauxs friend

but seriously de vaux you had the lead until overley and forbes pulled her out of black river then your colors fell

why did you surrender so quickly

why because the young lady seemed to want somebody else my pride would not permit me to wait until i was snubbed answered de vaux then added what do you intend to do about your invitation to visit lashum

visit lashum why i never took the proposition seriously i have no intentions of accepting an invitation of any kind from him who is going to accept

bloxum i guess answered de vaux he has the one chance left he was saying to me that he thought new orleans a most beautiful city when i asked him if he had ever visited that city he answered by saying that he had not but would as soon as he got acquainted with some native of the soil i did not continue the conversation further you can bet he will go with lashum

their talk drifted into other channels and bloxum and buck were forgotten

the time soon rolled around for the boys to leave for their respective homes bloxum had finally agreed to let buck do the honors for the summer and they left the college together

when they reached their destination they were met by mr

and mrs nick lashum sr clemmie and arabella bloxum was not prepared for the sight that met his gaze nick lashum sr with his large boots and small legs mrs nick lashum sr with her plaid shawl and blue skirt clemmieâ the divine creatureâwith her bangs and curls topped by a picture hat of flowers ribbons and velvet a yellow gown trimmed in brown a costume calculated to cause all the girls of her class in acounty to envy her

he could not get his eyes off this vision was this the girl upon whom he had set his mind through bucks description of her if he had had the means he would have gone back home by the next train bloxum although of a very small nature was bright and intellectual and had had the benefit of excellent home training he was shocked at the sight that presented itself to him but when clemmie came down to breakfast next morning in evening dress with rings on all four fingers bloxum was astounded

arabella strange as it may seem was by nature a very handsome child and seemed to know instinctively what she looked well in and she did look very attractive in a plain white frock nick sr was disappointed because buck did not bring with him all the friends he had led his father to expect buck explained that the boys had been ordered to come home from college and they were to visit him on their way back in the fall

bloxum spent most of his time sleeping when not riding about the country with arabella and while thoroughly disappointed and disgusted with his surroundings and the conditions amidst which he found himself in alabama conditions so totally different from anything he had ever before seen or heard of he yet found much to amuse and interest him bloxum frankly confessed to himself that he enjoyed the company of arabella a creature so entirely different from the rest of that strange brood

as the time for them to return to college drew near the elder lashum began to question buck about his school friends

buck was sure they would arrive on schedule time pretending to receive letters to that effect at the last moment buck received a telegram requesting him to join the class in cleveland ohio at a class reunion this appeared to satisfy the senior lashum and he therefore sent buck and bloxum north a week earlier than the time set for their departure buck and his friend made good use of this time in cleveland and other places

a few days before the time set for the college boys to resume their studies a discussion was precipitated by buck and bloxum in which feeling ran very high

these boys not having anything in particular to occupy their minds soon began to look about for amusement in the mess hall there were six or eight boys who waited table to help pay their expenses at college among them were two negroes one a green southern boy with all the fears grounded in him that characterize a great many negro boys from the south

the other boy was a westerner who knew nothing of the environment in which his colaborer had formerly lived buck had time and again addressed the southern boy as nigger

and assumed that the other boy could be so addressed in this he made a mistake and his mistake cost him one of the worst beatings he had ever received and this one was particularly humiliating because it came from a despised negro

he tried to forget what happened to him at the hands of this boy but was unable to do so nor would his fellow students allow him to forget this encounter led to a discussion of races that brought out the views of nearly every boy in the college

bloxum led off in a wordy defense of buck

i tell you fellers that i am going to take this case to the dean that fellowâhe was careful to say fellowâhit buck for no reason whatever and hit him when he was not looking

he should be expelled

no he didnt hit your friend when he was not looking

said the long yankee boy i saw the whole mill your friend was given time to withdraw the insult but would not

he got all that was coming to him i say no advantage was taken of him

i tell you there was bloxum answered and i can prove it you are a nice white man taking up for these people all the time

i take up for whom i please and dont you question me about my actions you saw as i saw that those men were facing each other when your friend was slapped the idea

let anybody slap him and never hit back thats southern blood for you

well southern people feel that it is beneath them to have personal encounters with negroes spoke up de vaux

that is a peculiar kind of reasoningâpeculiar to southern people beneath their dignity to fight singlehanded with a 

negro but not beneath their dignity to insult and illtreat him and even take his life when in a company of three and four or even in a mob of a hundred answered the yankee boy then turning to the tennessee boy he said say my friend can you explain that side of the southern blood to me

no i cannot was the answer but i want you to understand that the picture you draw is not a true one of all the people in the south further i want you to understand that buck lashum and bloxum do not represent me my family nor my friends we feel that it is as much beneath us to insult a negro as it is to fight with him

well i guess buck was moved by your high ideals when he permitted his face to be slapped by a negro replied the long yankee boy at any rate he failed to hit back

i have never been able to understand why you southern boys particularly of a certain class are always and continually harping on the negro said forbes men like you  de vaux and your friend from tennessee talk of your mam j mies and your aunties overley over there speaks of his negro friend as his chum lashum and bloxum always speak j of negroes as  dâ niggers wherein does the difference lie is it in these negroes or is it in your people

well so far as i am concerned said the tennesseean these things dont worry me nor do they worry my family or friends we work on the principle that a negro has the same right to live and enjoy life that any other man has we hire him and pay him for his labor he goes about his business we go about ours when he is trying to do right and we know he is an honest man and he asks our aid we give it

we always aid a worthy negro when we see that he is being imposed upon we call a halt no indeed my friend you dont understand the nature of this race of people continued the tennessee boy they are simple and they are not simple simply because they will trust your word implicitly do thousands of dollars worth of business with your taking your word for it but remembering every little detail in the transaction for years back we never break our word given with them this is the reason that all men of my class in the south have no grievance against the negro he understands us and we understand him

lashum and bloxum can speak for themselves

my pappy says niggers aint got no right to live said lashum let alone own plantations and stock

why asked a dozen boys at once

because they are niggers  was the answer

what makes them niggers asked an english boy

why their inferior blood of course was bucks answer

well that may be from your point of view you are white your blood is superior thomas l jones who graduated from this college last year and who was rated third in his class was called a nigger he was whiter than you are

what made him a nigger

why his mothers blood of course buck answered

his mothers blood asked the english boy why she was a quadroon as white as you are and his father was a caucasian do you mean to tell me that the sixteen drops of your superior blood will be overcome by his one drop of inferior blood impossible your position is ridiculous

you are governed by a blind prejudice get rid of it

shortly after this discussion among the boys concerning the status of the niggers malcolm and abe after discussing the merits and demerits of the arguments of the various students who engaged in this animated discussion of the race question continued abe said malcolm suddenly you have not lived up to your agreement with me

i have not why malcolm what can you mean

well last year and since we have been back you have steadfastly refused to go with me to miss donewells home offering one excuse and then another now i want to know what is the trouble has miss donewell or her father intimated to you that you are not welcome

oh no  exclaimed abe on the contrary they both have asked me repeatedly to call on them at their home i have always refused why you ask me malcolm do you think i do not know that we belong to two separate and distinct races and that the sentiment in the section from which we come is hostile to the free intermingling of the races i of course know that you do not consider the color of my skin but there are others who do you know that i do not visit your female friends down at your old home why should i do so here buck lashum and his crowd have said more than once that you invite me to the homes of white women you can resent it for it is not true

now as to my reason malcolm i know that i have no better friends nor will i ever have better friends than you and your father i believe that unless something unforeseen intervenes you and miss donewell will some day become man and wife and reside on the old plantation i know the harm that will be done her should the report precede her to her future home that she took me on social equality i therefore ask you to let me have my own way in this matter you know that i have always insisted that no good could possibly come by the mingling of the races socially no malcolm no good can possibly come from my accepting these invitations

yes abe that is true enough but you are my friend and i insist on your receiving the same consideration from my friends that i receive

true you have so insisted but can you recall any instance when you have received an invitation and i have not well at any rate it is left to me to accept or refuse i beg of you not to press me further i say that i do not feel and will never feel that you have deserted me you would feel out of place in the homes where i visit i would feel out of place in the homes that you visit i trust you now understand me said abe

i understand what you say your reason may be a good one but if i see fit to take you with me who has the right to dispute my right to choose a companion father told me that i was to see that you were accorded the same treatment that i receive and

yes yes malcolm but he never meant that you were to take me into the same society with you he meant school privileges i am perfectly satisfied with the young ladies whom i visit

well abe let that pass where did you get the idea that i would some day marry miss donewell she has never said that she would marry me

she will if you are the man i take you to be malcolm if you do not win herâwell our friendship will end she is certainly the finest woman save one that i have ever met

hello abe have you a girl you sly dog you never told me about her who is she you are a nice one i have been telling you of my hopes and fears and you have been hiding your lady from me i do not think you have been treating me square

i have no idea in the world malcolm that the young lady whom i admire ever thinks of me other than as an acquaintance we have never had a serious talk in our lives miss watson is her name the young lady who led her class last year but for the color of their skins you would think she and miss donewell were sisters

oh yes i have seen her at miss donewells house she has avoided me on more than one occasion i think you must have put her up to it

we have similar ideas along certain lines malcolm but i am sure she never intended to offend you she simply feels as i do that no good can possibly come by the mingling of the races socially

abe i guess you are right after all at any rate we now understand each other better good night old fellow from the bottom of my heart i wish you all the suceees in the world said malcolm as he left abe and commenced to prepare himself for a visit to mr donewells home

when abe was left to himself he sat for a long time thinking of what malcolm had said

i wonder abe asked himself whether he will ever change toward me i do not believe he will i feel that no matter what befalls me malcolm will still be my friend

abe is a curious fellow thought malcolm i could not induce him to change his mind well since i have thought the matter over i cannot see why i insisted on his visiting these young ladies mabel is all right but the rest i think abe would stand by me against a regiment of cavalry hes true blue

malcolm was soon on his way to miss donewells home he had been invited to meet some young ladies who were visiting miss donewell and whose home was in new york

abe had also received an invitation but as we have seen had refused to accept

upon malcolms arrival he was asked by the ladies why he had not brought his friend he made an excuse for abe by saying a previous engagement or something to that effect had kept him away the visiting ladies had heard so much of abe through miss donewell and malcolm that they were curious to see and learn something more about him they were very much disappointed that he did not accept the invitation malcolm was asked by miss donewell if he could not suggest some way by which abe could be induced to visit her guests as they were very anxious to meet him after some thought malcolm suggested that miss watson be invited and that she be requested to bring abe with her explaining that the visiting ladies and no one else be present that the ladies wanted to hear miss watson and abe in their famous duet the two having won the reputation of being very fine singers one of the visiting ladies was an exceptionally fine pianiste and a delightful musical evening was promised next morning abe reecived a note from miss watson inviting him to accompany her to miss donewells home that evening to meet some ladies of the musical world abe was very fond of music and as miss watson was to be there the two inducements decided him to accept this was the first note abe had ever received from miss watson so he hid it away in his pocketbook little thinking the service it would be to him a few weeks later

at the appointed time miss watson and abe arrived at the donewell home where they found the ladies waiting after several choice selections vocal and instrumental tea was served some time was spent in a very spirited conversation after which miss watson and abe left to join some friends at the home of miss watsons friend miss glenn

mabel exclaimed her friends all speaking at once

my but he is black hes your

mabel his voice is grand and his manners are

mabel where was he educated he acts like he is white his table manners are

mabel i never saw one so black why his skin is just

how unfortunate that he is black said mabel laughingly else what a scramble you four girls would make for him i agree with you girls he is all you say and more he is a young man of exceptional habits now miss scott i hope you are satisfied you have had a birthday treat added mabel

yes said miss scott i do not remember ever spending a more enjoyable anniversary i hope to always remember the two hours  to  p m november  â

it is well for abe as we shall see later that miss scott made mention of this date and these hours as they were thereby impressed upon the minds of the other young ladies

after malcolm left abe sat musing for some moments after which he walked into malcolms room and took up a queerlooking meerschaum pipe filled it and began to smoke soon he remarked to himself that he wanted to see forbes and left his room taking the pipe with him not being permitted to smoke in the halls he pushed the stem of the pipe up his sleeve holding the bowl in his hand close to his body with the pipe in this position apparently hiding it abe met buck bloxum and several other boys of that set

what you recon he is hidin that pipe fer said buck as abe passed him

likely as not he is carrying it down the hall to sell it to forbes remarked bloxum

you fellows can always see something wrong in everything that overley does why not tell him what you have just told us said sam bueker

just like you taking up fer niggers i remember when we went to see dr finley bout niggers eatin with us you was the first one to back out and have been leaning niggerward ever since said buck

no i am not leaning niggerward nor am i taking up for niggers  i think you two ought to be more manly either to say these things to overley or leave them unsaid but you and bloxum do not seem to understand the position that gentlemen should take in such matters if you despise overley as you claim the dignified gentleman would ignore him

bucker you aint a thing said buckaint we white

whose got nothin to do with us when it comes to these niggers

well said a boy from north carolina the whole fetched crowd is bad but buck and bloxum do worry too much about them weve got nothing to do with thatair pipe come on lets have a game do something that gentlemen can find some amusement in

these young men then passed into bucks room where they were soon busily engaged in a game of poker

while abe was at the home of miss donewell malcolm missed his pipe the meerschaum pipe spoken of in a previous chapter he searched his own room and abes but could not find it

upon abes return he found malcolm brooding over his loss

malcolm what is the matter you look as if you have lost your best friend cheer up i have a message for you from miss donewell she invites you to call tomorrow evening at  p m as her visitors have received an unexpected summons to return to their homes they will take the midnight train they also expect you to see them off miss donewell says she is going with them you will have four full hours with her malcolm and this is your chance or else she wouldnt have sent for you i wish you every success

abe after the way you treated me in your affair i think you have nerve and plenty to expect me to talk to you about my ease but you seem so fatherly i will say that i do intend to avail myself of the first opportunity that presents to learn my fate after a moment or two malcolm added we have met with a very serious loss abe if you do not know where our pipe is i have looked all over the place for it do you know where it is

let me see said abe i think i saw it just before i went out last night

well it is not here now said malcolm and the gloomy look which abe noticed when he entered the room again settled upon his face

what will i say to father if we dont find it he values that pipe very highly because his greatgrandfather smoked it

that pipe was never off the old place before and now it is lost

while malcolm was talking abe had been searching the room he looked in every place in which the pipe could possibly be but to no purpose it was gone

malcolm i cannot find it think have you left it in any boys room let us ask forbes and the rest of the boys

they then proceeded to forbess room but forbes had not seen the pipe nor had any of the rest of the boys

what shall i do asked malcolm this pipe is a family heirloom my father will never forgive me for losing it

report the loss to the dean at once said rattles maybe he can suggest some way by which it can be recovered

they went immediately to the dean and explained the loss and its seriousness the dean promised to investigate the matter at once he first ho avever reported to dr finley that the pipe was lost under circumstances that looked as if it were stolen they then ordered all the boys on that floor before them dr finley had a short hearttoheart talk with them suggesting that he would consider it a personal favor if the boy who knew the whereabouts of the pipe would see that it was returned he did not ask nor did he desire the students to inform upon one another he also intimated that he thought the boys on the same fioor with malcolm and abe knew all about the pipe thereby practically exonerating the rest of the school this brought buck and bloxum together about a week later

buck now weve got him said bloxum let us go to the dean and tell him that we are on his floor and do not feel content to live under the suspicion that has been cast upon us simply because we are on this floor that we saw abe with the pipe all the fellows who were with us in the hall will remember how he had the pipe up his coat sleeve i tell you weve got him this time

dâ his black hide i hope we is come on lets go to the dean  said buck

the two then proceeded to the deans office and stated to him that on account of being on the same floor with the overleys they were very much humiliated because of the suspicion cast upon them by the loss of overleys pipe they very much disliked to say anything that would reflect upon any student but they saw abe overley with the pipe half up his coat sleeve going into forbess room on the night of november th were confident that it was november th they gave the names of several other students who saw him together with the part of the conversation that followed after bucks remark about abe taking the pipe to forbes

these young men were so embarrassed that they could not tell the story at once and it was only by dint of close questioning that the dean could get a clear idea of what they had seen

he reported the facts to dr finley who immediately sent for the boys whose names were given as witnesses after questioning them very closely the doctor concluded to send for abe when abe put in his appearance the doctor repeated to him what he had heard and asked what he had to say for himself

doctor said abe i was not in the hall the night in question between the hours of  and  p m i was at the home of abe stopped short and looked the doctor full in the face and said i cannot tell you at whose home i was that night without the permission of that person

mr overley said the doctor do you realize the position in which you place yourself and the chain of suspicion that encircles you consider well before you decide not to make a complete statement of your whereabouts the night this pipe was missed

doctor i know only too well the danger in which i find myself i know the natures of the persons who have come to you with this story i know the animus behind the whole affair but doctor for all that i cannot say where i was that night it must come from the other person

does your friend overley know your whereabouts asked the doctor

yes sir he does said abe

will you say to him that i desire his presence at once i do not wish you to say one word to him about what has passed between us said the doctor as he arose and extended his hand silently to abe

what does he want abe asked malcolm when the request was delivered

he said to me i do not wish you to say one word to him meaning you about what has passed between us so you see where i am at you must face the lion unprepared said abe laughingly

well i will soon know answered malcolm as he prepared to leave for the doctors office after abes departure the doctor turned to the dean and remarked these boys are the two strongest characters in the school they are friends this white boy feels the loss of his pipe very keenly

now we will see what he will say when he learns what these other boys have said about his friend

upon malcolms arrival the doctor told him what he had heard the number of witnesses who saw abe with the pipe and finally abes refusal to say where he was the night the pipe was lost

now mr overley your friend says you know where he was that night will you tell us

no sir if he refused to say where he was i of course cannot betray his confidence answered malcolm simply

well said the doctor as he handed malcolm an official note take this to him it is a notice of suspension pending further investigation i am very sorry that this course must be pursued

do you mean doctor that you believe upon the statement of this bunch of

be careful mr overley i have expressed no belief in this matter i am simply pursuing the course that is usual in matters of this kind the doctor answered very quickly

i will never believe abe stole that pipe nor will he steal

said malcolm as he left the doctors office

he hastened to abe with dr finleys note which follows oberlin ohio november  â

mr abraham overley dear sir this is to notify you that you are suspended from further participation in the college exercises or lectures until further notice

finley president

what have i done malcolm to warrant this asked abe when he had recovered from the surprise caused by his suspension

you have refused to tell doctor finley where you were on the night the pipe was lost why abe you have not even told me where you were that night

have not told you exclaimed abe can it be possible that you of all persons on this earth doubt me too why should i tell you that which you already know

malcolm with his hands deep in his pockets stood looking at abe in amazement

abe do i understand you to say that i knew of your whereabouts upon the night this pipe was stolen how can you say

my god malcolm you too doubt me as abe asked this question he laid his hand on malcolms shoulder and looked him in the face hoping to find there the old look of trust and confidence malcolm turned his face away abes hand dropped to his side his whole attitude changed to one of despair he seemed to age perceptibly abe moved toward the door then turned to malcolm with a look which malcolm never forgot and simply said and yon too malcolm

malcolm met his gaze with a heart full of doubts and fears but answered abe calmly saying abe you did not tell me where you were nor do i know

my god exclaimed abe he too believes me to be a thief  abe passed into his room and cast himself upon his bed where he remained for the rest of the night and the following day the morning of the second day as abe had not put in his appearance malcolm became uneasy about him still abe had not told where he was the night the pipe was stolen

malcolm therefore went to forbes and rattles for advice

say forbes said malcolm what shall we do with abe

he has not left his room for two days he does nothing but moan all the time

let us go and see him said rattles

when these young men entered abes room they found him lying across his bed where he had been since his talk with malcolm rattles went to him and lifted his head from the bed bringing his face into the light at the sight of which haggard and careworn malcolm and forbes drew back astounded

abe said rattles kindly what can i do for you

come old man brace up you are killing yourself about nothing this thing will blow over in a day or two

abe raised his eyes to malcolms face and kept them there in a long bewildered stare malcolm could not endure the gaze and moved away to his own room followed by forbes

malcolm said forbes what is the trouble between you and abe malcolm hesitated but forbes urged him to tell what had come between them

well the truth is said malcolm while i will never believe that abe stole that pipe nor will he steal he would not tell dr finley where he was the night of the th nor would he tell me why not me then he said i knew but i do not he told dr finley that i knew when he must have known that i did not what has come over abe that he has so far forgotten himself as to lie

are you sure of what you say asked forbes i am loath to believe that abe will lie

at that moment rattles came into the room with abes pocketbook in his hand and walked to the window remarking that abe said there was a prescription in it which he wanted filled rattles searched the book and pulled forth the note miss watson sent abe asking him to accompany her to miss donewells it follows oberlin ohio november â

 a m

mr abraham overley dear sir will you kindly call for me this afternoon at  to accompany me to a musicale at miss donewells home

we will meet some musical people there from new york city

sincerely yours nancy watson

as rattles began to readoberlin ohio november  â  a m malcolm exclaimed what is that november  â let me see it rattles and he grasped the note as malcolm read his color changed his hand trembled for a moment he seemed to be deprived of the power of speech he staggered to a chair and sank upon it still holding the note before him at which he gazed in blank amazement

why overley said forbes what on earth ails you

has that note deprived you of your senses let me see this scroll from the magii

forbes read the note as did rattles but neither of them seemed to understand the situation forbes again asked malcolm for an explanation

do you not see that date asked malcolm november th is the date upon which i lost that pipe abe was at miss done wells home with miss watson and to make matters worse i knew he was there what a thoughtless thing i have done to let abe suffer for two days without attempting to console him then i have written to my father and explained the whole affair to him as i thought what an injustice i have done abe how i could have forgotten that he was at miss donewells when i told them how to get him there is more than i can understand he ought never to forgive me i will see him at once

malcolm went immediately to abe who was seated on a chair where rattles left him staring into space malcolm extended his hand to him saying abe can you ever forgive me for the pain i have caused you i understand now what you meant by asking why you should tell me that which i already knew my friend i am ashamed to say so but i forgot all about that engagement of yours with miss watson at miss done wells abe i ask you a thousand pardons

abe looked up at malcolm in a half conscious way apparently not fully understanding all that had been said to him he took malcolms hand however in both of his own and said malcolm did you think i stole that pipe

why no abe said malcolm no such idea crossed my mind i thought you were not living up to your promise made to me when we first came here that we would have no secrets from each other abe i shall go immediately to doctor finley and explain this wretched affair

no malcolm do not do that i do not want it done this explanation must come from them i must insist my friends that each of you promise me that you will not say one word of this to a living soul

i am sure i do not see the force of your request said rattles but i will respect your wish

abe we want to consult on your case said forbes malcolm and rattles as they went out of the room malcolm you are the only person who has the key to this situation

what does abe mean by not wanting you nor either of us to say where he was that night  i do not believe that either of you has ever heard abe express himself about visiting white women said malcolm nor do you know that he has never before november  visited miss donewell well such is the fact he has always contended that no good could possibly come by the commingling of the races socially now through miss watson he accepted an invitation to meet some ladies at miss donewells home and while there this pipe was stolen abe absolutely refuses to say where he was that night nor will he permit us to say he is already suspended and will suffer himself to be expelled before he will divulge his whereabouts the night in question what can we do about it

i hardly know  said forbes we must certainly respect his wishes but must we permit him to sacrifice himself upon the altar of his high ideal which seems to me a bit overdrawn

what can we do asked rattles it is abes affair

we have no right to butt in say i admire his grit he is suspended now and is prepared to be expelled rather than say that he was at a white womans home many a negro would be crowing about it

when i questioned abe about not accepting invitations to these various places he answered that his female associates suited him said malcolm he even said that you could not tell the difference between miss donewell and miss watson but for the color of their skins i tell you fellows he has ideas of his own

as we have no right to divulge abes secret remarked forbes let us advise him to see doctor finley himself

abe said forbes we are your friends and want to advise you overley has just explained this whole affair to us we think you are wrong miss donewell and her father have invited you to their home so have i invited you to mine

do you think that they or that i would object to your saying that you accepted the invitations abe you are drawing it too fine

forbes i appreciate your good intentions answered abe but you do not understand you cannot understand the position in which i am you

why cant i understand asked forbes

because you are not a negro abe replied solemly

this remark of abes stopped all conversation for several moments the silence was broken by abes remarking fellows i am in for it i can but let matters take their course

well you can take a little exercise at any rate said rattles and he suggested a turn around the campus as abe and his three friends neared the upper end of the campus they came upon a group of boys which included de vaux and his friend from tennessee together with bucker and bloxum

de vaux was the first to note abes approach

why fellows there is abe overley he remarked look at him i dont believe he would steal anything

nor do i said the tennesseean turning to abe he extended his hand very cordially saying overley i hear that you are in troubleâthat you are suspendedâthat you are practically accused of stealing a pipe from your friend malcolm all these things coming through statements of persons not above small things i want to say to you that i do not believe that you are guilty in any sense of the word if there is anything i can do for you command me i am at your service

overley said de vaux after the general handshaking which was joined by all except bloxnm who slunk away as soon as the boys began to gather about abe when this thing is cleared up and you are exonerated as i know you will be you must do some lambasting

dâ if i wouldnt commence now said the yankee boy if i were you those fellows need a good thrashing i tell you abe overley i can count on my fingers all the boys in this college who believe you guilty whenever i think of this trick i feel like thrashing somebody

as bloxum turned to leave the crowd bueker called to him saying earnestly dont leave bloxum dont you hear what these fellows are saying bloxum apparently did not hear what his friend bucker said as he kept on going straight to bucks room

say buck he said dont you know those fellows down on the campus are making a fool of abe overley telling him that they know he is not guilty and that a nigger wont steal well you should have heard them

bloxum i dont give a doggon fer the whole bunch said buck i am going to elmyra come on and go

bloxum did not need a second invitation they were soon on the way

abe appeared to feel much relieved after being assured by his friends and acquaintances that he had not lost their confidence and still retained their respect these young men went back to malcolms room where a free and frank exchange of thought was had goodfellowship soon held sway once more

after the conversation between malcolm and abe which resulted in the latters prostration and seclusion for two days malcolm felt it his duty to inform his father as to what had taken place he therefore wrote to him as follows oberlin ohio november th

dear father i can imagine how you and uncle abe will feel when this letter reaches you both but i feel it my duty to write the whole circumstances that you may form your own opinion

the meerschaum pipe that i brought from home is the cause of all this trouble on the night of november th last i missed the pipe from my room i reported the loss of the pipe to the dean he in turn reported the loss to dr finley who called all the boys on our floor together stating to them that he thought some of the boys on our floor knew where the pipe was he asked that it be brought back later buck lashum and squealer bloxum went to the dean and told him that they together with several other boys saw abe with the pipe half up his sleeve going through the hall to will forbess room the dean reported to the doctor who sent for the boys and they all agreed that they saw abe as buck and bloxum stated

the doctor then sent for abe who denied being in the hall at the time they claimed to have seen him when asked where he was he absolutely refused to say

he said further that i knew where he was but i do not

as a result abe is suspended and at this time is in his room where he has been for two days

i do not know what to do with him i do not believe that abe knows anything about the pipe but why does he not tell where he was and why did he say that i knew where he was when i did not

father what must i do tell uncle abe to write to him and command him to say where he was he will obey his father

these are the circumstances i hope this will not worry you but i feel it my duty to let you both know exactly what has happened

give my love to the people i am well but worried

yours m a o jr

after malcolm a overley sr had read and reread this letter in old abes hearing he said abe what the hâ do you think of that just to think of it abe suspended under suspicion of having stolen my pipe that he has been playing with all his life such dâ rot that shows what little sense these dâ professors have

that boy steal why i should as soon believe that my abe would steal but why dont he tell where he was that night

abe dâ your black hide have you nothing to say are you going to let them make a thief of that boy buck lashum

he saw abe hiding that pipe hâ and damnation man are you asleep or are you dumb or are you such a fool that you dont care what happens to that boy of yours dâ if i dont believe you are glad he is in trouble sit there now looking like that dâ old kicking mule of yours cant you talk

yes sar ob cose i kin talk said old abe but yuse been talkin an cussin for morn half hour how kin i talk

how i goin  to git a word in nohow my po  boy he am in all dis heah trouble bout dat pipe i vouch buck lashum stole dat pipe yes sar de lawds will mus be done

yes the lords will must be done saddle it on the lord

thats the plea of every nigger i ever heard of after he has been caught doing wrong the lords will according to that doctrine the lord wills that you niggers do wrong it is too foolish for discussion what are you going to do about that boy of yours

i does not know i does know dat my abe wont steal but why he not say whar he war i does not know dat boy he sho got a good scuse fo not sayin whar he at dat night

all i say is dis lawd dy will be done 

well i be dâ is that all you have to say

both of these fathers then relapsed into silence one to brood over the prospect of a disgrace to his name the other to pray silently to almighty god that his son may come out of this entanglement with his name untarnished

thus we leave them to their own thoughts

when it became known throughout the college that abe overley had been suspended supposedly for the larceny of his friends meerschaum pipe upon the statement of buck lashum and bloxum feeling ran very high

the oberlin college bulletin contained the following editorial comment it is with regret we announce the suspension of mr abraham overley for the supposed larceny of a pipe belonging to his friend and classmate mr malcolm a overley both of these young men residents of the state of alabama

it appears that mr malcolm overley was the owner of a very old and valuable meerschaum pipe this pipe was stolen the night of november th

it appears further that mr buck lashum and mr

squealer bloxum saw mr abraham overley with the pipe in question half up his coat sleeve passing through the hall to the room of mr william forbes

it also appears that mr abraham overley when questioned by dr finley absolutely refused to state where he was the night of november th whereupon his suspension followed

it does not appear that mr abraham overley was given a chance to explain his having the pipe in his possession if he had it as claimed by the two gentlemen named

we feel that a grave mistake has been made and that mr

overley has been done a great injustice

when this issue of the bulletin reached mr george billings donewell he forwarded a marked copy to his daughter mabel which copy caused a sensation among her new york friends

why mabel said one who would have thought he could

oh i cannot believe him guilty exclaimed another

mabel i thought you said he was such a gentleman said a third young lady

what can he mean by refusing to say where he was

asked another friend

why girls said miss scott november th is the date of the night he was at mabels house with miss watson and sang so lovely

oh i see the whole thing now said miss mabel donewell he was at my house and will not say so because he hasnt our permission

of course that is the night because that was jennies birthday

what can we do about it asked miss chiswell

let us see papa said miss mary chiswell show him this paper and ask his advice we are the cause of his embarrassment 

after mr chiswell had read the editorial and all the surrounding circumstances had been explained to him he advised that the young ladies go to oberlin and state the whole case to dr finley he advised further that they start immediately

preparing themselves with incredible speed we soon find the girls on a train due to arrive in oberlin at  p m that night upon their arrival in oberlin they hastened to the residence of dr finley where they found him in consultation with the members of the faculty concerning this very case

when the girls were announced he was at a loss to understand this unusual visit miss mabel donewell made plain the object however stating how she happened to know of this trouble and where she and her friends were when they heard of it

when she had completed her statement the doctor sent for malcolm

mr overley said the doctor i have just learned that abraham overley was at the home of a young lady who has been out of town and that you knew that he was there is that a fact

yes sir said malcolm but i have given abe my word not to mention his whereabouts unless the other party so directs i hope you will not question me further

mr overley i appreciate your position and will see what i can do to gain you that permission

thereupon he instructed his secretary to bring to him the lady who was in waiting when malcolm saw miss donewell enter the room he started up wtih a look that betrayed his feelings he extended both hands to her saying thank god you have come i knew you would i know now that abe will soon be reinstated i am very glad to see you

miss donewell colored very deeply and drew back as if she feared malcolm would crush her in his eagerness

miss donewell said the doctor with a merry twinkle in his eye will you give mr overley leave to say where his friend was on the night of november th

of course i will doctor mr overley you may say that mr abraham overley was at my home on this night and all else you may know about this affair that pertains to me

malcolm immediately started into a complete recital of the whole story stating that it was november th that abe had the pipe in the hall also stating abes reason for not saying where he was the night of november th to all of which the doctor and faculty listened very attentively after malcolm had finished the narration the doctor instructed him to have abe come to him at once and that he would impose the further burden  upon him of seeing the young ladies home the doctor also instructed his secretary to go for lashum and bloxum telling him to keep them in the library until he sent for them

he then suggested to the dean that he thought it advisable to search lashums room the dean together with two other members of the faculty proceeded to make the search which resulted in finding the pipe at the bottom of lashums trunk

the dean took the pipe wrapped very closely to dr finleys office

when abe reached the doctors office he expected to hear that he was expelled his surprise was very great when told that the whole affair had been cleared up so far as he was concerned and that the announcement of his reinstatement would be made in the most public manner next morning in the chapel just after devotional exercises the doctor and other members of the faculty then shook abes hand very cordially and bade him good night the doctor had been informed as to how and where the dean had found the pipe so after a short discussion it was thought best to interview bloxum first when bloxum came into the room the pipe was on the table in full view and when he saw it he staggered to a chair and dropped upon it he knew that trouble was in store for him true to his nature he resolved to put the blame on buck dr finley did not question him at once but kept looking at the pipe waiting for bloxum to be the first to say something concerning it bloxum was wary and did not betray himself finally the doctor turned suddenly to the dean and said dean sternly where did you say you found this pipe

i found it in mr buck lashums trunk was his response

mr bloxum how came this pipe to be there asked the doctor i hope you will see fit to tell me the whole truth about this matter

i did not put it there i told buck to let it alone was bloxums answer

now tell us the entire circumstance said the doctor

bloxum said that he and lashum and a few others were passing through the hall the night before buck got the pipe and they saw abe with it buck said lets get that pipe and put it on abe but bloxum advised him to let it alone

buck insisted buck alone did the whole thing all bloxum did was to say that he saw abe with the pipe which was true

after this remarkable statement the doctor sent for buck

when buck saw the pipe on the table he became sullen at once

mr lashum do you know where that pipe was asked the doctor

no i do not said buck

it was found in your trunk said the doctor

i didnt put it there said buck nor do i know how it got there

have a care mr lashum said the doctor i have a statement from one who claims to know all about this affair

the doctor then read the statement made by bloxum buck thought a moment then concluded that bloxum must have squealed on him

well i wont say nothin because i dont know nothin

said buck and moved toward the door

do not be in a hurry mr lashum said the doctor i want to know whether or not this statement is true

no it aint true said buck

at a sign from the doctor bloxum was brought in the room again and his statement was read to him

mr bloxum said the doctor is this statement true

yes sir it is true every word of it was bloxums answer

buck glared at him for a moment then said so you are trying to put this whole thing on me are you

well you wont didnt you tell me how to fix that nigger

mr lashum interrupted the doctor you will use nothing but proper language here you will withdraw that word

well bloxum told me how to get even with abe he told me to get the pipe and hide it and say that abe stole it and that we saw him with it and that the boys would not know what night it was now he tries to put the job on me i aint afeared to say what i did im white i am

after buck had finished bloxum began to remark that buck knew better that he advised against the whole thing all the way through but he was cut short by the doctor who said that their cases would be disposed of that night and that the conclusion would be announced next morning at the chapel exercises

dr finley after a prayer next morning in which he asked almighty god to watch and protect the school and those in the school who were weighted dowp with troubles and sorrows and those who were about to leave the school and who would need his constant care said he had two duties to perform one a pleasant the other a very disagreeable duty

first that the faculty after new facts had come to light had unanimously agreed to reinstate mr abraham overley who had been suspended pending the finding of mr

malcolm overleys pipe and the investigation as to his whereabouts the night the pipe was stolen he said it gave him great pleasure to state that the investigation disclosed that mr overley was not guilty in any sense of the word he therefore withdrew the suspension and hoped that all the students would understand that no suspicion whatever rested on mr overley this announcement was met by the yell that only college boys know abe was the hero of the hour the doctors manner then changed he said the investigation also led to the discovery of a case of criminal conspiracy he stated that it was discovered that two students had conspired to rob another of his good name by lying about him and gave the complete details of the affair after which he announced that the faculty had dismissed mr buck lashum and mr

squealer bloxum the boys arose to their feet looking for buck and bloxum but they had been notified of the action of the faculty and were not present these young men were busy packing their belongings buck cursing and scoring bloxum as an ungrateful dog bloxum whining and crying not knowing where to get money to pay his fare home when the doctors announcement was made that buck and bloxum were dismissed there was a moment of silence then there burst forth a perfect volcano of cat calls hisses and groans when the noise had ceased the doctor dismissed the students out on the campus a party surrounded malcolm and abe and wanted abe to tell where he was that night and all about the case but abe still refused to say a wrord about his whereabouts remarking that if one visit caused all this talk and trouble what would ten visits cause as de vaux and his friend passed out of the chapel the tennesseean remarked that was undoubtedly the dirtiest trick i ever heard of

de vaux what do you think of such people

well i am sure i dont know they just deliberately stole that pipe and accused somebody else of the theft thereby bringing other people into it as witnesses answered de vaux

these fellows must feel cheap now

i am glad they are gone

the next issue of the college bulletin contained a full account of the affair malcolm mailed one to his father and also a letter to abes father asking pardon for causing him unnecessary worry and trouble

bloxum unlike buck had no cash upon which to draw to procure a ticket for his home trip he was therefore compelled to write his father for the necessary funds what should he write how was he to explain his expulsion after much thought bloxum concluded he would write his father at length explaining that he had brought trouble upon himself in an endeavor to protect a negro by the name of overley forgetting that his father received the oberlin bulletin in due course bloxum received the bare amount necessary to procure his ticket unaccompanied by either letter or comment he left by a night train well knowing that no boy in the school would be sorry to see him leave bloxums father concluded to express himself to his son in person

after writing home that abe overley had lied on him that abe had stolen a pipe and put it in his bucks trunk buck declared that he was coming home oberlin was no place for him a niggers word there is better than a white mans

buck also forgot that the bulletin was sent to his home but he was more fortunate than bloxum nick lashum sr could not read and was kept in ignorance of those things which the family did not desire him to know buck concluded he would visit friends in elmyra and cleveland before he started home

he found himself stranded in cleveland however upon receiving a telegram from buck his brother immediately tele graphed him the necessary amount to procure a ticket when buck arrived home his father wanted to know about the affair that led to his homecoming inasmuch as his brothers and sisters had been careful not to inform nick sr that his son had been expelled from college he therefore launched into a long story as to how he happend to be home in the first place oberlin was no place for a white man anyhow niggers were more thought of than white men niggers had all the privileges of the school they stood at the head of some of the classes they went about with white women a nigger was the captain of the college baseball team niggers

sat at the same table with him taken on the whole he could not understand how he managed to live through it all he as you may know had a very sympathetic audience

after he had finished his narrative arabella innocently remarked buck it was awful mean of them to expel you just for that

whats that asked nick sr with a blaze of wrath

why the damnation haint yer tol me that fore now

what yer mean by not tellin me what i aughter know dâ if i dont pull yer lyin tongue outen yer haid

suiting the acts to the words nick sr made a move toward his son but buck was on the alert and soon put a safe distance between himself and his irate parent

never yer min yer ungrateful dorg jes yer put yer foot in this hyre house again anâgo way arabella yer leetle hussy think im goin to let thet air boy run my house

doggon ef i dont fix him yoll see

buck in his haste to get out of his fathers reach ran to the cabin of black sue who was sitting before the door smoking a pipeâa habit common among the negro women among her class

lor chile whats de mattah she asked noticing his haste and frightened look sho yo pappys not arter you gin so soon

yes said buck and he swears he will kill me if he catches me

black sue insisted that he should tell her about the trouble thinking something had happened which caused him to return before the end of the school year negroes of this class could always be depended upon to know all even to the smallest details that transpired at the big house black sue was no exception to this rule after buck had related his version of why he was expelled this virtuous  person was consumed with wrath she regarded buck thoughtfully for some moments then remarked chile i know jes how to git eben wid dem overleys ole mal overley and ole abe and de rest ob dem men is gone to take dey grain to de boat dey wont be back till day arter morrow yo kin kotch dat gal ob ole abes what puts on so many airs jes kase she kin read and write and dat ole mammy ob hern stealin bacon outen yo pappys meat house

i dun kotch dem onct den yo  kin gib dem a good hoggin 

buck knew only too well the purport of this statement he saw very readily that he could rehabilitate himself in the good graces of his father by this means he therefore immediately sent one of black sues boys after the smalys and wardemans upon whom he could depend it was agreed in the council that followed that at  p m the next night they were to assemble and go quietly to the cabin of the overleys take the two women out and flog them at the appointed time these representative citizens met at the place designated and proceeded to the cabin where they found these lone women

the daughter was engaged in reading the bible to her mother as she had been accustomed to do for years past just before retiring jack smaly burst the door open and with an oath demanded to know where the bacon was they had stolen from mr lashums meathouse the daughter who was a very spirited girl arose to her feet saying that they knew she nor her mother had stolen nothing jack dealt the girl a blow with his fist that felled her to the floor the mother in trying to prevent this assault was knocked down by one of the wardemans they were both then seized bound and taken back into the orchard stripped bare to the waist by these alabama gentlemen  who proceeded to administer with a leather horsetrace nine and thirty lashes on their bare backs at the first blow the mother old and feeble fainted and hung by the thongs that bound her to the tree no thought of pity for her no hand was raised to stay the sickening blows that fell upon her emaciated body no word of warning that her life was being taken nothing but curses and blows were multiplied upon her until her brutal lynchers stopped from sheer exhaustion the daughter begged that the mother be spared but was answered by a blow that loosened several teeth the trace was applied to the now perfectly nude body of the unfortunate girl until she too hung limp and apparently lifeless subjected to the vile remarks and jeers of these merciless wretches at this moment bucks brother nick jr arrived on the scene he though a lashum did not approve of such deeds he went at once to the old woman and cut her loose thinking she would be glad to get away but she fell to the ground after bending over her for a moment he said you fellows have raised hâ now havent you you have killed this old woman

he then went to the daughter and found her almost lifeless

some of the negro women from the nearby eabins were called and they took the girl to her cabin where she died before morning this drunken mob now sobered by the realization of the enormity of their crime began to move away leaving their victims dead and dying

sheriff joe wheatley was notified of this tragedy by some of the negroes and was soon upon the scene he learned from them that the deed was committed by buck lashums gang the sheriff immediately put buck and his cronies the wardemans and the smalys under arrest the coroner also soon arrived when he learned that buck and his friends were under arrest charged with murder of these women he impanelled a jury at once to determine the innocence of these young men testimony was adduced from the negroes that should have been strong enough to hold the prisoners for the action of the grand jury but three white men who were late in arriving at the scene of action swore they passed the prisoners five miles back on the road going in an opposite direction from the scene of the tragedy at the time of its occurrence which testimony was of sufficient weight in the opinion of the jury to justify them in bringing in a verdict declaring that the women came to their deaths at the hands of parties unknown to the jury probably the result of a fight among the negroes on the overley place malcolm a oberley not being home to preserve order all this in the face of the fact that these men were in the custody of the sheriff at the time the three citizens swore they were on the road

the ability to reason in a negros favor is not an accomplishment characteristic of an alabama jury the coroner ordered the discharge of the prisoners

after a consultation with the states attorney sheriff wheatley rearrested buck and his friends and they were held by judge wiggles under heavy bond to await the action of the grand jury

old abe and malcolm a overley learned of the double tragedy before they reached home old abe completely prostrated lay in the bottom of a wagon moaning and praying to god malcolm a overley as soon as he learned of what had happened lashed his horses into a furious gallop and was soon dashing along the road toward his home like a madman

as he passed his neighbors they gazed at him in his mad flight fearful for his life when he finally reached home his rage was beyond control

for two days malcolm a overley rode the country with his gun looking for some person to shoot who was concerned in the murder of these women but no man came his way however and he was finally persuaded by big joe wheatley and others to return to his home for six weeks following this old mans soul hovered between its prison and the boundless beyond when malcolm a overley finally regained his strength and took his accustomed place with old abe on the veranda where for two generations they were wont to smoke and talk the altered appearance of each was so noticeable that the old men sat for a long time gazing at each other finally malcolm a oberley said abe what the hâ are yon staring at me that way for

have you never seen me before dâ your black hide do you think i am a ghost

yes sah yo is de ghost of yosef but sah will yo nebber member dat de lawd is more powful den we is will yo nebber member dat his will mus be done my ole oman dats daid an gone she say dat she will die happy when she know dat yo done gin yo heart to god now she done pass way an yo air still outen de lawds fold yo jes come through de valley ob de shadow ob death an yo is not changed yet i dun stop prayin fo my ole oman an my gal kase i know day is in glory ise prayin fo yo

when i see how nigh de grave yo   why abe who the hâ told you how near the grave i am

you old niggers think that you know as much about the lords business as he himself knows where did you get the idea that i am nearer the grave than any other man of my age

hab yo forgot so soon dat yo jus earned outen yo sick bade dat de doctors say yo mus die an

oh dâ the doctors they tried to kill me old cleo she brought me out but abe what will we do when my boy and your boy learn the truth

god am my hepper i dunno i pray god my abe may nebber learn de truth

after old abe had expressed himself as not knowing what to do malcolm a overley seemed lost in thought

abe he said what will the grand jury do with those dâ beasts si weedles foreman of the grand jury what the hâ has this country come to poor white trash a hound like that foreman of the grand jury i tell you abe if that grand jury does not indict that bunch of murderers i shall take my gun and kill the whole dâ crowd what are you shaking your head about dâ your black hide you havent the courage of a flea what are you going to do

let them go scot free well just you wait until that boy of yours comes back here then you will wake up dâ if he dont fix matters

god forbid my po boy come back heah wid he heart full of murder an vengeance no he inns nebber know how he po mudder an sister done die i hopes sah yo will nebber tell him

at this point big joe wheatley jim connors and several more of malcolm a overleys friends together with the good minister rode up to the house old abe called some of the boys to look after the horses

malcolm said big joe wheatley tomorrow the grand jury will sit on those cases already they are bragging that it will not indict i do not think myself that it will but what can we do at times t feel like taking my gun and killing the whole crowd

i can but feel that that will be the only way in which this thing can ever be settled said jim connors

why of course that is the way replied malcolm a

overley dâ their dirty hides i have said so all along

i just told abe that if the grand jury did not indict them i would indict try and execute them too hâ they deserve to die

but my brothers interposed the good minister that would be murder two wrongs will not make one right still when one considers the wickedness of this deed the wanton brutality attending the crime there may be some excuse should the passions and desire for revenge common to all human beings get beyond control my brothers

may de good god almighty keep yo gemmen from letten yo passions get yon control interrupted old abe ef yo does venge yosef on dese people an take dey life yo souls will be los  dar will be no scuse fo  yo  i se de one dat is most hurted i dun forgin dese people why yo gemmen not do de same god grant dat yo will not pen on any scuse an cubber yo hands wid blood

old abe made these observations solemnly and with all the simple eloquence peculiar to his class abes rebuke to this man of god was apparent to all it put a stop to all further discussion along those lines

upon the following day the grand jury met and considered the case after hearing the three white men who testified before the coroners jury together with the negroes who witnessed the murders buck and his friends were discharged an alibi having been established

the following was found next day in the county bulletin messrs buck lashum rex and tom wardeman jack and jim smaly were yesterday discharged by the grand jury they having been held by judge wiggles in  bond each charged with the murder of two nigger wenches on the overley plantation the time has not yet come for white men to be tried for killing niggers

and thus the matter ended

malcolm a overley and his friends were compelled to bow to what seemed to be the inevitable the grand jury exonerated the men who killed these women the county bulletin had passed editorially on the killings the case passed into history malcolm a overley was called from his bitter thoughts by a communication notifying him that his mortgage would be due in thirty days and that it must be paid in full

the money was not available what was he to do after a long consultation with his friends it was decided to ask the bank for eight months extension of time

when the proposition was submitted to nick lashum he denounced the big bug saying that now he had him and he was going to sell him out but the officials of the bank were not of nicks opinion the time had not come for the mortgage to be foreclosed they prevailed upon him to withhold his vengeance for a few months the extension was obtained and it was placed upon record and thus the matter was settled for the time being

when nick lashum sr learned that buck and his friends had been arrested by sheriff wheatley charged with the murder of the overley women his wrath knew no bounds

what the hâ yer think of them big bugs restin white men fer niggers dâ if i dont git even yoll see go they bail in course i will i dont kere a dâ ef its a hundred thousand they is good boys an them niggers was stealin my bacon serve em right

thus commented nick sr when requested to offer himself as bondsman for the murderers when buck was questioned by his father as to his knowledge of the theft of the bacon he said black sue first told him that the women were stealing from the meathouse in fact that she had caught them in the very act he then determined to watch and see for himself and he and his friends caught the women redhanded buck told these lies without a tremor without a blush his father already convinced that a nigger will steal only needed to hear such a statement to convince him that the women were guilty of stealing his meat it mattered not to him that no bacon was missing nor that the meathouse showed no signs of having been tampered with

wall boy youse in a pretty fix now aint you cused of killin nigger wenches yo brother he say youse a disgrace to the family wall all i got ter say is ise on yer bon an no grand jury will diet yer an no harm will come ter yer yo tell old sue i wants her ter come hyre i want ter see her

buck was glad of the opportunity to get old sue to talk with his father he hurried to sues cabin where he found her dozing by the door with her corncob pipe in her lap

sue pappy wants to see yer he wants to ask yer about them overtey niggers i told him what yer told me and what i see them niggers do myself

yer tell yo pappy ise got no time ter was wid him yo tell yo pappy dat ise to home

but sue pappy says

go long boy what i ear what yo pappy say yo tell him ise to home and she laughed at her own cleverness

buck went back to his father and told him that sue was sulky but she would be up to the house in a few minutes

nick waited more than an hour for sue and then went in search of her himself he found her where buck had left her sitting beside her cabin smoking

sue said nick with a great show of wrath why the hâ dont yer come when i send fer yer do yer

look out white man exclaimed sue interrupting nick with kindling anger dose yer know who yo is talkin at

 se telled yo fo now dat i dont low no white man ter talk ter me dat way yo jes modrate yo tune ef yo wants me ter talk ter yer now whats yo gwine say

sue i wants the facts bout them niggers of overleys

yes but sue i wants ter know what yer did see aint yer never goin ter larn to act lek a lady dâ ef i ever seed a woman lek yer yer never keeps yer word with nobody

nick said this very meekly careful not to anger black sue further

keep my word yelled sue yos a nice one ter tell folks bout keepin dey word does yo member dat yo promised me er greenback morn six mon yos a nice one i swar man yo go long i tells yo nuttin

after sue made this speech she lighted her pipe closed her eyes and seemed to forget that nick was in existence nick observed her for some moments well knowing that it would be useless to question her further he took from his pocket a roll of bills from which he selected a dollar saying in a very kind voice sue ise glad yer called my min to that ar dollar livers hit yers morn welcome id er gin hit ter yer fore now had yer sade the word

sue eyed the money for a moment then she reached for it with all the eagerness of a vulture swooping down on a carcass of carrion as soon as she obtained possession of the money she resumed her pipe and her silence in the most aggravating manner nick noted from sues attitude that she did not intend to talk but he thought he would try again

sue what did yer say bout them overley niggers i wants ter know

wal ef yo wants ter know yo knows how ter find out

answered sue and she resumed her pipe with the same exasperating indifference

nick knew only too well that sue meant to make him pay her to talk he thought however he would try persuasion

sue he said very kindly yer is the onest gal on this whole place thet t kin pen on yer is the onest one thet ever watches my stuff thet keers nuff bout me ter study ray interest i gives yer credit fer thet an

yes an ise de onlest one dat yo nebber gins nuttin to i tells yo dat i studies yo good and gits nuttin fer hit i isnt gwine to do it no mo interrupted sue

black sue knew the truthfulness of this statement and watched very closely for its effect on nick she noticed that he was startled and became nervous

she remarked that she knew a heap bout what dey war doin de night of de troubles

sue ole gal said nick i wants ter know all bout thet dâ row hyre tek this an git yersef a nice caliker dress

so hep me god

nick stood looking at sue with a mind to strike her but his good judgment together with the knowledge of his former experiences deterred him he said finally all yer dâ niggers is jes alek and departed in high dudgeon black sue laughed to herself remarking that she warnt goin ter hab all de niggers arter her an her chillern on dey count dem women my color an ise goin ter stan by dem

as nick moved off toward the house he soliloquized wall thet do beat hâ thet nigger wenchâis clean outen my bearinâtek my money an not tell me nuttin ill sho git even yoll see when thet grand jury meets we is got ter pend on dem white men an ole si i dunno what we would do widouten him

malcolm and abe had been informed that abes mother and sister lucy had died very suddenly and that there was trouble on the plantation because of their deaths also that it was advisable for them not to come home as they would arrive too late for their burials abe was prostrated he could not understand why he had not been telegraphed at once malcolm forbes and rattles were unusually kind to him which only augmented his uneasiness forbes was careful to keep the newspapers from him it was soon known about the college however that abes mother and sister had been lynched and that buck lashum and his friends were under arrest charged with their murder how to keep the truth from abe longer was the allabsorbing question before the three friends while discussing ways and means to keep abe in ignorance of the manner of his mothers and sisters death malcolm forbes and rattles were surprised in rattles room by abe just as rattles remarked i tell you fellows abe should have been told at first

abe heard the latter part of this remark as he entered the room i should have been told what fellows  he asked

the three boys were so surprised by abes appearance that they betrayed themselves abe noticed their confusion

say fellows what is this conspiracy why what is the matter he asked as no one appeared to be willing to answer him abe observed them carefully apparently reading their very thoughts finally he sank upon a chair and said malcolm tell me about my mother you fellows know more about her death than i do

abe made this request in such a pitiful heartrending way that malcolm turned from him to hied his tears rattles remarked abe i am afraid you stay in your room too much come with me to the campus

abe permitted himself to be led from the room by rattles who said to forbes tell de vaux and his friend to meet us down on the campus

soon rattles and abe were joined by malcolm and forbes together with the other young men as soon as abe saw malcolm he attempted to take him to one side and ask him about the part of the conversation he had overheard in rattless room feeling that he still had something to learn concerning his mothers death

rattles noticed the movement and signaled de vaux to follow which he did remarking you fellows shall have no secrets from the rest of us overley tell us about this sad affair

no i cannot said malcolm your friend here has kept in touch with the case let him tell you

abe was conscious of the solemn manner in which malcolm spoke also of the solemn faces about him he sank upon the ground in an attitude that college boys know well and said fellows i am ready to be crucified

the tennesseean began by saying overly you may be crucified before i have related all that i know of this affair but you must bear up like a man we employed a man to go to your home to learn the facts we learn that during your fathers absence your mother and sister were

lynched yelled abe as he bounded to his feet and grasped the tennesseean by the shoulder in a grip that caused him great pain but which he bore without flinching abes manner and appearance were so changed that his friends feared for his reason his eyes bulged from their sockets they seemed to flash fire he looked a full foot taller his hands worked convulsively his neck was swollen he did not seen to breathe he looked the very incarnation of the avenging demon this was a terrible tableau lasting for several moments all stood looking at abe in awe they were conscious he would wreak a terrible vengeance when his time for vengeance came finally abe sat down and said fellows i will listen but i see the whole thing now i know that my mother and my sister were both killed by whom why were they killed why was i not told at once

malcolm why did you keep this from me all these weeks

their murderers may have escaped by this time

no they are awaiting the action of the grand jury they are under heavy bonds said the tenesseean

who are these people who are under bond asked abe

the tennesseean answered after a moments thought buck lashum two wardemans and two smalys the grand jury will hear their cases tomorrow

after a long silence abe as if speaking to himself said so this is done to be avenged on me oh my poor mother i am the cause of your death can there be a just god mother so surely as you are dead i will avenge you

the boys thought it best not to tell abe at this time of the manner in which his mother lost her life so they slowly returned to their rooms abe walking between malcolm and rattles like one in a dream when they reached the hall de vaux and his friend stopped each extended a hand to abe the tennesseean remarking overley i have said to you before that i am your friend

i am still your friend my services and my funds are at your disposal command me and them

abe i am with you to the same extent that my friend is command me said de vaux

i thank you both your god alone knows what i may need exclaimed abe

the two young men then left abe and his friends as their rooms were not in the same hall in which abes and malcolms were for they true to their southern blood had when they first came to oberlin refused to live under the same roof with abe and the rest of the negro students who were in this building when abe and his friends reached his room there was a long silence which was broken by malcolm saying abe we all sympathize with you what can we do to help you in this matter

i want to go home i want to see my mothers grave

malcolm why did you keep this from me he asked and then added  can there be a god can there be a just god

can there be laws to reach such people can there be nothing that governs the universe but the avenging demon

abe had now risen to his feet towering above his friends in his rage he called out again in his madness if there be a demon if there be a devil if there be an imp of hell if there be a force that will turn blood to gall love to hate good to badâcome to me that i may feel thy full force come to me that i may forget that i am human until i have avenged this wrong perpetrated upon my mother and sister by all the imps of hell this was done to be avenged on me oh my poor mother i am the cause of your unnatural death by the god that made me and with the aid of the demons of hell whose help i implore i will be revenged

you hear me fellows i will be revenged

the three young men stood looking at abe conscious that all that was human in him all that was good in his nature had succumbed to the brute instinct of human nature for revenge suddenly abe turned to malcolm and demanded in a tone and with a look that malcolm had never heard nor seen before malcolm why did you fellows keep this from me

rattles the only one who seemed to be able to cope with the situation said abe stop a moment and consider see the rage you are in you cannot govern yourself now what would you have done at your home when all this excitement was on you by yourself we talked over the matter among ourselves

malcolm wanted to go home with you he was ready to place his life at your disposal he argued that you should avenge your mothers and sisters death but he was persuaded that the time was not come now abe listen the school year is now nearly over you and malcolm will soon be going home then you can ferret out the guilty parties

you can do nothing now from the beginning malcolm wanted you to know so do not blame him yesterday i talked this matter over with dr finley and he told me to bring you to him will you go i think mr donewell has also had this matter investigated abe your friends are doing all they can to have those persons indicted but as you know the grand jury may fail to indict let us go to the doctors office

abe said malcolm i have felt all along that you should know all about this deed but the majority of our friends thought it best for you not to know as you would naturally want to go home where you could do no good i was willing to go with you and i am still willing to go i will aid you in any way to right this wrong i hope you do not think abe that i will desert you in your hour of need

malcolm i cannot think i know you and your father are my best friends i know you and he will aid me i will need your help

the young men clasped hands in a friendly manner suddenly abe said stay here six weeks why fellows i am going tonight how can i study now

abe i took the responsibility upon myself to make an engagement for you with dr finley will you go to see him before you decide to leave the college asked rattles

yes rattles we will go was abes answer

when the boys reached dr finleys office the good doctor met them very pleasantly

doctor said rattles i have brought mr overley to see you we have been discussing his bereavement and

yes yes said the doctor who seemed to divine rattless intentions i have been expecting mr overley for some days

rattles gave the doctor a full account of all that had transpired and also abes determination to go home at once the doctor took abe by the hand and drew him to a chair by his side he invited the boys to listen he then went over the whole case dwelling upon the enormity of the crimes the flimsy excuse for them and the environment amidst which the people live who tolerate such crimes in their midst he finished by asking abe what he expected to do after he got back home provided he should go at once

abe who had been quietly listening to the doctor arose to his feet extended his hands toward the heavens remarking with great bitterness   doctor i intend to go home and kill kill kill my poor old mothers blood cries for vengeance i hear it as it falls to the earth it calls to me drop by drop as it is drawn from her emaciated body by the brutal hands of her lynchers oh my poor mother poor and lowly that you were slave but virtuous and true ignorant but wise in the duties of life look down from thy celestial home upon me thine only son search my innermost heart where if one drop of blood has its resting place that calls not for vengeance that falters even for an instant in that purpose dry it up call me not thy son should i not bring down upon the heads of thy murderers a like fate

but mr overley consider that to which you are about to commit yourself consider the great gifts that god has bestowed upon you consider the life in a higher world to which your ability will surely lead consider the wishes of your many friends those who are sacrificing that you may enjoy the benefits of this great college consider the wishes of that old father who is now praying for the hand that bereaved him and who even when he first received the terrible blow bowed his head and said lord thy will be done

dr finley spoke these words with great earnestness but abe was unmoved

doctor answered abe  i come from a race of men who though slaves were never known to falter in the performance of a duty my poor mothers blood calls for vengeance i see that blood as she lies bound and helpless in the hands of her murderers drawn drop by drop from her helpless body

i tell you continued abe as he sprang to the middle of the room his whole attitude changed from the man to the animal seeking an object upon which to vent its rage her blood calls to me it calls aloud abellike for vengeance i care not what befalls me i care not what my life in eternity may be aye i care not what your god may demand my poor mothers blood cries to me for vengeance and i will answer that call all i ask is that the demons of hell may lend me their strength that i may possess myself of the bitterness gall and hatredâthe kind which possessed the murderers of my poor motherâin order that i may wreak a vengeance suitable to their crime

dr finley realized it would be useless to argue further with abe and therefore remarked without answering abes last outburst of passion that he hoped abe would see mr

donewell and miss watson before he concluded to leave the college after some general remarks the boys took their leave

abe said rattles are you thinking about leaving the college without first asking miss watsons permission i thought you were more gallant than that do you want her to follow you seeking an apology

rattles said this with a view to relieving the strain under which they were laboring abe did not answer rattles but he seemed to be in deep thought he seemed not to have noticed rattles little pleasantry

suddnly abe remarked that is so i did not think of her well i can see her tomorrow

this gave rattles an idea he determined to see miss watson before abe saw her he went next morning to the young ladys home and explained to her abes intention to leave the college and go home to revenge himself upon the murderers of his mother he asked her good offices in persuading abe to remain until the end of the school year which she promised to use

after the departure of abe and his friends mr donewell came into the doctors office in company with dean sternly and several of the college professors

gentlemen said the doctor you have come too late

i have just had a most interesting interview with the young negro overley from alabama his friends brought him to me they wished me to talk to him to try to calm him and if possible to persuade him to stay in the college until the end of the school year i did my best but only succeeded in arousing all the animal in him i suggested

that was very easy to do was it not doctor interrupted professor smirchum

i do not understand you professor answered the doctor

well these negroes have a great deal of animal in them and it only requires a slight offense to arouse them to a point at which they become dangerous answered the professor

i do not agree with you professor said dean sternly your statement is too broad we have thirty negroes in the college who are subject to slurs and insults from the southern boys but we have only one case of disorder resulting from a negros resenting these insults in that case a southern boy after provoking an assault was slapped in the face but did not retaliate no professor you are too hasty in your judgment you do not judge these boys as you do the other students why assume that they are carried away by the same animal instincts that governed their forebears they are several generations removed from them

you gentlemen interrupted dr finley said dr donewell he was about to tell us what he suggested to this young man i am very much interested in this student and want to hear the doctors story

well i will continue said the doctor this young man has just lost his mother and sister who were lynched as you may know he has about made up his mind to leave the college at once i tried to persuade him to remain until the end of the school year i talked to him like a father i told him of the enormity of these crimes of the punishment that would overtake the murderers of his intellectual gifts of his bright future of the old father who was praying for him i suggested all i could to him he sat silent while i talked but when i asked him what he would do should he go home at once he bounded to the middle of the room with a cry that startled me and said doctor i shall go home and kill kill

kill  his words were not spoken in a loud tone of voice but with an intensity a force that made them cut like steel he stood towering above us with his hands extended to the heavens his eyes emitting the most peculiar flame his whole being suggesting the incarnation of the evil one gentlemen when he said doctor i shall go home and kill kill kill his wrath was something terrible then he moaned oh my poor mother i am the cause of your unnatural death thy blood calls for vengeance and i will answer that call his agony was as deep and heartrending as his wrath was bitter and uncontrollable gentlemen i would that all of you had witnessed these outbursts what will this young man do when he reaches his home i do not hesitate to say that he will keep his vow he will surely kill those who participated in the lynching of his mother he in his blind fury can see but the one way to avenge his wrong i predict for him a carnival of blood

doctor do you think that what you have just said is possible in a negro asked professor smirchum

professor your question is not quite clear to me explain more fully said dr finley

well we all know that the negro is an inferior being that

you state your conclusion professor and reason back to your premises said dean sternly you will pardon me for saying that this is a most unusual manner of reasoning and one to which you resort only when you have the negro under discussion why say we all know the negro is thus and so when the facts before us are just to the contrary

in your class report of last year you say to use your own words  overley is an exceptional negro i may say an exceptional man i did not know then what you meant nor do i know now i can simply guess how a student can he exceptional and be less than a man is a point upon which i beg you to enlarge but this exceptional negro is the one under discussion not the race to which he belongs will he adhere to his vow i agree with dr finley that he will surely kill the murderers of his mother

he has been educated developed i may say up to the point that has been reached by our civilization where men take the lives of one another in revenge for the lives of their kindred or for wrongs perpetrated upon their women how is it possible for a negro or a man of any race to live amongst us be educated in our schools take on our civilization and differ from us in this respect i grant that there is a class of negroes who have been taught that it is a crime against god for which there is no forgiveness for them to take the life of a white man i may add that they think it is even wrong to strike one but this negro overley is not of that type and that old type is now the exception rather than the rule no professor your conclusion is not tenable

pardon me you reason backward this negro is a white man in the sense that his ambitions and his desires for the good things of this world are identical with yours he loved his mother and he loves his home his feelings are outraged by the manner of his mothers taking off he says her blood calls for vengeance he sees her bound and helpless being lashed to death he sees no difference between a white murderer and a black one he has never been taught that a white mans person is sacred he resolves to kill what else can you expect what would a white man do what would you do i am almost prepared to acquiesce in his resolution and bid him godspeed but i remember thou shalt not kill were i this young man placed as he is could i withstand the desire for revenge that is born in every human being would the mosaic law deter me with all the avenues of justice through the courts cut off compelled to combat a sentiment which sanctions such atrocities living in a community that bids him be silent because his mother deserved to die and that it was fit and proper for those young brutes to take her lifeâi repeat placed in his stead could i could you resist the impulse to avenge her death would you not avenge your mothers murder would you do your mother justice not to avenge her i do not condemn the man who seeks vengeance i leave these matters for each person to decide according to his personal feelings

 dean sternly said professor narrows   do you consider your doctrine of revenge a sound one is it one that should be inculcated into the minds of these negroes

i have no doctrine of revenge nor have i said to inculcate any such doctrine into their minds answered dean sternly hotly i have said that the desire for revenge is an attribute of human nature controlled only by the will of the individual in the case under discussion and in all similar cases the only remedy the only means of eradicating this terrible evil is to teach the lynchers by example that they will meet like fates men who gather in mobs and kill are not of the class who will face death individually men who are brave in mobs when attacking a single person will not even attack that person with a mob when they know that retribution will certainly follow them you gentlemen have a certain code of ethics along those lines for yourself and a different one for these negroes you say that he must not look at your women but at the same time his women are not safe from you that for which he is lynched you simply smile at in one of yourselves still you are educating him along your lines when you place him in classes along with your sons and daughters he outstrips them frequently in intellectual power and i cannot conceive how men can be so blind as to think that an educated negro will be any less the man than any other human being that has taken on your education and civilization

you take the chinaman the japanese all the darker races in fact even the native african and educate and civilize them and then you point with pride to your work with open arms this product of your labor is received into the body i politic but the americanborn negroâit matters not what his early environment the social status of his parents nor that he has passed through with highest praise the courses here prescribed by you and brought credit to your schoolâyou consider him with a specially constructed code of reasoning both illogical and unjust and force him outside of your consideration and social institutions no hand is extended to him unless it brandishes a cudgel no door is opened to enable him to gain an honest livelihood no matter how proficient he is in the branches from which you have graduated him the american negro possesses a something i suppose which you cannot tolerateâa something that no other man nor race of men not even his forebears possessed how came he by this undefinable something hoes he get it by contact with this dominant race of ours yes examine yourselves and you will find the source of the trouble why you are unwilling to accord him the same privileges the same chance to earn a living and enjoy life which you accord other men is a question which i have long pondered you gentlemen possibly can give me the solution

well for my part answered professor narrows the foreigner acts differently from the american negro you always know the foreign negro but the american negro has an air about him that makes him objectionable he likes to rub against one too much oh he presumes to be ones equal

i dont like him for that

yes that is very true answered dean sternly that is the secret of the whole matter you invite the chinaman out of whom you can never educate his opium the japanese out of whom you can never educate his idolatry the malays hindoos moors africans and all other foreign races of men you invite to come to you the people who never take on your civilization you bid come you repulse the american negro who has taken on your civilization can you not see that that of which you complain is but the american idea how can the negro come in contact with you and your institutions and not be americanized why do you teach him you educate him then ostracise him apparently for taking on your teachings this state of affairs must certainly be embarrassing to the negro professor if you are not willing to live up to the result of your work you should not be a party to the tragedy which you are helping to enact i was born and reared in the south and i know that your theory and comments are all wrong

gentlemen said dr finley a discussion of this question was had over forty years ago at the time the founders of this college concluded that there were no white men no black men no yellow men no red men but that all men were alike before god and further that this idea should dominate the policy of this college from this ideal it has never deviated and so long as i remain president it never shall this brings us back to this young man overley can he justify himself before god should he keep his vow we read the avenger of the blood himself shall slay the murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death we would infer from this charge to moses that the great god almighty contemplated an avenger of the blood would you consider it strange that this young man feels in the absence of courts and juries that he should avenge his mothers and sisters deaths i as a minister of the gospel do not advise deeds of violence but in this contemplated deed i am almost persuaded that this young man is right in his determination to avenge his mothers death when i think of this atrocious crime the wanton brutality of the whole proceeding i bow my head in shame that such crimes are perpetrated and countenanced by the race to which i belong can this nation of ours stand with this thirst for blood growing upon us there will surely come a day of reckoning

the afternoon of the following day abe called upon miss watson with the avowed intention of bidding her goodbye she greeted him very cordially remarking you may come in sir but i want you to give an account of yourself where have you been for the past six weeks do you remember sir that you promised me that you would sing at our song services last sunday i am greatly aggrieved at your unaccountable conduct i shall accept nothing but the most abject apology now sir i am ready to listen abe stood looking at her in bewilderment he finally said miss watson my mind has been so paralyzed by my bereavement the weight of my burden has been

mr overley why did you not come to me and permit me to share your burden do you not know that by staying away from your friends at such times you not only burden yourself but put a burden upon them unnecessarily i have waited all this time for an opportunity to express my sympathy for you i am very sorry mr overley that you have not seen fit to see me sooner do you think that i cannot feel the terrible blow that has befallen you do you not know that i am aware that no negro man woman or child is safe in the land of your birth from the kind of assaults that has resulted in your mothers death would i be safe there if i was not subject to one kind of assault i would be to another and so you have come to say goodbye

miss watson if you will permit me to explain i know you will agree with me that it is imperative that i go home my father is an old man very oldâseventyfour years of age mr overley is of the same age they are both too old to think of ferreting out the persons concerned in the deaths of my mother and sister and for them to avenge their deaths is out of the question i say them i of course do not expect mr overley to avenge them but i know him so well that i know he will aid me i am going home for no other purpose than to take the lives of those who killed my mother and sister i am going to killâkill every man that has my mothers blood on his hands i have determined to devote my life to the wreaking of vengeance i have come to make this confession to you i have come to confess that i am a murderer at heart and soon will be one in fact i am going to ask whether after i have stained my hands in the blood of my mothers murderers which i surely will do will you still want to see me will you answer me now or shall i leave you to consider the matter

mr overley i have already considered was her answer

i have been taught thou shalt not killâlove thy neighbor as thyself i have also read an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth  as god is my guide and my helper i know not how to advise you but were i a man nay woman that i am should my mother meet the cruel death at the hands of brutal lynchers that your mother met i would leave no path unsearched no stone unturned i would delve into the very bowels of the earth i would skirt the fires of hell aye cross them in my endeavor to wreak a suitable vengeance upon such brutes nor would i feel until the last murderer was slain that i had done my duty to my dead will i care to see you

mr overley i feel this outrage upon negro womanhood most keenly i feel that it calls for a terrible retribution i thank god that i am permitted to call my friend the one negro man who will devote his life to the punishment of the perpetrators of this crime will i care to see you again she asked her eyes flashing her slender figure swaying as the panther sways when about to leap upon its prey go and when you have wreaked the vengeance for which your mothers blood calls be it one month one year nay be it eternity i will wait for you

as miss watson who was known for her passive christian spirit finished this declaration she extended her hand to abe who raised it to his lips with the remark miss watson i was afraid you would not understand my motives i am pleased that you take the view of this matter which i do i am more than proud to know that the one woman now left to me in this world approves of my determination miss watsonâmay i say nancy i am proud of you i love you

i have always loved you i loved you before i ever met you or else how would our souls have joined at sight nancy you say you will wait for me wait for me to commit these terrible crimesâfor crimes they will be oh nancy you have not said you loved me

as abe said this he held out both hands to her she came close to him permitting him to put his arms around her and implant a solemn kiss upon her forehead suddently she drew away and asked what his plans were

abe said he would go home at once to which she objected

abe do not go home immediately wait until the end of the school year then go home quietly as if nothing had happened learn all you can about this deed who committed it and how it was done why it was committed if there be a reason then you will know what vengeance to wreak and upon whom be cautious ingratiate yourself into the good graces of all until you know the whole truth it matters not if it takes one year or two years success is to be your object to avenge the death of two outraged women is to be your undertaking i shall expect you to write me as your hunt progresses do you think that a good plan

yes nancy that is a very good plan and i shall act upon it said abe as he arose to leave

mr overley said miss watson havent you forgotten something

abe did not seem to comprehend her meaning

forgotten what nancy he asked

why my father of course you have forgotten that i am a minor was her laughing reply

oh i will never forget that all girls are minors up to a certain time in their lives answered abe

that will do sir i will call fatherand miss watson left the room

mr watson was a substantial citizen who had conducted a grocery business in oberlin for a number of years he was very fond of his only daughter nancy

mr watson said abe you have been sent for that i may make two confessions to you you have no doubt heard of the terrible deaths of my poor mother and sister well sir i have vowed to avenge them i shall go home and kill every man who was concerned in their taking off i confess this to you that you may know the next time we meet if meet we do that i have the blood of one or more persons on my hands

further when we do meet i shall ask you to give me your daughter in marriage

mr watson arose to his feet taking a turn across the room

he stopped looked abe full in the face and asked would you give your daughter to a murdererâa double murderer maybe

abe answered solemnly mr watson should your daughter nancy be foully murderedâlynchedâwhat would you do

after a long silence the old man faltering as to his decision said as he extended his hand to abe i will consult my wife and daughter

abe then left the house and returned to his room

soon the day of his departure came and abe with malcolm took leave of the college when abe arrived home he found his father broken and apparently twenty years nearer the end of his lifes journey

the old man greeted his son without a word but with a long clinging grasp of the hand in his eyes was a mute appeal felt only by the two souls that had been stricken by the same blow the father led the way to two newly made graves by which abe kneeled raised his eyes to heaven and in a voice choking with emotion pleaded with the ruler of the universe for strength to bear his burden

abes father listened thinking that perhaps after all his son had accepted the situation and would not seek revenge

the young man fell across his mothers grave where he remained seemingly lifeless while the father watched and waited hoping that abe would soon leave the graves and go with him to the house to greet mr overley the old man finally concluded to call mr overley and ask him to try and persuade abe to go to the house mr overley accompanied by malcolm came to the quiet burying plot where he found abe still prostrate on his mothers grave abes father pointed to his son with a silent request for help

mr overley knelt by him taking his sand saying abe my boy come to the house with me i am anxious to hear something of your success at school you cannot help matters by grieving over what is already done boy i feel for you

this thing is the most hellish crime that has ever been perpetrated on woman in this country but what can you do

hâ and damnation what can you do i say

abe arose slowly and stood looking first at one and then the other finally he asked in a solemn voice what can i do by the gods ask me what will i not do

he again fell upon his mothers grave where he remained some moments in silence which was broken by his father saying to him my boy yo po mudder am in hebben she am now lookin down from dem stars on yo she am sayin to vo to belebe in de lawd dat de lawds will be done oh my boy

look to de lawd fo hep in dis matter

abe arose to his feet extended his hand to his father saying dad i appreciate what you say but i feel that i must avenge my mothers death oh my mother oh my poor mother again abe in a frenzy of despair threw himself upon his mothers grave where he lay supine and quivering moaning that the great god almighty had forsaken him and his

he extended his hands toward the heavens and in the stillness of the night in the presence of his father and their old friend called upon the god that made him to register his vow he said by the god that made me by that silent breast that nurtured me by the sister of my childhood by all that i hold dear in this world i will be avenged mother may i ever be accursed in your sight if i do not avenge you

turning to his friend he said mr overley would you not consider me less than a man should i permit these murderers to go unpunished i swear to you that so surely as there is a god so surely as this brutal deed is recorded in heaven so surely as there is an eternity so surely as there is a hell so surely as the perpetrators of this crime are watched for in the hell into which i shall plunge them just so surely shall i avenge this murder

finding it impossible to induce abe to leave his mothers grave and go with them mr oberley and abes father reluctantly left him there and returned in silence to the great house when they had gone abe again raised his hands to the heavens and exclaimed mother oh my poor mother

look down upon thy son let me feel thy presence mother i devote my life to the wreaking of vengeance upon thy murderers  as abe uttered these words he sank once more upon his mothers grave where he remained in silence until morning

it soon became known throughout the county that abe had returned to his home speculation was rife as to what he would do to avenge his mothers death he gave no sign however as to what his intentions or feelings were but set about quietly though diligently to glean the facts in the case he soon learned that black sue had planted the germ which led to the deaths that bereaved him he also learned that the crime had been committed by buck lashum the smalys and the wardevans and that they had used a leather horse trace to accomplish the horrible deed the trace he discovered had been cut in pieces by the five men and the pieces taken to their respective homes to be kept as souvenirs of this great performance thus perpetuating in their families the fame of having participated in such a laudable  undertaking abe concluded that he would possess himself of the pieces of trace splice them together and make this reconstructed trace the instrument of his revenge after some thought he concluded to take malcolm into his confidence

malcolm said abe one evening as they sat in their favorite haunt the corn crib i want to tell you something and then i want your advice first i have discovered by whom and just how my mother and sister were killed second i have determined how these lynchers shall be punished

my poor mother was beaten to death with a horse trace just think of it seventy years old and to meet such a death

and my sister nude was beaten to death amid the jeers and curses of those drunken brutes

as abe recited these details the tears of rage rolled down his cheeks his head dropped upon his breast and he remained silent for a long time malcolm respecting his grief waited for him to recover abe finally resumed saying i have also learned that each archdemon in this horrible crime has a piece of this trace at his home as a keepsake i propose to possess myself of those pieces make a whole trace of them and then let that gang beware i shall take them one by one tie them to a tree and when i have finished with them all there will be five new graves somewhere in this county i shall begin with buck lashum there is but one thing malcolm that deters me i may be compelled to enter the homes of these people especially bucks and steal those pieces

after a long silence malcolm said abe i do not think you should let that stop you i will go with you and help you get them then you will need someone to help handle these fellows you cannot do the whole thing yourself and more i want the pleasure of laying the strap on buck jim wheatley and jack connors both told me to tell you they would be glad to help you in any way you might suggest

what do you say

no malcolm said abe i alone must do this deed

you and your friends will make this state and county your homes i have no home if blood must be shed i must shed it there will be a price on my head no it will never do for you to be drawn into this affair in that way you can help me in other ways

when abe had finished he arose to his feet looked out of the door and remarked well the moon has gone down i shall now go on my errand of stealth my friends who work at the smalys and wardemans will be waiting for me with the different pieces i hope i will have only bucks house to enter and i know exactly where to find the piece he has

i hope he will sleep soundly for if he awakens he will face his maker sooner than he anticipates when i return in the morning i will have the five pieces

with this speech ringing in his ears malcolm watched abe as he disappeared in the gloom

abe went to the wardeman place where he found the pieces imbedded in the earth on the left side of the left post of the big gate at the main road at the smalys he found the pieces sticking through a crack in the barn six boards from the east corner next to the spring then going to buck lahsums home he entered by a back window which he found open and went straight to bucks room where he had been told the piece of trace was tied to a picture which hung over the head of bucks bed these instructions flashed through abes mind as he passed into bucks room all the while asking himself what should he do if discovered he was not discovered however and reached home without accident

next morning when malcolm came to the harness room he found abe busily engaged splicing the pieces of trace

hello abe exclaimed malcolm you are a successful pilferer i see tell me did you have any trouble

not a bit answered abe i found everything just as i expectedâdown by the big gate at the wardemans sticking out of a crack in the barn at the smalys and buck had his piece hanging over his bed when i looked upon that brute sleeping so peacefully the vision of his crime came upon me

i stood over him hoping he would awaken that i might strangle him i did not feel capable of striking him down in his sleep he slept on but with a look of terror on his evil countenance he felt my very presence even in his slumbers his god was merciful to him had he opened his eyes had he indicated to me in any way that he was aware of my presenceâwell

malcolm watched abe for some time in silence then asked what will you do next abe

i have been told by friends that buck is going to ride in the tournament down on the neck next wednesday that he will be gone from home two days he is sending his traps around the road and will ride across the country now there is but one path for him to travel after he leaves the back end of his place and that leads through the gut north of the swamp you know where the solid ground narrows to a neck of ten feet in width well there i shall set a trap for his horse which will cause the animal to throw him i will do the rest this place is six miles from bucks home and his cries cannot be heard that distance i will endeavor to impress upon his mind in the two days i shall engage him that negro women are as sacred as his own and that negro men will have to be reckoned with in the future when their women are assaulted

abe dont make a brute of yourself in this matter said malcolm what you propose to do will be a terrible punishment

i mean for it to be terrible answered abe i mean for my first blow to strike terror to the hearts of these people

malcolm you will see but i must go and study the land at the point i have in mind i will ride kate if you do not object

do not what said malcolm you are getting mighty careful all at onceâasking for the use of a horse i guess i had better tell your dad that you want to use kate and where you are going and for what purpose

both young men laughed as abe rode away he rode to within fifty yards of the place secured his horse and proceeded to lay his plans he first selected a sapling bent it to the ground at a point where bushes overhung the path cut the top out and attached part of a plow line to it passing the line through the bushes and once around a series of stakes driven in a circle on either side of the path with their tops leaning out the plow line formed a loop into which the horse would be sure to step thus causing the line to leave the tops of the stakes release the sapling and thereby tighten the line around the horses leg should it be the foreleg the horse will be sure to go down in front if the hind leg is caught he will plunge and kick unseating the rider

abe expected to profit by the struggle that would follow the springing of his trap the afternoon of the tuesday following abe noted bucks departure and immediately set out at a brisk run for the place at which he hoped to stop buck and his horse he had scarcely seated himself at an unobserved point with his eyes on the path when buck came in sight the horse sprung the trap with his forefoot and began rearing and plunging tearing up the earth for yards buck fell heavily to the ground and before he could recover himself abe was upon him

buck was filled with terror his teeth chattered his lips were purple his eyes bulged abe placed a small rope with a running noose about his neck and ordered him to stand up and keep quiet which he gladly did then cutting the line which held the horse he proceeded with it and buck to a dense nearby thicket buck in his terror begged to be allowed to go home saying mr overley sah yer knows i was always yer friend deed i was im yer friend now what you treat yer friend this way fer mr oberley if yer let me go home i will have my pappy send yer a dollar and a half deed i will

abe made the horse secure after which he fastened the end of the rope that was about bucks neck to a small sapling that was already bent to the ground and when this sapling was released the rope tightened about bucks neck with a suddenness that nearly lifted him off his feet buck grasped the rope and drew the sapling down to him thus taking the strain off his neck when he did this abe dealt him a blow which caused him to scream with pain and to release his hold on the rope which again jerked him by the neck to his toes and held him there

up to this point abe had not secured bucks hands he started toward him for that purpose buck seemed to divine his intention and pleaded mr overley fer gods sake let me go home my mammy

when buck made this reference to his mammy abe sprang upon him with a cry that resembled a wild beast and dealt him a blow on the crown of his head with the trace that hut for the thickness of bucks skull would have crushed it

buck threw both of his hands into the air and with a laugh that appeared not to be human as it echoed through the still forest sank to the ground abe stood looking at him for a long time as he lay prostrate and apparently lifeless suddenly he realized that buck was getting black in the face the rope was slowly choking him to death

he released buck and sat down beside him the shades of night began to fall the moonbeams and the shadows were flirting in the gathering gloom buck to all appearances was dead abe watched him as if he feared that even in death buck might escape him all night he lay motionless

as the sun began to dispel the gloom of the forest abe discerned a movement in him and reached forward to turn his head that he might see his face when buck suddenly raised himself to his elbow and their eyes met abe knew instinctively that he was facing a maniac buck almost bereft of reason could see but one object and that one hateful to him

he bounded to his feet with the quickness of a wildcat and was upon abe before he hardly realized bucks intentions

the struggle that ensued spurred on as it was by a mortal hatred on the one side and an unevenly balanced mind on the other was fierce but of short duration buck in his wild rush endeavored to grasp abe about the middle but failed and only succeeded in securing a hold on his shoulders which enabled abe to more easily throw him buck fell with great force with abe across his body the small of his back struck a stake causing an injury to the spine which paralyzed him from the waist down rendering him totally helpless buck never recovered abe not knowing bucks helpless condition belabored him with his horse trace buck at intervals bursting forth in a laugh that resounded through the forest when abe noticed bucks condition he sat down to think how he might get rid of his victim without killing him outright he finally concluded to take buck back to the place where he was thrown from his horse and where the ground showed a struggle turn the horse loose and leave buck to be found by his friends abe was careful to cut the sapling which sprung the trap close to the ground and to remove all evidences that would tend to show that human hands were responsible for bucks condition the horse soon made its way back to the barn black sue saw it and spread the alarm

i bet dat abe oberley knows sumfin bout dis hos an bout dat chile said sue to herself soon a searching party was formed which included some of the overley negroes who were inspired by curiosity when bucks dogs were turned loose they started for the swamp in full cry and soon had him located every man crowded about with an opinion all finally agreeing that the horse must have kicked buck in the back while his foot was hung in the stirrup

when the wardeman boys heard of bucks mishap tim who had become a local minister concluded he would answer a call from a town in a western territory he left very suddenly about two weeks later abe learned that rex wardeman the one who knocked his mother down in the cabin breaking her jawbone was riding three times a week into the next county to visit a lady whom it was rumored he would soon marry

abe set about to learn the truth he was informed by his friends in the wardeman home that such was the fact that rex seldom returned home earlier than  a m and that he traveled the same path night and day abe was also told that rex was always heavily armed

after an inspection of the path traveled abe found at a point remote from any road or habitation two trees opposite each other close to the path to which wild grapevines were clinging by pulling one of these vines nearer the earth it could be so arranged that a person riding horseback would be swept off his mount by it abe selected the following wednesday night for his attempt it being the dark of the moon

rex rode away from his ladys home whistling softly to himself as he drew nearer and nearer abes trap he became drowsy and permitted his horse to make its own way along the path unaided the bridle rein hanging loose when the animal came upon the vine as abe had arranged it it instinctively lowered its head and quickened its pace and as it passed under the vine rex was caught and lifted from the saddle

before he realized what had happened abe was upon him

he seized rex by the throat and pinioned him to the ground

then began a desperate struggle for the possession of the pistol that rex carried and but for the strangle hold abe had on rexs throat the pistol would have been used with deadly effect upon abe as it was rex succeeded in getting his hand in his coat pocket where the pistol was concealed before abe rendered him selpless

abe bound rex and took him back into the marsh where he had prepared for the vengeance that had mastered him

when rex again gained consciousness and realized into whose hands he had fallen his fear and abject cowardice were despicable abe sat by quietly waiting for the sun to dispel the darkness that he might be better able to complete his work rex true to his cracker nature begged and promised abe to make all amends possible

fer gods sake mr abe aint yer got no heart in yer body he pleaded yer knows my pappy has got a plenty money deed sah hell pay yer lotsâthirty forty fiftyâ only let me go home to my ole pappy 

while making these supplications rex raised himself upon his knees and drew closer to abe who dealt him a terrible blow on the head which rendered him unconscious the sun was high in the heavens when rex again opened his eyes and the sight that revealed itself to him caused him to tremble and close them again

abe who had been watching him observed that he had regained consciousness and told him that his time had come that he had five minutes to prepare to meet his maker

rex cringing whining and pleading dragged himself to abes feet begging to be spared abe spurned him refusing to say another word

at the expiration of the alloted time abe took his victim to a stump to which after stripping him of all clothing he bound him and proceeded to administer the trace to his bare back in a regular stroke

rex pleaded yelled threatened cursed and finally made a last frantic effort to break the thongs that bound him to his post of torture exclaiming i wont die i ll see my po  mammy

this yell of rexs seemed to arouse the halfslumbering demon in abe

your poor mammy curse you curse you for a cowardly hound beat my mother to death  beat the flesh off the nude body of my sister curse you curse you your damnable crime is now being punished yelled abe

as abe was delivering himself of these imprecations his fury seemed to redouble he belabored rex with both hands until in his mad frenzy he fell exhausted beside the limp and lifeless body of his victim

had one of rexs many friends happened upon the scene at this time abe would have become his easy captive when he recovered he stood for some moments seemingly appalled by the terrible crime he had committed

the lifeless body of rex hung to the post torn and bleeding

after his first fright abe concluded to hang a piece of the horse trace about the neck of his victim and leave him to be found by his friends or the vultures and then made his way back to the overley place upon his arrival malcolm wanted to know where he had been and what he had been doing

malcolm suppose i tell you just what i have done will that not make you a party to my crime or whatever you may call it asked abe no malcolm i guess i had better not tell you

after a moment malcolm asked why abe can you not trust me

oh that is not the point i can trust you but i do not want to draw you into this affair of mine

while they were talking one of black sues boys rode up to the gate on rexs horse and asked if they knew the horse and to whom it belonged when asked where it came from the boy stated that he found it in the back lot on nick lashums place nobody on that place seemed to know to whom the horse belonged malcolm did not know as the boy left malcolm turned to abe with the inquiry abe who rode that horse to his death last night tell me i want to know

well said abe  if you must know rex yardeman fell from it last night about five miles back in the timber

when i left him this morning his soul was in paradise

abe what have you done

what i promised my poor mother i would do replied abe quickly

when the boy on rexs horse reached the main road he soon found persons who knew the animal and who directed him to take it to the wardeman place the wardeman home was quiet nothing having been thought of rexs nonappearance

but when the horse was brought in the fear was expressed that he had been thrown and lay somewhere in the timber hurt and helpless the boy was questioned as to where he found the horse he of course knew nothing a searching party was soon formed and on its way to the timber to find rex they were not successful however returning as darkness came on but the next morning with the returning sun a party of searchers rode away from the wardeman place

this party spread out over a large area of timber and soon came upon the mangled and lifeless body of rex at a glance it was apparent to all that human hands had brought about rexs death the opinions as to who committed the deed were numerous and varied si weedels who was ever present on occasions of this kind and ready with his advice was of the opinion that the brothers of the girl whom rex was visiting were the parties who took the young mans life his decision may have been influenced by the fact that one of these boys had beaten him in a horse trade it is strange but not one of the assembled searchers thought of abe all agreed that some fiend among the whites was responsible for the killing

young joe wheatley the sheriff who was present said nothing but listened to the story of each man all the time firmly convinced that he knew the probable murderer after a coroners jury had returned a verdict declaring that rexs death was caused by a party or parties unknown to the jury the clans of each county began to arm and to watch each other buck lashum not being in a condition physically to lead his clan the leadership passed to tom smaly who was known for his drunken brutality

after a days hard riding following the hounds in a great fox hunt tom smaly was not to be found among those who gathered at goose neck inn to commemorate and celebrate the days sport his absence at first caused some comment but mirth ran high and rum flowed so freely that his absence was soon forgotten it was not until next morning that his brother fully realized that tom was missing after an allday search the body of tom was found in the same condition and in the same place that rex wardemans was not so long before

when it became known that another white man had been killed in the same manner at the same place the wise people began to shake their heads some were in favor of calling on the governor for a detective to ferret out the murderers others were opposed to such a move claiming that acounty could look after its own affairs that a county is the same as a state inasmuch as it has the right to handle all matters that arise within its borders

while these fiery arguments as to county rights were in full swing at goose neck inn one of black sues boys a worthless mixture of black sue and nick lashum came forward with the story that he saw abe riding away from the place where tom smaly was found

the next morning a selfappointed posse of citizens good and true soon formed for the purpose of finding abe and lynching him within a very short time after the mob was in possession of this information abe and the whole overley plantation were warned messengers were sent out hurriedly for friends who could be depended on to aid in case of trouble this mob more or less liquorized under the leadership of si weedles mounted on a borrowed horse he never having been able to recover from the disastrous horse trade mentioned above swearing vengeance and promising great things was soon on its way to the overley plantation as they drew near the place a discussion arose as to the gate they should enter

some were for going through the big gate while others favored the back cut

ole mai overley is so dâ funny said their leader in deciding to go in the back way that he might git mad and shoot somebody when he see so many of us comin  up his front way it aint proper fer no white man to git killed fer no nigger 

these people passed through the barnyard on their way to the veranda of the great house where they found malcolm overley and a friend quietly smoking when they lined up in front of him off came their hats overley sat calmly surveying them waiting for the leader to make known their business as no one of them spoke he demanded in an angry voice what the hâ do you dâ meadow hogs want on my place at the same time thrusting his hand into his coat pocket which movement caused them much uneasiness

si weedles started up the steps of the veranda at the same time saying sah mr overley we are on a

stand where you are interrupted malcolm overley

who the hâ told you your place was up here

si moved hack quickly to his comrades with whom he held a short consultation after which he again addressed malcolm overley saying as before sah mr overley we is here on a mission of law and order we has hearn that your nigger abe is the one that is guilty of killing po tom smaly and we came arter him we wants to axe him about hit

who the hâ made the likes of you sheriff of this county

what the damnation business is it of yours who killed that dâ hound you dâ meadow hogs dare to come to my place demanding my boy you better get off this place and never put foot on it again or i will be found shooting the crumbs off you

when he delivered this speech he called to malcolm to bring him his gun malcolm appeared at the door with a winchester in his hands at the same time windows suddenly opened and the muzzles of guns were to be seen si became very nervous three of his comrades left hurriedly si attempted to explain and excuse himself and friends but was cut short by an order to leave and leave damn quick at that moment the sound of clattering horses hoofs were heard on the road leading to the house sheriff wheatley and two deputy sheriffs dashed up

what is the matter here demanded the sheriff of si and four of his friendsâall that were now left of the twenty who made the charge from goose neck inn

we jes earned here to axe mr overley bout his nigger abe we certainly didnt mean no harm we is lawbidin citizens we is

you people get away from here and remember that i am sheriff of this county and that it is not your business to arrest people if you have any information that will lead to the capture of the man or men who killed tom smaly give it to me it is not your business to enforce the law if i ever see or hear of anyone of you five men being on any mans place on such a mission as you are now engaged in i will put you among the breakers now go

yes sah mr joe we is goin answered si weedles as they hurried back through the barnyard

when si and his companions had left the place malcolm a

overley sr greeted the sheriff very cordially saying joe my boy i am proud of you you know better than any man in this county how to handle those crackers come up and let me introduce you to my friend a friend of my college days from nova scotia

after some general conversation the stranger said sheriff i heard mr overley and you use some expressions to those men which they seemed to understand but which i did not mr overleys expression was shoot the crumbs off you what in the world do you mean by that this question brought forth a peal of laughter from all those present

well answered the sheriff that is a slang phrase that should carry an insult with it it means that the person so addressed is low and filthy i am surprised that a fine old gentleman of mr malcolm a overleys ealiber should make use of such slang had it been just plain cuss words i would not have been a bit surprised but what did i say

your expression was i will put you among the breakers 

that expression translated would read i will put you in the chain gang to break stone  laughed the sheriff

well well said the stranger apt indeed i could but notice its effect on those men we do not have that class of men in our section

the sheriff left saying i am very glad to have met you

i hope you may learn to sight a rifle close enough to shoot the crumps off a cracker 

two days later black sues son was found hanging by the neck to a young sapling that had been bent to the ground

he was dead having strangled to death pinned to his breast was a card upon which the following words were written let this be a warning to all niggers who carry tales to the white people

when the news of this young mans death reached black sue her grief and wrath were pitiable this drunken worthless scion the most worthless of all her illegitimate brood was her favorite black sue reached the conclusion that abe was responsible for her sons death she therefore swore vengeance upon him she like all of her kind was an adept in gathering and disseminating scandal she instructed her pickaninnies to say that abe injured buck lashum that he killed bex wardeman that he killed tom smaly that he had now killed their brother this story soon spread over the county a demand was made upon the sheriff for abes arrest sheriff wheatley however refused in the absence of facts to arrest abe feeling and excitement ran high

those who felt the burden of the affairs of the county most heavily met every day at goose neck inn and their sessions continued until midnight when the bar was closed si weedels always the busiest and most ragged citizen at these sessions had undergone another change of heart with regard to abe some of his friends were heartless enough to express the suspicion that the sight of the winchesters at the overley place were responsible for this sudden change si was loud in his protestations and grew louder as the night grew shorter he now insists that no nigger had the nerve to kill a white man like that whoever hearn of a nigger doin sich a thing black sue and her pickaninnies has caused all the trouble in this hyre county for the past ten years them people was killed by some oncivilized critter in the next county thus si talked and argued with kindred spirits while the weeds grew up to his doorsill and the holes in his boots and pants grew larger

to discuss the mysterious deaths noted in the previous chapter and to devise ways and means by which these mysteries could be solved nick lashum and his cronies met at their favorite nook by the pig sty si weedels was still of the opinion that some oncivilized white man from the next county had done the killing jack smaly was of the opinion that abe overley did the deed or that burrell nigger did it his cowardly conscience pointed out to him the real source of the calamities which had overtaken his brother and friends he felt within himself that he would surely be called upon to answer for the part he played in the killing of abes mother and sister nick lashum sr could see no reason why any man in the next county should want to kill anybody in a county neither could casper lashum

si yer is suttenly mistook whos in thet county thet has got nothin gin anybody in this hyre county nobodys bin hurted by them people fer morn twenty yeirs not since jeff snooks took and killed ollie bookerâand none of these boys long to them famlies no sir yer is mistook we is got to look ferdern thet dâ ef i dont tek black sues gess fer hit thet nigger abe done thet killin ise axed my buck morn onct who did thet job for him but he dont seem ter understan by god i â would gin all ise got ter know thet boy war a promisin boy he had his faults but he was a promisin boy now look at him ef i thought thet thet abe overley hurted thet boy il kill every dâ nigger  in the county thet i would

what good would that do father asked nick lashum jr the other negroes did not do it nor are they responsible for what abe has done

thet is jes lek yer forever takin up fer them niggers  shouted nick lashum sr dâ ef i knows who teached yer them sentiments dâ ef i did

no you did not father common sense taught me

answered the son with some warmth it does seem to me that men grown would learn something as they pass through this life when those two women were killed did you feel that every white man in the county should be killed

in course i did not who the hâ ever hearn of white men bein killed fer niggers answered nick sr jes sich talk as thet makes them niggers think they is got the same rights as me and you is got what right is they got to have one hundred and sixty acres and good horses and cattleâ horses thet kin come down the road faster n you kin i tells yer mr nicholas lashum thet yer pappy dont want thet darn talk on his place dâ ef i does this last remark aroused the quarrelsome cracker blood in nick jr who answered hotly no i suppose not your whole bunch was so dâ ignorant the day of the meeting here that you would not let white men talk who had as mucli right to talk as you had now what is the result uncle casper is out and all the offices are in the hands of the people opposed to you your friends are being killed under your very noses and all you know and all you can say and all you can do is kill a nigger dâ such ignorance i have been with people of brains and standing long enough to learn that killing niggers and burning their property is a mighty sorry way to control anything while you and your friends were bellowing nigger these people used their brains and took the office of sheriff away in one night now your friends are being killed and you are bellowing nigger instead of locating the murderer and bringing him to justice i do not wonder that these people call you meadow hogs crackers and the devil knows what not to hâ with your dâ brute ideas i am cashier of the pioneer savings bank i mingle with the best people of the state

must i be forever and continually reminded that i belong to a family of murderers

yes thet is very fine talk but who the hâ ever hearn of killin niggers bein murder asked nick sr

your dâd ignorance is simply maddening answered the son with great wrath can you give a nigger life have you got a right to take that which you cant give i dont care a dâ for these  niggers  but i would like for my family name to stand for something besides brutal assaults and adulterous connection with niggers if this thing keeps up i shall leave the state and go where the curse of cracker ignorance is unknown go where i will not hear at every turn that nick lashum says this and nick lashum says that all of which bespeaks phenomenal ignorance and brutality i am tired of it all

yes i suppose yer is yer an arabella is the only two thet tells ther ole pappy thet he is igrant and all these things whined the old man yer has alays been a good boy nick but cant yer overlook them things thet i learnt when i was a boy

overlook hâ yelled the son are you never going to learn anything am i ever to be reminded that my father is different from the fathers i meet out in the world your whole bunch of dâd ignorant crackers is despicable and nick left with an oath applicable to them all

when nick jr left the crowd began to melt away soon jack smaly nick sr si and casper lashum were left to themselves casper said nick what did i tell yer when yer started thet boy to school twenty odd yeirs ago i tole yer jes what twud be you never hearn my boys talk lek thet why cause i knows as much as they does i took pains not ter let them go no longer than i did thet is what i done

cas yer and nicks ferever cussin at each other said si is yer never goin  ter get ter act lek men when yer gits tergether i wants yer both to do better dâ if i dont

sis remark caused a laugh accompanied as it was by an attitude of authority

in spite of the suggestions offered this assemblage broke up without reaching a definite conclusion as to the killings

in the meantime abe bad expressed his determination to mr overley to quit the place as the crackers were aroused to a point where it was likely they would fire the house and barn because of the fact that mr overley protected him the senior overley however would not listen to abes protests insisting that he was master on his own place

at this time abe was approached by an italian with whom he had been very friendly and who had worked for the lashums for some time he seemed to understand the whole situation and endeavored to persuade abe to use bombs on the white people of the county

abe i maka de bomb i learna in my country i shoota one little birda da counta de costigni he beata me i fixa de bomb under his door stepa he cornea buoy buoy

ha ha his heada go one waya his feeta keep on running i geta my revenga i leava my country i go backa some day rich mana i liva and diea good mana i makea you de bomb no bah no revenga

no tony said abe i do not want your bombs i have no quarrel with the whole county five men killed my mother two of them are dead three live one worse than dead he shall die however that leaves two more to be accounted for were i to use a bomb on the first white man that comes along simply because he is a white man i would commit a cowardly crime for which i would deserve the worst punishment this is not a question of race with me but it is a step back to medieval days when brothers avenged brothers wrongs when the state was not strong enough as in this case to right such wrongs the time is now come when negroes should kill the man or men who on the slightest provocation lynch or take the lives of their kinsmen

when they learn to do that we will have fewer murders of this character to mar our civilization with me your bomb is impossible

you say civilizationa thata for biga mana not for poor mana and blacka mana no civilizationa no gooda

two years later it was announced in the county bulletin that caesar antonio amato of reggio italy had married miss josephine walsh a descendant of one of the oldest families of the state of alabama it is to be hoped that amato absorbed the american idea to the point where he could understand the meaning of our civilization

at this writing we do not understand the american civilization

about this time malcolm received a long letter from de vaux and his tennessee friend they were spending the summer automobiling through the far west it bore the postmark of a small town in nevada that portion of the letter which was of most interest to us reads as follows your section of the country certainly produces some queer characters to say the least i have just had the honor of meeting a preacher an exhorter a regular romping roaring raging rambling backwoods parson of the kind who attracts attention by the use of his lungs if nothing else this man together with his wife  whom he claims to be a mixedbreed indian but whose language would indicate that she is a mixedbreed negro has charge of the only church in this whole country when we first called on him he was not quite steady enough for an interview but when we saw him later after his nap he gave us his lifes history i was surprised to learn that he came from your county he seems to be very well acquainted with buck lashum he says bucks horse crippled him such a pity have you a school of theology in your county you have an advantage over me you are living in an atmosphere of greatness rev and mrs timothy wardeman are living evidences of greatness and they hail from your county how is your friend abe bearing up i hope he has done nothing rash will you and he return to college miss d was in california this summer so i am informed you may know that however with kindest regards to abe yours de vaux

abe sat silent for some moments after the reading of this epistle then said again have those young men done me a very great service this time unconsciously i have tried in vain to locate tim wardeman this letter with its information comes at a very opportune time i had made up my mind to go in search of him which would have been a long tedious hunt now i can go direct his wife black sues girl viney she disappeared about the time tim did and i have no doubt it is she who is with him but we shall soon know malcolm when do you start for college

when do i start for college asked malcolm have you concluded not to go we should start next wednesday

dad said last night that we were to finish this year that he is very proud of the showing we have made have you talked to your father about going

poor old dad i had almost forgotten him no i have not i have had very little to say to him on any subject he will of course want me to finish my course but i do not feel that i should remain at college after what i have passed through in the last two months i shall leave here for oberlin when you do however i will then make my way out west

i am sorry that i must leave jack smaly and buck alive but i will return about christmas

abe then went to his father whom he found sitting silent and alone apparently weighted down by the burden of events which have so rapidly succeeded the taking off of his loved ones

dad you seem worried said abe what is the trouble

yes my son i is worried answered the father ise worried bout yo two munts hab yo  been home an  yo  has not spent two nights wid yo ole dad my son my ole heart tells me that alls not right wid yo when de great day dun kum an de questions axed yo what yo dun wid dem two munts what yo goin say oh my po boy what kin yo say

the old mans head dropped to his breast his whole body quivered tears ran down his careworn cheeks his whole attitude was one of dejection of despair abe stood for some moments gazing intently at his father whose age and helplessness were apparent to him now as never before he suddenly realized what a blow his determination to live for revenge had been to his old christian father his heart swelled with remorse but his purpose was not shaken for one moment he knelt before his father whose hands he took in his own saying dad why spend your last days worrying over a thing which neither of us can remedy you say this case can only be settled at the bar of god dad i sincerely regret that any action of mine should cause you trouble but my mothers death calls for revenge

my boy does yomember what de good lawd say on dat at he say dat revenge is mine does yo feel yosef stronger dan he am does yo feel dat you is on dis eart to do his work or his biddin oh my po boy what i teach yo when yo a leetle boy at yo po mammys knee did i teach you to be vengeful what has yo lef fo de lawd to do in dis matter my boy it am yo ole dads wish dat yo goes bak to school and leve dese pussons in de hans of de lawd if yo does dat yo will tek yo ole fodders blessin wid yo

as abes father spoke these words he laid his hands upon his sons head with a mental supplication to almighty god that he direct abe anew

father answered abe i have come to you to say that i will go with malcolm next wednesday when he leaves for school

the old man closed his eyes and murmured lawd i thank thee

abe remained with his father listening to the old mans admonitions and advice and when he finally left him abe had promised by implication at least that he would do what his father wanted him to do he went immediately to malcolm to whom he unburdened himself

malcolm for the first time in my whole life i have lied to my father i have promised him to do what i do not intend to do and did not intend to do at the time i promised him

oh i have deceived him shamefully

abe what have you promised asked malcolm

i have not promised anything in words but by inference i have promised to leave buck lashum tim wardeman and jack smaly in the hands of the lord i have led my father to believe that i am going to college with you and forget all about my promise to my mother that i would avenge her

god knows what effect it will have upon him when he learns the truth

abe why did you not tell him the truth asked malcolm

malcolm i could not if you had heard that confiding old man talk you would have done just as i did the lord will forgive me i did it that dad may sleep in peace at least until he learns the truth i told him that i would go to college with you next wednesday that much is the truth

well abe you are certainly in a very awkward position

you must tell my father before he makes arrangement for your tuition

malcolm let us go to him at once i want this thing settled now

they found the senior overley dozing on the veranda old abe being at the barn looking after the stock

mr overley i have come to talk to you about my going off to college with malcolm next wednesday said abe

you have have you damnation do you think i want you to wake me up to talk about your dâ school didnt i say go how long have you been on this place that you havent yet learned that i sleep at this hour you did well last year what the hâ do you learn at school that you dont know better than to disturb an old man during the hour he sleeps you both malcolm i am displeased that you let abe awaken me

yes dad im sorry but

but interrupted the father now thoroughly awakened what is the matter what have you young devils hatched now

mr overley i want to tell you how i am going to devote this school year i hope you will bear with me

abe then related all that had passed between himself and his father also his determination to find tim wardeman and wreak vengeance on him

the senior overley listened attentively when abe had finished he sat silent with his eyes closed apparently lost in thought neither malcolm nor abe dared speak

so you want to go out west to kill somebody do you

well if i thought you killed the two valuable citizens who were found dead back in the woods i would have you hanged that i would and you do not feel that you ought to go back to college why

i do not know at what moment the hand of the law may reach me i do not desire to bring disgrace upon the college by being arrested while there answered abe

well i never looked at this dâ business in that light before said mr overley how are you going to live

i have no fear along those lines answered abe i want to get back here by christmas i think that jack smaly would like to meet me about that time i shall avail myself of your kindness as far as oberlin college then i will drop out of sight

hâ boy you are welcome to money to pay your way out and back i know that a good citizen would not let you have this money but i do not want you to walk that distance

i thank you very much mr overley said abe but i cannot accept any assistance from you i know it is needless to ask it but you will look after my father

look arter me said a voice from the yard whose been lookin arter him dese sixtyfive yeirs hows he goin to look arter me

with the arrival of old abe the conversation turned to the approaching departure of the boys abes determination not to attend college the ensuing year was not again mentioned by malcolm a overley sr

the day of their leaving came only too quickly and the boys were on their way to oberlin it was agreed between them that upon their arrival abe would call upon miss watson see dr finley and leave the town immediately he went from the station direct to miss watsons home their eyes met in a long steadfast gaze the one bearing the mute inquiry what have you done the other conveying the desired information miss watson asked no questions she seemed to know intuitively that abe had kept his promise to the dead

abe will you finish your course this year she asked

no nancy i am on my way out west answered abe

i hope to be with you again just before christmas i have stopped in oberlin to talk to you also to pay my respects to your parents i expect to visit dr finley dean sternly and mr donewell after which i shall leave the town

by good fortune abe after leaving the watson home found the three persons whom he most desired to see in the doctors office he was greeted very cordially by them the doctor assuming that abe was back for the school year immediately began to compliment him upon his determination to finish his college course abes embarrassment was not at first apparent to the doctor who when he did notice his confusion asked for an explanation abe stated briefly that unforeseen circumstances had arisen that would not permit his attendance at college this year that he had stopped in oberlin to see his friends and say goodbye to them and that he was going out west and might never return abes vow to avenge the deaths of his mother and sister was known to the doctor dean sternly and mr donewell and they felt that that vow was the basic cause of his determination not to attend college this year dr finley arose from his seat greatly agitated he walked over to abe placing his hand on his shoulder saying my son may i not speak to you in gods name listen to me an old man who has passed the threescoreandten mark and who firmly believes in the brotherhood of mankind

in gods name do not leave this college do not go on this errand to the west do not begin this wreaking of vengeance do not put yourself without the pale of the law do not do that which will bring the wrath of god upon you leave this matter in his hands i know that your provocation has been great i know that you cannot invoke the aid of the law i know that you feel from your point of view that revenge is the only course open to you but why take this matter in your own hands why take your own life in your own hands why leave off the building of a useful life as you seem to have determined to do

doctor my mothers death will then have been avenged

answered abe

avenged exclaimed the doctor a false doctrine

to be avenged you would violate the law of the land to be avenged you would take your own life in your hands to be avenged you would forever put aside the building of a useful life put aside the opportunities that are open to you forever put aside dwarf deaden and transform into an agency for evil those faculties which god seldom bestows upon man in such abundance my son i repeat you will do all these things to be avenged and after you have been avenged what have you accomplished

abe stood looking at the doctor his form seemed to heighten and expand finally he answered in slow and measured tones doctor not being a negro you cannot understand nor can you appreciate my feelings in this matter taking your last argument first granting that god has bestowed upon me in an unusual degree faculties that are susceptible to cultivation must i not also be endowed with the accompanying sensibilities that would tend to make up the mentality of which you speak

doctor had your mother your mother mark you been treated as mine was though she was ten times guilty of what my mother was so wrongfully accused had your sister been lashed upon her nude body until death relieved her sufferings even though she had been guilty of murderâwould you stifle in your breast your desire for vengeance when you knew that the processes of law were a farce and there was no such thing as justice with no other means of redress but retaliation and no remedy for the wrong except the torch the knife or the club would you refuse to hear the cry for vengeance from your dead mother and sister doctor god may have endowed me as abundantly as you say but the one gift from the great jehovah for which i am truly thankful is this right arm of mine

as abe spoke these words he raised his arm aloft in all the pride of youth and conscious strength of manhood then with a sudden burst of passion he exclaimed doctor what do i now care for law life or liberty

could i go calmly through this life trusting to a force which i can neither see nor feel conscious that the brutes who foully murdered my loved ones my poor old mother and my young sister are enjoying liberty would i be a man would you under such circumstances bow your head clasp your hands and trust in the lord life is worth nothing to me now i go forth from here with the deliberate determination to take the lives of those who murdered my poor mother

when abe had finished a silence fell upon the assemblage that was broken by mr donewell who invited abe to walk to his home with him

mr overley said dr donewell what do you expect to do after you have kept your vow i have invited you to walk with me that i might ask you this question i am not censuring you mark you but as i place myself in your position i can see nothing that i could do my life would be a blank

have you considered well the step you have taken

yes mr donewell i have considered answered abe

and if i do not forfeit my life in this attempt the time allotted me from the consummation of my vow to eternity will be spent in the upbuilding of my people in some foreign land perhaps but i am frank to say that i feel that i have nothing for which to live why should i care to live my poor old father now on the very brink of the great beyond is all that binds me to this earth

why mr overley asked mr donewell i hoped there might be a young lady somewhere who would influence you to resume your course at this college

yes yes said abe there is a young lady from whom i wrung a promise when the enormity of this crime was upon her but who is too good too pure to have her life linked to one whose hands will be red with human blood when i next see her i shall bid her forget me i shall give back her promise i shall then be an outcast a homeless wanderer an outlaw maybe with my hand raised against mankind and a price upon my head god alone knows how it will end but no matter how it ends no matter what i am forced to do the dying cries of my poor mother and my outraged sister shall be answered by the dying cries of their brutal murderers

though i face death at the fiery stake in this world though i am sure to be engulfed in the fires of hell in the next world my mother shall be avenged

as abe uttered these words he stopped short looked mr

donewell full in the face and remarked perhaps i had better not go further sir i am already a murderer

mr donewell gazed at abe for some moments in silence

in spite of his conviction that abe was wrong in his determination he could not but admire him the thought ran through his mind that here is a splendid life wrecked one of gods rare creations one of natures noblemen made wretched and reckless by the wanton killing of his mother and sisterâa killing directly traceable to lust and drunken brutality after some moments  silence mr donewell took abe by the arm resuming their walk

mr overley i feel for you my heart is with you but my reason tells me that you are wrong i would to god that i might be of some service to you that i could say or do something that might help you to the right course what can i do to help you

mr donewell i know of nothing you can do for me but away down in the state of alabama there are two old men who are dear to me who have made great sacrifices for me

i wish there were some way in which you could look after them and help them to spend their last days in peace on the old plantation mr donewell do this and you will surely be rewarded in heaven i will leave you now sir

as abe extended his hand to his friend his eyes filled with tears he said simply goodbye mr donewell i may never see you again

goodbye my boy was all that mr donewell could say

when left to himself dr donewell recalled abes words see that they spend their last days in peace on the old plantation after some thought he recalled dr finleys remarks concerning the conditions under which malcolm and abe entered the college he determined to have a thorough investigation made at once which investigation resulted in the disclosure that the mortgage on the overley place was about to be foreclosed that some of malcolm a overleys friends were pooling their money to buy the place in for him

mr donewell instructed his solicitor to buy the place in at any cost when the day of sale came nick being precluded from bidding left that duty to casper the bidding started slowly and it seemed at first as if the probable price brought would not pay the mortgage soon a stranger raised the last bid of caspers one thousand dollars casper stood aghast

he raised the bid one hundred dollars however the stranger bid one thousand dollars more casper yelled five hundred dollars morn thet last bid the stranger calmly bid one thousand dollars more neither nick lashum nor his cohorts could understand this move they consulted together after which at the request of the auctioneer they bid one hundred dollars more

the stranger who was seated in a public carryall arose remarking in a loud voice mr auctioneer i propose to have this place if it costs me a half million i bid twentyfive hundred dollars more

mr casper lashum will you let this grand old place get away from you for seventeen thousand five hundred dollars

do i hear a bid of one hundred dollars more seventeen thousand five hundred dollars for property which is worth more than fifty thousand dollars mr zeph smaly do i hear one hundred dollars more seventeen thousand five hundred dollarsâgoing five hundred dollars more said smaly at this point malcolm a overley with tears in his eyes supported by old abe made a mute appeal to big joe wheatley and jack connors big joe wheatley with his clinched hand aloft pushed himself through the crowd close to the auctioneer shouting may i forever be damned if i permit this place to get away from my old friend overley i bid

before he could offer his bid the stranger who was beside him held his hand up to his gaze in the palm was a card upon which was engraved in red the words life brother

big joe wheatley immediately withdrew making his way to malcolm a overley to whom he whispered he is one of us life brother is in his hand

all eyes were now centered upon the stranger what would he do next i bid two thousand dollars more he said

what could he mean by such bidding was he trying to put somebody in a hole how did he silence big joe wheatley so easily a trap si weedels whispered to casper lashum

i dont give a dâ i wants thet place and ise goin ter have hit i bids five hundred dollars more said casper

well you will have to pay for it if you get it said the stranger you will give dollar for dollar i bid five thousand dollars more

casper lashum again consulted with his friends they concluded that the stranger could not stand another raise of one thousand dollars so with a great flourish he bid one thousand dollars more the bid was scarcely made before the stranger cried i bid five thousand dollars more nick lashum sr and his friends not being accustomed to such to them reckless use of money stood aghast not knowing what to do nick lashum jr explained to his father that the last bid took the selling price np to thirtyone thousand five hundred dollars all the place was worth and if the stranger refused to bid again he nick would have more than twentyfive thousand dollars cash to raise over and above his mortgage that this stranger was setting a trap to break him

but nick sr whose cupidity was now thoroughly aroused whispered to casper to bid one thousand dollars more

naw exclaimed casper who the hâs goin ter git they money together bid one thousand dollars more casper when my homes gone yoll gin me one lek you did them eighty acres yer put yer own head in the trap yer is a nice

thirtyone thousand five hundred dollars going

going yelled the auctioneer now thoroughly satisfied with his prospective fee goingâonce mr zeph smaly do you bid one thousand dollars more mr casper lashum are you done do i hear one hundred dollars more this property is worth fifty thousand dollars if it is worth one cent

goingâtwice thirtyone thousand five hundred dollars

make it one thousand more mr wardeman will you let this opportunity pass are you all done going going

gone this gentleman here gets the place for thirtyone thousand five hundred dollars the bargain of his life mr

john k evers is my name said the stranger

mr john k evers the terms of this sale of course are known to you one thousand dollars at time of sale balance in thirty days

yes said mr evers i am prepared to comply with the terms here and now

it is not necessary to go into details here in the road sir

said nick lashum jr we will drive to the bank where we can arrange all matters and where the papers are to be found   this was satisfactory to mr evers who made the deposit and promised to come to the bank next day at  p m and make the final payment he then drove to the overley place he found malcolm a overley seated on his veranda surrounded by his friends as he drew near the group they asked each other who can he be

he is surely one of us said big joe wheatley he gave the sign known only to the inner circle amongst us but we will see

mr evers advanced to malcolm a overley and extended hand saying in a low voice life brother with the accompanying grip

i am indeed more than glad to meet you mr evers

said malcolm a overley but you have put it out of my power to ever gain possession of my home oh my god

six generations of overleys have lived on this place and now we must go

say not so sir said mr evers i bid this place up to show those crackers that they may never expect to obtain possession of any of our ancestral homes i would have bid indefinitely as i have the means at my disposal now you of course understand that the amount over and above the mortgage goes to you i do not want your home nor do the people whom i represent this is december th december th christmas day the real owner will present himself and settle matters with you you will be satisfied that is all that i can say at present i am very glad to have had the honor of meeting these gentlemen of whom i heard so much before i came to your end of the state added mr evers when introduced to the gentlemen present after a few more unimportant remarks he took his departure a few days later mr evers sent a full statement to mr donewell concerning this transaction

by way of explanation it may be here mentioned that all the old aristocratic families in this state are oathbound for mutual protection life brother being their password

malcolm left abe at the station and went directly to miss mabel donewells home where he was very warmly greeted

malcolm why did yon not wire me that you were coming asked miss donewell i would have had some friends here to welcome you where is your friend abe

why ask for abe where am i did i not hurry from the station to find the girl whom i love where would you be likely to find him and you have not even offered me your hand i know abes little girl has done better than that

well mr overley do you expect me to offer you my hand

i am going to take it whether you offer it or not

laughed malcolm as he attempted to seize her hands

at this point mrs donewell appeared at the door and remarked why mabel what does this mean

it means mother that mr overley is trying to take my hand he finds fault with me for not offering it to him

mrs donewell i did think that after several months absence miss donewell would at least shake hands with me

i was endeavoring to instruct her as to how she should conduct herself toward the best of friends answered malcolm

i suppose mr overley you mean to infer that her mother has been derelict in that respect said mrs donewell

oh no by no means answered malcolm quickly i would not presume for a moment to even insinuate that miss mabels training has not been all that could be desired i can testify that with this single exception her conduct has always been above criticism

you have been very observant mr overley remarked miss donewell one would conclude from your remarks that you are competent and willing to set up a standard of deportment for the young ladies of your acquaintance

mrs donewell do you not think your daughter a little severe in her comments asked malcolm

before mrs donewell could answer malcolms query mr

donewell came into the room

mr overley i am very glad to see you very glad that you are hack to finish your course

i am very glad to be back answered malcolm this old college is very dear to me we form ties at college that should never be severed

father what is the matter asked mrs donewell you look as solemn as a judge who is about to pronounce a death sentence upon some person whom he does not believe guilty

well i feel just as you express it said mr donewell

i have just passed sentence upon a young man whom i admire and respect my heart tells me he is right in his determination to take the law in his own hands his is a position calculated to try the strongest i would

you have seen my friends abe mr donewell interrupted malcolm what has he told you he means to do

he insists that his vow must be kept said mr donewell

his only concern is for two old men in alabama who seem to have made great sacrifices for him his concern is that they spend their last days quietly on the old plantation what can he mean by that remark i tried to persuade him to remain at the college with us this year but he would not

he has a mission to perform in the west he says i hope something unforeseen will prevent the fulfillment of that mission

mr donewell nothing but death will stop abe said malcolm i have not tried to dissuade him for the reason that i know it would be useless he will surely keep his vow

mr overley what vow has your friend abe made

asked miss donewell do you refer to his vow to avenge his mothers death i thought those men were arrested at the time released do you mean to tell me that the men who committed such a dastardly crime were released then i do not blame abe i would take the law in my own hands mother dear were you to meet a like fate how can such crimes be overlooked under a civilized government

miss donewell you do not understand the sentiment that prevails in the land of my birth answered malcolm that sentiment does not pronounce it a punishable crime to kill negroes either men women or children we do not believe in that doctrine but it prevails nevertheless the unwritten law is that no white man no matter how low and depraved shall die or be deprived of his liberty for the mere killing or maiming of a negro man woman or child abe knows this

he acts accordingly i do not blame him he is doing no different than other persons classed as good citizens have done

is it possible that men live and worship god who commit such crimes and see no harm in them asked mrs donewell

mother what mr overley says is only too true said mr

donewell it is to be hoped that the influence of brotherly love may change all this some day

mr donewell you do not understand the nature of this cracker blood if you think that anything short of an infusion of new blood will change this sentiment this blood asserts itself no matter where you find itâin the united states senate in the house of representatives in the governors chair in the pulpit on the rostrum on a pullman dining carâanywhere this cracker blood predominates there you find a bloodthirsty sentiment toward the negro these people have had access to the bible and biblical teachings for centuries but have they learned the ten commandments

no and they never will not until god almighty injects into their veins a newer and purer bloodâa blood that will bring about a complete change of natural instincts we people of the south who believe that every man has a right to life liberty and happiness have studied these people and have come to the conclusion that new blood injected into the cracker is all that will save the southland these people are nonprogressive they produce little and consume much

the negroes are outstripping them at every turn and let me say that herein lies the trouble the cracker will not do himself and resents with great fierceness the progress made by his black neighbor but where is this new blood to come from some states have agents soliciting emigrants contracting for them abroad in violation of the laws of the united states when they come here they look the cracker over turn from him to the better class of negroes or leave the country they will have none of the cracker and the birth rate of the mulattoes goes on and on where will it end we have men in public life who have negro blood in their veins these men are fiercest in their denunciation of the negro in a few more generations in some sections of the south the line will be obliterated much as some of us may deplore it

mr overley you draw a gloomy picture of the future of the south said mr donewell can you see no light of hope no gleam away in the far distant future that would indicate an awakening in this cracker element

no i can see nothing in them answered malcolm they are today where they have been for generations with an exception here and there where one has reached the united states senate he stands even there for those things which have disgraced the south in the governors chair some lowbred cracker has brought disgrace upon the state there is nothing you can do with them as a whole they are intractable unteachable and incapable of cultivation they simply multiply like the germs of a contagion fighting ever at the vitals of the body politic but where has abe gone mr

donewell

your friend has gone to say goodbye to miss watson

answered mr donewell after which he will see you then leave for the west

abe after leaving mr donewell went to miss watsons home and took his final leave of the family saying that he would return the week before christmas he then went to malcolms room to await his arrival malcolm soon came into the room fully persuaded to try to show abe the error of his way he found abe seated by the table gazing at a little homespun jacket which he held as the great teardrops fell like rain upon the garment malcolm stood for amoment as one suddenly awakened from a dream

abe where did you get that little jumper he asked

oh mammy rinda made that for me years ago let me see it yes this is one of mine here is the family coat of arms she sewed on the collar sh poor old mammy rinda

how i would love to see you now abe do you remember

do i remember my god malcolm how can you ask

now abe be reasonable said malcolm i want to ask you about the good things mammy rinda used to fix for us

i remember her as the only woman who nursed me who sang me to sleep to whom i told the story of my sufferings and who always comforted me and soothed my pains now she is gone and by the hands of murderers curses on them abe when do you start for the west i will go with you those hellhounds must surely die malcolm forgot for a moment the fine resolutions he had made to persuade abe to stay at school he remembered nothing but that that old black woman the mother of his childhood had been foully murdered the little garment took him back to the days and acts of her kindness and love never to be forgotten

malcolm sat with his face in his hands for several moments

he finally said abe i want to help you god knows i do

but in what way how can i help you most poor old mammy rinda the only mother i ever knew

malcolm arose and walked to abe placing his hand upon his shoulder saying abe you are my brother the brother of my childhood why did god almighty make you black and me white make us to love and revere the same things alike in all respects but color and this world holds you responsible for your color abe continued malcolm as they clasped hands what can i do now to help you

malcolm you can best serve me by not becoming involved in these crimes i am committing answered abe while i appreciate your feelings in the matter and believe you are willing to avenge my mother it is not right that you should do so you should not stain your hands with human blood

you cannot justify yourself before man or god this is my affair and mine alone i have come to say goodbye to you malcolm i am going to find tim wardeman he shall not escape me but i feel that i am leaving my brother if not in blood in unity of soul malcolm brother look after my old father see that he wants nothing if i never return and he should learn the truth tell him what i have confessed to youâ that i lied to him that he might not suffer the anguish the knowledge of my errand would bring to him if i ever return i pray god that it will not break his heart can there be a god malcolm is there a god that directs and shapes the courses and destinies of nations alike why my brother are we brothers yet as far apart as the poles north and south and held apart because i am black and you are white

de vaux and his friend ready and willing with their money and their blood to defend me would not sleep under the same roof that sheltered me because they are white and i am black

this must be the god that rev dr snell down home preached about you have no conception malcolmâyou can have no conceptionâof the terribly humiliating effect of this undefinable something that makes me an object of scorn of derision something to be shunned to be ever set apart from other men not because i am not decent clean and orderly but because god made me black a something that white men with the christian love for their fellow men in their hearts and millions of money in their pockets have not the moral courage to stand up before the world and combat though the sermon on the mount is against this unbrotherly feeling they are unwilling though professed followers of christ to say this black man is my brother and has a mans rights  they cannot take a black man into their religious institutions even when he is weak and exhausted by the toils and disappointments and diseases of this world and say rest here in peace brother god will show you the way that christian spirit of brotherhood is reserved for all nations and races of the earth save the american negro in all civilized communities the negro even the american negro is welcome and welcomed save in such communities as are protected by the star spangled banner the emblem of the land of the free and the home of the brave i leave you now malcolm but i feel that god has made some white men after his own image i feel that should i never come back my good name will not suffer in your keeping goodbye my brother

goodbye old boy said malcolm as their hands doubled over each otherâand abe was gone

as malcolm stood listening to abes receding footsteps he suddenly remembered that abe had no money taking all he had forty dollars he wrapped it in his handkerchief well knowing that abe would not accept it if given openly and called to abe saying that he wanted him to take this handkerchief as that was all he had to give him abe placed the handkerchief in his inside pocket remarking that he would keep it always

after abes departure malcolm soliloquized why was abe not made white the same as i am why should a man of his fine intellect and sensibilities be placed in this world where he is looked down upon even by the most ignorant of white men what indeed must be his feelings as he meets that sentiment at every turn but tim wardeman will surely die abe will come back as he said he would and go south with me and finish the rest poor old mammy rinda my old black mother i nursed at that breast drew my life from her care father has told me time and again that but for mammy rindas care i would not have lived now she is dead am i not a craven that i do not avenge her is she not the only mother that i ever knew beaten to death my god and i have not struck a blow in her defense nor have i uttered one word in protest shame shame and i am a white man i shall go back home and when abe returns he will find nothing to be done i shall finish where he left off

i shall see mabel and go tomorrow

with this determination uppermost in his mind malcolm sought the sleep which try as he would was denied him

abe after leaving malcolm went direct to the station catching the chicago express while thinking over the events of the day malcolms gift presented itself to his mind upon examining the handkerchief he discovered the money which malcolm had concealed in it his first impulse was to return it to malcolm when he arrived in chicago he concluded after much thought however that to send the money back to malcolm would be an offense which would wound his feelings he felt that malcolm had made a sacrifice for him which he should appreciate his mind turned to the working out of some plan by which he could accomplish his mission without detection abe found that his money amounted to sixty dollars all told and that he must find employment to procure funds to pay his passage to st louis

while searching about the docks for a job he fell in with a person who interested him a great deal his new friend was a young white man apparently thirty years of age well educated but a slave to drink who said his name was draper

he could not be induced to talk further about himself he appeared to take to abe at sight draper worked upon the docks when he felt so disposed seeming always to have a job at his disposal he procured a job for abe the second day after they met while waiting for a boat abe asked him why he did not let liquor alone get himself together and go back to his home and friends

draper you are a bright man you are college bred you come of good stock you haveno excuse in the world for living as you do now i am not trying to lecture to you i simply hate to see you in this condition come old man tell me why you are throwing your life away

black this is the name he gave abe when they first met i do not acknowledge your right to ask me such questions but your motive is a good one and i will tell you what i have never told my own brother the last of my blood living you say that i come from good stock you are right

i come from the best in the state of louisiana my brother and myself are the only survivors however i came through oberlin college my brother is there now and will finish this school year i think i have a letter from him in which he begs me to come to see him or let him know where he can see me black what would you do send for the kid or go to him do you think i would look good at college in these togs well i guess not we have money between us plenty of it what do i care

yes yes said abe but draper you have not told me why you do not care what makes you so reckless 

black he said i have been grossly deceived by a woman i loved her beyond all reason she deceived me married another man inferior to me in all respects and

say draper does he keep sober laughingly inquired abe

why do you laugh black asked draper

i did not intend to offend you but you assume that you are superior to somebody answered abe look at yourself may not this young lady have seen your weak point and been afraid to trust her future in your hands do you think that being deceived by a woman is a sufficient excuse for your doing those things which would break your mothers heart were she living no draper you are showing a weakness that this young lady may have discovered and you are simply justifying her cut the booze out old man see your brother go home and be a man 

black you are certainly taking great liberty in telling me what to do i did not ask you for your advice did i

but ill think this thing over

come on draper there is our boat we can get seven hours off her that will take us up to dark then we can go to the y m c a

y m c a asked draper what put that into your head i have not been inside of one for two years then they drove me out but we will go

that night abe and his friend made their way to the y m c a buildingâa large and commodious place given over to the reformation and upbuilding of the men along the docks the building was filled with all the conveniences needful for such work the dormitory was a model in itself

after hearing a long and very instructive lecture by a local preacher without a charge abe and his friend betook themselves to the library they had been seated but a short time when a gong sounded and the inmates of the library arose and began to file out of the room abe and his friend sat still

soon the superintendent came to them remarking that he observed they were strangers he also remarked that the gong had sounded for bedtime turning to draper he asked do you expect to tarry with us tonight 

yes that is what we came for answered draper

well erâyou mightâbut erâyour friendâhe er

stammered the good man

he erâhell what is the matter with my friend

asked draper

the chargeless minister who had just been discoursing so eloquently on the brotherhood of mankind together with two other persons who were evidently christian workers joined the group well erâthe fact of the matter is our rules forbid the sleeping of colored men here we will do all else we can for them said the superintendent

oh i see dagoes sheeniesâany old nationâis welcome but the american negro said draper come black lets go back to con mc nultys we can get a room over his booze joint but you cannot get one in this christian institution

black i promise you not to touch a drop tonight then turning to the minister he remarked doctor how can you reconcile the turning out into the streets of this man at this hour of night with the doctrine you labored with so eloquently for one and onehalf hours this evening the rules of your y m c a are paramount to the teachings of christ it appears

before the man of god could answer abe and draper had passed out into the street

black dont let a little thing like that worry you said draper we are not far from a bed and we have the price

these biblebacks are something awful they dont have to save the soul of an americanborn negro but they will take  your money and go away off to africa and hunt up some j heathen who does not understand their love for him nor their talk nor their tracts here is macs place

mac we want two rooms

sure dannie me bye sixteen and seventeen show the gintlemen up said mc nulty without a moments hesitation

several weeks after the y m c a episode while on their way to the docks abe suddenly asked draper what his brothers name was saying that he had some friends at oberlin college

black you ask too many questions said draper but i will tell you that kids name is leon de vaux he is thewhy black what is the matter

abe had grasped draper by the shoulder and stood looking at him in a way that was puzzling to his new friend

leon de vaux and what is your name asked abe

my name what the hâ do you want to know that for

you are the most persistent black man i ever saw let go you are hurting me are you crazy said draper all in one breath well i will tell you my name is napoleon de vaux i am the ninth de vaux of that name but why do you ask

abe was about to unburden himself but wanted one more proof that this friend was what he seemed to be

one more question said abe what nickname has your brother

we called him onnie when he was a boy and they called me nips now are you satisfied asked draper

yes my friend perfectly tonight after work i will tell you something that may interest you i will say now however that i know your brother and a man is he de vaux i will never call you draper again this is my last day on the docks i am going to leave the city tomorrow i have saved the amount of money that i needed and more i am going to the far west

black i am sorry to hear that you have been an inspiration to me your disinterested friendship has kept me sober for three weeks i have never before come in contact with a black man like you i feel like a new man we need not work today let us talk i want to hear your story

well said abe after some thought let us hire a boat and go fishing this is my last day with you and we may as well spend it in pleasure i want to say something to you which i hope you will appreciate

abe and his friend were soon out on the lake at the end of a deserted pier

black tell me about my brother said de vaux i am anxious to hear about him i have not seen him for seven years he was a kid when i left home

he is no kid now he has been very kind to me answered abe abe then told de vaux the part his brother played in his troubles of how his brother believed in him when he was accused of stealing malcolms pipe of de vauxs sending men down to alabama to investigate the killing of his mother and sister of the fact that he offered to go with him to his home to avenge the killings of how his letter put him on the track of tim war deman and ended by saying that there was nothing in the world he would not do for him and that he would never be able to return his kindness

abe you have paid him you have saved his brother from a drunkards grave said de vaux when i first saw you i knew that you were a different kind of black man from any that i ever met i liked you at sight but when you began to point out to me my worthless life i began to sober up i felt the shame that only a southern man of my blood can feel when his shortcoming are pointed out to him by a negro i felt at first that even this negro feels himself above me i know you better now you are a man although you are black you are my friend i am proud of that fact you have awakened the de vaux blood in me

you have done what the y m c a failed with their rot and tracts to do i also shall leave tomorrow i go to oberlin to see onnie then i shall go home a new man abe listen this is on the word of a de vaux if you ever need a friend if you need help on this errand of yours whatever it may be if you need money no matter what amount i will come or will send it i care not to what part of the world i may have to go or send that stands until death

de vaux i appreciate your offer but i cannot draw any man into this affair of mine said abe you certainly make me feel proud when you say i have persuaded you to join your brother tell him that i shall always remember him tell him when he is governor of his state to deal leniently with the misguided ones of my race who appeal to him we had better go ashore now it is getting dark

abe we will have a farewell supper tonight then we part maybe forever said de vaux

these two men parted the next day one bent upon beginning life anew with the world open to him notwithstanding his downfall the other to seek the men who had ruined his life by murdering his mother

they never met again

abe left chicago going direct to st louis he then made his way as a laborer to nevada entering the country in which he hoped to find tim wardeman

after a short search he located his man in a small mining camp where wardeman was known by his loose habits and hard preaching his wife  was also known to all the miners in that section abe set about to learn something of tims habits and found that tim spent much time fishing

abe determined to surprise him while engaged in his pastime

while loitering about tims cabin abe heard him call to his wife saying yinnie i am goin fishin i believe them fishll bite bettern they did yestiddy

goin fishin cried yinnie yer is always goin fishin i never hears you say yer is goin to chop wood ner tote a pail er water yer better tak dis chile out in der sun ef yer dont wat hit ter die

i got no time to nus yer kid growled tim

no in course yer haint snapped yinnie but yer had time to bring hit hyre yer aint no man yer know dat

tim shouldered his poles and walked away without further comment soon he was seated on the edge of a mountain pool singing softly to himself camptown race track five miles long du a du a do camptown ladies sing this song du a du a do gwine to run all night gwine to run all day i bet my money on the bobtail nag some one take and bet on de bay

suddenly there was a movement behind him looking up lie found abe overley standing over him with a horse trace in his hand tim collapsed and would have fallen into the water had not abe caught him and pulled him away from the bank when he recovered he looked at abe with bulging eyes and fear and guilt were stamped on his every feature

their eyes met tim felt that his time had come his craven heart manifested itself his one endeavor was to get away

he bounded to his feet in a vain attempt to escape but was felled to the ground by a terrific blow on the top of the head that rendered him unconscious when he regained his senses he found himself stripped of clothing bound to a stump and abe standing over him with a horse trace ready in his hand to administer the terrible blows that tim felt were sure to come he began to plead

mr abe would yer 

did you ever see this horse trace before asked abe holding the trace before tims eyes

how kin i tell ise seed so many answered tim

how many have you used on helpless old women demanded abe

deed mr abe i never did sich a think in my whole life was tims answer

liar hissed abe at the same time bringing the trace down on tims shoulders with a force that split the skin

take that and thatâmaybe you can remember an old woman whom you beat to death with this very trace curse you i am now going to treat you as you served her i am going to beat you to death

my god mr abe spare me he pleaded think of my wife and chile they will suttenly starve without me to find for them

your wife and child they will suffer did my poor old mother suffer did my sister suffer when you brutes were tearing her garments from her back thundered abe

take that you cursed brute and that and that yell you dog did my mothers cries stop you yell curse you

your cries are what i have come to hear ha ha yell

yell damn you yell

abe stood over tim and belabored him with the trace first with an even stroke that was cruel and diabolical in its sameness of contact with tims body each stroke cutting deeper and deeper into the flesh abes temper arose with tims cries he soon began to wield the trace with both hands regardless of where the blows fell until he stopped from exhaustion dropping down beside his victim who was unconscious

abe waited for tim to recover thinking then to finish his work it was nightfall before tim recovered although abe had repeatedly deluged him with water

tims first cry was spare me mr abe spare me fer my ole father

spare you for your old father yelled abe did you spare my sister for her old father

mr abe my po ole mother she with a cry that was beastly in its fierceness abe sprung upon tim dealing him a shower of blows that soon rendered him lifeless tim as the life left his body gave vent to one cry which was heard by two miners who together with yinnie were in search of tim they immediately returned to their cabins the miners leaving vinnie in great haste

when abe discovered that tim was dead he cut a piece of the trace and hung it about his neck after which he made his way to the cabin where he found vinnie cowering in great fear the cry which she heard having completely unnerved her when abe strode into the room she instinctively knew what had happened but when she saw the bloodstained horse trace in abes hand her terror rendered her helpless

abe stood in the gloom of the poorly lighted room gazing intently at her vinnie was held transfixed by his gaze her eyes bulging her tongue refusing to move at last she whispered in a voice uncertain and weak abe overley

yes said abe i have come to tell you not to move out of this cabin not to let any person in nor to tell any person on earth that you ever saw me in this country if you do the voice that you heard on the hill an hour ago will call you to that door do you understand

yes abe i does an will do jus as yer says was her trembling reply but abe yer is goin way dont leave me here we was chillen togedder yer tooked me ter sunday school many a time tek me back ter the ole place abe ill be yer wife i swears ter yer abe i never had a nigger man in all my life ise always been a good woman i

been a good woman was abes contemptuous reply

what do you call that pointing to the child be my wife move out of this cabin before twelve oclock tomorrow night and you will join tim wardeman in hell with this remark abe left yinnie as he had a distance of ten miles to walk to catch the overland express to utah city

abe reached that city in safety he then went to san francisco from which city he shipped on a coastwise steamer plying between san francisco and vancouver

from vancouver abe made his way to windsor canada from which point he wrote malcolm asking whether it was advisable for him to come to oberlin malcolm wrote him that he might come in perfect safety and abe left windsor arriving in oberlin ten days before christmas

when he left vinnie she sat for a long time trying to think what was best to do suddenly she thought of a miner by the name of hutchins who had been very friendly to her in tims absence she arose and looked out of the door remarking that surely it was after twelve oclock in reality it was little past sunrise vinnie determined however to make her way to hutchins cabin the location of which she knew very well

hutch ise come ter ax yer what i am ter do tim aint come back an me an ben an jim waters hern sick a yell when we was lookin fer him thet we was feared to go any furder

well vinnie i am sure i dont know answered hutehins where did this yell come from 

over by the pool in devils holler said vinnie

vinnie you stay here i will take jim and ben and see if i can find the parson was he drunk or sober when he left home

he was sober he haint been drunk now for morn a week hutch ill stay right here till yer comes back and longer too ef yer says so

after several hours hunt this trio of tims members found their parson bound to a stump dead his body covered with cuts and bruises and a small piece of horse trace on a string tied about his neck hutchins hastened back to vinnie to break the sorrowful news while jim and ben went in search of a team to convey the body to the parsonage

vinnie said hutchins as he entered the cabin in great haste you are free the parson is dead we found his body now ah what did you say when i left about staying here

i said i would stay here if yer said so answered vinnie

yes but what are you going to do with that child that is the parsons child i dont want it

no it aint hisn its yourn answered vinnie

mine no it is not mine you cannot put that on me

said hutchins

well its as much yourn as its hisn yer knows thet dont yer

hutchins agreed to take vinnie to himself three years later he struck a very rich vein of ore and left the mining camp taking his family of three children and his halfbreed indian wife with him it is not known whether vinnie ever saw her mother and brothers again it is to be hoped that their new life and new surroundings will be an inspiration to them

parson tim was taken to the parsonage by his members and prepared for burial in the absence of either undertaker or preacher the preparation and burial were not of long duration tim died as he had livedâa miserable wretch

upon abes arrival in oberlin he proceeded at once to miss watsons home after a short wait miss watson came into the room greeting him with a smile saying so you have arrived how long have you been in town

i have been

i have been in town just thirteen minutes said abe so solemnly that miss watson gazed at him in wonderment i came to you direct from the station there is something i want to say to you and then i shall leave oberlin immediatelyâ without seeing another person nancy i have been thinking of your promise that you would some day be my wife i have come to the conclusion that i should not hold you to that promise and that i should not expect you to marry me after i have steeped my hands in human blood

nancy i giveâi releaseâi insist that you east me off for your own good you should not marry me in simple justice to yourself you would always think of me as a murderer

our children would have a murderer for a father as you pressed your child to your breast you would be oppressed with the feeling that its father is a murderer i cannot bring you to this god alone knows where or how my life will end

i therefore do not feel that i am showing my love for you by dragging you into the mire with me

abe listen to me said miss watson earnestly i understand and appreciate all that you have said i thought of those things before i gave you my promise my father has since spoken to be along the same lines but i see no reason why i should change toward you i will keep my promise

nancy your confidence in me gives me strength and i love you more for it said abe implanting a fervent kiss upon her forehead

abe what do you propose to do now asked miss watson

i am going home to settle accounts with jack smaly and buck lashum answered abe

abe when all this is ended what will you do the rest of your life inquired miss watson

i do not know nancy i shall do something that will gain us a livelihood was abes reply

when are you going home when do you start was miss watsons next query

i will leave here tomorrow at midnight i want to join jack smaly in his christmas festivities answered abe

but before leaving i want to see mr donewell i will leave you now may i return later

i will inform you when you return whether or not you may remain laughed miss watson

abe went immediately to malcoms room where he found the latter hard at work

hello malcolm how are you are you still in the lead in your classes you look well hard study and good company seem to agree with you why what is that you are reading for what are those clothes being aired i never saw those full dress clothes before whats coming off

going to a ball dont let my coming stop you i want to abe overley interrupted malcolm i have been looking for you for several days you are hurting my hand

how can i answer all those questions i am not going to a ball i am going to be married

be what exclaimed abe be married will your father be present when will the event take place tonight want me to stand with you malcolm are you crazy that would never do tell me about it

malcolm told abe that he and miss mabel donewell were to be quietly married that evening and were to start immediately for cleveland and new york leaving new york in time to reach home christmas day abe was also informed by malcolm that he had not consulted his fatherâthat the whole thing was intended to surprise him

i have no doubt that it will surprise him said abe

you have my word for it that what he will say will also surprise your bride

be that as it may i want you to stand with meâto give me away laughed malcolm

i have no clothes said abe nor do i think it proper for me to join the company in which i would find myself should i accede to your request

i have had several full dress suits brought here for you to select one from said malcolm it is out of the question for you not to be present at my marriage you are my only friend at this college would you desert me at this time

no malcolm of course not i will wear those clothes and try to look happy for your sake said abe but malcolm this is very sudden is it not 

yes it is sudden answered malcolm

de vaux soon came into the room in company with his friend from tennessee they together with rattles and forbes having promised to stand by malcolm and make all the trouble possible for him they had bribed the negro coachman to drive them out toward lake erie to within a short distance of a road house kept by joe hilton where he would be met by those young men who would stop the carriage relieve them of their baggage and valuables detach the horses and leave the bride and groom to find their way as best they could to the road house abe learned of the plot and determined to frustrate their plans the driver was again bribed this time by abe to let him abe drive in his stead after the ceremony and while the couple held an impromptu reception abe slipped out of the house donned the drivers livery and took his seat upon the box de vaux came out and asked the driver if everything was all right abe said yes sail then added boss cant yo gin de ole man another ten ise lierble to git fired fo dis

heres the money old man now keep your head and drive fast

ill sho drive fas sah said the driver with a broad grin

de vaux did not recognize abe in the darkness soon malcolm and his bride came out followed by the throng of mischief makers they put the bridal couple in their carriage remarking to the driver that he had just seven minutes to catch the midnight express

ill git thar sah said abe

de vaux and his friends got into their carriage motioning abe to proceed the whole party moving off at a terrific rate

at the second corner abe turned toward the station the occupants of the other carriages noticed this move then began a race to the station that was fast and furious but of short duration abe dashed up to the platform just at the express was pulling in he jumped off the box and opened the door saying quick malcolm run for the train noting malcolms hesitation for he did not recognize abe in his livery abe grasped him by the arm and pulled him out of the carriage

run for the train i tell you they are coming

malcolm did not need a second warning but hurried aboard

abe grasped the baggage and was soon on the train they were not seated however before malcolms friends were also in the coach they started for the supposed coachman but recognized abe the trick was apparent and the joke was on them abe relieved himself of his livery passing it out to the negro coachman forgetting at the same time that he had placed de vauxs tendollar bill in the pocket of the coat where it was found by the negro driver

de vaux extended his hand to abe saying abe in consideration of what you did for my brother in chicago i forgive you this trick

abe laughingly replied that he appreciated his goodness of heart and as an evidence of that good will de vaux might call on miss watson and explain abes sudden departure

soon the train was on its way to cleveland

 abe tell me about this escapade what had those fellows planned to do asked malcolm

mr overley do tell us from their disappointed looks i know they had planned something that would have annoyed us very much said mrs overley

yes said abe they had planned to delay your departure you were to be driven out on the road toward lake erie held up by highwaymen robbed of bag and baggage the horses detached from your carriage and you were to be left to the tender mercies of the storm

i would not have cared would you malcolm asked mrs overley as she nestled close to him

cared of course i would suppose you had become chilled and caught cold i would never have forgiven those fellows said malcolm abe how did you manage to frustrate them

abe then related his connection with the affair also stating that de vaux had given him a tendollar bill which he put in the pocket of the coachmans coat and forgot it when the coat was returned

abe where are you going now suddenly asked malcolm

why malcolm do you think you can get along without my care laughed abe

i will be glad if you will stay with us said malcolm but as you have said nothing of your intentions i of course do not know what to expect

  malcolm i am going home i want to arrive at night i will have ten miles to walk across the country my plans must all be arranged before christmas day i will have but two days in which to perfect them so you may expect me to leave you in cleveland  said abe

when the train bearing mr and mrs malcolm a overley jr reached cleveland abe took his leave of them and they betook themselves to a hotel

malcolm made known to mr donewell his love for the latters daughter mabel his desire to marry her and take her to his home to spend the christmas holidays with his father mr donewell gave his consent seeing therein an opportunity to release the overley estate without seeming to be doing an act of charity when it became known at the college that malcolm and miss mabel were to be married the presents and congratulations were numerous mr donewell concluded to make up a large party and visit the bride and groom on the overley plantation dean stearnly professors smirchum and narrows together with several others agreed to join the party it was not convenient for dr finley to leave the college at this time

dean stearnly was a nativeborn southern man with all the peculiarities of the upperclass southern people open honest frank having a thorough knowledge of southern conditions gleaned by personal observations and early environment professors smirchum and narrows had made a study of southern life from books newspapers and magazine articles the primary object of this trip was to study conditions in the south mr donewells party proceeded to mobile alabama direct where it was arranged they would be joined by malcolm and his bride

the arrival of such a distinguished party of northern visitors created quite a little excitement among the hospitable southerners and they vied with each other in showing courtesies to mr donewells party mr donewell himself had traveled extensively throughout the south and his large business interests made him well known to many of mobiles leading citizens and merchants the second night of their stay in mobile was enlivened by a banquet given in their honor at which southern wit and impulsiveness were pitted against northern brains and caution

among the southerners was a former united states senator who was disingenuous enough to assume that he too like other united states senators could annex the public domain to his private belongings while bellowing wolf on the floor of the united states senate this distinguished senators doctrine as to the ultimate results of the education of the american negro is sound for he predicts what will surely happen as a result of the education of the negroâhis ascendency over the cracker

in this assemblage was a governor of questionable lineage who was notorious as the apostle of the doctrine of arson for negro schools colleges and churches and no state appropriation for negro education the good people of his state however appear later to have swept him and his doctrine into oblivion we also find around the banquet table southern men of wealth culture and influence whose ideas are always sound on the policies of state and government the speeches that brought out the sentiments of the banqueters were made by dean stearnly who made the final speech professors smirchum and narrows the former senator and the governor just mentioned john k evers presided as toastmaster

in response to the toast education in the south the former senator said as he slowly arose to his feet mr toastmaster and gentlemen i guess you all know who i am and knowing me you know my sentiments on this troublesome question we need education in our southland i mean education in its broad sense and i mean education for the white man gentlemen you cannot discuss this question and leave the nigger out this last remark was brought forth by murmurs of disapproval when the drift of the senators talk was noted up in my state there is an agitation now on foot for compulsory education they dont seem to understand what that means it means that niggers must be educated the same as white men it means that in a few more years niggers will be able to qualify to vote the same as white men do you want that cries of yes and cries of no were heard from different parts of the hall it could not be determined which sentiment prevailed there were enough cries of yes however to encourage those who believe that the southland has reached its awakening day the senator resumed saying i know that education increases intelligence increases the usefulness and value of the citizen i

then why not educate these niggers asked a voice to the senators left

because education makes them too damn smart have you ever come in contact with an educated nigger  the senator asked

yes hundreds of them does not education make him a better citizen

can a nigger be a good citizen when he is out of his sphere was the senators reply i know the niggers place and it is not in the schools nor is it at the polls where he is dictating to white men his business is to do the white mans bidding this is a white mans country i tell you if you persist in this fool idea of educating those niggers in one more generation they will have their feet on our necks they will rule us instead of our ruling them i

why senator can these ignorant negroes overcome your race in one generation are your people at a standstill

are you retrograding asked a northern man

overcome standstill retrograding hell no my people are the finest in the world before they will be overcome they will shoot every damn nigger off the face of the earth standstill retrograde white men cannot retrograde we are burdened with this nigger load if there were no niggers in

yes but that does not answer my question persisted the northerner how under a compulsory education law can one part of a community outstrip another all things being equal if your people are superior to these people and i assume that they are wherein lies the danger would not their education be a positive benefit would

you are entering into a discussion of a matter that northern men cannot understand only southern men are capable of understanding this question of explaining it in its proper light was the senators peevish reply

yes i suppose so was the snappish rejoinder cries of order came from all parts of the hall

mr toastmaster continued the senator i have been interrupted i had not contemplated a discussion of this nigger question in conclusion let me say and to this i stick that the only possible way for us to maintain our supremacy is not to educate these niggers by their education we are only hastening the day of conflict between the races

when the senator resumed his seat he seemed a bit surprised that his sentiments fell flat upon all his hearers save the governor

professor smirchum responded to the toast the college as it shapes the destinies of nations the professor enlarged on the beauties of college life the ties of friendship that are formed at colleges and never severed the many great men that have gone forth from them who have made the world better by their teachings that the college is the great beacon light which attracts all men that the great god of the universe had put it into the hearts of men of means to endow colleges in large sums of money that their usefulness to all mankind might be perpetuated

but added the professor there is one element of our society the negro which is not contemplated in the organization of our colleges who has become so persistent that we cannot keep him out and who is creating no end of trouble

we should keep the negro out of our colleges

why came the question in a chorus of voices

well because we should answered the professor

an excellent reason laughed a questioner

have you ever taught a negro asked the professor

oh yes i have been teaching them all my life was the response i played with them when a child i have eaten drank slept and shared my roof with these people as all southern men of the old families have and will do again

but professor i am interested in your remarks the great god of the universe is the head of all northern colleges is he not

i do not care to enter into a discussion of that question with the gentleman suffice it to say this negro element is causing a great deal of trouble in our colleges the professor seated himself not wholly satisfied that his tirade had struck a popular chord

in response to the toast the state the governor gave his experience as governor he spoke of the great trials and burdens that a governor has to bear how perplexing it is at times to determine what course to pursue he thanked god however that he always knew what course to take when it came to niggers i cut off our money that was appropriated for nigger normal schools i would rather see this money burned than be used for such a purpose shouted the governor making this last statement in a loud voice as the climax to his speech

as he took his seat he wondered what had come over these southern people that such sentiments failed to arouse them

the governor failed to see as some of his southern brethren for years had failed to see that the world is moving forward and not backward and that even the south must move on or stand a desert country in a land of plenty

professor narrows was called upon to respond to the toast the ladies though none were present he did justice to his subject not once referring to negroes it would have been very bad form indeed to have referred to a negro while speaking to the toast the ladies

the professor seemed to be aware of this rule of southern etiquette

when dean sternly arose to respond to the toast mankind there was a momentary silence a stillness that was broken only by a greeting of handclapping which was accorded no other speaker of the evening his eyes sought those of the former senator the difference betwen these men was very marked the former senator was of the mushroom variety his family had never been heard of beyond the limits of his native county until his advent into politics his general air his table manners his deportment did not bespeak the cultured gentleman his whole appearance gave unmistakable evidence that he was born of no gentlewoman but was undeniably a scion of that cracker

element that a turn of the wheel of fortune had suddenly tossed into prominence

mr toastmaster and gentlemen said dean sternly i did not expect to be called upon to discuss the negro when i accepted your invitation to respond to the toast mankind but it appears to me from the remarks of the gentlemen who have preceded me that they consider him at least a part of mankind that to me is very encouraging

it may be proper at this point to state that i am a native of this state of this county of this city my ancestors were among the first settlers here when alabama was a trackless forest inhabited only by the aborigines and wild animals

my ancestral home across the river can still be seen from the windows in this hall there ten generations of stearnlys have lived and contributed in no small degree to the property the strength the intelligence of our dear old state

i make mention of these facts that you may all know not only that my training was received here my sympathies are here but that this negro question is nothing new to me i have known the negro all my life i have lived with him on i those dear old hills across the river and i have loved him for i his simple faith his unquestioning devotion his unselfish j service to me and mine

mr toastmaster and gentlemen i am going to say some plain unvarnished things to you let me say first of all that i am thoroughly aware of the fact that it is not popular in this section of the country to tell men of their faults particularly when those faults have relation to their treatment of the negro the world would be better off mankind would suffer less from chicanery and deceit there would be less heartache if we would frankly tell our brothers in love and not in anger of their faults i feel perfectly justified tonight because of my ancestry and my relations in talking frankly upon this negro question which has been so unfairly and so unjustly handled here tonight

when he states that it is better to keep white children in ignorance and not force them by legislative enactment to attend school for fear that the same law will force negro children to attend school the senator lays down a most re markable doctrine it is preposterous that the relative education of the negroes and the whites will result in the domination of the whites by the blacks for us to believe that the shotgun and the torch are the necessary sequels of i a compulsory education law is to admit that the negro is the superior race and ours the inferior one and that we fear the loss by force of the position we now hold by fraud it is no compliment to the intelligence and standing of the gentlemen who are present tonight for such sentiments as we have heard here to be heralded to the whole country as the opinion of the soberminded and betterthinking whites of the south i do not subscribe to such sentiments and wish most emphatically to be put on record as expressing my disapproval of them such ideas are in contravention of the spirit of the constitution of the united states which every good citizen is pledged to uphold and support they are opposed to the doctrines of christianity which teaches the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man they violate the spirit of our american civilization which declares for equal rights for all and special privileges for none

if we are not patriotic enough to uphold our constitution or if we do not accept the christian doctrine of brotherhood or if we do not believe in the theory of equal rights as business men we ought to seek the negros elevation politically socially and economically because the more we elevate him and increase his earning power his saving power and his intelligent appreciation of his relation to his community the more valuable he is to us he becomes a land owner and must need money which he will invest in our stocks and deposit in our banks as he earns more he spends more intelligence and education increase his needs and wants which we alone can supply it is worse than suicidal for us to restrain and restrict the development of such an element in our community

the rural negroes in this county earn on the average eight dollars per month nearly every dollar of it comes back to us through our stores and business people

suppose in some way we could increase their earning power to twenty thirty or fifty dollars per month their additional earnings would still come to us if you had a piece of poor land would you keep it poor would you use every effort to prevent the improvement of the land or would you fertilize and cultivate it so as to increase its productive power

of course you would improve it why not pursue the same course toward the negro if schools improve the earning power and civic value of the whites they will do the same for the negro if kindness and brotherly love and opportunity make the white man a better citizen they will make the black man more useful and more valuable whenever a citizen is made better the community is made richer it would seem therefore that this attitude of repression and proscription toward the negro is not only unamerican un christian and unjust but it is positively impairing the very communities we are pretending to serve

again it is impossible to practice such injustices upon our weaker brother without directly injuring and preventing the right development of our own moral natures to cultivate unreasoning prejudice to concoct schemes which are aimed at the peace happiness or welfare of another is to set in motion influences that sap out the sweetness and beauty of our souls this sort of an attitude embitters our own lives handicaps our children spoils our women degrades our homes and undermines our civilization i cannot understand and have never understood why we commit ourselves to this unwise and unchristian policy

for myself there is no right or privilege which i enjoy or which i seek for my family that i am not willing to accord to the humblest negro in the land and i believe that it is in this spirit that the proper solution of this vexed question must come

we must realize and accept the fact that we cannot keep among us and treat as aliens a race of people who are worshiping the same god reading the same bible attending the same school system serving under the same flag forming a part of the same civilization we must accept them as a part of our homogeneous population and treat all alike or we must get rid of them entirely since the latter is impossible the former is clearly our duty

let me urge you to educate the negro to see political issues as you do to treat him politically as you do other races of mankind that have come among you

your legislature has just enacted a statewide prohibition law in mobile it is enforced strictly against the negro the negro dens and saloons have been closed up and it is wellnigh impossible for negroes to obtain intoxicating liquors a thing for which the better class of negroes are truly thankful while the low and vicious whites have free access to it your prohibition law so far as it is enforced is similar to your educational qualifications as to the franchise

you place before these people an incentive an obstacle to overcome which you do not place before the ignorant of your own race illiteracy among the poor whites is not decreasing as rapidly as it is among the negroes the poor whites have practically the same percentage of illiteracy now as they had fifty years ago you say to the negro educate your children you leave the ignorant white man to flounder on and on upon the theory that because he is a white man that will suffice it does seem to me that the folly of such a policy should be apparent to all men

gentlemen do you know what these negroes are doing

do you know that they control just a few thousand less than five hundred million dollars worth of farm property in this country do you know that they own and operate farms valued at six millions of dollars more than the total of all capital invested in manufactories in the twelve southern states in eighteen sixty this farm land that they own and operate if put acre to acre would make a strip of land five miles wide that would reach from new york city to san francisco if by nineteen forty as predicted by the united states census bureau the illiteracy of the negro disappears and the ratio of their increasing wealth continues what will you do you will have forced him to qualify for the ballot both educationally and financially and by this course will have made a man of him as it were at the same time leaving the poor white where he has been for generations you have kept the negroes out of your lives politically you have not taught him to believe in your political creed but you have taught him that your creed means disfranchisement and oppression for him and his children you will have educated him up to the white mans standard and that standard set by yourselves he will be an american citizen thanks to your foresight what will you do with him

gentlemen there is but one way to solve this question

that is to prove the superiority of your race treat these people as you do all other peoples who come among you educate them up to your way of thinking make your interests their interests bind them to you by kindness and consideration and make them feel that their interests lie with the men who are native to the soil i beg that you gentlemen will bear with me for confining myself wholly to the negro question but it seems that this is the allabsorbing topic in most southern gatherings of the day and unless we take a more rational view of it we will lay the foundation of trouble for the generations to come

when dean stearnley had finished a silence filled the hall

many gentlemen left their seats to congratulate him this line of argument so different from that usually advanced by southern men caused considerable adverse comment from those who hoped to profit politically by keeping up a strife between the races but it was plain that with a majority of those present dean stearnley had advanced a line of thought that struck responsive chords in their hearts they were many of them tired of the everlasting flaunting of the negro bugaboo for political purposes and were sincerely desirous of devoting their time and their talents to the best interests of the south and they welcomed this new doctrine as sane and safe

the senator and his followers who had profited by preaching nigger nigger all the time did not dare assail dean stearnleys arguments which were so plainly true and unanswerable but waited until they were among the class of whites who are always ready and willing to listen to this senseless babble

after spending some time in after dinner conversation dean stearnleys party which now included malcolm and his bride left the hall and resumed their journey to the overley plantation in acounty

when abe left malcolm and his bride he proceeded night walking across the county to cleos cabin where he rested during the day while gathering the news of the neighborhood abe learned that buck lashum could be seen any fine morning in a glass inclosure which his father had built on his front porch his chair is rolled into this retreat where he is left for hours at a time

abe concluded to visit him in this place when he saw buck in his helpless condition noticed his look of recognition and that although he could neither move nor speak his face bore a look of terror he concluded to leave him as he was feeling that his punishment would be greater if left in that condition abe succeeded in regaining the overley plantation without having been seen early christmas morning abe mounted on ben the overley horse mentioned in a previous chapter was riding through the back woods when suddenly he came upon a horseman who upon seeing him wheeled his horse and fled into the woods abe recognized jack smaly in the fleeing horseman

go ben go cried abe the old racer seemed to understand that he was to make the effort of his life away he dashed along the cow path over which jack was racing

abe noticed that jack was well mounted his horse seemed scarcely to touch the earth so quick was she in her movements

ben go are you going to fail me now on on i tell you abe had his horse trace buckled about his waist he raised it above his head to deal old ben a blow but lowered his hand muttering no this is not for you

at once to the county of c nine miles below the overley plantation he arrived near mid never will i disgrace you old horse by a blow with this bloodstained lash this is for murderers

the old horse now thoroughly aroused increased his pace rapidly closing in on jack who seemed to know that he was being overhauled a few more bounds brought them to a clearing across which their course led jack turned in his saddle with a pistol in his right hand which he leveled and fired at abe twice in rapid succession abe swung his horse to jacks left making it impossible for him to turn far enough in his saddle to get his range without unseating himself jacks movements were fatal to him as they caused his horse to slacken her pace at the same time his shots went wide of their mark as old ben came along side of jacks horse abe dealt smaly a blow upon the head which knocked him to the ground jack fell upon his head the force of the fall breaking his neck

abe dismounted and hastened to his victim thinking to lash him as he had his brother but he found jack dead and concluded to leave him where he had fallen knowing that his friends would soon find him abe then went to his fathers cabin where he found the old man at breakfast which had been prepared by one of cleos girls after greeting his father abe greeted the girl just as if he had not seen her before he remained until by the confusion at the big house he knew malcolm and his bride and friends had arrived abe found them as malcolm was introducing mrs

overley to his father

what is that you say boy exclaimed the father

your wife who the what the how in the  you have disobeyed me sir abe tell me what my abe has done got married didnt he tell me that not one word sir you have disobeyed me abe he cried addressing old abe i have asked that boy of yours to tell me what my abe has done he does not obey me those devils still hang together and defy me that boy has been married

old abe seemed to take in the whole situation at a glance

he went to mrs overley looking at her long and searchingly then said yoll suttenly be welcome on dis heah place

dem is miss mirandas eyes mr overley miss miranda sent dat chile heah to look arter yo in yo ole days

there was a long silence during which the old man looked first at malcolm then at the bride and then at the assembled friends finally he extended a hand to mabel drawing her close to him and as he did so he implanted a kiss upon her forehead a great tear stole down his cheek his lips trembled he whispered in a voice scarcely audible rinda

the name by which he always addressed malcolms mother

this act simple and courteous in itself revealed the true heart of this southern gentleman

old abe in a voice rich and melodious one of those voices around which sweet memories of plantation life still cling broke forth in the good old hymn blest be the tie that binds our hearts in sacred love the fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above

old abes happy selection inspired the most cordial feelings among all the company

mr john k evers who had joined the party in mobile said to malcolm a overley sr mr overley i wish to call your attention to the fact that it is now  oclock noon december 

he then produced the title deeds to the overley estate which he had purchased at the auction mr evers delivered the deeds to mr overley who saw as he hastily read them that he still held title to his family estates when the old man fully realized that the burden of his mortgage was lifted from him he staggered to a chair where he remained several moments in deep thought finally he said to whom am i indebted for this gentlemen something has been done in this matter that i cannot accept somebody has paid by debts without my consent mr evers i ask for a full explanation of this matter

mr donewell here may be able to enlighten you said mr evers

this is mr donewell the father of your daughterinlaw mr

why malcolm you have not introduced your friends to me why

dad if you will only give me a chance i will be glad to do so laughed malcolm then followed a general introduction after which mr overley again asked the question as to how the mortgage on his place had been paid addressing himself to mr donewell he said i have been told sir that you can explain this matter who did this and why was it done

mr overley you are giving this affair too much consideration i straightened the thing out i felt that i had as much right to provide for my daughter as you had to provide for your son laughed mr donewell we concluded to keep this place in your family provided we are permitted to live upon it at times

at times cried the old man if you are willing to take that disobedient boy of mine in exchange for this sweet girl i am willing i am glad enough to be rid of him

he has caused me no end of worry but come here boy addressing malcolm malcolm a overley sr placed his hands upon the head of the young couple remarking i give you both a fathers blessing

amen i jes knowed yo would broke in old abe

messengers were sent out and soon the house was filled with the friends and wellwishers of the overleys young and old

a christmas dinner was served amid wit and humor the kind only known to those who have enjoyed the hospitality of the old plantations of the south speech song and laughter resounded through the rafters of the famous old dining room until early morning abes thoughts and feelings not being of the kind that held sway at the big house he had stolen quietly away and made his way to his mothers grave he east himself upon the cold ground beneath which she lay still and motionless

mother i have avenged thee thy murderers now lie cold in death their jeers and curses are stilled forever

their pleadings and cries will be answered by the imps of torment oh great god where art thou mother my work is done what wilt thou have me do  the land of my birth the land of the morning of my life the land that knows all the sweetness of my childhood the land that knows thy motherly care is accursed to me now by the gods he exclaimed as he sprang to his feet i would that i could kill each one of them over again oh mother guide me anew what wilt thou have me do  

while abe stood looking down upon his mothers grave his father approached him and said my boy come wid me i wants to talk to yo  

abe went to the old mans cabin where he listened to plans for the future abe did not divulge the secrets of his life to his father

jack smaly after his horse had made its way home was found by his friends where he had fallen the verdict of the coroners jury was that he came to his death by a fall off his horse which broke his neck jacks wellknown habit of riding through the woods to his home after his nightly carousals paved the way for this verdict abe was not mentioned in connection with his death

new years day came only too soon malcolm was reminded of the fact that he still had his course at oberlin college to finish his father insisted that the bride stay with him for a short time only it was finally agreed that she would stay on the plantation until easter time when she and the senior overley would visit oberlin

at the end of the school year the donewells and overleys would make an extended tour of canada and europe the party finally left abe bade farewell to his friends the mates of his boyhood days knowing that he would never his farewell to his mothers grave was taken in silence

he approached the mound in company with his father messrs overley and donewell dean sternly and professor smirchum this old womans grave nestled among the graves of seven generations of overleys and was marked by a granite stone upon which was inscribed mammy rindaa term of endearment fully understood only by those who knew and appreciated her as the party stood with uncovered heads different thoughts and feelings surged through their breasts

abes sorrow was of the kind that wrings mens hearts

he was a strong man bowed with grief a strong heart bursting with a sense of injustice his whole being strained to the bursting point with no outlet dry eyes twitching mouth clinched hands rigid form marked his terrible sufferings all eyes were turned upon him professor smirchum who seemed to be greatly affected by abes mute agony took his hand and said in a kindly voice mr overley i am sorry indeed to see the extent of your sorrow your mother must have been a grand woman to return

have deserved the respect she seems to have commanded

what can i do to help you

nothing sir i must begin life anew and amid new scenes new environments from now on my success or my failure will depend upon my personal efforts

professor smirchum drew to one side soliloquizing how could i have been so blind as to believe that these people are different from any other people this trip reveals to me what they are doing what they ha ve done in what respect vast numbers of them are held by the better class of whites

i am now convinced that the great howl and cry sent up by this governor is a fear of what they are doing and not what they are not doing he vetoed the bill appropriating money for a colored normal school at the same time he was forced as governor to sign charters for twelve negro banks then these people raise thousands of dollars among themselves to carry on their school what an objectlesson could there be a more convincing argument as to the energy that lies dormant in this race what in the name of god will be the future of this people if my southern brothers do not bestir themselves do not awaken their cracker brother these negro people will own this fair southland thus this new convert reasoned within himself

abe my boy said malcolm a overley sr i am still your friend in the full sense of that word whatever you do when you leave school remember that i am entitled to know

mr overley i shall always remember you answered abe i shall always keep in touch with you your kindness to me is the one bright spot in my memory that binds me to this old plantation as abe finished mr overley placed his hand upon his shoulder saying with intense earnestness

my boy that mound of earth covers one of the noblest women that it has ever been my lot to meet i can never forget that she took my abe to her breast a puny sickly child nursed him day and night put new life in him guided his footsteps was a mother to him indeed until he is now the man of whom i am proud that old woman was your mother

she was a slave in name but never in fact boy there is nothing i will not do for you so long as you are true to her teachings your old father has ever been my companion

we shall continue our journey of life together i thank you mr overley said abe as they clasped hands

professor smirchum had been a close observer of all that was transpiring he had never dreamed of such friendships among the people of the south

when the party turned to leave abe put his arm about his father and said dad i leave with malcolm tomorrow

i have three more years in school in which time i hope to have finished a course in civil engineering then if god has been merciful to us i will send for you to spend your last days with me and mine

the old man raised his eyes to heaven and said lawd watch over my boy thy will be done

as the sun went down the next day the donewell ear with abe aboard crossed the alabama line bearing him away from scenes and faces which he was destined never to see again

when the donewell party arrived in oberlin abe took his leave of them explaining that he would go to new york city and prepare himself for entrance to the college which he had selected

after tramping about the city for several days he procured a job as assistant janitor to an old negro who had charge of a flat building at ten dollars per month and board

abe soon made himself felt by his willingness to work

the owner of the flat who was a prosperous jew watched abe very closely noting his studious habits and general deportment he concluded he would offer abe a better job

young man i haf noticed dot you never goes out you haf always a book what for you reads all of the time

i am trying to prepare myself for college i want to take a course in civil engineering answered abe

yell dot is very goot i likes to see a young man dot is trying to help himself i needs a goot man in a goot job

but you haf no vife you gets yourself a goot vife and i finds you a good job

mr goldenheimer your suggestion makes it well nigh impossible for me to accept said abe i am sure i do not know where i will find this good woman what will this job pay

yell for you and a vife i pays seventyfive dollars a month and rent free dot is very goot vages i works for three dollars a week for two years onct yot you think of dot

when do you want me to go to work asked abe

i needs a man right avay answered mr goldenheimer

but vy you axe ven i vants you abe was silent for some moments he was considering the advisability of explaining his love affair to mr goldenheimer finally he said mr goldenheimer i am engaged to a girl who is college bred who has always had a good home has never done work of any kind save that which would naturally fall to her about her fathers home we are to be married when i finish my course i do not feel that i should offer her this home being so different from that to which she has been accustomed but i am sure sir i can do your work as well without a wife as i can with one

young man i pelebes you can i make it a rule to hire no mans dot has not a vife said mr goldenheimer but i say dot if dot young lady ish a goot one she vill come i vates two weeks nine hundred dollars a year you mind dot

 what must i do will nancy think me a fool if i make this suggestion to her i will ask uncle joe and aunt jane what they think i will also write malcolm mr donewell ought to be able to write me what is best to do mr overley âbut he is too far away my father would be compelled to get some person to write for him thus abe reasoned with himself he finally concluded to write miss watson and explain the matter to her

he wrote her as follows new york city february â â

dear nancy  the contents of this note may not please you but read it carefully and answer by return mail as i have but two weeks to consider mr goldenheimer for whom you will remember i am working has offered me a position as janitor of a building at nine hundred dollars per year and house rent light and fuel free provided i get a wife nancy can you help me out in this matter

yours as ever abe

p sâanswer by return mail

abe

p sâthis offer is open to me for two weeks answer soon

abe

when the letter reached miss watson she smiled to herself thinking that abe must have been a bit agitated when he wrote she however went immediately to her mother and put the letter in her hands after reading the note several times the mother said daughter what do you want to do

go was the daughters brief reply

but will your father consent this is so sudden

answered the mother

mr watson was called into the room and given the note

he too smiled when he read it

daughter this is a very sudden proposal i am not prepared to give my cohsent i will communicate with my friends in new york city i have had dealings for years with a goldenheimer of that city i wonder if this is he

however daughter i will not keep him waiting very long

mr watson called mr goldenheimer who was a wholesale grocer over the longdistance telephone he appeared to be satisfied with what he learned but said nothing to his wife preferring to wait for abes next note

abe received the following in reply to his urgent letter obeelin ohio february â â

mr abraham overley dear sirâyour brief and ambiguous note has reached me

i am at a loss to understand just what you want can i help you out do you want me to look up some woman to be your wife two weeks is a very short time in which to undertake such an important matter i will consult my mother maybe she can help you out in the meantime you write my father and ask his assistance i will be glad to have your plans more in detail

your friend nancy watson

when abe read miss watsons note he immediately forworded to her a full statement of his plans laying great stress upon the fact that he could have his old father with him should he be able to obtain this position he also wrote mr watson explaining the situation before the letter reached mr watson however one from mr goldenheimer had reached him in which he was told abe would be carefully looked after and that so long as he did his work in a proper manner this job or something better was open to him ten days later we find abe installed in his new home a fourroom flat which had been furnished by mr goldenheimer as a present to the brideelect

abe was the proudest man in all new york city miss watson and her father were due in the city at  p m but we find abe at the station before  oclock scanning the faces of the passengers as they pass out from the trains mr

goldenheimer happened to notice abe as he passed in with some friends and said with a merry twinkle in his eye my poy vat you do here now your train ish not due for ein hour yet you think dot girl vill go mit some fellow passing on before abe could answer at last abes vigil is ended miss watson and her parents appear at the gates the party was joined by several of mr watsons friends men of means two of whom were real estate dealers the third an undertaker the party went immediately to the home of the editor of a wellknown newspaper where it had been arranged the marriage ceremony would be performed

the eventful night of march  â came the wedding guests filled the editors home to overflowing elaborate gowns were conspicuous by their absence it being understood that the bride would be attired in street costume the rev dr cofficiated after the ceremony mr and mrs

overley received the congratulations of their friends after which they quietly drove to their new home in company with the brides parents abe had written a long letter to his father and mr overley explaining the situation and received their hearty consent and approval in return within six months mr goldenheimer raised abes salary to one hundred dollars per month saying that he considered the work more than one man could do and in view of the further fact that the flat was filled and several prospective tenants were on the waiting list abes management of the building made it a very desirable place in which to live when he entered college he was astonished to find that the two japanese whom he had known at oberlin college had also entered upon the same course which he had undertaken abe saw a great deal of these men they seemed to be very familiar with certain facts connected with his past at the end of the first school year abe found himself marked thirtieth in a class of fortyfour he seemed very much disappointed at his rating

mr goldenheimer said to him a few days later vell my poy you pass you do very well mit all dot vork to do

i makes you my head janitor you gets one hundred dollars a month and rent free you haf more time you pass high

how dot suit you

mr goldenheimer i scarcely know how to thank you no dot is beseness interrupted mr goldenheimer

you do my vork veil you keep my house full all the time

now you keep ten houses full and i pays you more you buys everything dot goes in dose houses you keeps my house account now vat you say to dot

i will do my best sir answered abe

veil dot is beseness ven you not do dot i pays you and gets somepody said mr goldenheimer

abe now had more time to devote to his lectures and with his wifes assistance he brought his rating at the end of his second school year up to sixth in a class of fortynine his wife was delighted with this improvement though abe insisted that but for her assistance he would surely have failed at the end of his third year when it was known that he was one of the first three of his class now numbering forty the japanese approached him with a proposal which at first was very hard for abe to resist they called abes attention to the political conditions in the east which were changing very rapidly japan was determined to be mistress of the pacific and in the near future he might hear the roar of japanese guns off the western coast of the united states they told him that he had no reason to love nor fight for a flag that was no protection to him that the japanese government wanted educated american negroes in her service where his race would be no bar against his advancement they explained to him further that they were princes of the blood royal and were commissioned by the mikado to enlist or commission recruits as they saw fit

they also stated that they had commissioned the three negroes who would graduate with them second lieutenants in the engineer corps of the japanese army at a salary of sixteen hundred dollars per year and they were frank to state that they wanted abe because they felt that he would be of great service to japan should a conflict come on between the two countries the wily jap then pictured the lynching of abes mother and sister in such colors that the demon in him which had lain dormant for three years was aroused and took flaming hold on him once more his blood took on the fire that arouses men to kill he was in the full height of a consuming passion when the vision of nancy and her child came before him his passion was subdued his calm reason regained its sway abe was himself again he promised the japanese that after he had consulted his wife he would give them a definite answer when abe arrived at home that night he found nancy in a dimly lighted room quietly rocking his little son who seemed fretful nancy noticed by abes demeanor that something unusual had happened motioning him to a seat by her side she asked what was troubling him abe told her of the offer made him by the envoys of japan laying particular stress upon the commission but he said speaking as if in a dream can i renounce forever the allegiance i owe my country because of personal wrongs because of the crimes of murderers can i renounce forever the land that gave my mother birth the land in which she now lies buried can i renounce forever the land that my fathers knew the land which i now know as my country my home can i renounce forever the land of my few friends the land in which they are daily appearing can i renounce forever that which i know and embark in a foreign land in that which is problematical can i

he suddenly sprang to his feet saying nancy my mother appeared to me in my thoughts she held the stars and stripes proudly above her head while her other hand was extended to me my mother wills that i shall defend the flag of my country

two days later the japanese called upon abe to obtain his final answer he said gentlemen i have considered your proposition very carefully and conclude that although the stars and stripes afford me little protection although the laws of this land are interpreted against me although the machinery of the law is too weak to bring the murderers of my mother to justice in spite of these things and in spite of attempts at every turn to humiliate me in spite of what may seem strange to you that one part of a nation can and does hate another i must decline your offer will you fight the land of the rising sun  no nor will i fight the land of my birth over which the sun is now rising i am proud that i am an american

the japanese were astounded they like hundreds of thousands of other people american citizens too never imagined that a negros heart was governed by the same honorable impulses that other mens are that his soul is alive to the touch that stirs other men in short that a negro is a man

two weeks before abes commencement mr goldenheimer died very suddenly abe was notified that his services as superintendent would be dispensed with but that he could have the choice of the care of any one of the flats that now numbered thirteen at seventyfive dollars per month abe immediately severed all connections with the estate his wife who handled his finances showed him deposits to the amount of twentyfive hundred dollars and abe concluded to embark in the practice of his profession

abes commencement day was june st â may st a long legal envelope was handed mrs overley by the postman it proved to contain a very important document

it appears that leon de vaux had been making yearly trips to new york and had kept in close touch with abes progress through mr goldenheimer and knew his standing in the college de vauxs brother was the head of a large corporation that was reclaiming land in the lower counties of the state of louisiana and building a narrowgauge railroad to the coast this envelope contained a contract guaranteeing him employment for five years at twelve hundred dollars the first year twentyfour hundred dollars the second year three thousand dollars the third year and thereafter his salary to commence june st â it also contained a draft for five hundred dollars when abe came home his little son came up to him and handed him these papers abe paid no attention to them but simply cast them upon the table and took the boy in his arms remarking nancy is it my turn to feed this young wolf of yours

for an answer the young mother handed the papers to the child who again handed them to his father abes eye caught sight of the check which had fallen to the floor upon examining it he was amazed to find that it was drawn by napoleon de vaux he hastily examined the contract noting that he was not expected in new orleans until the september following

nancy you have certainly brought success to me in three years and thereafter i will surely be earning three thousand dollars per year what shall we do with the four months i have on my hands before september when my labors must begin

let us go to oberlin and read up on louisiana geology

answered mrs overley we can send for your father again maybe he will come to spend a few months with us he would not leave the plantation to live it seems queer that he should feel bound to stay on that place with mr

overley until one of them dies malcolm is down there now and they do not need him

nancy you do not understand these old men they love each other as brothers love neither would live long without the other they have known each other and lived on the same place in peace for seventyeight years threequarters of a century just think of it they must live out the rest of their lives together abe sent for his father who came to oberlin and spent two months with him promising to join him and his wife in louisiana should be outlive mr overley

at the end of three years the company began paying abe three thousand dollars per year he having come up to their full expectations

we leave him on his plantation in the full enjoyment of home life surrounded by his father and growing family his wealth and usefulness increasing as the years speed by increasing as the wealth and usefulness of many negroes before him and as the wealth and usefulness of many negroes who come after him will increase

and to a womans love a womans implicit faith under most peculiar circumstances a womans tenderness abraham overley gives all the credit for his success in life and when the night is come and the boy kneels beside them abe whispers to his sweetheart god grant nancy that he loves you as i loved my mother
