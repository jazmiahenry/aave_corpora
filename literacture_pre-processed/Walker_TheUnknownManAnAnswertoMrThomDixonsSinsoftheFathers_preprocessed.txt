j johnson or the unknown man an answer to mr thom dixons sins of the fathers walker thomas h b  fiction
no home no father no mother or even sister or brother was the lot of little jim and legally speaking in the eyes of the law we might add that he had no name

it was a sad day in the life of this boy when first the rays of sunlight streaked his brow and the music of nature beat upon his ear who were his parents no one knew

when upon the tide of time he was first seen floating like the great law giver in a basket was he but not so fortunate as the law giver to be among the flowers of the sea a cheap fivecent basket discarded and worn with rags tucked around held the little flower bud that was lying at the door of an excuse of a house that was inhabited by one of the poorest families of the town we say family but not a family it was but the remnant a june pear swinging tenaciously to the limb of the tree when the fruit was all plucked and the october frost and whistling wind of autumn had said to the leaves earth to earth and ashes to ashes it was all that was left of a very happy but humble family

a lone widow poor and feeble an old woman left in the world without a relative

aunt jane was her name at her door one winter morning while the ground was wrapped in a sheet of frost this wee babe was found

her dark eyes rolled and her wiry form stood erect she laughed ha ha bless the lord child i wonder whose baby is you

ise sho gwine ter have trouble here by this time she had him up in her bosom fondling shaking and continuing to talk to him where you came from sich er day like this little rascal aint crying er bit your people sure must be crazy or want er fling you in a coffin to put you here a day like this

a little bed was speedily arranged in a rocking chair and in this improvised nest our little friend found what hereafter was to be his home an interesting picture they presented around this fireside compared with what it was a few minutes before

days and weeks rolled by and neighbor after neighbor came to see aunt jane and her new visitor all of them more or less were equally filled with advice but for the mush and milk that made up the little ones diet the merciful god only knew the hardships and struggles of aunt jane to secure it

after a year passed and the wee baby had struggled from the cradle and was creeping about the house showing a little ivory decoration cute dimpled cheeks and fat dimpled hands cooing and twittering like a sparrow aunt jane came in seized the little one up into her arms gave him the usual kiss just as she had a hundred times looked into his eyes that showed the african and anglosaxon mixture and said boy ise gwine ter sho name you today ise dunno how old you is but you is been here a little over a year so ise bound ter name you today

while aunt jane was talking to the child some one came up and struck the steps with a stick as though they would split them and said hey hey who lives here

aunt jane replied you hush dat noise jonah come in ef you gwin ter

uncle jonah answered oh hush yer foolin oman don git scared ise jest thought to pester yo a little how is dat child gitting along you aint hearn nothin yet bout his cestry

no not a word said aunt jane

well janie said uncle jonah what you gvvine ter do wid him

do wid him said aunt jane why today ise gwinter name him i thought id call him spurgeon or beecher and den one time i wanted to name him garfield but nowâ

oh janie said uncle jonah you think dat boy will be president an you know dat niggers cant even vote why dey is just franchising the negro eber whar

to this dialogue the baby paid no attention he simply feasted on the music of the words and seemed to have been greatly delighted to pull uncle jonahs gray mustache or poke his finger into the old mans mouth

uncle jonah like aunt jane had watched the pickaninny grow and while the baby could not talk yet he could with his little eyes watch them the old folks argued debated and loved the baby cooed cried and loved thus in process of time the three were bound together

uncle jonah continued tell you janie de way de negro is lynched an pestered sorter pears to me dey is agin him eber whar yes

eber wharl you think cause hes kinder yaller das hope for him bet you neednt think dat yaller niggers are hated as bad as any of dem dey say dey aint got no nation

wy said aunt jane i knows he aint gwine ter be no president but i thought he mout un be lowed to vote outen any one pesterin im

yas said uncle jonah dat ar grandpa clause in de contution keeps us fom it

granddaddy claws what make dat dey dont cut him off asked aunt jane with a deal of confidence and assurance in her very accent

moren dat she continued who knows but what dis boys granddaddy both of um come in dat darâwhat yo call it

oh no said uncle jonah you kin see the nigger in him fer if he is only got one drap of blood of my race the whole blessed thing becomes nigger

any way said aunt jane ise gwine ter name him ise gwine ter call him jim johnson atter the great book writer

aunt jane had heard of ben jonson the great scholar and writer of england and her husband who was now dead was also named jim therefore she had this name deeply rooted in her heart she called him jim

in this name she perpetuated racial love and predicted scholarship perhaps the boy might someday be a great scholar and then her souls crave to see the name of her family placed among the great men of the earth would be realized for in the heart of every son of adam there is a something that is called by some an instinct by others an affinity and yet by the great philosophers it is an unknown attribute that throws men together and repels them

aunt jane was a good christian intensely religious as most colored folks are yet she had a feeling to love her own of course this love was not necessarily confined to her own people exclusively as we have seen in the case of this child that no one could kiss a bible on as being of negro blood yet like moses like any people when it came to hairsplitting love the racial love was bound to predominate although many have often said that the negro possessed no such love

now here was a child a bright child an octoroon may be a white child but somehow she believed it to be of her race if it had been an indian of the forest a chinese from hong kong or a saxon of the purest blood it would have made no difference with aunt jane for in spite of all his opposition in spite of all his shortcomings in spite of all his faults and sins the negro is a good samaritan he is hospitable he will help the needy yea he will feed even the slayer of his brother and those who revile maltreat and abuse him

kill him head him off sam i got him once on the knoggin no you didnt old spaniard not that time were noises heard from half a dozen throats that filled the air a crowd of boys were chasing a little bushyheaded boy of about eight or nine years his face was dirty and like the other boys easily could he have passed for white no one would have thought him other if it had not been that one of the boys said never mind you nigger as the boy escaped his pursuers and entered a hut an old woman pulled him in and closed the door

she said jim whats the matter my boy

whats those boys chasing you bout i dunno what im gwine ter do wid yo one of des days ise mighty fraid youll git hurt you know you ought ter stay way fom dose white folks

well ma jane said jim we boys were just shooting marbles and getting on fine until one big boy came along and shouted sweeps and i happened to get more of them than the other boys then they started to fighting we boys play together all the time us boys we do and we never fight of course i wont going to give my marbles away i dont like sweep stakes but if they are going to play the game every man for himself

yes son said aunt jane you donno you stay by yourself and be a good boy if you want to go to heaven where you can meet your ma and pa

but ma said jim you are the only ma i have and if i get to heaven how will i know my mamma oh no i aint got no ma but you and if i go to heaven she wont know me either

come son and git your dinner i knows you is hungry fer you is sure got a bright head eber body says it your uncle jonah was er telling me bout it tuther day said aunt jane

the boy wouldnt be shut off so soon especially when he seemed to have the best of the argument so he continued you know ma the other day i was standing by the road and a big automobile passed me and all at once my hair stood straight my skin grew tight and i dont know how i felt it looks like that every time that machine and those people pass me i have that same feeling

aunt jane couldnt answer the boy but simply groaned and before she knew it a tear was stealing down her sainted old cheek

when the boy had ended his supper he and aunt jane were seated before the fire and whiled away the time until the hour arrived for bed aunt jane was busy with the needle and the boy busy with his books and toys

the little scrummage among the boys that very often took place and many times was magnified by the papers as a race war very soon was forgotten

day after day passed and years rolled by the tender youth became the hope and inspiration of the old saint and the old saint was the succor and hope of the child the ones life became entwined within the other it was barely possible to cut one without affecting the other like millechristine the twins that were held together by one body one mouth said to the other when you die how long will i live nay i cant live i will die also

janie say what you will or may but there is something strange about that boy it has now been twelve years since he was picked up and yet you know nothing

yes jonah said aunt jane it is strange but i have hearn of a heap uv folks in dis ole wurl picked up yit dey seem to stay here an git along like de tuthers dey aint gotten but one mouth and it kinder git somkin to eat

why take dat man fred douglass he couldnt tell who his daddy was i dont believe didnt he live died and all de wurl had to tip dey hats to him nobody sputes dat

well what you gwinter do wid booker washington he named hisself i am not er arguing bout his daddy and aint he smat

why bless your soul he is the biggest man you ever seed aint no white people kin beat him in dat dustrial education

but jane said uncle jonah have you ever think bout dat boy

yes said aunt jane i know one thing he has sho brought good luck to dis house and the good master protects me as never before

he sho opens de window of heaven

uncle jonah said i dont mean dat bet dat boy was picked up as a naked bird thrown from its nest janie i am an old grey haired man stung by the frost of seventyfive december morns but i says againâdar am somethin bout dat boy spicious when i was a boy i saw a featherless bird yea a naked little bird you got me fall fom its nest dat wuz hidden in de bough and secured fom the winds and dews of heaven i saw it fall and as it fell hitting limb after limb bush after bush screaming chirping aye gurgling oh it was dying the blood was creeping fom its legsâits wings seemed broken and its back looked like a beef janie you ought to have hearn its screams it would have made a hangman cry and a demon weep did the mother leave it no she floundered beneath it she fluttered about it and when i went dat i mought take it outen de sand the ole bird fought me she picked me she left me not till i had nested the leetle one back safe into its hiding

well said aunt jane what bout it

why oman said uncle jonah we are mortal and how kin a mother lay its little one out on a frosty morning to weep to cry to suffer yea to die if dere be a god who shall judge the wurld janie do you believe such an one as dat shall ever see his face in peace jane shall not the jedge of all the earth do right de good book sezâ

ah jonah said aunt jane

then for about ten minutes they were both lost in thought and not either said a word

the two old sainted philosophers were trying to solve a problem that had baffled sociologists and humanitarians and scholars from the days that cyrus was found down to the present

yet unsolved it remained

kingdoms and empires rose and fell years roll by nations like men grow old and die history changes science advances but this problem ever remains here is a boy who will soon bud into the beautiful life of manhood who will stand upon the college platform and deliver the valedictory of his class enter the world and like other fellow students speak of his alma mater but who knows the yearnings of his heart who knows the dreams that come to him in the night times as upon his bed he rests his weary head and in his sleep climbs the golden stairs no mother knew he that had ever kissed his lips or father said my son there he was a lone pine born in the ocean expanse of sandy desert and although scorching sand and burning winds swept on into one eternal day yet it remained where did it come from how did it get there no one seemed to know

not indigenous to the clime yet it lived when there was no oasis to shade and water its roots it caught the dews of heaven it dropped its own leaves and made a shade

uncle jonah ended his visit and returned home the days rolled by as usual

the boy fast sprouted into a large youth while the dame rumor nodded but never slept

kind friends made it possible for aunt jane to find work and evenings on jims return from school he washed ironed gathered wood and did whatever his hands found to do the people admired him and the community often buzzed with gossip that we dont know whether he is white or colored but he certainly is thrifty a few other children would sometimes join him in his work and at school allow him to share their lunch prominently among these was a little dark girl called susie smith susies father was dead and so she and her widowed mother lived alone together yet her mother was young and proud and possessed a neat home and had a few thousand dollars in the bank from which she could draw whenever the income from her poultry farm and garden failed to cover the weekly expenditure susie and jim were the star pupils of the little town and often contested for the place at the head in the spelling row jim was susies senior by two years but they were both in the same grade

one day in may when the school met for the final close six boys and girls were selected to plait the pole three beautiful girls and three fine robust boys one of the boys seemed to be the favorite of all the girls called him jimmie the boys called him jim the day before that he had led the class in arithmetic and saved the day in spelling problem after problem the town folks and wise old farmers threw at the scholars but never failed jim to work every one sometimes jokers sometimes catch problems but seriously quickly and manly worked he every one an example like this one time tripped the whole school if two trains were traveling the same day in opposite directions one starting three hours ahead of the other and had gone  miles traveling at the rate of  miles an hour and the other was making  miles where would they meet on the road and how far would each one have traveled jim worked it and not only won a smile from aunt jane and uncle jonah but likewise won the heartfelt thanks of the teacher for no teacher likes to see his school fail

uncle jonah gave one suppose a man had twenty sick sheep and one died how many would be left

many of the children said why  for one from  always leaves  but he couldnt catch jim he politely said that  would be left

now the word and book battle was over and the gods of the feast had to be fed every person attending had a basket chicken little shoats cakes pies and gingerbread formed the bill of fare

the crowning event before the feast was to plait the may pole and the speeches and dialogues came next with the crowning of the may queen and king as the last event before the meal little susan smith was the queen and our friend jim was the king the scholars making the highest marks were selected hence the pupils leading the school in the general averages were susie and jim

and to these no greater joy could have come than to be king and queen

when dinner began uncle jonah threw the crowd into convulsions of laughter as he looked at aunt jane and winked and said janie you member foe de war when we plait a pole you wuz queen and i wuz king and old jim got so mad i thought i mought have been king right on but janie always liked big men so jim won de day and here i is wid my fuss shoes standing right on de carpet

the professor broke in uncle jonah you have sorter given her up now havent you

oh no sir said uncle jonah never too late for a raccoon to wear a pleated bosom shirt

by the glowing fire coals one night near a fire hearth sat little jim and aunt jane they were talking as usual the boy like all boys since cain stood questioning adam down to the present was right there seeking information and sometimes his question were hard to answer

ma said jim how long have you known uncle jonah

oh bouten sixtyodd years i think if ise not mistaken said aunt jane

why ma that was before the war said jim

aunt jane yes my son when the war broke out in  uncle jonah was a fullgrown man he isnt old as i is but he was grown he was one of the men who was carried from south calina wid de men who went to kansas to fight de free soilers he was de cook

free soilers said jim what do you mean by free soilers

oh yes ma said jim i know about him

chorus glory glory hallelujah

glory glory hallelujah

glory glory hallelujah

his soul is marching on

ma he was the best man i ever read about if it had not been for him we all would have been slaves today

well said aunt jane as i was telling you dis man wuz sent from god to free the cullud folks and de soldiers went aar to stop him and make dat country slave jonah i says wuz cook but jonah wuz hadly over de long ribber fo he brake loose and scape fer freedom

jim interrupted they couldnt catch him

he is a regular pedia he aint got no book laming but he sho is edecated

when the platting of the may pole became a thing of history and a few more summers rolled by a sad incident crept into the life of aunt jane she had never before from the first day that little jim was placed at her door considered a time of parting

these two friends who for many years had cheered each other around the fireside jim and aunt jane must part aunt jane by close saving had laid aside a few pennies that proved sufficient to put jim for a year or two in a faroff university the old saint knew not one school from another but a kind teacher when jim had finished his academic course advised him about two schools nashville and boston jim preferred nashville but the teacher boston jim also reasoned that while nashville was planted in the south and the summer hung around almost the whole year boston for refinement was almost a college in itself and to mingle among its people was like placing two years work into one

jim went off to school and his progress was what all his friends predicted aunt jane soon became accustomed to being alone and susie and uncle jonah appeared to feel the sting of his absence almost as much as his foster mother

a new doctor came to bowser and the old town that never had anything to liven it but public gossip except sometimes a funeral or marriage or when a wandering minstrel or circus visited its cross ways moved on in the even tenor of its ways

one warm day in june when all nature was contriving to make old bowser a duplicate of eden as the bees hummed the honeysuckles waved the peaches looked red on the trees the blackberries waved their hands on every hill top and from every fence corner the violets bloomed in every dale and fragrance filled the air three people while the dew yet stood on the roses and like diamonds sparkled from the eaves of the houses stood at the station to meet the early train

one was a feeble old woman bent by the weight of ninetyodd years wiry form grey haired sharp voiced tenaciously holding on to life some hope like a spark moved in her breast and kept life burning for you know we only die when there is nothing to live for

she hoped she prayed she worked therefore she lived

the other was a young woman in the bloom of life a girl of but twenty summers a blushing rosycheeked curlinglipped ivoryteethed young woman i would say a rose of the spring just unfurling its leaves to send out sweetness to conjure the humming birds and draw the bees but you would say my description is farfetched dressed plainly and simply head erect and upon throwing it back she looked like a queen she was there there like the others watching and waiting with a spark in her breast that glowed through her beautiful dark eyes whenever a certain name was mentioned

then we must not forget the third person you know him wellâthe old sage from the dark continent who had been crushed by the demon slavery but when they looked for him to be mashed and destroyed he came forth a shining coal he was ground in the mill of hardship but instead of being destroyed came forth as a diamond that sparkled in the sunlight of a new era there he was grey headed but yet youthful he was a man who laughed at hardships and through impediments marched on to victory when he was down and you thought hope had mouldered away into ashes he had but one answer its never too late for a raccoon to wear a pleated bosom shirt

you know the three who could they be

none other than aunt jane susan smith and uncle jonah

the train arrived and a rapid stepping curly headed athletic young fellow with sachel in hand football under arm leaped from the car the four sunshines met and melted into one the words of none we record save those of uncle jonah boy we shore is glad to see you janie been cooking all day yesterday for you shes got a powerful lot of good things fer you i dunno whos been studying most bout you susan or janie i sorter git jealous one time case ise ur right here standing on the carpet yit and nobody ever study bout me

uncle jonah said jim you know it took a seven days march around jericho before it fell but suppose they had stopped on the fifth day or the sixth or even six and a half

janie susan you heard dat dat boy talks like a preacher but hes hit de nail right on de head dar is a young gal roun here i courted fore de war an fuss thing you know she gwinter fall my way boy ise see de raccoon a putting on the pleated bosom shirt

a few hours passed and the four souls were sitting around the table in the little old cabin where twenty years before a wee babe had been picked up from the step one cold winter morning

jim drew up and pushed back his hair the other three gazed out the window as a big automobile with its curtains down making twenty miles an hour rolled by

the rushing crowd that thronged the calvary church that sabbath at bowser town was far greater than what it was for many a day

a few leading white people occupied rear seats on one side and colored people crowded everywhere until every available space was taken even the altar and around the platform was used as seats among those who filed in were the preacher and doctor they pushed through the crowd looking right and left gazing at the audience and finally found their seats on the platform the preacher seemed a bit stung and winced the doctor was in harmony with him and said yes people always make a deal of fuss over nothing

yes said the preacher they have gathered here to hear that boy as though he was some great something im glad of one thing i have to introduce him i think i can scratch a little of the peeling off the rind

oh watch your friend a little too said the physician i am coming behind him and the pill i will give will prove a physic that will stir the molecular system

the preacher was one of those misfits in nature who possessed an over charge of enthusiasm that he sometimes mistook for the working of the spirit he was a pretty good parrot who rattled off spurgeon wesley and talmages sermons verbatim et literatim and did it with so much ease that he very often deceived the ignorant and made the simple believe that he was a great scholar one time he gathered the fragments of many old christmas plays together gave a concert and dubbed himself as the author he wrote not a jot of the music nor line of the poetry yet he underscored the play with his signature and told the folks that he wrote the cantata he was a base liar and a man that possessed hatred for anybody that was his superior such people are found all through life but it looks as though the largest number is found in the pulpit

the doctor was not so prejudiced yet his profession as he thought possessed certain qualities that lifted him so far above the rabble as he dubbed humanity that there were courtesies belonging to him quite different from the other sons of adam he and the preacher were associated hence one had a bad case of the malady called egotism and the other had contracted the disease from him as the minister took his seat at the side of the doctor he remarked i see that the great lord of the town aint here yet

no said the doctor

guess he will be escorting miss susie out the belle of the town as she and all the other girls are so crazy about him said the preacher

i guess so said the doctor or some other belle i tell you i havent much faith in these football and baseball dandies

neither have i answered the preacher but it looks like all the world is gone wild over them

while the preacher and doctor were whispering a rustle went through the whole house and the congregation like one man gave an applause that vibrated the walls and shook the ceiling the giant had appeared the peoples favorite was entering the door it was jim aunt jane was leaning on his arm uncle jonah with stick in hand was hobbling on behind jim looked solemn but aunt jane dear old woman as she was knocking close on to a hundred looked angelic the grey hairs adorned her temple and her face was lit up with a smile uncle jonah came grinning down the aisle and one of the devilish boys whispered to another its never too late for a raccoon to wear a pleated bosom shirt

they took their seats that were reserved on the front and jim took a chair between the preacher and doctor both of them extended their hands in the most cordial manner it was now fifteen minutes before the program was to begin but the house was filled to an overflow uncle jonah whispered to aunt jane and said janie i aint seed dis house so full of people but twice fo dis one time was when fred douglass spoke and de time when bishop turner preached here about africa

an opening of the crowd again in the aisles was made and miss susie smith passed to the platform the preacher coughed the doctor cleared his throat and jim crossed his legs

someone in the congregation said she is a queen yet but out of those three fellows on the platform side by side and all of them reaching for her hand its hard to tell who will be king

the other said preachers are right hard to beat and doctors are as proud as peacocks and girls like that

ah said the first speaker if madam rumor has it right women have gone wild over baseball and football players and they tell me that she met him referring to jim at the train the other day

 get you gone ely our professor used to say jims at the bat said the other

the programâjims speech

after a song and prayer miss smith was introduced and she sang does jesus care

which seemed to so thrill the audience that numbers of persons wept great tears rolled down the cheeks of aunt jane and uncle jonah cleared his throat to keep from crying

the song sank deep into the hearts of all even the big three found water settling in the corner pf their eyes the preacher in a sophomore style introduced the speaker he rattled off some old introductory speech that seemed quite bookish no doubt something that had been used by an old learned senator or college president for many of the words he mouthed and others he cut in half one fellow said that preacher is the most exacted man i ever saw to take pains to commit errors

when the preacher ended the bookish dope he remembered his promise to the doctor so he added ladies and gentlemen the gentleman i present to you was picked up at a door some twenty years ago he does not know his mother nor his father but you can see the cracker in him he has just returned from high school next year he tells me he will graduate we have him today as one of our speakers i now present him to you

jim arose and with all the politeness of a diplomat and the grace of an actor began by saying ladies and gentlemen i speak to you today on the future of the negro in america the negro as you know was brought to this country in  on the slave ship jesus he was sold into slavery he was placed in the toil but to his credit let it be said that he is the only race that has been able to look the blueeyed anglosaxon in the face and live

the speech was moderately long and was fairly warm but it was more on the order of the cold new england reasoning near the close he pushed the college veneering back and the hot blood that used to boil in the veins of c n grandison and henry w grady became turbulent he said i can see them the sons of all nations on the stage playing the worlds drama the indian is there he says his speech yea this child of the forest the crowd applause he takes his seat then the mongolian chin chin chinese walks forth he tells of a civilization that existed long before the christ was rocked in the manger a civilization that at one time lead the world and today is yet to be unraveled he made his bow he took his seat the people applauded the fifes whistled the drums rolled the music sounded

the white man the worlds conqueror appeared  his blue eyes shot fire his bony fingers caught the wind and bound the lightningâ he budded out wings mounted the air flew above the clouds he walked the bottom of the sea and felt the heart of the earth he made the desert to blossom pitched railroads over the mighty valleys climbed the highest mountain when the white man ended his part the curtains dropped the people arose to go but the stage manager waved his hand and said ladies and gentlemen not yet we are only changing the scenery the show is not over there is another actâthe last act the music sounded the drums rolled the people waited and finally the actor appearedâa curly headed chocolate drop his words were oil his rule was great he bridged the clouds in his splendor and held the wind in his fist the five continents under his sway became a common fireside and all men worshiped at one altar angels communed with men and a man was a child a hundred years old travel was reduced to such a system that many could breakfast in new york and dine in london three thousand miles away this man ruled as no man had ever ruled and under his reign heaven and earth were married and the new jerusalem was born by the science and the inventions of his mighty schools sickness was banished the doctors became bootblacks sin was destroyed and the preachers lost their jobs and became ditchdiggers the people excited leaped to their feet shouted and screamed but the orator continued when he ended his speech the indian the chinese the saxon and the african shook hands and with one voice said strife today is forever dead and the whole world is kin 

at the conclusion of jims speech for five minutes the house thundered with applause

while jim was speaking the doctor bit his lips the preacher turned ashy and aunt jane was too full of joy to weep and uncle jonah came near standing once or twice the doctor was then introduced and made a strong effort to speak but the tide of eloquence by the college student had so impressed the people that they the preacher ended his sermon that night a trifle earlier than usual to the delight of the congregation previously he spent many moments around shaking hands with the choir and others but that night he hurried out the side door and in a very few minutes was seated by a glowing fire watching the coals while his thoughts battled with expectation and anticipations of the unknown road that we sometimes call the future while he was in this daze a rap was heard on the door without looking up or turning around he knew the stroke so he shouted come in doc and as the doctor entered he stood to greet him

well how is it now asked the doctor

oh said the preacher i was thinking about that molecular stir of yours

oh no fellow i never like for one to say i have the odor of the candle when they are smelling of the wick answered the doctor

what is he asked the preacher

said one and all enough for today let us go home and we will hear thee another day

the doctor was very soon so impressed therefore he took his seat with an air of disappointment on his face jim won for himself that day the praise of the town susan loved him as never before she saw in him not the qualities of the little jimmy that years before led the spelling bees but rather a giant brain that used the english language to convey his meaning and that he was such a master of it that people bent forward to catch every word else perchance one might slip no pen can express the feeling of uncle jonah or aunt jane

that day jim made two enemies who became more bitter when they saw the next day the daily paper filled with a column and a half of the lecture prefaced by daring headlines setting forth the most emphatic parts

you think he is colored what is he

i dont know

the preacher said well i tell you that fellow did some talking why he has the brain of a goliath and his language is perfect

yes i knew that there was quite a rustle about him but it did not once occur to me that he was an orator have you heard what he intends doing do you suppose he is contemplating preaching entering law or practicing

i dont know i dont think he would do much at practicing said the physician he has not the airs and trim manners of a physician i was thinking he would make an excellent preacher what do you think about it

no sir said the preacher he is not spiritual enough you know that calling requires a man deeply spiritual the doctor thinking about his friends gifts made no reply but simply coughed now continued the preacher you know thats where most men make a mistake they do not count the cost before entering upon the highest of all callings now you know if i had not been a man of ability i would never have made the impression in that introduction that i did

the doctor coughed again why i saw a ripple sweep the whole house while i was talking and you know i told you that i would peel the rind

yes said the doctor but have you thought how that fellow struck back at us he said preachers would become bootblacks and doctors ditch diggers when the world reaches its high civilization and did you notice how old jonah looked it seemed as though he was glad then the whole house applauded

yes said the preacher but the bible disagrees with him for it says before the end of time they would become wickeder 

i thought that it was weaker said the doctor

yes i think it says both although my memory is a little dull replied the preacher

yes remarked the doctor i guess preachers are like men of my profession they sometimes make grave mistakes take the bug theory of spreading disease we used to have an old professor who said that he did not believe a word of it and he also believed very little in the knife he only resorted to it as a finale

i didnt know said the preacher that you fellows would ever admit the truth but i guess i will have to say that you are an exception  in fact i have been watching you since the first day i arrived here two years ago say what do you think about doctor boston i notice crowds are always around his office and sometimes he is as drunk as a bed bug yet they pass by good doctors and wait there until he sobers up help to dress him pay for a prescription and take the medicine with more confidence than they do that from the best doctors in town

it is not so replied the doctor

but i know that it is said the preacher

for i have seen them hanging around by the dozen when well dressed doctors with fine offices went for hours with nothing to do

well i deny it emphatically said the doctor getting angry the bible says if a man tells a lie tell him of it

the preacher rose to his feet you dont mean to call me a liar in my own house

that is what i said said the doctor

you are the cheapest man i ever saw remarked the preacher

i think not said the doctor but you are deceived you are i repeat it said the doctor drawing nearer to the preacher and speaking in a lower tone that old drunkard that old drugfiend i say that old scallywag is the best doctor in town i had rather take his opinion on a case than all the dandies in the city i have seen the doctors in town yes white and black hanging about him the darkest hour in the night to get an opinion i have seen precarious cases given up by all the highpriced doctors in town i have seen that old wreck of humanity that drunken doctor go in and bring them to life the preacher could not do anything but shake his headâhis speech seemed gone when he did speak remarked i have seen the same thing in the pulpit

i remember the first church that i served i was right from the seminary and a bit starchy

a bit starchy yet said the doctor

and an old tramp as i thought came to town he was there a week before i met him and i positively was told that he was drunk the whole time well another preacher comes there and raises a denominational strife and scoops in half of my members the old fellow drunk as he was comes around and offers to help me his clothes were in rags his hat yellow with age i didnt know what to do yet i certainly needed help in the meantime i had wired my presiding elder to come immediately i told my friend i would thank him much to come back to dinner yet i was not decided as to my action in the matter of the church work the presiding elder arrived before dinner and while i intended telling him about it it slipped me while we were getting ready for dinner who comes in but this old ragged preacher i saw him first and was a little nervous at what to do but the elder saw him jumped up and ran to meet him and greeted him most cordially on returning to me he said god is with us we have the man i thought he was dead have not seen him for years but we will make him preach tonight i could not quite understand it oh yes said the elder we are lucky we will make him preach tonight when i got an opportunity as you know me you see that i am a straight man i asked the elder do you have that old fellow preach tonight oh yes the presiding elder said i will have him preach and you rush the news around as rapidly as possible i could not understand even myself but i reasoned that if the elder said it let it be

did you let him preach and knew that he had been drinking asked the doctor

yes said the preacher and more than that he told the elder that he was sick and that he knew nothing that would help him so much as a pint of corn to get ready for the service he stated that he had been taking the keeley cure for drink habit thought he was well did not take a drop for three years and all at once he became crazy for it had to have it had been turned out of the church several times but thank god he was making a confession and that he believed that pardon was his

how did he come out responded the doctor

why man said the preacher he entered the church that night on the presiding elders arm and took for his text when i was a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put down childish things he preached the people wild they shouted they screamed they cried i never saw a mortal man preach like that man you know he took every member back and a third of the other fellows members for one hour and a half i thought i was on the mountain of transfiguration

did he make you cry asked the doctor

yes i think that everybody must have been crying then

doctor said the preacher what about that fellow jim you know he has these people fooled

yes said the physician but i know a few things now i heard that his mother is serving a life sentence for shooting his daddy and that when he was born they brought him to that door to lose all identity of his mother

ah said the preacher were they white or colored

now that matter i havent got just straight as yet but soon will remarked the doctor

i would give five hundred dollars said the preacher and snapped his fingers and laughed yes i am poor but i would give five hundred dollars to get the facts for i know that every word of it is just like you heard it

i have the thread said the doctor changing the subject i love that girl susan but since he has been back she has thrown me overboard

the preacher felt his pocket for a letter that he had from her he was a silent lover but worked hard for the first place and said if you dont get her i hope that he dont for i think really she has a turn for a preachers wife

thats it said the doctor every man for himself

i believe it any way said the preacher

with that girl as the queen of my home i would make the bishopric

yes said the doctor you will make the bishopric without her

i think remarked the preacher that we both will have to watch that fellow jim

the doctor remarked i guess i will be going on that

why not stay all night

no i must be at the office i dont know when a call might be made

dont forget to push matters said the preacher i know that susie doesnt want to marry a convict

no said the doctor our people are not like they used to be they use a little common sense now about the married relation

thus the preacher and doctor parted with a vow to meter out vengeance upon jim

while the town was all arife discussing the affairs of the evening jim the orator and while the doctor and preacher were plotting as to the next move jim aunt jane and uncle jonah were spending the evening around a warm fire jim remarked several times to his mother that he thought that the preacher and doctor were such fine men said he i am glad that you have such a fine preacher

susie thinks he is a very able man and she also tells me that the young doctor is so well thought of by the people

yes said aunt jane he is a fine preacher  cose de people seem ter think he is more uv a teacher or essay reader but ise er findin no fault of him cose i aint gointer fight no man of god no and dat doctor is de best church lover dats er gwine amongst dem doctors and dey tell me he gives a right pert medicine

oh said uncle jonah janie you believe he can cure anybody ise right sort of poorly myself sometimes but ise afraid to call a doctor you see ise er been round here a longtime and ise afraid if i take any powerful lot of medicine i mought crap ho ho i aint gwin ter call none of um dat preacher and doctor today when you told em what dar work in the future would be just drawed up like dey was shot an miss susan had to push a handkerchief in her mouth to keep from laughing but boy you made er pression

you think so uncle jonah asked jim

ha ha laughed uncle jonah yes yes you certainly silent dat doctor cose he likes to talk an dat preacher looked like er kitten drapped in er pond

ise always says said aunt jane dat jim has a head on him nobody kin spute dat

ma if you and uncle jonah will excuse me a little while i am going out for a little fresh air

yes son replied uncle jonah you is scused

mind jim be careful said aunt jane you know it is seven er clock dont be out late dey er haulin up mighty heap o people now days

oh boy said uncle jonah wimmen folks always dat way but nothin aint gwinter happen to you

jim pulled his coat about him and left

after he was gone uncle jonah said janie dis makes close onter seventy years since i fuss court you and i thinks ef you gwinter say yes its high time uv it

aunt jane raised the fire iron and said jonah ise gib you dat

jonah said i love no oman but you in all de world and tell de ole man youll marry im

you dont believe me but once you git de pizen in yer heart you cant git it out till something is done will you marry me

aunt jane dropped her head and after a long time said jonah gib me a little more time

jonah said ill gib you till saturday night

while they were talking jim had walked out and after wandering around found himself at the home of miss susan smith they were all glad to see him and after a few greetings he found himself and miss smith quite deserted by the others

she looked at him and just laughed he looked bashful and a bit surprised or i might say wild he had quite a few things in mind but they seemed to have all left him

i havent heard you tell me a thing about your trip since you returned said susan

how was new york i knew that you passed through there

yes said he i spent three days there but i tell you miss smith that while it is a great city there is no place like the south

dont say that call me susie like you always did it makes us look like strangers to call me anything else said miss smith

well you must call me jim then none of your mr johnson for me because i want to feel at home too remarked jim

all right said susie but how about the party friday night well have to use a handle to your name then

i dont care said jim but i just cant feel at home unless you call me jim

well mâer i came near saying it jim tell me about new york

susie said jim new york is a marvel a wonderland why there are more people in one building than there are in this entire town of five thousand people do you know that in that city i have seen a bread line for one block long one man standing behind the other waiting two hours to get a loaf of bread and what do you think of three car lines funning down the same street over the same space land is so valuable and people so numerous that it must be

but remarked susie it is a physical impossibility

not so said jim

how can it be asked susie

why said jim one line is on the ground âthen there is the elevated line in the airâ

and the other

under the ground said jim it is called the subway and the cars under there dont run nay they go so fast they seem to fly there are stores restaurants and shops all under ground and thousands of people go for days without ever seeing daylight

it certainly is a great city said susie

yes continued jim i am told that they have ten thousand police that daily go on duty and over sixteen thousand sunday school teachers who stand before classes on sunday

do many people die there asked susie

yes said jim they have a death every eight minutes and at that rate one would think that they would all die but that is safeguarded by a birth every five minutes

well said susie how about the girls i expect that you got in love with some of them while there

they have beautiful girls said jim

they look like angels some are so small and fair and their eyes are so clear the language so choice i was one day standing on the corner of broadway and rd st and one passed me that fairly flittered along the odor that filled the air seemed sweet as rose of atter i was lost in admiration

say you got stuck said susie and then stop

no little girl dont get jealous i did not get in love said he if i have ever loved a girl if there is one that i might call my angel if there is one that i shall ever look forward to as my love believe me dear girl susie shall be that one

susie bowed her head and when words obeyed the mandates of will she said mr

johnson iâerâyou see i forgotâjim if i could only believe it but i was so afraid some northern girl would steal your heart then you know you are bright and i am dark and i am told that white women marry colored men in the north and i knew that i was poor i didnt know what you might do

not a word of it said jim there is very little of this intermarriage that you speak of there are a few poor whites swedes and irish that marry with colored but i tell you positively and emphatically that they are not millionaires but for jim johnsons part there is but one angel for me she may be ten times darker than she is but i will ever love her if she was as black as the ace of spades and possessed the character that she has i would love her yea i would love but her

susie believe me said jim the negro is not trying to get away from his race there is no woman under the sun that holds the charms for him as is found in his own women i know that i am fair but did i make myself

can i by thinking change one hair or add one cubic inch to this great universe i know you are dark but did you make yourself you had no part in it it was the plan of the almighty but here we are some are dark some red some yellow some brown and some white but who among us can change their skin not one

twenty years ago i found myself shaking on the knee of an old woman but the dearest friend i have in all the world she is black but she has been my life susie believe me

jim stood up i had rather have my tongue plucked out and this arm cut off than deny her

and some day when it falls my lot to take a wife a woman like her a dark woman yes a black woman shall be my wife and my life shall be lost in her life and in eternity we shall be one

oh said susie jim if i could only believe it its too much for me i cant oh

that i could only believe it i know i love you for eight years my life has breathed no other desire no other thought than to think of you you remember the day we plaited the may pole together and you were crowned king and i queen i thought that you looked like king solomon that i read of in the bible and i only wished that i might have appeared as the queen of sheba they tell me she was black jim i dont know how you felt but since that day my soul has been living on your name

jim extended his hands and as he did it she remained a safe distance and extended her hands also there in the gloom of a flickering lamp light that glimmered through a pink and green globe they stood silently gazing into each others eyes a tear of joy like one big diamond rolled from the eyes of susie and jim was too high upon the hills of paradise to break the silence they loosed their hands and half blinded by the joy and ecstacy jim felt for his hat and stole his way into the dark when he returned uncle jonah had gone and aunt jane was deep in the throes of slumber

in a few days the town had forgotten the platform meeting and like all small cities the whole society of young folks were absorbed in the coming event the women were making new gowns the girls were buying new ribbons and many who were not able to get new dresses were getting out the old ones from the trunks and either making them over again darning the weak places or they were dusting them up

the preacher said that he did not like such events too well as it was out of his line but he didnt see how he could stay away

the doctor was awful afraid as he termed it that he might lose a call by not being at his office and that old doctor boston or some other physician would get it but he could not fail to attend the levee why

said he we doctors miss so much in the profession there is so much selfdenial and such a sacrifice on our part

uncle jonah said that if he could call back forty years he would set the pace for the youngsters

ise er gettin sorter painful now said uncle jonah but de music sorter make dis old hoss prance janie knows it she knows how in the old times we boys used to attend parties and dances and grab de rabbit an play roguish sam all de night long

the day of the party arrived a large hall was secured some young women spent most of the morning in decorating and getting ready for the occasion ferns flowers and plants of all kinds were brought and long tables with white cloths lined the building

at the head of one of the tables was an arch that was profusely decorated and under which were two chairs on one the name of jim

was written with green leaves and studded with red holly berries the other bore no initial but all understood that it was placed there for jims best friend the minister was to sit at the other end of the table that held the guest of honor and the doctor was placed at the head of the table just over the hall every preparation in the power of the people was made that the event might be one big success

an orchestra of ten pieces had been secured from the neighboring town and many of the leading elites from there were expected to attend among the folks from that town who would attend was a talkative old fellow that was there by special invitation from the doctor and the preacher no one else knew of his coming he was the man who had given the doctor the thread as to jims ancestry

that night at the party after the speeches if any were made and if there were no speeches during the card party or some other game he was to come up and make himself known to jim and at the same time give him a bit of news so interesting to the preacher and doctor by a concocted plan he would tell jim how glad he was to meet him that he was sorry that his mother was in jailâthat he knew his father for years before he was shot and that he was exceedingly glad to know that he had made a mark in life in spite of the fact that the odds were against him

the night covered the earth like a curtain

the moon like a big ball of fire was just rising from behind the hills of the old town it seemed to be just behind the old station where aunt jane uncle jonah and miss smith had waited for a train a trifle over a week ago the old buildings many of them had been there before the war from those walls the slave and master had spent many a jolly day and sometimes the weird yell of the slave had been heard late in the night as he passed the old graveyard to keep away the ghost all bygone days slavery was gone the whip lash gone the songs gone but the old house that once made this town the pride of the south stood there yet like a mighty phantom against the grey moonlight and the white tombstones and old black headboards stood there also as a reminder that the slave and master of those days were yet inseparable

in a short while crowds of young men and women were seen hurrying along the streets the more fortunate in automobiles laudaus and carriages but the majority were walking

down back of the old jail the shadows of three men might be seenâthe doctor preacher and our friend the unknown

the voice of one said i would give a hundred dollars if i could learn all aboutâ

the unknown said i tell you i know all about it

well said the preacher tell us about it

i told you his father was deadâkilled by his mother

preacher how about his mother

unknown i know all about her

doctor you said she was in the chain gang

unknown yes or anywhere you want her

the preacher and doctor in concert do you think you can work it

unknown if enough steam is put in it

doctor i dont know how you will do it unless you congratulate him on his speech before the company and tell him this strange news as we said

unknown put the steam behind it and i will do the rest

how much asked the doctor

oh not much said the unknown i heard the elder say he would give a hundred bones but i dont want that much

how much stammered the preacher of course a lot of things like the gospel has to be free

this will not be free said the unknown

well set the price said the doctor

no you name it replied the unknown

how would a five spot look

the devil you say exclaimed the unknown what could i do with a five spot

do you suppose i would come way over here and lose my rest and jeopardize my life and turn a girls love to you all for five dollars

not by a jug full

how much then asked the doctor

unknown make it fifty and give half now and the balance when the duck is stewed

doctor cant you do better than that

call it twenty down of course i hope that you understand our position we simply want to see him humiliated as the town is wild over him

and a girl said the unknown all right give me the twenty dollars and the other as you stated

the doctor and the minister stepped aside

speaking confidently the doctor said elder give me  will you i will give the other of course we can get the other later

preacher i havent mine now but i can pay you sunday you fix it it will be all right

how much have you now said the doctor

the preacher felt in his pockets i could spare you thirty cents said he

the doctor turned ashy say what man

thirty cents and i got  to get up

see cant you get him to do a little better

said the preacher

doctor he has said what he would do

preacher and i have told you that finandaily i am incapadtated in other words i am short but i will stand by you yes to the last ditch

the unknown gruffly gentlemen if you gwinter do anything let me have it cose dis is sorter tedious work and i want a little something for this cold before the party

doctor all right sir but we are a bit short

unknown well give me what you have

at which request the doctor gave him ten dollars and promised the other later

now elder give me yours said the unknown

the preacher gave him thirty cents he looked at the minister and said is this yours

well this is way over what i spected for preachers are generally nothing but talkâ whenâ

yes said the preacher the last wine is the best

unknown but it seemed to be such little wine specially when you said you would give a hundred dollars i am surely glad man dat you did not say two hundred

they parted the doctor and preacher going in one direction and the unknown in another when they had separated the preacher remarked to the doctor i guess you will take miss smith out

no said the doctor she has thrown me overboard

i wrote her said the preacher to get the honor and she answered that she was otherwise engaged so i thought you were the one

not i said the physician

while the doctor and the preacher were holding a conference with the unknown jim was far on the road pressing toward susies house so when the conference ended they had reached the thoroughfare in the doctors buggy just in time to see jim and susie going down the street

jim said to miss smith susie i know you will pardon me for not bringing a team

i had one engaged but it did not show up

the reader can see at a glance that some one is doing underhanded work

ah mr johnson said susie i am so glad that you did not bring it you know that you will return to school and this is no time to waste money we can walk that little distance you know how we used to walk with aunt jane and uncle jonah and i know we are much bigger now

as jim and susie marched along she in white and he in black it looked like a wedding all but the preacher jim however was afraid to touch her and barely held her arm

they flittered like two butterflies in spring and as the moonlight struck their form the long shadows united into one and resembled some angelic form crossing the elysian hills

when they were within two blocks of the hall they heard the music the measured time seemed to have been intended for them to walk by now it stops they play a medley old black joe dixie then they struck up bob coles and rosamond johnsons famous air if you like me as i like you and we both like each the same this very day if you may i want to change your name

jim said i never heard anything sound so real in my life

susie flinched and drew up but simply drew a long breath without uttering a word

they entered the hall amid applause music and a most cordial reception

many of the young women were grouped in one part of the building while the young men were in another part talking about the silly things that only young people can think to talk about a few were having checkers fortune games lotto and dominoes while a small crowd was watching the orchestra the tables seemed to be groaning beneath the loads of good things while every now and then the grinding of ice cream freezers and the breaking of the ice might be heard salads chickens cakes pies and other eatables so perfumed the air that appetite was sharpened upon entering the very door jim and susie were soon lost in the crowd jim sometimes with a crowd of young ladies or young men about him talking chattering smiling and joking then again having some innocent game

after a few moments the preacher with another young leader arrived then shortly after the doctor leading a young lady dressed in full pink and a double portion of false hair and false diamonds entered

one of the girls said to the other he cant come in a pullman so he took a tourist

yes said the other i do despise him he tries to be so important and high toned

mind said the other dont get jealous

not me replied the other i would pass by a hundred men like that and never see one of them and that little old sawed off preacher is just like him

the preacher walked over to where they were he he laughed one we were just talking aboutâ

ah girl said the other and by that time four or five had joined the party

i hope said the preacher that it was something good

yes it was about your big sermons

that was so kind of you said the preacher

we are delighted to see you tonight we know how prejudiced preachers are toward such things

yes many of them are said the preacher but i could not stay away i wanted to honor our friend the young college man who is so worthy

we are proud of him said a chorus of voices

no one feels proud of me said the preacher

you see said one of the girls he is so nice he grew up with us we have known him so long and he is so fine

the minister said if you ladies will excuse me a few minutes i want to shake hands with my friend the doctor the preacher walked over to where the doctor was and shook hands with him and the girl in pink

a broad grin stood on his face as he looked at the doctor and said everybody coupled but the divine

yes said the lady it looks as though the divine had a dozen couples with him a while ago

ah remarked the preacher just killing time that is all

every now and then the doctor and preacher would gaze toward the door as though they were looking for some one the fleeting moments rolled by and soon grew into hours the musicians became tired and stopped every little while to talk supper now was all made ready and the guests were served as a special arrangement to seat the guests without that noise and stir that follows such entertainments the party was coupled off and the band struck up repaz grand march and after promenading around the hair two or three times in the grand march each one found his place at the table every one just as arranged to a very gnats heel the preachers back was to the door while the doctor was seated in a position to gaze into the darkness therefore the preacher watched the doctor while the doctor watched the door

supper was soon over and several were called upon to give toasts the doctor was requested to give one in honor of our guest as a college man the preacher on opportunity as it presents itself to a young man just leaving college susie spoke on jim as she knew him in the public school another on what will his future be and several others on different subjects

the doctor in his speech devoted much time in telling of his college life as he found it at maharry but seemed to have missed the mark entirely as relating to jims college life or anything else about him

the minister was not so narrow said he opportunity ever stands in the way of a young man leaving school as he enters upon life there is but one thing to do and that is to seize it i find that most young men are too anxious to marry that is a mistake no man ought to marry until he has money or something to live upon the doctor coughed

yes i repeat it that most men marry too young

susie in a very brilliant and stirring speech told of himâjimâin public school how he had helped the dull students how he led the class and how without any support of parents as he was an orphan yet without the aid of special friends he did whatever his hands found to do like a leaping comet he had swept by one comrade after another till now he lacked but one year of being a fullfledged college graduate and just think how he has done within twenty years what it requires forty years for most men to accomplish

the one who spoke on what will his future be became rhapsodical he said why what shall he be a blacksmith to shoe his neighbors horses nay if he did success would be his

a cook if so he would be the chief a preacher no that high calling has no charms for him but if he was you heard him sunday afternoon you can but surmise that no three churches in town could hold his crowd though they were built into one a doctor no i dont think he would glory in giving castor oil but i dare say that if he was he would lead the state and make new discoveries in medicine his place would be in the long line of stalwarts who make medicine write books and tell others what to do what his future will be i know not but in my vision i can see him entering the gilded hall of fame i can see the daughters of fortune placing a wreath of victory upon his brow ladies and gentlemen let me implore you to rise and give three cheers for jim the young leader of bowser town they all arose even the doctor and the preacher and gave the yell over in the corner around the punch table about a dozen fellows could be discovered who would occasionally quench their thirst on punch

during the supper and while the speeches were being made they had not been discovered but no sooner than the yell for jim was made like a sleeping man just aroused on the train reaches his station jumps up and joins the crowd and does it in a hurry all looked around as they yelled with a tremendous applause among them was a big chunky athletic dark looking fellow who seemed to have shouted three cheers for jim so loud that his voice sounded high above the others his voice was so strong that all had to notice him a red bandana was around his neck and his coat collar pulled up when they cheered three times he cheered again hurrah for doctor jim the doctor looked at the preacher and winked

the man so recently discovered was the unknown the feast being over the music started and a few began waltzing but the majority played some game the doctor walked over to the group of men near the punch bowl and up to the man with the red bandana about the neck whom you have no doubt guessed was none other than the unknown and said if you intend to do that what make you dont shoot

the unknown replied when i sez a thing you can pend on it

well shoot then said the doctor the doctor then walked over where jim was and soon was lost in the mingling crowd in the meantime he tried to get as many friends about jim and susie as he could always taking great pains to show special courtesies toward jim the preacher having seen the doctor conversing with the unknown thought the time was ripe for the triumph so he busied himself drawing all that he could about the guest of honor he and the doctor vied together to see who could go one better in story telling

the crowd by the punch bowl having dried that vessel drew near the company who had formed a circle about jim as they were passing the doctor looked at the unknown and winked and then back at the crowd remarking at the same time have you ever seen a shootthechute then glanced about him for the unknown but to his surprise and chagrin the unknown was passing out the door

he looked at the preacher and frowned the story telling reached a very sudden end and one by one the joymakers filed out of the door jim and susie went along with the crowd the preacher went with the doctor and the girl in pink walked between them

the music hushed the lights of the hall were darkened and the party of bowser town became a thing of history

after jim and susie had gone a certain distance once or twice he thought that he saw some one lurking along in the dark he said nothing they went on conversing and praising the different features of the entertainment jim bade susie good night and started for home a stick cracked near him once or twice

once he thought that he saw a form stumbling along in the dark and managing always to hold the dark street when he got near his home he saw it again he stopped and made an investigation and to his surprise the man came toward him jim could not make out its form he saw something in the mans hand like an old lincoln springfield rifle his hair stood on end his skin grew tight as the man approached he stopped and let down the trigger of the rifle by this time jim was white with fear he felt his pocket grabbed his pen knife in one hand and was almost about to take his sky piece in the other the reader can surmise what he was about to do the man broke out in a laugh haw ha haw

the two walked on together and when they reached the house aunt jane was up by the fire when she saw jim her eyes sparkled with joy uncle jonah with his springfield walked behind

said he janie i wuz powerful scared once tonight that i might have to do some fightin but didnt while he was speaking a big automobile rolled up to the door and our friend the unknown stepped to the door and knocked when he was admitted jim at once recognized him as the man at the party who gave the fourth yell for he had on the same bandana about his neck

said he i wish to speak to you all a bit but swear that you will abide by the contract

its not the best thing to do to swear all de time less you knows what you are swearing

replied uncle jonah

nothing to hurt you said the unknown

they all three stood and raised their hands but the unknown said no let us join them and as we are but four lets swear by the four winds of the universe they joined their hands and in these words the unknown said swear that you will not open a certain letter that i will give you tonight until nine a m in the morning that when you do open it that you three will stand by the tombstone over the street in front of the bank on lemon street

many people think that it is a monument but it is a tombstone that was placed over a grave just twenty years ago at which time that lot was a private lot

yes said aunt jane i remember it well when dar wuz a house on de lot

he continued do you so promise me

they answered in concert we do

their hands were loosened and the unknown took a long grey letter from his pocket

it was closed with wax and a seal thereon he placed it in the hands of jim at the same time saying young man i give it to you because it is yours but keep the vow upon the honor of a gentleman he bade them goodnight and the autombile left the unknown stood on the side of the driver

when the automobile left jim tucked the letter safely into his pocket and after a few passing remarks left the evening to uncle jonah and aunt jane

in spite of the worry and excitement the blessing that belonged to youth was his his eyes had hardly closed as he struck the bed before he was fast asleep and knew nothing nor thought nothing till next morning about seven oclock when he heard a knocking on the window and a familiar voice you all ainter gwinter git up today

a voice answered from the little shed or kitchen ise up already you dont find me in de bed at dis hour but i thought i wouldnt bother jim yit cose i know he is tired

open de door den dont you know its eight oclock and fast gwine on nine

no i wasnt er thinking it dat late jim

jim son you better git up

jim rolled over stretched out bounded from the bed with the practice of quick dressing learned at the school in five minutes he was dressed head combed and ready for breakfast which had been on the table for some time

dat boy sho is pert said uncle jonah

dese boys round here always take an hour to dress

that night when the automobile left aunt janes house it stopped and put the unknown off near the doctors but to his surprise the doctor wasnt home so he wandered down to the peachers and just as he expected the doctor and preacher were holding their council

one said you did wrong to pay so much in advance

i thought i would encourage him

but you see what he did

he did nothing

when i thought that he was about ready to snap the cap he had sneaked out

how long have you known him

i dont know him

what is his name

i tell you i dont know

how did you find him

he found me

you mean to say you dont know him

no i dont know him

that is funny

i dont see anything so funny about that i was attending a case over there and was asking folks did they know anything about the parents of jim johnson and this man came up and took me aside and said he could make me wise i told him how i loved susie and that if he would help me what i would do then he made an agreement to meet me tonight as we did

what did you say was his name

i dont know i tell you

by that time a blundering was heard on the porch then a knock the preacher opened the door and to his surprise the unknown with the bandana about his neck was before him looking half sleepy and a jug in each hand the preacher called the doctor doctor jones here is a man who wants to see you

the doctor came or rather walked to the door

i want to see you both said the unknown

then he went to crying i think you did me fine call yourself a preacher and tried to beat me out of my money

i resent it said the preacher

unknown you sent me nothing i aint got nothing but  cents an you talk about best wine ise got some right here in dis jug as good as anybody wants

the preacher man i cant fool with you i dont owe you nothing

unknown talking louder and half crying  you do you owe me  and dat doctor jones owes me  you know you know you owe me i want my money i tell you

man come inside dont talk so loud or you will wake up everybody in this community

said the doctor

unknown i aint coming no whar

speaking louder i think you fellows are beats i want my money you know dat you owe me

the preacher speaking to the doctor privately say man we got to get this fellow from here if we dont he will ruin us

what can we do said the doctor

i dont know said the preacher but we have to do something

unknown speaking still louder  gentlemen i wants my money i says i did your work so i want my money im going and git a perlice an you will give me my money

the preacher was so anxious to get him away that he said go get him then we dont owe you nothing i dont know your name

unknown leaving i know yourn you is elder slackum i know all bout where you come from

at that news the preacher drew up then remarked you know i had rather give that old guy a thousand dollars than be followed up by him

the doctor said what are we going to do if he comes here with his police of course we have done nothing but you know the scandal in court and the newspaper publicity to such things

yes said the preacher guilty or not when it gets to the public some one believes it

the reader may not have forecasted the plot of the doctor in finding jims ancestry and the public demonstrations at the hall if it had been carried out but that was his aim he simply wanted to create a scandal and whether it was true or untrue it would serve his purpose

about two oclock the doctor said i guess i will go as its late

the preacher said not tonight you will either stay here or i will go and stay with you but you will never remember leaving me here alone

while they were talking and had decided to go to bed even if they could not sleep a heavy stepping resembling that very much of the drunken man was heard then a knock

doctor jones called the voice is you gwinter gimme my money wake up men and gib me my money i got to go home to my wife elder i want my money

the preacher got up and opened the door

the unknown pushed in he tried to prevent him but with jug in hand the unknown pushed in and continued to speak louder give me my money the men could not appease him so they made up what they could and gave him but yet was short after he received what they gave and a promise for the balance they tried to bid him goodnight but he yet hung around and refused to go

he said elder scuse me but i want to taste a little of dis for my cole have some

the preacher said no thank you i never drink

it wont hurt you

no i just dont think it right for preachers to drink

i seed you do worse than that

i think not

i see you and doc tried to make me tell a story on dat young man

man i dont understand you and if you say that again i will put you out of here

dont lie on me i

you call me a liar and i will break this jug on you

i did not say liar but dont lie on me

dats what you said youre a liar if you said i lied on you

the preacher ran out of his coat grabbed his sword out of his k of p scabbard and made a lunge at the unknown but the unknown man dropped one jug and raised the other and warded off the blow they stood in the room gazing at each other

the unknown said i have a mind breaking this jug over your head

the preacher made a lunge at him again

he warded it off with the jug

in the meantime he seized the scabbard and twisted the belt around his arm and when the preacher struck at him again he knocked the sword from his hand the doctor seized it and ran out on the porch he ran behind him the two stood in the moonlight this time he struck at the doctor saying you all want to run over me

the preacher ran out with a jug as a weapon about this time the fight was pretty warm when all at once a lady dressed in white said doctor whats the matter

the doctor raised his head the fight stopped the unknown ran off the peacher hurried into the house it was susie

nothing susie what are you doing out so late

mother took suddenly ill said susie and there was no one at home to send so i ran over for you to come at once

yes said the doctor that is one of our society practices we cant well do it in the day without creating excitement so we use this hour

why did the others run said susie

oh said the doctor they did not want you to see them

susie hurried on back home and as quickly as the doctor could get over to the office and to the patient he made it

at nine oclock the next morning around a big monument standing ten feet from the top to the base made of vermont marble and beautifully carved bearing the inscription to commemorate the daring deeds of the noble stood three persons an old woman at the east an old man at the west and a young man in the middle looking toward the north

if it was a novelist writing this he would say a robust young man in the bloom of life whose cheeks were painted by the fluid of youth curly hair of chestnut hue lips that parted his body strong and athletic shoulders that bid fair to some day be graced by a martial uniform standing there like a giant but so drooped that day by strange thoughts that the weight of so little a missile as a letter bent him and pressed tears from his eyes

he looked at the tombstone and his thoughts rambled suppose whispered he in his heart that she sleeps there my mother he sleeps there my father mother jane has told me so much about them oh i wonder if it is true

if i only knew it if it is true and if it is so and i knew it i would bow on my knees and kiss the dust to their memory i would press my lips to this cold marble i would bathe it down in tears and feeling for it i would reach my arms about it and feel for once that my mother had her arms about me they tell me that spirits walk they mount the air and seeing her poor son with a bleeding heart from zion she would come and kiss my brow my father would join her in a whisper that would go through my soul like a thunder roll i would hear their voices so loud and yet sweet as an angels voice say my son in this halo of glory i would read this letter written by the fingers of my mother here and there i would see tear drops and then the news would break upon meâher last words

he would paint the picture of a helpless old woman who for ninety years had fought hardships pain yea death who had struggled on through life some days on a single morsel yet she lived every hair in her head was white and yet never once had she tried to hide them with dye her heart was so gay she simply thanked god that she lived she never tired talking of the past yet her eyes ever tried to penetrate the future she had been wooed by many but only knew one husband who was now sleeping beneath the sod he had gone and her friends one by one like the stars had all gone down now at the parting of the ways her only friends the sun and moon one would soon be hidden behind the hills the other was just rising there she stood gazing at the west with a soul as big as the universe and a heart made of love there in the cold air of the morning she stood thinking and wondering if what she had sought for twenty years was now to be revealed by the letter

he would describe uncle jonah as a feeble old man who has crossed the hills and vigor of manhood and now stood within the vale the dews of eightythree winters had frosted his brow and the sweep of rolling years had taken the activity from his limbs he lived in the past he talked of the darings of brown jeff

davis lee and grant and convulsed the crowd in laughter by his native wit and ability and the wonderful stories of lincoln as he stood there like the sun almost down in the west he wondered whether or not the news sought for twenty years was not soon to be revealed

the town clock in solemn tones one after another struck nine aunt jane with tears in her eyes uncle jonah fairly devouring the letter with his eyes so anxious to learn the contents jim with a trembling hand tore off a bit of paper and dropped it as though each piece represented the stroke of the clock and as the old clock struck nine his fingers pushed open the letter the first thing that met his gaze was the edges of bank notes a little note written by the nervous hand of a woman stained in two or three places and written on pink paper was tucked among it he read the note and then in a soft audible voice to aunt jane and uncle jonah who drew nearer he counted one thousand  two thousand  three thousand  four thousand  five thousand dollars 

five thousand dollars said jim

what you say son said aunt jane poor old soul liked to have shouted

five thousand dollars said jim

yes sir said jim

uncle jonah shook his head well i hearn edicated people change things powerful bad

there is another old sire that i like to think about dear uncle jonah i hope to reward them some day but god is good and he ever keeps the faithful i am enclosing you a few pennies  five thousand dollars to finish your schooling and help fix you and aunt jane and uncle jonah in shape to meet us

this envelope has a letter written on it also but its contents cannot be read unless the envelope is dropped in water and kept awhile but upon the honor of a gentleman do not open it for ten days after you open this the man with a bandana around his neck as well as other friends for twenty years have watched over you and aunt jane and uncle jonah

only do not ask who wrote this letter or sent the money dont ask even who the party is that watches over you let me make a request

put the money in the bank at once and on the tenth day you and aunt jane and uncle jonah and the best friend you have in the world as far as you know lady or gentleman but a lady preferred and the unknown man who delivered this letter who will call that day at nine p m meet together and dip the envelope in water and read my message the unknown man understands it well he will fix it for you

kiss aunt jane and hug uncle jonah for me

your loving dear

p sâi sign no name but shall stain it with one of the thousand of salty tears i have shed for my love

a tear spot not only was found on the bottom of the letter but all through it

jim aunt jane and uncle jonah walked over to the bank and for the first time in their lives deposited money jim understood it theoretically so that day he put it into practice

uncle jonah touched the pen as the person recommending jim when the banker asked uncle jonah how could he recommend him when he didnt know the banker uncle jonah replied i nursed your daddy captain i knew you fo you wuz born and for mending dis boy i mend him for the president of the united states an dis gal you see pointing to aunt jane was er woman fo freedom wuz deeclared

it was twelve oclock that saturday before the rev mr slackam got out of bed in general appearance he looked as though he was bowed in health and troubled in mind he tried several times to get out his sermon or read over those already written but upon doing so he found himself always looking into vacancy

he shoved his sermon book aside grabbed his hat and went down town as he walked he had even a stealthy move he was constantly gazing in every direction he saw the whole town and apparently saw nothing by far he was not the man of a day before he couldnt believe himself that such a change could take place in so short a time he stood in front of a show window with hat in hand and to his surprise his hair had turned white he did not know himself he wondered was it slackam or someone else in a single night said he in just a single night i but thirtyone years of age am an old man

before he realized it tears stood in his eyes his throat got full he repeated again old in a single night

while standing meditating one walked up and tapped him on the shoulder and said elder i want my money and broke into a laugh it was doctor jones he remarked man we had a time of it last night

yes said the preacher much more like that and i will be no more

the doctor replied i certainly gave susie a turn didnt i

yes

well continued the doctor i remember when i was at meharry my chum and i got all worked up to get us a private skeleton

of course they had plenty of skeletons but we wanted one of our own we talked about it and planned for it but times were hard and we never could get the price so my friend says to me jones i have a scheme i know where we can get one i was tickled to death and said old boy pop your whip he says jones there is a little graveyard on the edge of town now we will watch for the next funeral and at night while the dirt is yet fresh we will get our man you see me i said i think i do but its a little cloudy how are you going to get him to your closet doctor oh thats easy said he we will rent a teamâsay a horse and buggy for a dollar and thats all the expense said i how about the decomposition jones said he the receipt for cooking a rabbit is to first catch him we can handle that matter the opportune time arrived an old fellow died we rented a team and played the trick my friend was tickled thoroughly to know that at last we were fixed we dug up our man placed him in the buggy wrapped him securely in a sheet then we went back to cover the grave while we were gone some other student it must have been a student heard of our scheme so he takes the dead man out while we were at the grave then he gets in the buggy with the sheet about him now as we opened the gate to go out of the cemetery we had a glimpse of some one coming hence you see we had to hurry we jumped in the buggy and went off in a trot when we were way on the road my friend pushed the sheet about the dead man and lowed jones this man is warm i said of course that sometimes happens as you know the profession teaches we went on i thought nothing he felt him again and shook his head and repeated take his hand he is warm i felt the dead mans hand and then said he sure is the dead  man said if you had been down where ive been you would be warm too

what did you do asked the preacher

i dont know myself i know that i didnt see my friend any more for a day i lost my hat and it yet remains a mystery what became of the horse now continued the doctor that thing last night beat that

by that time they had reached the doctors office as they walked in and removed their hats the doctor jumped back and said you have fooled me this is not slackam i am addressing

the preacher said with a voice that yet bordered on fear i am he

no man

yes i am he it will all soon be over here i am gazing at myself an unknown man

the preacher reached out his hand and the doctor caught him as he fell to the floor

the reader no doubt has noticed that the doctor was like lots of humanity a man who weeps but yet possessed an iron will he could think on his feet and while he was treacherous and jealous yet supremely selfish he could always retain selfcontrol and generally knew what to do next he was a bad man he was a good man he was one of those contradictions in nature he would weep over the grave of an enemy and on another occasion rob a friend the preacher was different he possessed a green eye of jealousy and when he hated you he fought you like judas iscariot he could sop in the dish with you and forecast your death he was a little thingâa little worldâbut an atom the doctor was like steel flexible looked soft but was hard the preacher a piece of cast iron painted in silver shining hard stout strong but brittle

that night the doctor had gone over to susies house relieved her mother got in a word sidewise on love made a few dollars returned home took a two hours nap up by eight and out on time for his calls chanced to see aunt jane and jim leaving the bank he was making calls right on when he disocvered his friend the preacher if there was anything at all that troubled him it was the desire to know what would be the outcome of this midnights episode with the unknown man

when saturday night came almost before the sun was down uncle jonah called at aunt janes house he asked for jim but was told that jim tried to remain at home but so desirous of breaking the news to susie that he had gone to her home however he had only been gone a few minutes in fact said she dont see why you didnt meet him

didnt though said uncle jonah

you just as well come in said aunt jane

sort a think so replied uncle jonah

what you gwine to do tomorrow jane i was er coming down the street an i hearn dat the preacher was dead ise not so bright about it but dey tell me its so is shure an if it is so we is in a bad fix

jonah you staken said aunt jane i said give me twelve saturday night to think bouten it

i know twas somethin like dat replied uncle jonah

while they were talking jim walked in

why how are you uncle jonah said jim

sort of tollable thank you son how is you

quite well thank you

come nigh the fire

no thank you uncle jonah i just forgot a poem i wanted to take over to show susie

since you been gone i spect you was mighty nigh there replied aunt jane

yes ma jim remarked i was about a block from her house before discovering i did not have itâthat well i will be seeing you uncle jonah but dont forget monday night of next week

no i will be down said uncle jonah and then renewed his conversation with aunt jane janie how about it

what

you gwinter marry me

jonah things changes so

dats it i want a change

sorry but you have to give me twelve adder the ten days when we see what jims got to do about dat letter

uncle jonah wiped a tear from his eyes and said but de pizen is in my heart janie say yes

aunt jane shook her head so uncle jonah returned home just as he did many times before disappointed but still hoping

jim upon reaching susies was received with the cordiality of a prince said she i have seen many receptions in bowser but not one so fine as the one that we had last night

you think it was fine

jim indeed so that speech of yours was the greatest thing i have heard college girls speak and the best of them but that speech of yours was the best i have ever heard any woman deliver

my dear jim if you say that you will embarrass me for you know i am only a poor girl who has had but limited opportunities

dear little girl i got to thinking about you last night and i wrote these lines sing oh my angel sing such joys bring thou to me that eer thy voice doth ringâ fill thou my soul with glee

last night a dream had i as slept i upon my bed thee saw i passed me by and after thee i sped

twas mong our lakes that boil neath bowser s sunny clime on americas fairest soil where love is told in rhyme

when said thou you love me lost was gone my mind adore i the track of thee my love for thee sublime

oh jim thats fine

i am so glad you think so any way it is my heart you know susie i found out about the carriageâwhy i couldnt get it

did you i am glad you saved the money but tell me about it

not right now wait a while

why not now   no wait

if you say so

susie i want to make an engagement with you

susie drew up her heart beat faster like a flash a spark shot through her mind she thought of her mother who was not necessarily prejudiced toward jim but she always wanted her daughter to marry a doctor or a preacher or as she used to say a big man susie for her part loved jim as david did jonathan with her whole soul but how could she go against her mother the doctor had just been there that morning and although her mother was very sick he had relieved her and in fact she was well and as he always did chat so pleasantly as she said and there was something in his very manners that she liked

yes said jim an engagement for monday night it may be a little late about  at my home now i will call for you

all right said susie

you will not have to stay so long said jim

susie seemed puzzled but jim was equally puzzled therefore he could not enlighten her yet he felt that she was his best friend

there was the hook of love in her heart the same hook was in his therefore flutter as they may some day they would be pulled upon the banks of matrimony

by the quick change of temperature that so often took place at bowser it would require an expert weather man to forecast what the weather would be within the next ten hours

the day looked for monday the tenth day had come how slowly did time seem to drag not only to susie and jim but even to uncle jonah and aunt jane time always drags it seems to the young who are full of vitality and anxious for certain days to a child christmas never comes fast enough or say closing school day or even birthday but to the old time flies we hardly finish paying last christmas bills before it is time to start all over again the girl is budding fast into womanhood the boy now tall as father it seemed but yesterday when they were babies upon our knees everyone looked forward with a certain degree of expectancy

the day had come aunt jane fasted as she needed special prayer to tide her over any news of a sad nature suppose said she within her heart that it might develop that this boy is a white child and that if such is the case the law would force upon us a separation at once and in her words im gittin old now for years he has been my life when my husband died twentyone years ago de load was too much for me we had been walkin down the lane of time for about fifty years together in slavery and in freedom in virginia carolina and flurdy in perfect love we lived together and regretted it narry time to quit

when he died sez i life aint worth livin i have tried many er time to die but i had to wait fer de good lord to call me sometimes jonah console me as he an my husband was er courtin me de same time and one time i could hardly tell which id marry den i married jim now jim died i wasnt dar as he died at sea and i seed him no more after a evening when he was gwine to his work and he kissed me goodbye and up an sez jane i dont know when i kin git back but ef i dont git back heaven is mine so i couldnt marry no more so a year after dat i finds dis boy

he woke up de spark in my breast i sez jane raise dat chile an some day he makes you glad from de fuss day down to dis he is like joseph in pharohs houseâhe bless de house and luck is mine before dat i couldnt git work sometimes but atter dat i got plenty workâeasy jobs and good pay now if he is taken away and she would kneel and pray and put her hands to her eyes as tears rolled down in floods oh merciful marster jesus ef jim is only white ef he is taken from me no more ma jane no more my son ef he is taken lord let me die that day her groans her love would melt you to tears

uncle jonah thought lots but said little

sometimes he might have been caught shaking his head and saying to himself five thousand dollars enough to buy a forty acre tract of land ten mules and a wagon i tell you it aint too late for a raccoon to wear a pleated bosom shirt

susie in her expectation thought possibly that jim wanted to clinch their engagement hence she didnt know just how as she said i can break the news to mother for she seems to like that preacher and doctor mighty well i dont know what jim is going to do but i am quite certain that he doesnt want to preach or mix pills either

jim in his expectation thought that the best thing to do was to just wait as he had missed the mark so many times here of late that he thought the best thing to do was to just let things unravel themselves or in other words to not try to cross the bridge before reaching it as the old adage used to go

the day arrived during the day the sun shone bright and warm but as the sun went down the temperature grew warmer the clouds became dark old nimbus tried himself the thunder reminded one much of a cloudburst whenever it took a notion to rain at bowser it rained sometimes all business ceased the streets looked so deserted that night that the town appeared gloomy jim safeguarded himself against all disappointment of carrying out the request of the letter that he had received by sending a machine for susie

susies mother regretted very much that susie had to go out in such weather but after thinking over the matter and as susie had very much desired it she permitted her to go

at one minute of nine while jim susie aunt jane and uncle jonah were assembled about a bowl of water jim with envelope in hand wondering what to do next and constantly referring to the letter for directions an automobile rolled up bringing the unknown who still was decked with a red bandana about his neck he stepped up and was admitted

he smilingly remarked just in time we will drop the letter in water and in a minute we will have its contents

the crowd stood there with anxious eyes

the letter was emerged beneath the water at first it appeared milk white then a tint began to cover it it turned yellow then the words in every line stood forth in bold relief

the unknown raised it up and held it before the lamp and after it dried together they read  loubet ave paris france march th

dear jimâten days ago you read a letter at the tomb of your father who twenty years ago was cut down in the flower of manhood

in order to relieve your mind i will give you his name which was theo unoman the name was a little hard for many people to pronounce so he was generally called the unknown man

for a long time we lived in new orleans but when the yellow fever broke out there we fled to bowser we had both contracted the fever however and when we reached bowser it had developed he took the black vomit and when he took that we lost all hope he alsa knew that his death was certain he called the doctor and nurses about him and said i am going to die but i beg a favor of you promise me that you will grant it they all promised with tears in their eyes said he if my wife revives and i have a presentiment that she will and if she gives girth to a certain child if it is a girl name her mary for she shall be the mother of a great man but if it is a boy child he shall not be named he shall be turned loose upon the chilly world of charity but i want my brother to watch over him by helping him to help himself try him for twenty years and if he proves worthy let him stand upon my tomb and receive five thousand dollars  and which amount shall be banked at once this money is not to be paid in the presence of his mother whom i hope at that time and on that day shall be at my fathers home in france other conditions are if this boy proves worthy he shall be given fifty thousand dollars upon his twentyfirst birthday on that day he is to be married i hope and if aunt jane and uncle jonah are alive for at the door of aunt jane when he is a day old he must be left as they have courted so long if they are married or will get married also give ten thousand dollars to them hoping that you will bear in mind that i want this boy to name himself or some one else to name him as i want all identity hidden from him as to the wealth and ancestry of the family if he doesnt bear my name it hardly matters for i have always been called the unknown man like moses he is to be a leader like john the baptist he is from god then he must come up in a new atmosphere

your father ended his speech fell back in his bed and died i recovered from the fever

no one knew at bowser except the doctor that it was fever we had therefore to allay the fear and prevent the spread of disease the house was quarantined and the body of your father my husband was taken out in the garden and placed beneath the sod as soon as i was well we left by night you were born and aunt jane can tell the rest the grave naturally would have aroused suspicion but we bought the lot and suggested the idea that we would make it a park and raise a monument to the captain theo unoman for fear that someone might suspect the grave we placed on it in honor or to commemorate the memory of one of daring deeds

to watch over it we placed in the house d

s unoman who was to see no one but to stay in the house by night and day live to himself and when he went for the purchase of food to get it from neighboring towns and never meet anyone or be seen consequently for a long time the people got the idea that the house was haunted and the news was generally whispered that an unknown man was seen about the place

one night a great storm came the house was blown down and torn away and hence the aim of the donors was consummated a stranger to the bowserians was in the city at the time and suggested the monument and the money came in a way that no one has ever been able to tell

the people forgot about the unknown man but jim i am glad to tell you that this man always kept his eyes on you and tonight as you read this letter remember that it is from the dearest one you have in the world the unknown man will also give you a verbal message for me which i want you to carry out to the letter

your loving mother theresa unoman

now said unoman i have a special message for you i have finished now let me say my work that i had to do i promised your mother to look over you in a way and to prevent any destruction or mishaps that might befall you this i have done this year my contract closes i was to guard you for twenty years and present the letters i delivered after which my responsibility ended i leave this year to join the expresidents envoy for africa and i know not when i will return i have a presentiment that i never will nevertheless it is my hearts desire to go there and if i should depart this life like cox the missionary let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his now i am instructed to inform you that on june i of next year that your mother will arrive in new york on the lusitania you aunt jane

what responded jim my mother alive and will be in new york

yes said unoman she is alive and will meet you in new york

ah shouted jim is it possible my mother lives thank god that she lives and she will meet me in new york

yes said unoman she lives and let us pray that she has been kept secure from harm that he will continue to keep her dear jim she loves you but she was trying to carry out your fathers last request you know not the heartaches the pain the sorrows that must have come to her in order to carry out his request but so far to the letter she has lived up to it will you meet her

meet her said jim my soul goes out to her tonight my spirit will stand on laubet avenue in paris and commune with her she will know that it is her son and my sleep will be sweet as never before for today i have two mothers who with their heart shall call me my son 

now said the unknown you will meet her but will you know her

my mother said jim i would know her ashes if i should ever chance to get within view of that form i will feel her presence i will know her voice for instinct itself will tell me that is my mother oh i wonder how will i feel no tongue can express it no pen can write it or painter describe how a poor boy for twenty years has drifted on the waves of time all alone gazing ever gazing at the human barks that passed searching praying looking and hoping to find his mother i never once felt that she was dead but what my feelings were i know not but oh to know that she lives to look into her eyes and search for some likeness some peculiarity that proves that that blood is blood of my blood and bone of my bone like adam beholding eve my soul will be filled with ecstacy

you will do this said unoman take this bandana and wave it at the ship as it arrives and a lady will return the compliment with a red parasol and upon landing she will walk with the same in her left hand by this you will know that such a one is your mother

take this one and preserve and keep it until that day saying this unoman gave jim the red bandana that was about his neck and at the same time he pulled another from his pocket

jim took it and said i thank you from the depth of my heart you have planted a seed of love in my heart for you that will ever remain like the mighty palm it will send its roots downward into an everlasting gratitude and its branches will grow and spread into a thousand branches of friendship bearing the fruit of reciprocity on every bud that shall stud the branches

young man give me your hand said unoman you are a noble man and a true unoman for among the sons of men those who prove faithful to those who befriend them are unknown as i behold you i see more and more the big heart of your father captain unoman shining out in your countenance a greater man a more noble man and a braver man never lived as a man of means no man ever came for help and went away hungry he was a father to the needy and a succor to a hundred widows he was a loving friend but a fierce enemy along certain lines he was peculiar but a greater roman never lived i noticed the other evening at the reception that your presence proved that you were a sun whose heart warmed the multitude with ardor and held them with as much ease as sol does his planets and satellites about him if there is any difference in you and your father it is the inherited character of your mother whose voice possesses an eloquence that has the cadence of a harp and is as sweet as a melophone

ah said jim can i wait a year a whole year to see my mother nay how can i

yes remarked unoman you must wait

but ejaculated jim it will look like an eternity

nevertheless promise me that you will not violate the contract but that you will wait

if it was my fathers will and my mothers desire i will abide the time

give me your hand

there on the porch of the cabin where twenty years before the baby was found in a basket the two stood shaking hands the storm was past the stars shone bright and every anon the birds were heard whistling on the distant hill while the cricket chirped from the walls together in relation were they as they had been twenty years ago jim was that baby unoman was that man who placed the baby there as they stood shaking hands a tear settled in their eyes

unoman said i leave tomorrow but a letter i will give you which tells the rest i want you to read it alone and think it over soberly with prayer and meditation he bent over and kissed the brow of jim and said watch that doctor but be a man in a whisper he said i am your uncle captain unoman was my brother keep that tell it not even to your best friend

jim reached out his hands oh my uncle

i have ever thought that not a relative had i in all the world but are you here tonight do you breathe your breath upon my brow

unoman as jim uttered these words vanished into the dark jim returned into the house and in a little while he and susie were on their way to susies home just as they passed the bank jim looked towards the park and for a few minutes stood there gazing

tears rolled down his cheeks he said susie come with me and upon his knees he fell

he bowed his head against the marble and he said my father dost thou sleep here

susie drew back and said jim pardon me i must go

jim arose and followed

she stopped and said did i understand you to say my father

jim bowed his head and said i did oh

susie i know it all he sleeps there

susie drew away from him

susie dont leave me said jim

but i must said susie

the clock pealed forth and jim realized that it was  oclock

oh said susie so late

they walked to the door and then they bade each other goodnight

while all these things were transpiring at bowser the preacher was under the treatment of doctor jones and the care of tender hands who gathered about the doctors home the doctor knowing as he did that the disease was brought on by excitement worry and care arranged a place at his home for he knew that another such night at the ministers home might mean death to the patient for days the rev slackam was a sick man sometimes delirious  sometimes he did not know those about him but always very sick one day he sat up in his bed and made a confession said he its all over now last night i had a dream

i thought that conference was in session i saw the men appointed and saw another take my church i wanted it i contended for it but it was gone i saw my enemies crowd upon me a petition was offered against me there was no hope for me the man who led the crowd i could not see so well but finally i saw a young man walk through the crowd and seized the leader and brought him to me this man held the paper of my removal i looked into their faces the man who fought me was doc and the young man who captured and brought him to me and exposed his plot was the young man i have hated without a cause

it was jim the preacher stopped talking burst into tears and said as he fell back into the bed its all over i will soon be gone

the people said different things about him

some said he had lost his mind others said he had resigned the churchâhe has given up hopeâi cant see how his hair got whiteâ somebody has thrown a hand at him others said but the doctor said he would soon be all right

as the days rolled by to the surprise of the community the hand the doctor was playing with susie was really marvelous he and susie were seen out together riding several times all the young people began whispering about the matter the girl in pink became angry the preacher as he heard more and more about it gained strength and all the young women were intensely proud of it for they said if the doctor gets her it will give some one else a chance for jim

jim did not call upon any of the other girls only in a cordial way but the treatment received by him from susie made him feel serious jim had not told susie of the five thousand dollar  gift but it had been whispered around among a few of the bankers friends and one day at dinner it dropped into the ear of a certain cook who spared no pains to circulate it and while susie had not heard of it yet she had heard some mysterious things and had seen some that seemed to puzzle her very much in a general way some of the girls whispered he is as rich as jay gould and as learned as old socrates

one day jim received a letter from susie that read as follows bowser ga july th

dear mr johnsonâ this will inform you that i have yours to hand and contents duly noted sorry that i cant accept your invitation for a ride to the picnic on lake jackson as i am otherwise engaged hope that you are well and still succeeding we are all well say i am glad to inform you that the bit of news you kept from me as to the team i have heard all about it

they have falsely tried to lay it on dr jones but it is not so i spoke to him about it and he denies it emphatically i know that it is not he for he swears to me upon the honor of his dignity that not a word of it is true and that you are the best friend he has in the world

you know jim the doctor is so good and i know he would not tell a story

your old schoolmate susie smith

p sâthe doctor and i are going fishing next week come and go with us you and elder slackam might get a buggy and go along by that time he will be up i am sure

when jim received the letter and after learning the contents he threw it to the floor and stamped on it said he i hate it for i may not be able to fulfill certain desires of my mother if things keep on at the rate they are going jim did not go over to susies but wrote her as follows bowser ga july th

dear little girlâ i did not know that i loved you till that last letter of yours reached me but now i find myself insanely in love with you my poetry was but a sensual poets dream the thought that splutters or i might say that bubbles from my heart but now i have been able to reason out my way in life and as i reach the point more and more i dream only dear susie of thee may i add that there is one over the sea who is my guardian and star of hope in this life and an inspiration of the life beyond it is her request that my partner be just such a one as you now tell me dear susie that you love me say you love me and my life becomes one big effulgent ray of the great divine say no and my soul loses its brilliancy and heat and like an incandescent lamp whose fuse is gone it becomes illuminous yea it is dead

yours sincerely jim

when susie received jims letter she spread it out beside the doctors she said for my soul i cant tell which i love yes i can i love dr jones once i loved jim once my highest ambition was to be his wife and beside him all men looked vain as nothing but since the night at the monument he has shattered my love he no more gives me the feelin his presence i used to have to me now he seems a serpent from whose presence i draw away and from whose touch i would flee yet he would continue to seek after me draw me to him haunt me yea conjure me but how can i love him a negro loving such a man a white man my nature rises in revolt it is unthinkable now doctor jones i do not love but he is so good and mother serves him as a god and may not i after all let her choose for me and if for no other reason than for mothers sake

one evening long after the picnic trip while susie was alone meditating about her lover a knock was heard at the door it was jim she received him but instead of addressing jim as usual in all her talk it was mr johnson in coldness she fairly breathed frost upon him but this instead of driving him away only made him love her more intensely

with tears in his eyes he pleaded for her love for a kind consideration for just a promise to become his wife when he graduated but to every request she said no

one time he drew near her to place his hand upon her hand and she bounded back as though he was a snail he asked to be allowed to come around to take her to church but this request was refused by finding some excuse

the doctor was often seen out with her and ie time the preacher however she was only out with the preacher once for as the boys were passing her and as they looked at the preachers grey hair they said grandpa must be taking his little girl out for a walk the doctor heard about it and teased her more the atmosphere changed and there seemed to be but four souls happy in bowser aunt jane who had finally given uncle jonah a promise to marry him one month after jims graduation and the others were susie and doctor jones susie could not move for the doctor and the doctor seemed to have been her counterpart

one evening uncle jonah was down to aunt janes and he said janie i never seed anything so much like myself in my life i noticed dat gal susan was once crazy about jim and now she seems to forget all bouten him

yes said aunt jane he is stirred all over about it too sometimes he cant hardly eat for twenty years i have known him but i have never seen him so fretted he is a pining away like an old rooster i once had on de yard when he was left without a hen

well said uncle jonah i was piddling around de yard over to the doctors the other day and i hearn such a laughing i keeps one year open and i hears him say to susie do you spect to be my wife she says i will think about it my mother told you yes but i will think bouten it the doctor says you will say yes but you wont casin you gwinter marry jim then what you reckon she says

she say i wouldnt marry jim if he was the last man in the world i used to love him but sumpin has drived it away jist like he is pizen i sorter felt bad cose i know how like a dry pear with all the juice gone how for fifty years my hearts been and now in the last month since you says you will marry me next june i feel like a kittle with syrup juice biling over

jim walked up and as he was approaching he heard the name of susan so he paused on the outside he could not catch it all but he heard the word pizen when he walked in

uncle jonah changed the conversation and said yes janie i think dat preacher was sho pizen for his hair is white as er lock er cotton and he looks ole un i do i notice one thing he kin preach better dan he use terâeverybody says it dat doctor dont seem to come outen sick er lot and susan dont sing in de choir nigh so much she seems ter be wonderin bouten sumpun

it was now just six thirty oclock but like all summer days the sun seemed to hang around the hills till almost seven jim went as usual to pay his evening visit to his fathers grave

when he was returning home to his surprise as well as joy he saw susie coming up lemon street when he met her he tipped his hat and paused to greet her and even ventured to go home with her but she drew away from him and said mr johnson you will have to pardon me if i refuse

like an old man whose feet were heavy with years he blundered or dragged his way home

he said many people say that money brings joy but with five thousand dollars in the bank and the promise of fifty thousand more it is not so my days fly like a weavers beam and my soul seems to have dry rot

the falling leaves and the dying grass painted by the grim hue of an autumn sun brought to mind the fact that school was near

a line or two from paris bore evidence of a loving mother beyond the sea but there was some unknown affinity in bowser that had eclipsed the love that he had for the one across the sea one day he received a letter bearing the stamp of an elephant it was from africa

it was just a line or two

dear jimâwe are here colonel roosevelt killed an elephant today and we shot at a lion when he returns i think i will remain and spend the rest of my days among my people in liberia the negro republic they may need me at any rate i need them president barclay is yet in the chair and since the visit of the envoy from america made up of mr emmett scott of tuskeegee and others and since they have adjusted that wouldbemilliondollar loan that was such a burden the republic is on easy street

yours as ever unoman

p sâkeep your eyes on that doctor and if you ever need me touch the cable

up to the day that jim left for school his love affairs with susie got no better he said i have ever heard that marriage was a lottery now i believe every word of it yet i love that girl she is a pearl of great price to me i would give all i possess and then work a thousand years if i lived that long if she would just consent to be my wife

early one morning the train left bowser and a lone passenger in the colored coach gazed out of an open window into the cold after the rumble over hills and valleys and the change of conductors about four times he was again in school

on that trip he found out things about himself he never once thought before he hated novels to a fault but the first thing he bought and the only book he read was the girl i left behind me he devoured it the porter went through the car whistling you big old baby doll and jim gave him a quarter to sing it over again he had hardly registered and found his room before he wrote susie a whole letter of poetry

susie read it and said what a babbler i did not know there was such a gulf between the races

she answered him but so chilly were the words she said among other things mr

johnson for years i thought i knew you and in those days no name was so sweet but i have been deceived of course it was no fault of yours but let me add that you have been to us an unknown man please dont blame me

my love for you has been warm but in a single night the white frost killed it you remember the night that rainy night as you knelt at the tomb please dont think me hardhearted but only consider me as a foreigner and write no more

an old schoolmate susie

jim took the letter and read it a dozen times and shook his head at every reading he said i would kiss a buck and dance a jig if i could guess her i would feel like a lone hottentot on the ganges if i understood her

he took out his mothers letter that unoman his fathers half brother had given him and read it again

dear son this will inform you that your mother yet lives i will be in new york on the first day in june meet me have aunt jane and uncle jonah come also then together we will all attend your graduation

your mother theresa unoman

p sâyour grandpa sends love

well said he that letter to me has been a mystery when i think for twenty years i thought that mother jane was my mother and i was an orphan but this letter beats anything i ever saw dont write any more i wonder does she think i will surrender like that this is j j unoman and i wonder does she think a unoman gives up so easily i will write her tonight

the mails of the next day bore away jims letter and every word was a flame of love

jim after being in school a few days took unomans letters the request of his father and those of his mother to the college president and had a heart to heart talk

ah said the president that often happens

but said jim how am i to change my name when i have been known as jim johnson

that is easy said the president

my name is already in the catalogue

so it is

the people know me as jim johnson

men often add a third name in school

im puzzled what to do

suppose you sign it j j unoman

thats fine professor said jim

the request of your father looks strange

said the president but i knew a frenchman once who drew multitudes and he boasted that he hadnt combed his head for thirty years

they are a little strange but like the germans they are a great people

unoman his uncle sent him a letter from liberia in march that read as follows dear jimâ i find liberia the colored mans republic a dream and a very pleasant dream and the highest realization of real progress the tribes are numerous but progressive i find that the book writers and the missionaries have always held up the dark side of the picture they paint the african as ugly and lazy but i find them very different of course they dont have to scramble for a livlihood as they do over there in america for you know everything here grows almost spontaneously say how is your little love affair i told you to marry susie but now i am sorry for i see via girls and madingoes that i would rather see you marry that any woman in all of america

never mind though if you want to marry susie go ahead say i never did tell you how i frightened that preacher of yours until his head got white and scared that doctor almost to death because they were plotting against you

i never thought once of marrying but i have the fever bad i may get me a via or a mandingo girl if i can women are mighty funny though

i met the great dr blyden since being here and i must admit that he is the greatest man that i ever saw i thought that your father theo was a wonder but this man blyden speaks forty languages all europe is wild about him i hope that some day you can meet him if it was not that you were near the finishing in your school i would get you to come and finish in the college of liberia

your uncle d e unoman

a letter was again sent to susie telling about the struggle of an unknown man with her lover the doctor and his close friend the preacher susie read it and through the crevice of her soul she saw a spark but yet the affairs of jim were not bettered thereby

jim made one hundred in his studies but with susie his marks dropped from forty to thirty and on down to ten and then to zero

his mixed blood was puzzled so after studying for days he thought to give the whole matter up as a big joke

one night while on his bed peeping through the lattice of discouragement he saw the glimmer of a spark said he susie has dropped me but i will not despair i will try as bruce didâonce more in the meantime i will write two letters at once she calls me an unknown man i will be one indeed i will write as unoman two shots at the duck from differeat angles jims letter i will not repeat but you can see what unoman wrote miss susie smith bowser ga

dear missâplease pardon my boldness but by an unknown thread of circumstances i have come to write you mr j johnson your friend who is mine also has spoken from time to time so tenderly of you and never mentions you without saying that you are the noblest woman in all the world he has made me love you and you know he and i are the only colored students here out of nine hundred or more i hope i am not proving unjust to my old chum who will finish school the same day i do but how can i refrain from saying that i love you and will marry you tomorrow if you say yes

believe me to be sincere your obedient slave j j unoman

when susie received the letter she was dumfounded she knew not what to do

she sought the advice of her mother and her mother said that the doctor was good enough for her but men were such cheats

susie got the idea cheat so she wrote a line or two then after another letter she wrote again one letter after another and each one like a june melon weekly grew longer

of course while jim wrote the spencerian j j unoman wrote the vertical

one april morning when the mails reached the students jim was busy working on his oration out of the large number of graduates he was one of the eight selected to speak the postman gave him a letter and at a glance he saw that it was from susie it had been a long time since jim had heard from her but as unoman got a line every now and then he was not so badly disturbed in mind this letter apparently woke him up however he read dear mr johnsonâ pardon my folly if you so construe it but today i am returning in a separate package all of your letters please do me the kindness to return mine or destroy them if you would inquire my motive i would simply say that i am a negro and you are white an anglosaxon irish italian or spaniard or swede i know not and care less it is enough for me to know that you are white

and no negro woman desires intermarriage of any kind legal or illegal with a white man to the women of my race such a thought is odious i know you have written that we might go to europe but believe me i would not marry a white man if he were as rich as croesus or the king of ten empires i prefer rather to marry a poor ditchdigger with a single shirt to his back in this epistle i voice the sentiment of the women of ten million of sable sons and daughters living in america

like the many other white men of your race you are my enemy and i am yours

susie smith

jim turned as red as a beet and got up and walked the floor for an hour he said to himself i am white it is an infamous lie if i thought so i am deceived i have a work to do god has especially raised me up to do

my father has endowed me with money for it

i can hardly get out of school soon enough before my paper will paint the story of a downtrodden race that will startle the world i white when ten millions of my race are ground beneath the heel of the oppressor when daily they are rushed out of the courts to the chain gang without a scintilla of evidence

i white when for twenty years i have cried my eyes red when every week the papers tell the story of a black man hanged to a tree and his body riddled with bullets of a hundred rifles lynched lynched killed murdered assassinated and under the dome of the state capitol i white when my race needs me and within one year the rattle of my press will be heard and daring head lines will cry to the nations of the world to help a righteous cause

let susie marry whom she pleases and let me live to the age of noah and fill a bachelors grave but not once nay never let me try to pass for white or try to leave my race i will write to her today and settle the matter once for all what man can better voice the sentiment of a race than a man of that race the white man may lift his voice for and in our defense but it requires a moses to feel the heart pangs of an israel the white man may weary nights pleading our cause but can sing the weird songs of the wailer bet than the one who is crushed beneath the eel of the oppressor and yet susie thinks i am white and playing the roll of an imposter

it will be settled once forever

when jim returned to school notwithstanding that he often heard from aunt jane and uncle jonah the news was limitedâalways the same we are well and hope you are the same study hard be a christian dont backslide

in the meantime the doctor was elated over his success but susie was rather slow about granting his request to become his wife so he searched the recesses of his mind to learn the reason for the delay

one day he learned through some of the other girls that susie had heard that jim was white hence you know the rest but she doubted it and before making another move she had to be satisfied on that score

in a way yet to be known he drew her out on the question and then sought to aid her in the investigation it was not long before he returned with the news that jims mother was in europe that she was married his father was a millionaire and to hide the scandal had given a hundred thousand dollars that jim would go to europe after graduating and that he would soon forget that the negro race existed

susie blinded by prejudice of color and race which is as prevalent on one side as the other among black and white believed every word of what the doctor said without a single minute of investigation her love at once passed away and hatred came into her heart ten fold she told her mother about it and her mother said she had always heard it

in the meantime the doctor pushed his claim got susie to return jim his letters and before they had gotten as far as new york he got susies mother to give a party and to publicly that night declare their engagement he wanted the date set in may but susie preferred september after a long hum and haw as uncle jonah afterwards put it they settled on july th the next day when he met the preacher he said reverend the thing is fixed susie is mine

the preacher who felt that his punishment had already been more than he could stand and who yet peeped out the side of his eyes for the unknown man to return at any moment simply bowed his head

the town began to get ready for the event and all the girls said that it was about what they expected said they jim may be white but i cant believe that ghost story he is too kind to be anything but colored the news managed to stay out of reach of uncle jonah and aunt jane and thus one thought doctor jones congratulated himself on that doctor jones never sleeps

jims letter and his anxiety

for a day after jim received the letter of susies and the return of all his correspondence with her he was like a young lion just caged he walked the floor of his room he pushed his hands into his pockets he would blow and so absorbed in this affair was he that he could hardly do anything but think of bowser georgia on the third day after he received it he managed to compose his mind so he wrote as follows boston mass april th

miss susie smith bowser ga

your very interesting letter received and i need not tell you how interested i was to learn the facts related to me about by nativity and blood dear susie it was not just yesterday when we first met but i have known you for years we rambled the hills and played the creeks together and many years ago in a play together we were crowned king and queen now in all these years dear susie consult your memory and see if you have ever known me to be false or my actions to belie my words you say i am white and that it is odoius to think of a colored woman marrying such a man for that statement alone you have endeared yourself ten fold to me susie believe me to be not any other than a poor sable son of africa it is true that i am a mixed blood of french and spanish ancestry if you dont know it you must know it that it matters not if it is negro how little of it touches any other blood it turns it immediately to negro

now if you doubt that i am a negro i can prove my racial identity beyond the shadow of a doubt susie providence is so gracious and so good praise his name if five years if two years ago if eight months ago i had been called upon for this proof i would have been unable to produce the facts but now i am fully able to meet my pursuers and destroy my enemies if i wanted to pass for white my hair my color and my brogue favor it but pray tell me what would i gain if i have ever tried to take the advantage of my color for any special privilege or under any circumstances i dont know it now susie i love you but if you do deny me this highest of my souls crave deny me not at least one privilege to establish the truth and to make my enemies false believe me to speak from my heart

sincerely yours jim

p sâremember me to mother jane and uncle jonah

when susie received jims letter she was entertaining a few of her girl friends one of the girls took the letter from the postman and saw boston mass on the stamp mark so she shouted from jim i bet you a penny

susies engagement was generally known and the reason for her break with jim therefore the girls were not at all surprised to see susie toss it out the window without opening it one of the girls said susie you say he is white but i dont believe a word of it white people act differently from jim i dont believe it

i believe that is a frameup to reach certain ends so if you dont mind it i am going to read the letter and if you dont care i am going to answer jim myself for you

susie consented and the letter was read as line after line was read susie became more and more interested and finally she was so interested in the argument that jim made that she decided to write and apologize the girls were so pleased at the turn that they shouted bravo susie bravo thats right use common sense suspend judgment and if he can prove his racial identity give him a chance

the advice of the girls had its effect on susie and she decided to write and give jim a chance her letter went through due course of mail jim received it his mind was greatly relieved and he answered her immediately stating that he would fix the date when all proof would be established susie began to again act chilly towards the doctor who daily pressed his claims her mother felt alarmed over it and said that she could not understand her own child occasionally susie sought out aunt jane and uncle jonah but never thought once to discuss with them this allabsorbing question

the preacher went to the conference and was returned the summer was now almost on and bowser put on a flowery dress uncle jonah occasionally reminded aunt jane that the time of the marriage was close at hand

aunt jane seemed to feel like deferring it so she finally got him to agree to put it off until jim graduated and settle down which would not be earlier than august or september

one day in may as uncle jonah was calling on aunt jane aunt jane startled him by saying jonah what you reckon i jist got a letter from jim wid a hundred dollars and two tickets

what dat now said uncle jonah

wy dat boy wants us to go to new york

what you gwine do dar

i dont know

wy you will git lost in new york fo you git two blocks said uncle jonah i heard ole master in slave times talk bouten how he went dar and de men picked his pockets

yes jonah ise been aprayin over dat ting i jist dunno how we gonna work it

did jim say he would meet us said uncle jonah

yes said aunt jane he sez he would meet us at de train

well oman what you fraid of i wuz powerful fraid at fust but since he will meet us we can jist pend on sich a boy like jim

the day arrived and all the town of bowser seemed to have been at the station to bid aunt jane and uncle jonah goodbye several said tell jim that we still love him and to come as soon as he can

yas said aunt jane he sez he wants to go to canidy and around a little after he graduate but ise nealy scared to death that this train will jump off de track

 taint gwine jump no whar said uncle jonah and laughed ha ha ise ride on a train second year after freedom dared and we killed a cow but nobody was hurtin

the doctor was down but the parting seemed a litle too much for susie she assisted aunt jane in getting ready and even cooked some nice things and sent to the train but to go down to the train notwithstanding that the doctor had begged her to go she refused in her room however one upon careful examination might have discovered a tear drop the train departed and out of the windows gazed uncle jonah and aunt jane every time the train blew loud or passed through a tunnel uncle jonah would draw up and remark janie dont git scared taint gwine hurt you

one day about six oclock the train pulled into the pennsylvania depot in new york

jim was there to receive uncle jonah and aunt jane uncle jonah said to jim boy why you have so much police here looks like dars a dozen in de station

uncle jonah remarked jim there were only three police in the station those other fellows you saw were porters a cab soon hurried them over to their rooms and about three oclock they were at the boat landing

janie you know said jonah pears like to me that a body ud git hurt here say sonny how you reckon dey ever git de mortar up dar to build dat house ha ha dis is sho new york

aunt jane whispered jonah you make too much noise you are jist like a rabbit or a parrot

now janie i bet de mayor of dis town dunno what possum huntin is

standing on the pier at new york in a single hour one can count over five hundred ferry boats row boats yachts steamers schooners napthas and ships pass

the hudson seemed one big ant nest that is worked up with living monsters that ply the deep turning from the river view that seems one big mirror portraying a city beneath its banks one is impressed with the babble of all nations and kindred who have brought their language dress and customs from egypt turkey and italy china ireland and other countries beyong the creek and dumped them down into new york

there are more colored people on rd st in new york than the population of some whole cities down south for one to stand on broadway they can see one multitude of humanity that jostle crowd and press together forming a line over three miles long all of this was so interesting to uncle jonah

as the crowd thronged the pier the ships heaved in sight at ellis island the baggage was carefully inspected now the passengers were eyeing new york city everybody waving jims eyes were bulging to see her finally a red parasol was seen jime waved the bandana it was answered the woman leaning on the arm of a man about sixtytwo years old with a red parasol in her left hand came down the gangplank jim met them no pen can paint the meeting of a mother and son on such an occasion she said jim you look so much like theo got his eyes father you notice he even walks like him this is uncle jonah and aunt jane that i am so much indebted to

have you married yet i am so glad to see you say jim where is she

who mother

your wife

i cant imagine

after a few passing hours in new york the train hurried them over to boston the day rolled around for the close of school jim issued invitations to a few friends and among them one went to susie the different friends at bowser sent little tokens of respect but to jims surprise he received no reply at all from susie jim in his oration made a great impression just as we expected

in a few days they were off on a trip for buffalo and then to niagara and montreal

their plan was to go to bowser about august st and launch his paper susie had refused as he understood to answer his letter granting the day for him to establish his proof therefore he had given it all up and decided to let things drift aunt jane and uncle jonah felt anxious to return to bowser consequently all scenery and beauty of canada and the united states became uninteresting jim to please the old people after consulting his mother bought their tickets and sent them home

one day while sitting in a park in front of the public library in chicago jim said mother i have a bit of news for you the mother of course was glad to hear her son at any time so she said jimmie i am all attention say on

jim tried to relate it but found himself unable to talk finding himself not able to say what he wanted he fished the letter from his pocket that had informed him so much about himself and future plans as she took the letter and read it all her french and spanish blood mixed with hot african blood boiled

she said jimmie its an enemy but i can vindicate you as far back as i know my people are creoles and your grandfather will tell you that while he is a bright creole yet his wife and your fathers mother was as dark as aunt jane

mother is that so

yes every word of it

can we prove it

prove it why we have never posed as anything but negroes

indeed

yes creoles have never tried to be anything else of course we live in france and france has never had color phobia she respects her subjects regardless of complexion

why one of her greatest writers was a negro but we only knew him as dumas we think not of your foolishness over there we are too busy for it paris as you may know is the hub of the world everything moves around it and all fashion depends upon it there are thousands of negro soldiers there right from the heart of africa

what are we to do said jim

what day is this asked his mother

june th said jim

well call that automobile and make the telegraph office at once

what are we going to do mother

we are going to cable dimmey in liberia to make it direct to bowser said his mother can he make it

direct it to the secretary of state and also send one in care of prof blyden they will find him and he will come unless a mishap

while the cables were being delivered to liberia bowser was all astir over the wedding that was soon to take place susie called on uncle jonah and also on aunt jane but said she regretted so much that she had not heard from jim and specially as he had requested her to let him do a certain thing which no doubt would be worth much to the community and especially to jim aunt jane told of her trip and said that she was positive that jim had sent an invitation to susie and to be certain she would ask uncle jonah about it

uncle jonah told susie of how he had seen jim write several letters to her how he had mailed jims invitation with his own hands

all this seemed strange to susie as to the correspondence between them and especially when jim and susie were looking to hear from each other in reply to certain questions

mrs theresa unoman cabled to her brotherinlaw requesting him to come at once in just a few minutes it had reached monrovia liberia and both the secretary of state and dr edward w blyden sent messengers out in search of d e unoman it so happened that for five days unoman had been up in the hinterland he had just made a visit to kiatippoo a noble old african king who had been reigning for years from there he was pushing his way out among the mandingoes studying their method of smelting gold and silver

the kroo set out for him and using the wireless telephone to reach him from tribe to tribe it sounded until finally he was located

then they sounded the message back in twenty hours not stopping night or day a change of kroos had borne him in a hammock to monrovia

it so happened that the steamship orion of the werner line one of the fastest greyhounds of the deep was bound for gremany

the cable stated that we must try to make bowser not later than august ist

unoman in the quickest manner possible hurried on to the college of west africa to bid the president goodbye and also to liberia college where he shook hands with dr

blyden and in a little while had taken his berth and the ship set off for europe

is there not after all a something that binds men together by a kindred feeling you think of a friend and notwithstanding you have not seen him for days and he appears

when jim got all worked up over his letter and the meeting of susie to establish his identity while they were sending the telegram across the waters at that very moment uncle jonah was given a wedding invitation of susie and doctor jones by the girl in pink that we previously read about who played such a role at the party she surmised by the trifle of news that jim was kept in the dark and that the doctor had thumbed his cards and loaded his dice she therefore secured an invitation at the earliest moment and hurried it to uncle jonah ready stamped secured the address of jim and mailed it immediately

when jim received it he had already received the cable from dr blyden stating that unoman was now on the high seas and in a day or two would be in madeira if he wanted to wire him he might reach him at canary islands as the ship made but two stops before reaching south hampton

jim received the letter with the invitation in it and these few words from uncle jonah come at once if you kin cose you are needed sorter bad janie is well she sez we kin marry in september susie sez she has not hearn a scratch from you in i dunno when

she has sent you several letters

the wedding invitation was printed on linen paper with a miniature picture of dr jones and susie on the opposite corners at the top with the wording below setting forth the hour and day july th

ah said jim susie hasnt heard from me nor i from her and have been writing all the time and she is now to be married yet i have heard nothing i see the whole plot

where does that doctor intend to stop i will leave tonight for bowser

his mother was told his intention and assented at once but his grandfather disagreed with the plan he suggested that they would cable unoman to cross from the canary islands by new york and by all possible haste try to be at bowser by the th of july

in the meantime he said i know the old doctor that attended your father and mother

he was present at your fathers burial he is now at tampa i saw his name today in the locals of the tampa daily times published in that city it has been twentyfive years since we met but he sent me a very sympathetic letter on the death of my son and especially so when we consider that he is a white man and we are colored and the prejudice of the race that exists

grandpa do you think that he will come

asked jim

if hes well enough

well we will have him by all means

said jims mother

when susies mother saw that susie was about to toss doctor jones overboard again she called the doctor into question to ascertain what night be done

the doctor couldnt decide at once but said he we will think it over and see can we find a way out

the mother said susie why do you act so foolish doctor jones is an able man why not marry him there is no need to fret about jim have you not heard what the doctor said he found out

susie mother i cant love that doctor i am going to give jim a chance if he can prove his racial identity i would rather marry him though he had both legs cut off and no arms than to marry that great hypocrite of a doctor

the mother shook her head but said nothing

the next day when she and the doctor met he walked up smiling i have it said he you know susie as a rule always mails her letters at that box opposite your house well i have arranged with the mail carrier and he has promised to always forget to take out any mail addressed to jim until after the wedding or thereabouts what do you think of the scheme

fine said susies mother you have such an able brain susie is a fool or any other girl who would refuse the hand of a man like you say but how about his letters coming to susie

we can fix that said the doctor inform the mail man that you and susie are out so much that to send your mail to number  lemon street instead of duval avenue of course you know that is where i board i will do the rest have no more fear i will cut the wire and that will stop the current i think we have it now

ah you are so noble remarked susies mother i wish i could call back ten years

the reader can surmise now why jim never received any more mail from susie and why susie failed to get his graduating invitation and other letters

doctor jones not only led the town of bowser in society but kept posted on all lines he allayed the fear of the preacher by informing him on good authority that the unknown man was in africa and was there to stay he

said the doctor has pilfered us out of our cash old beat he is a fake but i have achieved my victory without him

as the days rolled by all preparations were made for the wedding the doctor wanted a house wedding but susie preferred a simple church wedding with as little red tape as possible

she selected her dress and her bridemaids and flower girls who busied themselves getting their dresses made

the doctor ordered a long black suit from sears roebuck  co of chicago and even the preacher had to get him a new suit

the day arrived july th the wedding was to take place at night the night before susie had cried most of the night and once hit on the plan of running away to keep from marrying the doctor

buwser was one of those peculiarly located towns as is found in many of the states the postoffice was bowser georgia but the town straddled the line of georgia and south carolina the church by location was in south carolina susie lived over the line and was in south carolina while the doctor living but two blocks away lived in georgia in that particular town those who lived in georgia had to secure a license to marry those who lived over the line might have the preacher or notary marry them and then write the license afterward

the doctor trusted no mistakes so he secured his papers for the marriage elder slackam was selected to tie the knot the day was beautiful it was a typical july day the atmosphere was clear and sultry and flowers perfumed everywhere every laudau buggy automobile and carriage was employed for the occasion the trains coming in at seventhirty brought crowds from neighboring towns for doctor jones was marrying the belle of the town and besides he was well known and had issued one thousand invitations said he i want to show the folks at bowser what society is and the way we do at my home

some of the people said that old doctor is as proud as a peacock he is a humbug i hate to think about him

at  oclock that night people were crowded all about the church windows and when the train arrived the crowd was greatly increased the marriage was fixed at  p m

at  p m among the many automobiles that rolled up a big red winston six stood among the trees the big electric lights seemed very attractive a large number of people filled every available space in the church except the aisles which under the new law for public buildings had to be kept open two seats in the main building had been arranged for whites these were separated with a cord of white ribbon that showed to what extent the jim crow law of the south was being carried

as the preacher reached the side door the music started his white hair against his smooth oiled skin and black broadcloth made him look like some old rich philosopher his step was steady his appearance saintly he held a little black book that contained a golden streamer a foot long that separated between the leaves of the ceremony he walked to the altar

the flower girls came in all arrayed in white and as the flowers dropped from their hands they looked like one big lily shedding its leaves

the next was a little tot dressed like cupid carrying a bow and arrow a gold ring hung on the spear thereof and its glitter was only eclipsed by the two golden wings of cupid that stood out about two feet as though every minute he was fixing to fly

the groom came in the side door that opened for the preacher his dress was faultless

one woman remarked it fits him like the paper on the wall another said he looks like a duke still another said he looks more like a coachman

the bridesmaid entered then the best man came down the aisle with susie leaning on his arm

under a big rainbow decorated with flowers and ferns and lighted with little electric bulbs of different colors so finished with paper of a different shade that when it was lighted it presented the variegated colors of a thousand hues

the bride and groom stood under the rainbow just as the bride passed in the crowd pushed in behind a tall old white man wearing glasses about seventy years old walking by the side of a corpulent man cleanly shaven and about sixty years old came in behind them a young white fellow with long red mustache and whose hair was red and much resembled in cut the pictures that we sometimes see of shakespeare entered a little white woman wearing a long veil and who possibly would not weigh more than a hundred pounds

she was leaning on the arm of the young man

like the bride and groom their attire was faultless they took the seats reserved for whites with the jim crow ribbon decoration thereon

uncle jonah and aunt jane getting in late were puzzled to find a seat the sexton seeing one of these reserved seats yet unoccupied led the grand old couple up and gave it to them and did in church what those in authority often do in railroad cars and stationsâviolated the law

over in the corner a big dark fellow with two other men carrying extra large bouquets of jessamine vines and roses had found seats as the wedding progressed it was the all absorbing one thing the people heard nor saw nothing else

when the minister reached that passage has any one any objection that these two people ought not to be joined together if so let him now speak or else forever hereafter hold his peace

a voice from three different parts of the house cried i object the sound was thunderous

the minister stopped reading the people looked around and so excited seemed the audience that it looked like a dozen people objecting at the same time

the bride caught the voice she knew of one and raised her veil and with her piercing eyes was searching the house the groom had turned and was looking in every direction as were also all the actors

one of the persons who objected was the judge who issued the license he was in the gallery he walked down the aisle and as he approached the altar he said dont be alarmed i simply came as a witness and as this is the place under the law that it will be of value i come at this opportune time

uncle jonah hearing so many objections walked out and as he approached the altar he said my jection is dat you doctor jones force a gal to marry you by triving to keep her letters from reaching de man she loves and in doin root work you stand me

doctor jones said i dont know what you are talking about old man this girl has never desired to marry any man in the world but me what letters

the judge said i cant well be a witness and judge both so i will ask the entire audience to judge these statements and the minister might be the jury and if he thinks that the objections are not reasonable he can continue with the ceremony

another minister who was sitting in the pulpit said thats fair let us have it quiet

 the old fat man who was none other than jims grandfather walked out and at the same time said i understand that jim was to marry this lady and that a certain minister and doctor circulated the news that jim was white and that they prejudiced the mind of the girl against the young man and stole her heart i am the grandfather of jim and while i am bright i am not white i am only a creole

my wife was black i had two sons theo who was very fair and dimmy who took after his mother and was very dark i am a french general and my son theo was more particularly known as captain theo unoman he died in this town twentyone years ago

the preacher trembled the doctor in a cool and deliberate voice said general where is your proof

the old man turned around and said doctor blair

the old man on the front seat walked out

do you know me

i do said doctor blair

give the facts

doctor blair before i begin i want all the folks who are here that remember me when i was in business in this town to stand

a dozen or more stood

all right i am known i will say i attended captain unoman and wife was present at his death and was also present when jim was born i heard the fathers will and saw dimmy leave with the child saw him many times afterward and inquired after the family

judge do you remember

the judge stepped forward and said i do

i executed the will i know jim we all know that he is a negro and one of which we are proud and if he keeps on the world will be proud of him for such men like him are unknown

then susies mother walked out and shook her head well said she what all this got to do wid de weddin

as the different witnesses testified susies face sparkled with joy and tears ran down her cheek the minister stood there like a monument

a rustle was heard in the amen corner of the church and a big chunky dark fellow with a red bandana about his neck and with a jug in each hand walked out making his way to the altar it was the unknown man as he approached the altar the doctor felt for his hip pocket but susie caught the hand the doctor grew ashy and fell back on the altar the preacher caught the eye of the man saw the jugs and red bandana about his neck he dropped his book threw his hands to his head and fell to the floor by that time a little mulatto woman whom some thought was white said i am jims mother he is not white

then the young white man pushed from his seat and as he did so the white separation ribbon broke he pulled the red mustache from his lip and the shakespeare wig from his head and tossed them to the floor and at the same time saying i am jim doctor jones do you know me i am not white nor gone to europeâstill with my race

susie saw him she leaped to jim and threw her arms about his neck and shouted oh jim are you here do my eyes behold you you look like king solomon i love you i adore you â then her words were only tears every drop of which said love

love love

jim had his arms about her the mother of susie fell in the doctors arms and uncle jonah threw his arms around aunt jane the girl in pink ran over to where the preacher was picked up his book and as she did so she said it was no fault of yours the preacher stood up and she put her arms about his neck

the judge winked as he looked at doctor blair and said it looks like four couples

then uncle jonah said marry us all judge

that night jim proved his racial identity took for his wife susie his love and four couples were married at bowser and instead of the preacher officiating the judge performed the ceremony
