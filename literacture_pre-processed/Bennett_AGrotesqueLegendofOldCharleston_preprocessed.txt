madame margot 

in an age so glorious so rich and fine and so bestarred with splendor that one almost forgets the bottomless abyss into which it plunged at last there lived a woman in charleston of whom a very odd story is told

the languid lovely tired old town was then a city brave and gay with mediterranean manners and caribbean ways

the perfume of ten thousand flowers drifted upon the winds which came and went over a thousand gardens ebbing and flowing like the tide

clouds of snowy gold and roses rolled across the sky like the vast rotundas of a city builded of colored ivory slowly rising overhead in windy and ethereal masses they stood carvings of pale porphyry upon a turquoise wall the earth was transfigured with beauty

it was a golden age when all things were fair nothing had grown old even the tragic and the terrible were comely then wonder lay on everything merely to exist was to be happy it was a world of unextinguished youth life was brimful to the lips with delight

in the gardens rare flowers bloomed and rare fruits ripenedâpomegranates oranges medlars figs jujubes and the purple indian peach and among the flowers like winged flames small and bright sped the harlequins the painted nonpareils delicately beating the soft wind with their pied wings while in the pomegranatetree among the dull bronze fruit the mockingbird sang his love and rapture through the greenhedged close women beautiful and stately paced the shade with men beside them slender and straight passionate and haughty with fierce bright eyes as ardent as the goshawks and as bold and lovely girls with dark hair and skins of alabaster as graceful and as timid as fawns and with fawns eyes slipped among the green leaves like flowers alive

those were charmed days indeed the town has changed since then the world seems to have grown weary and gray and the hearts of men bitter the young were younger then the old not so sorry for everything as they have been since then somehow it seemed to be always summer morning moming before the sun had burned the world to a dun crisp with his meridian heat scorching bitter and blinding bright before the advent of gasping afternoon with its languid leafage and evaporated sap the calendar seemed to have paused among the daffodils between the jessamine and the june in that paradise of the year the delicate and virginal camellia bloomed then untarnished by rough wind or rain its petals were sweet which since then have grown so bitter the elmtrees did not then bloom thrice for one green coat and no one ever paused to think that no good and lovely thing exists on earth without its corresponding shadow

the world was full of the sound of sweet flutelike voices of young women calling after their lovers and the singing of small birds made slender pleasant melodies among the cool myrtles life was simpler perhaps more childlike though more passionate two who loved each other might walk together hand in hand along the path singing their happiness without reproach save perchance from some lugubrious graybearded presbyter mourning among mossy tombstones lifes evanescence

and happy youth was without a fault unless it were a trivial one some peche mignon a guileless guiltless girlish sin like kissing oneself in the lookingglass for lack of another lover

in all the town there were none so pretty none so graceful or so sweet as the golden girls of san domingo they flowed along the windy streets their turbans nodding like a stream of tulips they fluttered down the byways in their white muslin dresses like bevies of butterflies the loveliness of their slender bodies and the beauty of their youthful faces were far beyond all dull description they were a bed of tigerlilies in the sun the earth loved the tread of their flying feet which seemed to be forever dancing pastourelles and the narrow lanes of the city laughed with the lilt of their creole tongue

among the golden san domingans the loveliest of all admittedly was marguerite lagoux the milliner by her patronage called rita by her familiars margoton by envious rivalry madame margot and after all was over and done known merely as old mother gogo

hers was glorious physical loveliness in its fullest maturity it was in an hour of inspiration the indolent god of beauty drew the lines on which her body was built

her passionate richcolored handsome face was like a line from an old enchantment which took mens souls captive then cast them away without the least regret or with a circean spell turned them into beasts her neck was a deepcolored ivory tower poised perfectly over her breast the dazzling orangetawny skin of her broad bust turned to goldenrusset before it reached her cheeks and was there flushed to dusky rose like the skin of a ruddygold peach in the burnt splendor of her cheek the darkly eloquent blood in her veins made its golden proclamation her mouth was long and strangely curved like a retroverted bow the lips of a queer fruitcolor not crimson carmine nor magenta but a little of all three the upper lip was brief to a fault and curled back on itself like a richpulped fruit which has parted in ripening the full underlip cast a heavier shade than the lips the old masters chose when they painted a picture of the madonna her hair like a dark uncertain cloud fell down in heavy coils gathered and knotted at the nape of the neck bound there in a golden net or lay in an unfilleted band across the broad low brow drawn back into braids over her ears or collected into a turban tied with peculiar dexterity her body was cast in a glorious mould she was tall in figure perfect and full of a stately tigerlike grace the envy of other women she moved when she walked as an empress might if heaven but gave her grace with an exquisite perfect motion devoid of every appearance of effortânot striding but seeming to glide like a swan swimming on untroubled water in the sluggish grace of her heavy lips and deeplidded brooding eyes she was as full of an indolent sleepy beauty as midsummer afternoon dressed in bright merino crimson orange and blue with a kerchief of bloodcolored silk around her head bound in oriental fashion beads of amber around her neck and in each ear a hoop of gold she looked like a great golden lily dusted with sangdieu

one day she was the lily the next a yellow rose and the next she was a tulipâgold crimson purple and black she was a caribbean summer incarnate of flowerblooms thunder and gold the passing traveler seeing her stopped while he caught his breath there was something about her commanded attention besides her remarkable beauty one spoke of ducie poincignon casually but one spoke of rita lagoux with an accent

of all the milliners of her day margot was first beyond compare her taste was perfect her instinct for color was never at fault her choice of fabrics exquisite none equaled her in dexterity she was like a marvelous spider weaving webs of gossamer those who sought beauty found it her patrons were patrician all of the very best employed her art she had no successful competitor beside her eloise couesnon was esteemed but maladroit

margots shop was in king street near migpots garden a little above the bend she lived in a little alley known as lilac lane a narrow crooked private path between two large estates which rambled into the interspace like a brown brook into a wood beneath high green hedges it wandered into the solitude growing narrower as it went until the hedge boughs meeting knit themselves together interlacing their elastic leafy twigs there the baffled footpath seemed to lose its way and to abandon every purpose for which footpaths are designed ran on a little hesitated crept on again uncertainly then gave up hope and disappeared in a green perplexity the unfamiliar traveler paused here bewildered and turned back to find a bolder thoroughfare familiar feet alone pressed on through lilac lane

where the strait way vanished into the wilderness stood margots cottage tucked snug as a plum stone in a plum around it was a garden hedged by box and bay of all the hedges in lilac lane the highest were margots they rose around her garden in an impenetrable thicket tall darktangled dense and old their green tops tossing against the blue beyond the reach of the hedgers bill within lay a little tranquil space withdrawn alike from curious gaze and the towns brawl and overshadowed by the wide boughs of two great magnolias whose drowsy shade fell heavily on the sleepy oleanders and over the rows of tulips below that lifted up their golden cups and filled the air with odor here day and night flowed by in undisturbed serenity all noise was hushed and tumult quelled the shyest wild birds nested here in perfect confidence fear cast away and foes forgot no place in all the town seemed more secure from rude intrusion no apparition came by night no terror by day so quiet it was so full of peace it seemed a sanctuary withdrawn from the interrupting clash and rude alarms of the troubled worldâits tranquillity that of a convent close with little distant ringing bells recurrent chimes and subdued voices muffled by distance as of nuns chanting an office in the peaceful choir of a greennooked nunnery

margot lagoux had a daughter her name was gabrielle

though margot was lovely gabrielle was lovelier they differed in beauty as pompadourpink differs from brierrose margots was a golden beauty gabrielles an ivory loveliness margot was a pottery figurine moulded with marvelous skill gabrielle a statuette of exquisite porcelain margot was like the summer sun dazzling opulent sumptuous gabrielle like the young spring moon in her slender loveliness the lines of her flowed one into the other like the lines of a song her hands were delicate and fine their touch as light as flowers blown by the wind which drift like a whisper across the face of the passerby her feet were arched like a spanish girls her ankles were the loveliest things that ever sandalribbon bound she walked like the wind of an april morning through meadows after rain

her face with its delicate high cheekbones was like the fair flower of normandy but her beauty was not western twas eastern it was like the pale persian roses which blow by the graymarbled waterways among the fallen pillars of the forgotten gardens of istakhrâroses of yesterday full of yesterdays unbearable loveliness yesterdays happiness yesterdays tragedy âfragrant with passionate heartbreaking perfume piercingly sweet with the pathos of swiftpassing beauty far keener than that of ruins and age she was of a loveliness such as sometimes comes out of india unburned by the indian sun of which dreamers make dreams of unforgettable beauty

her slender young body was like a piece of perfect ivory laid away to be carved her long dark tangled eyelashes fell upon her cheeks like sudden gusts of darkening rain her cheeks were japonicacolor her lips pale pomegranatered her hair ebony her temples were traced with crocusblue

her cheeks japonicacolor they were the hue of peach flowers at dusk god who gave them knew whence came both peach flower color and dusk

at every breath there came and went beneath her transparent skin a shadowy crimson underdusk ebbing and flowing with the beat of her heart like a somber twilit tideâsan domingos sang de crepuscule and through her fingers the sunlight shone with a golden radiance like the glow of a rose through a glass of madeira

she might have been sister to scheherazade in her exquisite aquiline highborn loveliness a patrician beauty strangely like that of old french romance far and away beyond compare she was the loveliest girl in st finbars parish and the faces of the young girls in st finbars made that ancient dim gray parish bloom like the gardens of paradise

god who knows everything knows whence she had her exquisite slender body her aristocratic face the dusky crimson tide the touch of fantasy which made her lovely as a strain of wild passionate music played on the deep strings of a gipsy violin

for as the rarest beauty remains imperfect without a touch of strangeness without something to haunt and to fret the mind forbidding it to forget there was a something almost if not quite fantastic in gabrielles lovelinessâa touch of irregularity difficult to defineâ making her beauty more significant through being peculiar more poignant through being strange something indefinite and conjectural tinged her being the ghost of a vaguely intricate and tragical implication beneath her bright young innocence lurked shadowy and malign had her beauty been less perfect this perhaps had been less notable revealed in a casual attitude for a moment startling in vividness now for a moment it was lost and now stole forth again in the stress of unstudied emotion to accent a passing mood

as one who looking into her mirror sees a face there not her own margot perceived in her daughters face an intricately blended likeness to banish which into forgetfulness she strove desperately in vainâthe recollection of a wild sweet irrevocable hour whose memory was fear gabrielles beauty made her tremble

it is a perilous privilege for a girl to possess loveliness rising above her station in life there is a price always to be paid for it sorrow the common fee such a heritage of beauty often proves but a legacy of shameâa beauty built for destruction a loveliness for scorn haggard wisdom reaps in tears what innocence sowed with laughter

there was a thought from which margot shrank as from a draught of poison gabrielle degraded and desolate there was nothing to her more precious than her daughters innocence nothing so important as her earthly happiness these seemed to margot even more necessary than her eternal peace

yet ever a shadow hung over her child from cradle to grave her delicate grace and refinement were signatures of dread margots eyes hunted from side to side as do a deers hard pressed by the dogsâcan one elude destiny

where were the lovely and the fair she had known in her own youth dead long ago the graveyard sand lay cold upon their lips their passion and their sweetness were forgotten long ago margot knew that youth and summer night are made for ecstasy she knew too that in forgotten graveyards are many unmarked graves of hapless beauty looking into the mirror where life is stripped of its illusions and truth stands stark and bare in its unmitigated ugliness panic terror seized margot

was there no refuge no escape nor safety anywhere no retreat nor harbor but in hopeless longing always the faroff lightning and threatening of storm peering into the future she was filled with apprehension in dreams she saw gabrielles innocence hanging over a black abyss in dreams saw a fawn torn by ravening wolves she awoke starting up crying out there was nothing but the night yet she arose from her bed and crouched by her crucifix prayed for her daughter as she never had prayed for herself

at adolescence gabrielle was a vision of delight in temperament she was ardent as is a summer shower which gives when it gives all that it has to give in a rush of wind and rain unspoiled by knowledge unruined by folly too innocent to be perplexed by lifes anxieties her soul mistook earth for the pathway to paradise and nothing as yet had discovered her error

with her each hour began afresh the tale of life a long sweet glad surprise

rosewinged days and golden nights were come to gabrielle whose feet stood at the smiling gate of the primrose way but margots days and nights were filled with passionate anxiety as with increasing doubts and fears she confronted destiny

the inner housedoor gave upon a little paved court where two twisted old figtrees grew manybranched candelabra tipped in spring with greenleaved lights greenleaved shadows wavered below on a duckpools marble bowl stained green from the copper tenons which tied its stones together here ducks praised jove with yellow bills and splashed viridian wings in the pool glimmering one saw the stuccoed cottagewall on the irregular surface of which old colors showed in broken chequers through the new until the wall was patched with unpremeditated beauty across the pool the silvery sunlight glimmered like a streak of flame but the fairest thing reflected there was gabrielle dancing on the old stones which paved the courtâdances fantastic as her mood sarabands to the stately rhythm of odd old songs deliberately slow canzons whose pathos was lost in a pirouette minuets which mimicked the swallows overhead with their swift glissades among the trees and undulating sweeps among the flowersâ snatching the poppies as she passed and thrusting them in her hair and pausing at last like a windblown flower above her reflection in the poolâgabrielle singing old songs by the world forgottenâstrains of wild beauty that by wayward loveliness have a peculiar power to please with old melodies alluring and sweet songs such as long ago stole the souls of saints determined upon salvation and gave themes for many troubadour lays of which though all are lovely the greater part are sad being memories of loveliness departed into the dust one of lifes paradoxes that the memory of beauty should be bitter

here remote from the curious world preserved by the cloistral hedges from prying indiscretion flowed her secluded existence few ever saw her such as by chance observed her through some green interstice dazzled by her beauty hurried off to spread the tale of an enchanted princess in an enchanted wood hedgebalked and bewildered few had ever seen her twice by which she had been the more thought of through being the less seen

many had sought the courtyard but none had found the way margot kept it a solitude lest gabrielle suffer corruption and around her maintained a veritable nunnery of care hovered over her and kept her as close withdrawn as a novice in a conventgarth

but beauty cannot be sequestered always safely anywhere cloistral life is very well for souls of cloistral nature and of the convent sort but youth and spring hate convents and will have lifes novitiate or none there is a crevice in every hedge no matter how tall or how thick it may be and through it ever gabrielle peeps

spring followed winter mays warm slow yellow moonlit nights were come

then gabrielle grew tired and white her hand became tremulous her light foot stumbled she left off dancing in the garden she sighed wistfully her song ceased her mouth showed scarcely a smiles wasted ghost her eyes like those of a wounded creature followed everywhere her tears flowed at nothing she grew as languid as a withering flower the light of her seemed going out the pallor of her face and the feverish luster of her eyes startled and frightened margot

hays dragged a laggard length night still more oppressed her she lay awake whispering with dry lips she knew not what calling she knew not whom her trembling hands pressed against her breast fancies for which she found no name thoughts for which she had no words and visions inexpressible would not let her sleep night after night she lay awake consuming the hours with wonder or if she slept awoke in tears fell asleep to tears again and waking tearwet trembling with darkened lids and drawn face grew daily worse

vague moody wants annoyed her the night was harassed by melancholy dreams the day vexed with formless fancies

walking alone in the garden answerless questionings beset and frightened her she listened where there was nothing to be heard stared where there was nothing to be seen found peace nowhere

her heart ached with unreasoning pain she grew as gusty as a storm the speechless inexplicable wonder within her breast throbbed like a festered thorn

margot too well knew the cause there was but one alleviation

spring with its universal song from grove and garden lifted up its deathless melody of bloomy verdure and warmbreathed sweetness all living creatures voiced the universal theme rejoice with the partner of thine heart in the happy days of thy youth

the blue dove moaned out his hearts desire the copper beetle wooed and won his lady in the dust butterflies and dragonflies glittered in the wind happy in their airy ecstasyâthey fluttered among the hedges they sported among the flowersâand all the earth rejoiced in having its hearts desire thrush and mocker sang passion passion    heartbreaking passion to their pretty feathered paramours from every spray the vireo cried shrill in shreds of melody hearts desire hearts der sire in the fragrant greenbay the painted buntings lovecall rang incessantly while from the tufted grove arose the stirring chant of earths universal choir the canticle all passionate and shrill of love love love and yet again of love

how can one keep it from the heart of youth that all unknowing yet numb with longing breathlessly awaits its coming and trembles like a leaf with the wordless yearning of unrecognized desire

gabrielle was intoxicated with the passion of her own heart without an object or an aim her throat was almost choked with youths sweet innocent desire and ever within her shaking heart the questioning wonder grew

mother she said wistfully what is it fills the world with music day and night what is it makes the whole world sing

happiness replied margot and joy of the spring

happiness rejoined gabrielle if it be happiness why does it make my heart ache why does spring hurt me so

margot startled sat staring wrung with sudden fear

and what is this love of which every one singsâwe women most of all

the source of all wretchedness leave it alone cried margot she looked at her daughter in terror

but replied gabrielle wondering if love be the source of all wretchedness why is its song so sweet

because fools have their folly cried margot lovesongs are sweet to a lover as folly is dear to a fool worship thy god she said harshly and leave foolishness to the fool

loveâfoolishness said gabrielle puzzled you told me that god is love she turned the riddle over and over in her mind

what ails you asked margot

nothing said gabrielle but a flush stole up her cheeks how does a woman know mother that she loves so that she may say certainly this is love

by the utter despair that tears her heart in two

but mother protested gabrielle they tell me that love is sweet

sweet as wormwood said margot hoarsely it is nothing but fever and fret

many i see who have it but none who fret might i not know for myself a little of this pretty play of lovers and beloved besought gabrielle

margot looked at gabrielle and trembled seeing the shadow upon her foreseeing the fate of her loveliness perceiving indiscretions lips at the rim of the cup of terror what man has snared your silly heart she asked

gabrielle stared at her why should any man snare my heart she asked in pitiful wonder i have never harmed any man nor any living thing she caught her breath oh mother feel my heart beating it beats as if it would burst why does my heart beat so am i dying do you think that i must die yet mother my heart is aching so that i would that i could die is not what god made good    you told me that god was love    was not mankind made by god    and is not love the worlds delight

it is its direst misery said margot bitterly god keep you from it two parts are pain two sorrow and the other two parts are death

i dont fear death said gabrielle then why should i fear love

because it is a lie cried margot beside herself i conjure you by gods sorrow close your ears against it

how can i close my ears against it when i hear it in my sleep 

margots delight in her daughters beauty was turned into bitterness peace she cried and leave me

all this will pass away but deep within her heart said never innocence will be indiscreet sin alone is always clever and in youth great things are lightly asked and lightly given go she cried to gabrielle

gabrielle left the room margot buried her face in her hands

it is hard for woman to stand alone and to resist temptation forever soon or late the black moment comes reason is off guard prudence abandons her caution is thrown to the winds passion betrays here is an irremediable disease which baffles the skill of the physicians margot recoiled as she faced the future time had become a terror burning tears flowed down her cheeks there is no woe so sickening as the monotone of fear the shuddering interior sense of impending catastrophe

nor is it eased by the strange apathy which is granted to the doomed margot groaned in an agony half remorse half apprehension could god set so foul a seal upon so fair a thing

again on a day gabrielle came in from the garden her eyes dryburning and faminebright mother give me a lover she cried nietta pascault has one

then alas and alack for nietta pascault cried margot

but mother he called her his hearts delight she did not speak but she kissed him and he kissed her until he must have bruised her lips yet she did not seem to care    rather she seemed to like it and all he said was love me love me and all she said was yes and yes and when he kissed her she grew pale i thought that she was dead    but he held her in his arms mother and kissed her again and again as though he would kiss her back to life will kisses bring one back from the dead for mother suddenly she opened her eyes as if she lived only for love and then all he said was love me and all she said was yes 

margots heart fainted

day after day gabrielle knelt in the garden and plead for her hearts desire night after night margot crouched on her floor and prayed in despair and agony that it might not be given her heavens custodian mingled their prayers in fatal entanglement one was answered and one was not he is responsible

sunset lay on margots garden the paths still shimmered with the days heat though the lax grass lifted in the shadows nameless perfumes wandered among the drowsilybending flowers the odor of warm boxwood rose from the hedge the hedge stood black against the sky in its glistening fragrant deeps small birds moved swiftly to and fro in curious agitation

gabrielle puzzling upon lifes unanswered riddle stood listening to sounds beyond the hedge everywhere was the patter of hurrying feet and the whisper of wordless laughter mockingly borne on the evening wind the air was full of the golden vision of lightfooted maidens with fluttering garments flying through lilac lane pursued by ardent and breathless lovers eagerly following where they fled the sound of laughter floated back along the narrow way and the little faint echo of flying feet it was that time of the year when all maids are sweet as freshly gathered flowers and all men are a little mad even the earth drab clod was astir with the ecstasy of approaching night

beneath the broadboughed magnolia grew a pomegranatetree whose branches shrouded the greater trees bole the scarlet pomegranate flowers hung over gabrielle the green leaves folded her in faint color came fitfully over her cheek her eyes roamed restlessly through the garden but found no solace there as she stood thus brooding on lifes inexplicable theme she was aware of a sudden shadow which fell on the grass beside her and turned in voiceless terror

there was a face in the green hedge smiling two butterflies hovering over itâa lads face laughing and debonair with yellow hair curling around it like crisp little golden flames his cheeks were as ruddy and smooth as a childs his eyes were blue as the morning swift and bright the leaves stirred all around him as if to the beat of wings there was confidence in his bearing easy lordship and high pride

gabrielle startled and terrified shrank back against the magnolias black bole one trembling hesitant hand extended in doubt speechless she stared at that bright boyish face writh its nimbus of sunlit yellow hair until her dry eyes gushed tears dimming her sightâstared in wonder and adoration

his eyes were audaciously bright as wild stars incessantly roving and alight with golden fire he was tall wellset and slender with a beautiful straight body there was something godlike in his air as he leaned through the matted hedge eagerly scanning her âher pale rose cheeks snowy gown mothgreen kerchief her lips her neck matching the ivory of the blossoms in her hairâhalfveiled by a screen of leafy green dull gold and pomegranate flowers

she had bound her hair with a bit of gold braid which shone like an aureole round her brow and in it had thrust two butterfly lilies whiter than ivory her eyes were wide open round and unwinking their frightened depths full of tears her lips had fallen slightly apart to free her fluttering breath she sighed a little shuddering sigh and crossed her hands upon her breast her beauty startled him delicatefrail almost translucent in the golden sun she seemed a being not of flesh and gross mortality but a spirit by enchantment made visible a dryad out of the ancient wood a maiden saint stepped out of a missal or fled from a chapel window with a halo around her brow with her head poised like a flower her little perfect hands and feet her ankles slim and beautiful each line aristocratic everything proclaiming patrician blood nothing asserting a baser thing saint maid dryad nymph or sprite who could tell which

silently drinking her loveliness he leaned through the hedge among the firecolored flowers and green her color was exquisite as the violet sky is seen through yellow leaves

again she sighed softly stared at his face and shivered a little was it a god or a man in the hedge had he sprouted out of the boxwood or fallen from the clouds

the perfect beauty of her figure outlined on green by her thin white gown charmed and enchanted him he stared at her trying to focus her face more clearly upon his sight her loveliness struck him dumb she seemed a statue of ivory hung with garlands of gold crimson and green halfhidden by a roodscreen of shimmering emerald it seemed to him that he looked on more than mortal beauty

leaning forward a little one hand outstretched one clasping her throat she watched his face with its golden hair aglow in the last red sunlight how could she tell if it were a god or a man âthat face with its shimmering locks like living fire around it a gleaming nimbus whose dancing flames were fashioned of burnished gold a face like a blazing seraphs or ariels she looked at that proud young countenance in wordless adoration

her own face was now intensely bright with the sunsets declining glory into the crevice between her lips the sunshine had slipped her lips were translucent her mouth was aglow as if she breathed ethereal fire

suddenly he drew his breath with a sharply audible sound for as he gazed longing seized the boys heart and wrung it bitterly

the flame which blazed in his bright eyes put an answering glow in her own she was aware that her beauty had startled him for the first time in her life she was awake to her own loveliness a sense wonderful and sweet a delicate throbbing fire came fluttering up through her breast a flush stole into her cheeks and warmed their ashy pallor her eyes met his in his eyes were joy surprise and longing his eyes met hers and all her doubts went out in wordless joy for when she perceived that look in his face she too was thrilled with longing the silence sang fire thrilled her heart suddenly neck and cheeks flamed red

she answered his look with glorious eyes humid terrified alight then her frightened eyes fell and her shy face but like a wave which breaks along a beach in a passionate surge her heart rushed out to greet him

he saw her neck and her cheeks flame red passion struck him to the heart with a gesture of haughty but boyish humility he pushed through the hedge seized the sheltering pomegranate branches and swept them aside she stood uncurtained before him he gazed at her st jacques he cried are you a living creature

she regarded him for an instant with a look of undisguised terror catching her breath with a sobbing sound right pitiful to hear then her quivering piteous face was made exquisite by tears

a backwash of timidity held him silently staring at herâa boy hot and hasty sure of himself impulsively bold but abashedâadmiration and longing ablaze in his eyes gabrielle stammered but could not find words her breast heaved and sank she could not control it overwhelmed by the sudden strange rush of emotion she swayed giddily dizzily put out one hand to steady herself and laid it upon his arm a tremulous smile came over her face her tears like an april shower were gone

his hand sought her other hand found it held it thus their hands met half a step timidly they approached each other than stood at a halt as if turned to stone her frightened breath was the only sound save the stirring of the nightwind in the dark boughs overhead

shaking like a windblown leaf que desirezvous de moi she gasped

his voice too was trembling that you should love me a little for pitys sake    and quite forget to fear i

his voice seemed to gabrielle godlike

see then  i fear nothing    i should as soon think of fearing the air we breathe she said adoring her slender young demigod out of the hedge then suddenly she raised her hand and laid it caressingly on his cheek her trembling fingers felt like flowers trailed across his face

he laughed there was an infectious sweetness and merriment in his laughter then they laughed together softlyâfirst love and joy are silent things

you are the god of love she said with infinite simplicity else how could you fly over the hedge

her flutelike voice was like the music of a halfawakened song and exquisitely moving her words trailed slowly like speech asleep

again he laughed the god of love bien then what shall i have that is godlike

what you will she said you may ask for the innocent are trustful as doves helpless as the least creatures weak as the small birds among the little branches

he drew a quick breath most of all things on earth i would have a kiss from your mouth shall i have it

yes she said take it and put up her lips so their mouths met a thousand tingling darts of fire pierced through her as his lips touched hers

her heart was wrung by that first kiss for an instant it stood still the blood had left it and had fled through her like flame she almost swooned for first passion is like the wind in the blossoming locusttree too sweet to be easily breathed or borne youths first caress is almost an agony gabrielle gasped his lips had burned on hers like a celestial fire both shook as loves consuming flame rushed through them

as he to her was first so she to him each gave the other lifes immaculate gift the unmeasured unmeasurable fire of loves first embrace that passionate anguish of delicate uncalculated delight ardent and boundless

their lips hurried to the meeting how could they delay youth and love brook no delays yet as she felt his lips upon her own she regarded him with a writhen countenance of unqualified terror love comes to the maiden spirit with sudden tumult and strikes it not as a blithe discovery or an allelysian joy but as a birth and an agony from which if the soul survives comes unspeakable happiness his lips sought hers and seeking met in the meeting her soul flew out at her mouth

the world seemed suddenly remote withdrawn into the depths of uncalculated space there remained but these two young lovestunned souls groping to each other in the garden under the shadow of the great magnoliatrees

the enchantment of love was upon them the happy girl lay close upon his heart and all she said was love me love me and if ever i cease to love you perdition take my soull he said with utter confidence her eyes looked up into his glowing with a passion that knows no change and all she said as she lay against his heart was love me only love me that is all a woman asks her fingers stroked his yellow hair the mere touch thrilled her with unspeakable happiness

night came and darkness voyaged the uncharted sky overhead the blue dome blazed with the innumerable stars and golden planets heaving up heavens arch the tremulous green lamps of the fireflies filled the earth with twinkling constellations all around them but the heavens and the earth were as nothing to them love was there and he and she and the utterly forgotten starlight and where youth and love are life death good or ill the bright stars or the black mould or better or worse are nothing and wisdom is of little worth

they gazed into each others eyes with wordless tenderness youth has not words nor waits to find them age finds words and nothing else

across the city boomed the hourâ at last

oh i must go

not yet not yet

but i must go goodnight

not yet

but i must go goodnight goodnight i pray you leave me go    for truly i must go

you ll come again

tomorrow

show me the way into the garden he said she showed him the quickest way in kissed him and was gone through the garden for him the night was darkened and the stars put out her breath was still upon his face the smell of the flowers in his nostrils and in his ears was the sound of her voice calling after him low and sweet like a halfawakened songâor was it but a bird which called that softlyfluting lonely note

and when he was gone the garden to gabrielle was emptied of delight but all her soul was singing

her lips stung her cheeks were on fire into the house she came one little slipper upon its little foot one slipper goneâwhat became of that lost little slipper god knowsâand her stockinged foot was damp with the dew which had dripped from the leaves overhead a flame was in her eyes which is in a maidens eyes but once when love first lays his hands upon her heart so transfigured was she she seemed a winged creature she loved she was beloved inarticulate ecstasy hands feet neck and face told but one story her eyes shone like blazing stars the roses had returned to her pale lips the freshness to her wan cheeks

margot watched her with narrowed eyes

mother i am happy so happy that i do not want to die i want to live forever

margot eyed her narrowly what has changed your mind

i was walking in the garden rejoined gabrielle and the god of love was there he kissed me on my mouth mother and oh mother love is sweet  margots heart stopped beating are you quite mad she said

then the truth dawned upon her she lost all sense of balance in the crossed tides of dismay she strained her daughter to her heart then thrust her away dropped speech unuttered gave a choked cry of despair while her face went gray as ashes

she clutched gabrielle by tbe arms steadying herself for she coidd scarcely have stood alone she blinked like a person purblind and peered into the girls wondering eyes the lines of her face became furrows oh my god

she whispered i should have known i should have known

margot cowered as if to avoid a blow her eyes dilated yet she seemed incapable of seeing her mouth fell open she seemed to scream yet made no sound but that of the whistling breath through her nostrils as one who sustains the torture of the rack

she thrust gabrielle from her go she gasped and struck herself on head and breast crying out mother of god i should have known fool fool fool then as if stunned her head fell down upon her breast

in the dark and breathless stillness of the night there was a stern strange loveliness and now something akin to terror the terror of a child that dreams and waking in the darkness cries out from dread of unknown things

an ill wind which had been blowing since sunset with a faroff moaning sound had arisen to a melancholy screaming note with an extraordinary rumbling in the chimney clouds of soot and ashes blown from the fireplace whirled in drifts around the floor the sound of distant thunder the velocity of the wind the increasing turmoil and confusion filled the night with keen disease a bird sped round the house with a shrill cry the wind bellowed hoarsely in the chimney the house shook with the blast over the housetops could be heard the coming of the rain the light of the flickering candles served only to increase the gloom the draft from the window swelled out the print curtain and floated it halfway across the room straining and whipping at its pole the black magnolias bent and rose and bent again as if beneath the beating of gigantic wings it was close upon midnight

before her crucifix margot knelt regardless of the storm praying in anguish for the safety of her child ever before her imagining was gabrielle dishonored and betrayed abandoned to scorn and poverty her hands twisted in desperate appeal

blessed st dominique lover of souls preserve my daughter she plead she listened motionless all that she heard was the roar of the wind

mary mother great in grace defend and preserve my child mary mother of sorrows have mercy upon my daughter

again she listened but for the howl of the gale the silence was profound

all ye holy virgins intercede for usl iter panting voice broke lord of compassion hear me lord of infinite mercy hear me have mercy upon my child o thou most pitiful lord of the innocent answer my prayer

again she listened there was no sound but the roar of the storm the creak of the house and the gnawing of the great rats in the timbers of the wall she cringed and shivered and in extreme entreaty cried lord seigneur dieu preserve and spare my child you see her young and fair her soul as pure as the flowers that bloom in paradise you breathed into her life by your law she was made but for you she never had been dare you then let her fall

but all was still heaven to mortal anguish seems intolerably serene so far beyond comprehension is the inscrutable leisure of god it was taking too long for her sorrow to reach the foot of the throne she was seeking her daughters safety though it should be at the hazard of her soul but all she had was the bitterness of unanswered supplication to hearts dismayed there is nothing so appallingly still as god the confident faithful may await the ultimate reply but the desperate storm heaven they have not time to wait

she beat her breast her hair was moist her garments disarrayed her voice grew sharp by vicars saints and intercessors by all intermediaries she plead with almighty god to listen and to reply there was no answer mary mother of sorrows  she gasped does god not understand

her appeal arose piercing shrill dieu dieu eternel dieu ecoute mes crist hatetoi de ma secourir hatetoi delle delivrer o toi qui ecoutes la priere aie pitie de nous ne tardepas ecoute mes cris she waited there was no answer and suddenly her voice went up like the cry of delirium o dieu treshaut reveilletoi reveilletoi mon dieu then in a tone of amazement and pathos mary mother of sorrows she said do i have to explain to god

she paused a moment while despair rose like a swelling flood then through the darkness and the night went up a bitter cry seigneur dieu toutpuissant dieu sois attentif a ma priere tu marrosarez avec lhysope et je serai purifiee vous me lav eras et je deviendrai plus blanche que la neige plus blanche que la neige mon dieu plus blanche que la neige gabrielle ma fille mon dieu plus blanche que la neige forgive in her my transgressions pardon in her my sins deliver her from her inheritance    o my god    let her be white

a tremendous gust blew through the house the wind sucked in the chimney with a sound like awful laughter the blinds recoiled with thunderous shock but from heaven there was no answer

at this she cried out pitifully as he who long ago cried out the cry which through unending ages shall stand archetype of despair mon dieu mon dieu pourquoi mastu abandonne

the wind screamed round about her with the sound of many voices far off arose a tumult as of many people running borne on the wind came a torrent of hideous sound not mad music but awful dissonance swiftly nearing suddenly checked after the clamor a silence like death the room was fantastically still margot clung to the foot of the crucifix pourquoi o dieu rejettestu she asked in a voice grown shriveled and thin she crouched a moment motionless her head on one side listening there was no reply heaven maintained its brassy silence her face went gray her eyes were hard as stones she turned her back on the crucifix saying i will call upon you no more

there was a queer shuffling sound as of footsteps in the entry the candles sank to dull blue sparks devoid of radiance yet instead of darkness there was light outside was darkness vast pitmirk inside appalling light all the place was stunned and blinded by an overwhelming light which cast no shadows anywhere but vehemently streaming searched crack and cranny not a crevice escaped it lapped and flowed like waves and penetrated everything even the gross material of the walls saturated by that flame gave back a superfluous glow a white excess of light and every pointed thing within the room was peaked and capped with flame round and round the room a bewildered host of moths in little wavering flights and drops went fluttering with a light rustle of powdery wings and among them bats splashed through the light with a low continuous whirr round and round like frothclots on floodwater swinging around a vortex whirled slantbat and moth in a dizzy irregular ring in the midst of which crouched in a highbacked chair sat a shriveled deadalive mummylike figure as thin and fleshless as a skeletonâan apparition sinister white and wasted as a corpse newrisen from the grave

its chin upon its folded hands its hands about one knee the knee upheld by the heel crooked at the chairseats edge the other gaunt leg dangling across the upraised foot the specter smiled on margot a bleak saturnine smile its face was greatly wasted all the life of it seemed gathered into the brilliant terrible eyes which blazed with infernal light in splendid scorn without remorse sardonical a countenance such as god alone endures to look upon unmoved a figure terrible    deity deformed might look like this grotesquely majestical hideous baleful glorious accursed malign an archangel fallen outcast depraved satan god of the discontent

a twisted smile wreathing his evil lips with his chin hooked over his hands âa smile of cool confidence mingled with nonchalance why not try me he said

staring into the abyss of blinding terror and light which encircled that thunderscarred visage with its thin sleepless eyelids and twisted ironic smile margot shrank against the wall shivering as with cold one hand shielding her blinded eyes one groping along the wall she listened breathlessly

in a voice whose deep and hollow sound seemed part of the midnight storm satan spoke

god has forgotten you that is plain he said then why not pray unto me i remember when god forgets

what did ye hope that he who left jesus to die on the cross would stoop to succor you nay then you have been cajoled he has never so much as kept one man from the withering breath of time but leaves a thousand ills on earth to work their wills upon him yet you thought he would harken to you fi done neither for life nor death nor angels nor principalities nor for all the powers that ever were or shall forever be will he alter for you or for any one iota of his law

nay though your heart break with its burden not a jot of his law shall be altered to ease your load

i have seen all the piety under the sun and its wages are vanity what profit have you of all your labor what recompense of your toil heaven hath sent you sorrow it hath not sent a cure nor had compassion upon you

if this be lovingkindness why not try damnation awhile not forfeit riches power and place for a fools hope of treasures in heaven

doubtless the priest hath said unto you what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul faw i say unto you what profit hath a man though he save his own soul if he lose his hearts desire

when you are dead and done for and lie sleeping in the dust when âworms destroy your body when your days upon earth are become as shadows and you have no more a portion forever in anything under the sun what shall it profit you to have saved your soul at the cost of your hearts desire nay ye have been cajoled your way is without hope

but come unto me ye anxious whose hearts are bowed with care and i will give you your hearts desire no man calls on me in vain i turn none empty away the world is full of my mercies upon those who trust in me and my benefits fall like the summer rain on all who covenant with me ask and ye shall receive whatsoever your hearts may wish yea though it lie at the ends of the earth it shall be given unto you your house shall be full of good things riches and place and power ye shall heap up gold like dust from the streets ye shall have your hearts desire

come unto me ye weary whose hearts are bent with trouble lay down your burden and follow me i will give you your hearts desire

margots hand went up the wall a little way toward the crucifix then slipped hack with fumbling fingers

lord    lord she whispered hoarsely give me my hearts desire and what is your hearts desire that my daughter gabrielle should he white to all eternity all that i have and all that i am will i give    yea for this would i give my soul satan smiled

then lay down your burden my daughter you shall have your hearts desire

margot with a sobbing cry laid down her lifes unbearable burden at the feet of the prince of the powers of darkness

by his eternal damnation he swore she should have her hearts desire by her rejected salvation she swore to abide by the covenant

consummatum est he said and was gone on the black blast

the candles sent up a thin flare of flame and smoke and went out in utter darkness crouched on the floor against the wall margot still knelt in a stupor a rat came out of a hole in the wall and gnawed at her rosary dawn came in at the windows the twilit gray grew pink the walls were blotched and spotted everything exhaled an odor of mildew margot still huddled upon the floor beneath the crucifix over her head the crucified christ hung mute in his agony

the flight of hours the decline of day the seasons turn all things which preface change are presages of parting and like the proximity of the tomb though wreathed in bloomy myrtle are subtly fraught with sadness and regret all loves farewells are so oppressed though with absolute confidence in themselves and in each other sure of the imperishable structure of their love a nameless apprehension fills the hearts of all who part and casts a melancholy shade on partings until tomorrow l ah tomorrow tomorrow i will come again she says they go with trembling hands each shaken by departure saying shall we meet again

tomorrow gabrielle had said as she took her lips away tomorrow i will come again and was gone

in the warm heart of the midsummer night he dreamed again among the hedges a boys dream a dream of joy a dream of hearts delight her lips were pomegranate blossoms her cheeks were wild peach flowers it was a boys dream a dream of joy a dream of hearts delight her waist was as a willowwithe her voice a bird in the deep wood calling her feet danced fantasies in his heart he came all in the daze of a boys dream a dream of joy a dream of hearts desire with every eager breath he drew in the hyacinthine fragrance of the night

all day long like a sullen army a great cloud heaved and gloomed along the west with windblown vapors streaming around its thunderous heights all day long in awe of it men put off going here and there gave over plans and stood oppressed by its tremendous imminence the day was darkened by the dominion of the cloud at evening it rolled off across the plain obliterating leagues of lesser storms with fire stabbing at its breast and distant bellowings of tremendous sound heaving slowly against the twilight stars rolling in sullen majesty upon the gale pale moonlight falling on its peaks and the gray rain trailing down below in its heart innumerable lightnings thunder grumbling in its front it left the drenched field to the moon beyond the edge of the world it hung gloomily brooding upon the splendor of the night

in the magic of the moonlight lilac lane lay ghostly as a dream hushed alluring unfamiliar the strange white light of the immense full moon lay dead on everything the hedgerows were hung with the shadows and darkness of strange delight the cicada chittered in the almond tree the great moths flapped heavily among the wet moonflowers a slow scarcely perceptible wind blew languidsweet hardly moving the heavy leaves of the magnolias a gray bird pitched a wild song somewhere deep within a hedge

in margots garden everything was wrapped in nights singular fantasy in the pallor of the moonlight the garden lay like an enchanted realm of goblin loveliness the lilies stood as pale and chill as flowers carved of marble among the drowsy poppies hung garlands of nocturnal vine whose folded blooms in chaplets clustered colorless in the pallid moonshine the whole place trembled in a pale strange beauty which the silence made lovelier still like an island in a silvery mist margots house stood blind asleep its little windows curtained deep with shadows dim blue and dark and on the woodwork of the door like petals of dismantled flowers waxwet windblown walked moths thrown there by the whining wind slowly blowing across leagues of lonely marsh and among the moths the glowworms faintly lighted and phosphorgreen crawled up and down up and down to nowhere it looked like the door of the way to oblivion so lonely it seemed and so still the garden was utterly empty the house yard was deserted

he looked he listened and his heart stood still save for the glowworm and the moth there was nothing alive there but him like the chill which creeps across the matted grass of evening in the last fair days of autumn full of the faded fragrance and haunted dusk of fall a wordless dread stole over him the moonlight gleamed on the cottage wall with a singular mournful splendor a heavy wind began to stir the trees immensely mournful faint and faraway there came a boom of thunder from beyond the rim of the world joy all at once was gone from the midsummer night the haunting strangeness crept into his heart the place was full of the heavy fragrance of dead flowers here and there a palsied rose its faded leaves relaxed broke and fell without a sound

under the figtrees he paused a moment undecidedâto listen shivering a little and peering along the wall there was no sound of human life though the wind had set the great leaves stirring all was ghostly as a dream one white star above the roofpeak sailed among the broken clouds the moon desolate splendid hung in the magnolia mournfully gleaming through the black boughs in the still air the moonlight stood the shadows lay like solid things upon the cottage wall

at the corner of the house he paused and listened again in the strange unanswering silence a sense of disaster gripped him there was no sound anywhere his heart almost ceased beating

with premonition of catastrophe he ran along the wallânothing but windows battened or curtained blank as a blindmans eyes not a sign of humanity

where he had dreamed to stand speechless with happiness he stood shaken by nameless fear

deep within the house he heard a relaxed beam pung with a sound like a viol string softly struck by a hand in passing the deep slow sound reverberated through the hollow house and died away in vacant whispering

through the crevice of the shutter he saw the cold moonlight fall along the deserted floor the house was absolutely empty

there is a conventschool for orphaned girls kept by the nuns in new orleans the loveliest girl seen there in years was gabrielle lagoux carried there between two nights lest young love like death insist

dawn and departure she had trembled like a leaf half comprehending only her mother kissed her twice in feverish haste with lips like dry leaves that was their parting some one called gabrielle at the door the coach was at the gate she stopped at the wicket looked down the lane said a few words to the coachboy who guarded her gown from the wheels tell him she said that i love him tell him remember me she paused again at the door of the coach her foot on the step a dazed look in her eyes saying tell him not to forget me i love himl the wheels rumbled over the cobbles she never came back when she entered the coach young love was done for forever she never saw her golden lad again love beat his rosered wings in vain he could not overtake the coach for the coach was fate all was over his dusty feet halted in the heat of the dusty road goodby   goodby forever

days became weeks weeks months months grew into years she never came again she passed through the convents sheltering door was safe from mischance and folly passed into a world remote of unfamiliar faces and forgot

god made memory cruel that men might know remorse but the devil devised forgetfulness anodyne of regret

reputed heiress to vast estates provided with boundless means and gifted with great beauty coming to marriageable age in all the freshness of her youthful loveliness she was wedded to a wealthy planters only son whose love for her was very great

pure happiness was theirs prolonged far beyond the honeymoon surrounded by every creature comfort wealth could procure or affection devise secure in a faithful mans unaltering love she dwelt serene in a country where the fruits of the earth and the flowers of the forest spread natural loveliness about fields of unsurpassed fertility

she never knew winter want nor war her years were filled with peace her estates increased to vast proportions  a thousand slaves were happy being hers admired for her beauty greatly loved she returned an adoring husbands devotion and bore him childdren with eyes like the morning and hair like wreathed flames her daughters married and were fruitful bearing children fair as an april day with eyes like the sky of the morning for them for her the world rolled on in unperturbed peace

but she never saw her golden lad again

something inscrutable deeper than whim had come over margot lagoux her work was oddly altered it had more air less ease more spell less charm more force and less dexterity the stuffs she chose no longer were notable for the exquisite wan delicacy which so becomes the pallor of highbred beauty she took an incomprehensible joy in vivid color but what was gained in vividness was lost in harmony her work retained distinction but of a queer sort reserve gave way to novelty simple beauty was replaced by meretricious charm her taste which had been perfect seemed suffering gradual corruption her craft was marred by crudities her turbans began to look as if there were duly barbaric plumes in the world of parrakeets and cockatoos trogons and flamingos gay toucan wings and extraordinary quills florid colors and distempered stains were mingled in inharmonious contrast mangoyellow peacockgreen egyptian blue and congo scarlet flaunted their discordant tones together

style she had but it was style malade du rouvieiuv her trademark had become gaucherie her art artifice good taste had departed her work no more was garnished but bedizened with excess nowhere restrained but having unrestricted vent in tawdry fripperies her handicraft was stamped by power and energy misapplied the sole distinction it had left was whimsical device everything she did was like sweet wine soured the worse for having been so much better her bonnets were like songs in forced falsetto every line slurred by subtle default every sweet note out always too much or too little never the happy mean even the pearls or marguerites which she had formerly employed in bordures as trademarks of her craft had become cheap beads of colored pottery and glass in tarnished bowls in corners of obscure pawnshop windows among the dead flies and the dust are still occasionally to be found beads often called margots or margotons like those employed by margot lagoux in her practice of millinery but said to be threadplummets employed by makers of lace one a greek dealer in old gold and stolen silver tells the enquiring traveler that these are dead sea pebbles worn to their peculiar shapes by the ceaseless fret of that gloomy sea but beads like them grotesques baroques were laced on toques and turbans of her make and now and then were found among the laces on bonnets which had no need of them men seeing them narrowed their glances and took new note of the wearer those aware permitted none near or dear to adorn her person with them

a queerly degenerated taste marked everything that margot did with singular obliquity she set everything awry from rich goods produced unspeakably poor results and with cheap cunning vexed priceless stuffs beyond recovery or repair

her custom fell from vendre cher to bon marche with the diminishing stream of patronage the material in her shop went down from velours ras velours fagonne and velours de sole to velours de coton and coton croise from velvet to velveteens the air of distinction which attracted gentility utterly faded away the coarse crude stuffs and rude handiwork repelled the aristocratic calls for her work became infrequent more infrequent came no more one morning the milliners shop was shut it never was opened again the sts uffon the dusty shelves grew faded discolored and stained cobwebs hung from the mouldy walls the trade which had known and frequented the place knew it no more

but out of this end like a paradox above the apparent wreck margot arose in prosperity the devil was good as his word

she dwelt in a massive great house a mansion handsome stately and somber by a courtyard paved in marble approached through a vaulted tunnel lit by a dullflaming torch and closed by an iron gate from the side of the court a staircase of marble rose to her private door ornate as a public offices entry and massively carved in flowers stairs within of blueveined marble went up through wide corridors heavily panelled in dark spanish wood beneath the house vast cellars boomed and echoed the chimneys rose like turrets grouped against the darkling sky the house throughout was furnished with every luxury befitting persons of circumstance broad hearths for the burning of long wood in winter vaulted corridors burnished fittings of latten and jalousies of saffronwood with retaining rosettes of porcelain mahogany tables of rare design deepcarved and adorned with brass curtains of saffroncolored silk cinctured with gold braid hung from the ceiling to the floor in heavy golden folds day was made night night day by many subterfuges with blinds and saffron jalousies ironed fast against the noon by night the light shone out to the red stars and the house was full of the swift rich sweeping of heavy silk curtains waved by the wind and the glow of the wax candles chequered the courtyard below with gold in the middle of the courtyard at the foot of the staircase a fountain played in a yellow basin with a pleasant incessant noise of whispering green water falling perpetually with a delicate patter over seven brown stone dolphins spouting from whose pouted mouths went up contending streams the waters gushed whitelaced babbling from the greencoppered vents in the dolphins mouths and descended in spray to the bowl below and under the bowl the drainpipe murmured subterranean cool about the courtyard stood a row of crimsonflowered pomegranatetrees through the split brown rinds the garnet pulp and silver seeds showed clotted thick as crystals in a stone and purple fruits in heavy clusters of myriad uncounted drupes hung from the superior privets ranged along the courtyard wallx dropping green shadows like vast laces over the blindarched bricks below a garden lay beyond the court its gate hung thick and deep with yellow roses clinging to the iron lantern drooping and swaying in unconstrained festoons beyond the garden the place debouched into a forgotten graveyard

by night alive by day the place was sunk in dreams with lavish beauty everywhere composed to sleep in sunlit sloth luxurious and deep the place seemed fallen in a trance the pigeons dozed along the eaves and on the grass below where the garden stretched the peacock slowly danced his stiff and stately dance an iris feather bubble green as jade purple as wine blue as lazuli the courtyard seemed the very home of sleep the sun lay stupid on the silent walls and drowsily beat on the bluedoored cellars shut with cautious bars closed fast and locked beneath the arcaded porch the shadows of the slim pillars slept in the graceful galleries all was hushed but the peacocks cry while that iridescent bubble on toes black as ebony danced here and there there and here his slow pavone among the yellow roses

by night beneath the windows ancient tombs bared their sculptured breasts to the stars and stared up at the golden arches and dank black cracked sarcophagi chequered with light laid broad their timeworn sculptured emblems and tragical inscriptions âskulls with wings and urns and hourglasses whose unrefluent palsied sands meet measure of eternity kept with motionless registry and stony garlands of stone flowers which never bloomed nor ever were sweet as that beneath them had been sweet to mans all quivering sense here lay the long dead day and night communicant in death and wraiths of old unhappiness rose sighing with regret or dreamed beneath the stones of love as futile as regret the wind among the tombstones like a stream from a windy fountain murmured among the pomegranatetrees stirred the shadows under the privets rustled between the silken curtains whispering much as dead men do chill wordless fluttering breaths of unsolved mystery and when the wind from the graveyard whispered all the place stood listening hushed the wind from the graveyard whispered among the saffron curtains the ceaseless fountain waters fell else all was still but the peacocks wild nightcry sounding through the unfathomable silence like the rending of an illusionâdeep and singular and strangeâby a harsh trumpets blast heh the devil keeps his promises in the way that suits him best

margots existence here was a thing apart from everything plebeian she was immensely wealthy had riches such as are won by few though sought by many plantations in the country houses in town money on call in quantity that made great bankers bow women to wait upon her deferential men boys to run at her beck maidservants bond and free to go before her her cellar was famous for its wines her dress for its wild and extravagant beauty all that she touched she took all that she took she kept everything that she kept increased beyond the hounds of reason she was spoken to with deference and referred to with finesse she had her carriage lined with silk with yellow hammercloths and bands in the license of her beauty she laughed at sumptuary laws and in her illegal equipage rolled insolently on in amber gown and canary turban fastened with a golden brooch despite the law she rode the streets like a charioted queen or dressed in wild unstudied colors such as are used in barbary she wandered in her garden in the afterhours of the day making wreaths of the saffron roses a cockatoo upon her arm the color of a wild peach flower

a shapely splendid creature with her handsome heavy hands neck like a tower glorious hair hanging rich beneath its turban her embroidered robe but carelessly worn and recklessly adjustedâoddly the coarser the more becomingâa goddess made of beautiful earth but coarse as the cottonflower with confident face and insolent mien she took her way through the streets with a supple stride which was the despair of envious rivalry hers was a regal beauty like the tigers loveliness

with her face like beauty seen in dreams incredible and untrue she went through the community like a lovely malady even wise mens souls were troubled sturdy hearts that had laughed at passion shook with the fairness of her face piety was troubled by her golden loveliness more than one sermon from solomons song was inspired by rita lagoux she was known as the woman with a face like a beautiful blasphemy

time but increased the wildness and singularity of her beauty it was gossiped about in the marketstalls it was babbled about in the streets

then a torpor fell on her loveliness a dull and leaden look her beauty grew sullen and lowering as the flame of a fallen fire though not much altered in appearance she was somehow greatly changed her looks had lost something no one could say what gained something none could define it was not that she was less the unforgettable being she had been or that her sullen beauty made less mark on memory but that the ecstasy of beauty was replaced by a queer unrest though as never before she was possessed of a singular comeliness men began to regard her with an odd uneasiness there was a foreignness in her face and the look of alien things

she looked like a portrait of herself painted in irony

on the day that her daughter was married in faraway new orleans margot stood motionless by her mirror staring at her own reflection the day seemed oddly overcast suddenly she burst into wild shrill laughter cheerless and tragic her body shaking her hands wrung together turned away with an epithet reversed the glass and never looked into a mirror again something had passed across her face like a strange ambiguous stain

a shadow had fallen upon her like an unexpected dusk or the dimness under a passing cloud and had overcast her beauty

not time with his pinching seam nor age with its ugliness but a subtle and more peculiar change had come over margot lagoux

there is a halflight in the hour of an eclipse which casts a weird spell on the world when the sun is but a narrow crescent at high noon and the earth grows oddly dim in an untimely dusk such a dusk was fallen upon margot lagoux

sultry beauty such as hers has ever an early afternoon but this was more than sultry beautys early afternoon not day not darkness yet but dusk went with her everywhere like twilight in the woods the sun shone brightly everywhere along a sparkling world but on margot lay a shadow strange and sinister as unbleached muslin sallows to dingy isabella as metal tarnishes from neglect as white paper dulls in the sun as the spot on bruised fruit turns brown margot lagoux was changing she was becoming tawny swart bisblanc as the creoles say her goldenruddy cheeks had turned a morbid olivebrown as if a somber fountain were playing in her blood

there were many women at that day on whom fate laid dreadful hands louise briaud who was blinded by smallpox fanchette bourie whom god pitied with death helene richemont the leper floride biez doucie baramont francesca villeponteaux wrecked by disfiguring maladies god give them peace but on none was laid so ruthless unrelenting deliberate a hand as fell upon rita lagoux

she changed like a portrait whose shadows painted in bitumen have struck through and distempered the rest like a strange nocturnal creature she seemed to absorb the gloom her glorious eyes grew jaundiced her rosebrown lips grew dun the delicate webs that joined her fingers grew yellow as bakers saffron malice laughed at her thickening lips

weeks turned months months years swarthy she grew and ugly she put aside beauty as a worn bright garment and took on grotesquery stark and medieval as a chinese teakwood carving she became both grotesque and contorted gross misshapen sullied and debased the old enchantment was gone like a necromancers spell the perfect gait had faltered down to a lurching trot a hurrying waddle with an irregular unsure motion hesitating a moment then hastening on with vague uncertainty her soft sleepy laugh had grown violent her melodious voice coarse of her fair face there was nothing left no not remembrance even

a young man came to her threshold one morning and looked in eagerly he would speak with margot lagoux but is that margot lagoux he asked a curious look coming over his faceâthat woman obese with low brows huge fat eyelids round bare forehead short strained and corded neck enormously thick yellowed teeth irregularly shown between thick sallowed lips cheeks wrinkled flecked and blotched with brown like spotted peaches no he said hastily shrinking away that is not the woman i mean the woman i meant was comely    and had a beautiful daughter named gabrielle he turned away shuddering

she wore old rags for robes an old freloche upon her head in nowise restraining the unkempt coils of her hair hanging matted upon her neck her cheeks hung slack and dark and dingy her lusterless locks were felted into a tangled web that had grown gray with lint her frowsy chin was stained as with walnut hulls she was falling apart like an old house with nobody living in it swore black oaths with a foul mouth cursed all who crossed her path ate like a beast food fit for beasts her fevered sun of glory setâgone gone gone down she went like the stuffs in her shop from velours ras to coton croise down down to oblivion down to the dusty corner of death she spat in the dirt je men fiche she said

she hated a priest and never knelt at a confessional again

she did not die in the great house where she had passed the days of her power every place she dwelt in sank into decay the swifter where its integrity seemed permanent and secure nothing purged the ambiguous spell which dragged them down together to the dust the great house stood a ruin above a ruined court a wreck of its former pride and splendor black and foul the fountain had fallen long ago its pipes strangled and eaten away to crusts of lead and thready ribs of iron in the sand lilac lane was gone there was no lane there any more and had been none for years there was no trace of where it ran its hedgerows or its gardens or of margots cottage other than a mouldering heap of broken brick bleak rafters of the fallen roof and one stark fallen gable of gabrielles garden nothing remained

margot died in a dirty hovel in an unkempt alleyway in the midst of a negro quarter where if one beat a drum or caused an instrument of an orchestra to sound the people swarmed from the tenements like ants out of a hill the place was fallen and foul and filled with beggary and that is the end of a tenement for beggars are like distemper the place where they have lived is hard to cure all the houses in the alley were filthy but none was filthy as hers

there was a tremendous storm that night her house was ablaze with light the little tailor who lived next door said ahai mother gogo has company but the only person seen was one of the religious sort a tall man with a face like an unpleasant taste

the thunder was terrific the storm wild beyond compare the wind blew with a sound like wild gigantic laughter ffffff went the gale the gusts howled through the tailors house the whole place shook the blinds banged and crashed the wind wailed and sucked down the chimney with a sound like awful weeping the little tailors soul was filled with a sense of enormous terror

all night long the thunder rolled like the laughter of an angry god dislodged by the tremendous concussions the cockroaches flew out of the walls end in the morning alter the storm the parrakeets which lived in the trees were all turned gray as ashes

the windows and doors of old mother gogos house were standing open wide it was plain that they had stood open all night and that the rain had beaten into the house unopposed

this however occasioned but brief surprise when they peered in at the door the rats were playing around the floor with the beads of a broken rosary

a priest came hurrying in he did not stay in long when he came out his face was white as a sheet and his lips were drawn and gray

those who prepare the dead came they stood on the threshold peeping and queerly looking in at the door

a gray mist filled the place like a cloud through which things were visible

the rooms were damp as an old vault and full of a deathlike smell the walls were covered with green mould the woodwork was rotten the candles had guttered and dripped and gone out the floor was bespattered with tallow all around the rooms were coffers of linen and lace coffres tres beaux coffres mignons de dressouer compagnons coffres de boys qui point nempire madres et jaunes comme cire all the coffers were open and everything that was in them was tossed wildly about the floor not one piece of the lovely old stuffs as yellow as wax but was blackened by showers of soot and trampled under foot by the neighbors goat the print of whose hoofs was everywhere

and madame margot

heh god had designed her for tragedy but here was comedy margot lay stretched out on the floor as black as ebony dead among the ashes and soot charred like a fallen star

the coroner found that the woman had died of the visitation of god but doe gou the tailor said simply has god feet like a gnat

the bishop refused to have masses said for the repose of her pitiful soul and they would not allow her to be buried in st sebastians graveyard the potters field was the place for her her color was too peculiar

too black to he buried among the white too white to lie clown with the black she was buried in secret in her own garden under the magnoliatrees

and that was the end of madame margot
