our nig or sketches from the life a free black wilson harriet  fiction
oh grief beyond all other griefs when fate first leaves the young heart lone and desolate in the wide world without that only tie for which it loved to live or feared to die lorn as the hungup lute that neer hath spoken since the sad day its masterchord was broken

moore

lonely mag smith  see her as she walks with downcast eyes and heavy heart it was not always thus she had a loving trusting heart

early deprived of parental guardianship far removed from relatives she was left to guide her tiny boat over lifes surges alone and inexperienced as she merged into womanhood unprotected uncherished uncared for there fell on her ear the music of love awakening an intensity of emotion long dormant it whispered of an elevation before unaspired to of ease and plenty her simple heart had never dreamed of as hers

she knew the voice of her charmer so ravishing sounded far above her it seemed like an angels alluring her upward and onward she thought she could ascend to him and become an equal she surrendered to him a priceless gem which he proudly garnered as a trophy with those of other victims and left her to her fate

the world seemed full of hateful deceivers and crushing arrogance conscious that the great bond of union to her former companions was severed that the disdain of others would be insupportable she determined to leave the few friends she possessed and seek an asylum among strangers

her offspring came unwelcomed and before its nativity numbered weeks it passed from earth ascending to a purer and better life

 god be thanked ejaculated mag as she saw its breathing cease  no one can taunt her with my ruin

blessed release may we all respond how many pure innocent children not only inherit a wicked heart of their own claiming lifelong scrutiny and restraint but are heirs also of parental disgrace and calumny from which only long years of patient endurance in paths of rectitude can disencumber them

mags new home was soon contaminated by the publicity of her fall she had a feeling of degradation oppressing her but she resolved to be circumspect and try to regain in a measure what she had lost then some foul tongue would jest of her shame and averted looks and cold greetings disheartened her she saw she could not bury in forgetfulness her misdeed so she resolved to leave her home and seek another in the place she at first fled from

alas how fearful are we to be first in extending a helping hand to those who stagger in the mires of infamy to speak the first words of hope and warning to those emerging into the sunlight of morality who can tell what numbers advancing just far enough to hear a cold welcome and join in the reserved converse of professed reformers disappointed disheartened have chosen to dwell in unclean places rather than encounter these  holierthanthou  of the great brotherhood of man

such was mags experience and disdaining to ask favor or friendship from a sneering world she resolved to shut herself up in a hovel she had often passed in better days and which she knew to be untenanted she vowed to ask no favors of familiar faces to die neglected and forgotten before she would be dependent on any

eemoved from the village she was seldom seen except as upon your introduction gentle reader with downcast visage returning her work to her employer and thus providing herself with the means of subsistence in two years many hands craved the same avocation foreigners who cheapened toil and clamored for a livelihood competed with her and she could not thus sustain herself she was now above no drudgery

occasionally old acquaintances called to be favored with help of some kind which she was glad to bestow for the sake of the money it would bring her but the association with them was such a painful reminder of bygones she returned to her hut morose and revengeful refusing all offers of a better home than she possessed thus she lived for years hugging her wrongs but making no effort to escape she had never known plenty scarcely competency but the present was beyond comparison with those innocent years when the coronet of virtue was hers

every year her melancholy increased her means diminished at last no one seemed to notice her save a kindhearted african who often called to inquire after her health and to see if she needed any fuel he having the responsibility of furnishing that article and she in return mending or making garments

 how much you earn dis week mag   asked he one saturday evening

 little enough jim two or three days without any dinner i washed for the reeds and did a small job for mrs bellmont thats all i shall starve soon unless i can get more to do folks seem as afraid to come here as if they expected to get some awful disease i do nt believe there is a person in the world but would be glad to have me dead and out of the way

 no no mag do nt talk so you shant starve so long as i have barrels to hoop peter greene boards me cheap i ll help you if nobody else will

a tear stood in mags faded eye im glad

she said with a softer tone than before a if there is one who is nt glad to see me suffer i blieve all singleton wants to see me punished and feel as if they could tell when i ve been punished long enough its a long day ahead they ll set it i reckon

after the usual supply of fuel was prepared jim returned home full of pity for mag he set about devising measures for her relief by golly  said he to himself one dayâfor he had become so absorbed in mags interest that he had fallen into a habit of musing aloudâby golly

i wish shed marry me

 who   shouted pete greene suddenly starting from an unobserved comer of the rude shop

 where you come from you sly nigger  exclaimed jim

 come tell me who ist   said pete  mag smith you want to marry  

 git out pete and when you come in dis shop again let a nigger know it do nt steal in like a thief

pity and love know little severance one attends the other jim acknowledged the presence of the former and his efforts in mags behalf told also of a finer principle

this sudden expedient which he had uninten tionally disclosed roused his thinking and inventive powers to study upon the best method of introducing the subject to mag

he belted his barrels with many a scheme revolving in his mind none of which quite satisfied him or seemed on the whole expedient he thought of the pleasing contrast between her fair face and his own dark skin the smooth straight hair which he had once in expression of pity kindly stroked on her now wrinkled but once fair brow there was a tempest gathering in his heart and at last to ease his pentup passion he exclaimed aloud by golly  recollecting his former exposure he glanced around to see if pete was in hearing again satisfied on this point he continued shed be as much of a prize to me as shed fall short of coming up to the mark with white folks i do nt care for past things ive done things fore now is shamed of shes good enough for me any how

one more glance about the premises to be sure pete was away

the next saturday night brought jim to the hovel again the cold was fast coming to tarry its apportioned time mag was nearly despairing of meeting its rigor

 hows the wood mag   asked jim

 all gone and no more to cut any how was the reply

too bad jim said his truthful reply would have been im glad

 any thing to eat in the house   continued he

 no replied mag

 too bad  again orally with the same inward gratulation as before

well mag said jim after a short pause  yous down low enough i do nt see but ive got to take care of ye sposin we marry 

mag raised her eyes full of amazement and uttered a sonorous  what  

jim felt abashed for a moment he knew well what were her objections

 yous had trial of white folks any how they run off and left ye and now none of em come near ye to see if yous dead or alive is black outside i know but is got a white heart inside

which you rather have a black heart in a white skin or a white heart in a black one  

 oh dear  sighed mag  nobody on earth cares for meâ

i do interrupted jim

 i can do but two things said she  beg my living or get it from you

take me mag i can give you a better home than this and not let you suffer so

he prevailed they married you can philosophize gentle reader upon the impropriety of such unions and preach dozens of sermons on the evils of amalgamation want is a more powerful philosopher and preacher poor mag she has sundered another bond which held her to her fellows she has descended another step down the ladder of infamy

misery we have known each other like a sister and a brother living in the same lone home many years â we must live some hours or ages yet to come

shelley

jim proud of his treasure â a white wifeâ tried hard to fulfil his promises and furnished her with a more comfortable dwelling diet and apparel it was comparatively a comfortable winter she passed after her marriage when jim could work all went on well industrious and fond of mag he was determined she should not regret her union to him time levied an additional charge upon him in the form of two pretty mulattos whose infantile pranks amply repaid the additional toil a few years and a severe cough and pain in his side compelled him to be an idler for weeks together and mag had thus a reminder of bygones she cared for him only as a means to subserve her own comfort yet she nursed him faithfully and true to marriage vows till death released her he became the victim of consumption he loved mag to the last so long as life continued he stifled his sensibility to pain and toiled for her sustenance long after he was able to do so

a few expressive wishes for her welfare a hope of better days for her an anxiety lest they should not all go to the  good place brief advice about their children a hope expressed that mag would not be neglected as she used to be the manifestation of christian patience  these were all the legacy of miserable mag a feeling of cold desolation came over her as she turned from the grave of one who had been truly faithful to her

she was now expelled from companionship with white people this last step â her union with a black â was the climax of repulsion

seth shipley a partner in jims business wished her to remain in her present home but she declined and returned to her hovel again with obstacles threefold more insurmountable than before seth accompanied her giving her a weekly allowance which furnished most of the food necessary for the four inmates after a time work failed their means were reduced

how mag toiled and suffered yielding to fits of desperation bursts of anger and uttering curses too fearful to repeat when both were supplied with work they prospered if idle they were hungry together in this way their interests became united they planned for the future together mag had lived an outcast for years

she had ceased to feel the gushings of penitence  she had crushed the sharp agonies of an awakened conscience she had no longings for a purer heart a better life far easier to descend lower she entered the darkness of perpetual infamy she asked not the rite of civilization or christianity her will made her the wife of seth soon followed scenes familiar and trying

 its no use said seth one day  we must give the children away and try to get work in some other place

 who ll take the black devils  snarled mag

 they re none of mine said seth  what you growling about  

nobody will want any thing of mine or yours either she replied

 we ll make em praps he said  theres frados six years old and pretty if she is yours and white folks ll say so shed be a prize somewhere he continued tipping his chair back against the wall and placing his feet upon the rounds as if he had much more to say when in the right position

frado as they called one of mags children was a beautiful mulatto with long curly black hair and handsome roguish eyes sparkling with an exuberance of spirit almost beyond restraint hearing her name mentioned she looked up from her play to see what seth had to say of her

wouldnt the bellmonts take her asked seth

bellmonts shouted mag his wife is a right shedevil and ifâ

 had nt they better be all together   interrupted seth reminding her of a like epithet used in reference to her little ones

without seeming to notice him she continued she cant keep a girl in the house over a week and mr bellmont wants to hire a boy to work for him but he cant find one that will live in the house with her  shes so ugly they cant

well weve got to make a move soon

answered seth  if you go with me we shall go right off had you rather spare the other one   asked seth after a short pause

 ones as bad as t other replied mag

 frado is such a wild frolicky thing and means to do jest as shes a mind to  she wo nt go if she do nt want to i do nt want to tell her she is to be given away

 i will said seth  come here frado  

the child seemed to have some dim foreshadowing of evil and declined

 come here he continued   i want to tell you something

she came reluctantly he took her hand and said  we re going to move bymbye will you go  

 no  screamed she and giving a sudden jerk which destroyed seths equilibrium left him sprawling on the floor while she escaped through the open door

 shes a hard one said seth brushing his patched coat sleeve id risk her at bellmonts

they discussed the expediency of a speedy departure seth would first seek employment and then return for mag they would take with them what they could carry and leave the rest with pete greene and come for them when they were wanted they were long in arranging affairs satisfactorily and were not a little startled at the close of their conference to find frado missing they thought approaching night would bring her twilight passed into darkness and she did not come they thought she had understood their plans and had perhaps permanently withdrawn they could not rest without making some effort to ascertain her retreat seth went in pursuit and returned without her they rallied others when they discovered that another little colored girl was missing a favorite playmate of frados all effort proved unavailing mag felt sure her fears were realized and that she might never see her again before her anxieties became realities both were safely returned and from them and their attendant they learned that they went to walk and not minding the direction soon found themselves lost they had climbed fences and walls passed through thickets and marshes and when night approached selected a thick cluster of shrubbery as a covert for the night they were discovered by the person who now restored them chatting of their prospects frado attempting to banish the childish fears of her companion as they were some miles from home they were kindly cared for until morning mag was relieved to know her child was not driven to desperation by their intentions to relieve themselves of her and she was inclined to think severe restraint would be healthful

the removal was all arranged the few days necessary for such migrations passed quickly and one bright summer morning they bade farewell to their singleton hovel and with budgets and bundles commenced their weary march

as they neared the village they heard the merry shouts of children gathered around the schoolroom awaiting the coming of their teacher

 halloo  screamed one  black white and yeller    black white and yeller echoed a dozen voices

it did not grate so harshly on poor mag as once it would she did not even turn her head to look at them she had passed into an insensibility no childish taunt could penetrate else she would have reproached herself as she passed familiar scenes for extending the separation once so easily annihilated by steadfast integrity

two miles beyond lived the bellmonts in a large old fashioned twostory white house environed by fruitful acres and embellished by shrubbery and shade trees years ago a youthful couple consecrated it as home and after many little feet had worn paths to favorite fruit trees and over its green hills and mingled at last with brother man in the race which belongs neither to the swift or strong the sire became greyhaired and decrepid and went to his last repose his aged consort soon followed him

the old homestead thus passed into the hands of a son to whose wife mag had applied the epithet  shedevil as may be remembered

john the son had not in his family arrangements departed from the example of the father

the pastimes of his boyhood were ever freshly revived by witnessing the games of his own sons as they rallied about the same goal his youthful feet had often won as well as by the amusements of his daughters in their imitations of maternal duties

at the time we introduce them however john is wearing the badge of age most of his children were from home some seeking employment  some were already settled in homes of their own a maiden sister shared with him the estate on which he resided and occupied a portion of the house

within sight of the house seth seated himself with his bundles and the child he had been leading while mag walked onward to the house leading frado a knock at the door brought mrs bellmont and mag asked if she would be willing to let that child stop there while she went to the reeds house to wash and when she came back she would call and get her it seemed a novel request but she consented

why the impetuous child entered the house we cannot tell the door closed and mag hastily departed frado waited for the close of day which was to bring back her mother alas

it never came it was the last time she ever saw or heard of her mother

oh did we but know of the shadows so nigh the world would indeed be a prison of gloom all light would be quenched in youths eloquent eye and the prayerlisping infant would ask for the tomb

for if hope be a star that may lead us astray and  deceiveth the heart as the aged ones preach yet twas mercy that gave it to beacon our way though its halo illumes where it never can reach

eliza cook

as the day closed and mag did not appear surmises were expressed by the family that she never intended to return mr bellmont was a kind humane man who would not grudge hospitality to the poorest wanderer nor fail to sympathize with any sufferer however humble

the childs desertion by her mother appealed to his symathy and he felt inclined to succor her

to do this in opposition to mrs bellmonts wishes would be like encountering a whirlwind charged with fire daggers and spikes she was not as susceptible of fine emotions as her spouse

mags opinion of her was not without foundation she was selfwilled haughty undisciplined arbitrary and severe in common parlance she was a scold a thorough one mr b remained silent during the consultation which follows engaged in by mother mary and john or jack as he was familiarly called

 send her to the county house said mary in reply to the query what should be done with her in a tone which indicated selfimportance in the speaker she was indeed the idol of her mother and more nearly resembled her in disposition and manners than the others

jane an invalid daughter the eldest of those at home was reclining on a sofa apparently uninterested

keep her said jack shes real handsome and bright and not very black either

 yes rejoined mary  thats just like you jack she ll be of no use at all these three years right under foot all the time

 poh  miss mary if she should stay it would nt be two days before you would be telling the girls about our nig our nig  retorted jack

 i do nt want a nigger round me do you mother   asked mary

 i do nt mind the nigger in the child i should like a dozen better than one replied her mother  if i could make her do my work in a few years i would keep her i have so much trouble with girls i hire i am almost persuaded if i have one to train up in my way from a child i shall be able to keep them awhile i am tired of changing every few months

 where could she sleep   asked mary  i do nt want her near me

 in the l chamber answered the mother

 how ll she get there   asked jack shell be afraid to go through that dark passage and she cant climb the ladder safely

 she ll have to go there  its good enough for a nigger was the reply

jack was sent on horseback to ascertain if mag was at her home he returned with the testimony of pete greene that they were fairly departed and that the child was intentionally thrust upon their family

the imposition was not at all relished by mrs

b or the pert haughty mary who had just glided into her teens

 show the child to bed jack said his mother

 you seem most pleased with the little nigger so yqu may introduce her to her room

he went to the kitchen and taking frado gently by the hand told her he would put her in bed now perhaps her mother would come the next night after her

it was not yet quite dark so they ascended the stairs without any light passing through nicely furnished rooms which were a source of great amazement to the child he opened the door which connected with her room by a dark unfinished passageway dont bump your head said jack and stepped before to open the door leading into her apartmentâ an unfinished chamber over the kitchen the roof slanting nearly to the floor so that the bed could stand only in the middle of the room a small half window furnished light and air jack returned to the sitting room with the remark that the child would soon outgrow those quarters

when she does shell outgrow the house

remarked the mother

 what can she do to help you   asked mary

 she came just in the right time did nt she

just the very day after bridget left continued she

ill see what she can do in the morning

was the answer

while this conversation was passing below frado lay revolving in her little mind whether she would remain or not until her mothers return she was of wilful determined nature a stranger to fear and would not hesitate to wander away should she decide to she remembered the conversation of her mother with seth the words  given away  which she heard used in reference to herself and though she did not know their full import she thought she should by remaining be in some relation to white people she was never favored with before so she resolved to tarry with the hope that mother would come and get her some time the hot sun had penetrated her room and it was long before a cooling breeze reduced the temperature so that she could sleep

frado was called early in the morning by her new mistress her first work was to feed the hens she was shown how it was always to be done and in no other way any departure from this rule to be punished by a whipping she was then accompanied by jack to drive the cows to pasture so she might learn the way upon her return she was allowed to eat her breakfast consisting of a bowl of skimmed milk with brown bread crusts which she was told to eat standing by the kitchen table and must not be over ten minutes about it meanwhile the family were taking their morning meal in the diningroom this over she was placed on a cricket to wash the common dishes she was to be in waiting always to bring wood and chips to run hither and thither from room to room

a large amount of dishwashing for small hands followed dinner then the same after tea and going after the cows finished her first days work it was a new discipline to the child she found some attractions about the place and she retired to rest at night more willing to remain

the same routine followed day after day with slight variation adding a little more work and spicing the toil with words that burn and frequent blows on her head these were great annoyances to frado and had she known where her mother was she would have gone at once to her she was often greatly wearied and silently wept over her sad fate at first she wept aloud which mrs bellmont noticed by applying a rawhide always at hand in the kitchen it was a symptom of discontent and complaining which must be  nipped in the bud she said

thus passed a year no intelligence of mag

it was now certain frado was to become a permanent member of the family her labors were multiplied she was quite indispensable although but seven years old she had never learned to read never heard of a school until her residence in the family

mrs bellmont was in doubt about the utility of attempting to educate people of color who were incapable of elevation this subject occasioned a lengthy discussion in the family mr

bellmont jane and jack arguing for frados education mary and her mother objecting at last mr bellmont declared decisively that she should go to school he was a man who seldom decided controversies at home the word once spoken admitted of no appeal so notwithstanding marys objection that she would have to attend the same school she did the word became law

it was to be a new scene to frado and jack had many queries and conjectures to answer

he was himself too far advanced to attend the summer school which frado regretted having had too many opportunities of witnessing miss marys temper to feel safe in her company alone

the opening day of school came frado sauntered on far in the rear of mary who was ashamed to be seen  walking with a nigger

as soon as she appeared with scanty clothing and bared feet the children assembled noisily published her approach see that nigger

shouted one  look  look  cried another

i wont play with her said one little girl

 nor i neither replied another

mary evidently relished these sharp attacks and saw a fair prospect of lowering nig where according to her views she belonged poor frado chagrined and grieved felt that her anticipations of pleasure at such a place were far from being realized she was just deciding to return home and never come there again when the teacher appeared and observing the downcast looks of the child took her by the hand and led her into the schoolroom all followed and after the bustle of securing seats was over miss marsh inquired if the children knew  any cause for the sorrow of that little girl   pointing to frado it was soon all told

she then reminded them of their duties to the poor and friendless their cowardice in attacking a young innocent child referred them to one who looks not on outward appearances but on the heart she looks like a good girl i think i shall love her so lay aside all prejudice and vie with each other in shewing kindness and goodwill to one who seems different from you were the closing remarks of the kind lady

those kind words the most agreeable sound which ever meets the ear of sorrowing grieving childhood

example rendered her words efficacious day by day there was a manifest change of deportment towards nig her speeches often drew merriment from the children no one could do more to enliven their favorite pastimes than frado mary could not endure to see her thus noticed yet knew not how to prevent it she could not influence her schoolmates as she wished she had not gained their affections by winning ways and yielding points of controversy on the contrary she was selfwilled domineering every day reported mad by some of her companions she availed herself of the only alternative abuse and taunts as they returned from school this was not satisfactory she wanted to use physical force to subdue her to keep her down

there was on their way home a field intersected by a stream over which a single plank was placed for a crossing it occurred to mary that it would be a punishment to nig to compel her to cross over so she dragged her to the edge and told her authoritatively to go over nig hesitated resisted mary placed herself behind the child and in the struggle to force her over lost her footing and plunged into the stream some of the larger scholars being in sight ran and thus prevented mary from drowning and frado from falling nig scampered home fast as possible and mary went to the nearest house dripping to procure a change of garments she came loitering home half crying exclaiming nig pushed me into the stream  she then related the particulars

nig was called from the kitchen mary stood with anger flashing in her eyes mr bellmont sat quietly reading his paper he had witnessed too many of miss marys outbreaks to be startled mrs bellmont interrogated nig

 i did nt do it i did nt do it  answered nig passionately and then related the occurrence truthfully

the discrepancy greatly enraged mrs bellmont with loud accusations and angry gestures she approached the child turning to her husband she asked will you sit still there and hear that black nigger call mary a liar

 how do we know but she has told the truth i shall not punish her he replied and left the house as he usually did when a tempest threatened to envelop him

no sooner was he out of sight than mrs b

and mary commenced beating her inhumanly then propping her mouth open with a piece of wood shut her up in a dark room without any supper for employment while the tempest raged within mr bellmont went for the cows a task belonging to frado and thus unintentionally prolonged her pain at dark jack came in and seeing mary accosted her with  so you thought youd vent your spite on nig did you why cant you let her alone it was good enough for you to get a ducking only you did not stay in half long enough

stop said his mother you shall never talk so before me you would have that little nigger trample on mary would you she came home with a lie it made marys story false

what was marys story asked jack

it was related

now said jack sallying into a chair  the schoolchildren happened to see it all and they tell the same story nig does which is most likely to be true what a dozen agree they saw or the contrary

it is very strange you will believe what others say against your sister retorted his mother with flashing eye i think it is time your father subdued you

father is a sensible man argued jack

he would not wrong a dog where is frado   he continued

 mother gave her a good whipping and shut her up replied mary

just then mr bellmont entered and asked if frado was  shut up yet

the knowledge of her innocence the perfidy of his sister worked fearfully on jack he bounded from his chair searched every room till he found the child her mouth wedged apart her face swollen and full of pain

how jack pitied her he relieved her jaws brought her some supper took her to her room comforted her as well as he knew how sat by her till she fell asleep and then left for the sitting room as he passed his mother he remarked  if that was the way frado was to be treated he hoped she would never wake again  he then imparted her situation to his father who seemed untouched till a glance at jack exposed a tearful eye jack went early to her next morning

she awoke sad but refreshed after breakfast jack took her with him to the field and kept her through the day but it could not be so generally she must return to school to her household duties he resolved to do what he could to protect her from mary and his mother

he bought her a dog which became a great favorite with both the invalid jane would gladly befriend her but she had not the strength to brave the iron will of her mother

kind words and affectionate glances were the only expressions of sympathy she could safely indulge in the men employed on the farm were always glad to hear her prattle she was a great favorite with them mrs bellmont allowed them the privilege of talking with her in the kitchen she did not fear but she should have ample opportunity of subduing her when they were away three months of schooling summer and winter she enjoyed for three years

her winter overdress was a castoff overcoat once worn by jack and a sunbonnet it was a source of great merriment to the scholars but nigs retorts were so mirthful and their satisfaction so evident in attributing the selection to  old granny bellmont that it was not painful to nig or pleasurable to mary her jollity was not to be quenched by whipping or scolding

in mrs bellmonts presence she was under restraint but in the kitchen and among her schoolmates the pent up fires burst forth she was ever at some sly prank when unseen by her teacher in school hours not unfrequently some outburst of merriment of which she was the original was charged upon some innocent mate and punishment inflicted which she merited

they enjoyed her antics so fully that any of them would suffer wrongfully to keep open the avenues of mirth she would venture far beyond propriety thus shielded and countenanced

the teachers desk was supplied with drawers in which were stored his books and other et ceteras of the profession the children observed nig very busy there one morning before school as they flitted in occasionally from their play outside the master came called the children to order opened a drawer to take the book the occasion required when out poured a volume of smoke  fire  fire  screamed he at the top of his voice by this time he had become sufficiently acquainted with the peculiar odor to know he was imposed upon the scholars shouted with laughter to see the terror of the dupe who feeling abashed at the needless fright made no very strict investigation and nig once more escaped punishment she had provided herself with cigars and puffing puffing away at the crack of the drawer had filled it with smoke and then closed it tightly to deceive the teacher and amuse the scholars the interim of terms was filled up with a variety of duties new and peculiar at home no matter how powerful the heat when sent to rake hay or guard the grazing herd she was never permitted to shield her skin from the sun she was not many shades darker than mary now what a calamity it would be ever to hear the contrast spoken of

mrs bellmont was determined the sun should have full power to darken the shade which nature had first bestowed upon her as best befitting

a friend for nig

 hours of my youth  when nurtured in my breast to love a stranger friendship made me blest â friendship the dear peculiar bond of youth when every artless bosom throbs with truth untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign and check each impulse with prudential reign when all we feel our honest souls discloseâ in love to friends in open hate to foes no varnished tales the lips of youth repeat no dearbought knowledge purchased by deceit

byron

with what differing emotions have the denizens of earth awaited the approach of today

some sufferer has counted the vibrations of the pendulum impatient for its dawn who now that it has arrived is anxious for its close the votary of pleasure conscious of yesterdays void wishes for power to arrest times haste till a few more hours of mirth shall be enjoyed the unfortunate are yet gazing in vain for goldenedged clouds they fancied would appear in their horizon the good man feels that he has accomplished too little for the master and sighs that another day must so soon close innocent childhood weary of its stay longs for another morrow  busy manhood cries hold hold and pursues it to anothers dawn all are dissatisfied

all crave some good not yet possessed which time is expected to bring with all its morrows

was it strange that to a disconsolate child three years should seem a long long time 

during school time she had rest from mrs bellmonts tyranny she was now nine years old time her mistress said such privileges should cease

she could now read and spell and knew the elementary steps in grammar arithmetic and writing her education completed as she said mrs

bellmont felt that her time and person belonged solely to her she was under her in every sense of the word what an opportunity to indulge her vixen nature  no matter what occurred to ruffle her or from what source provocation came real or fancied a few blows on nig seemed to relieve her of a portion of illwill these were days when fido was the entire confidant of frado she told him her griefs as though he were human and he sat so still and listened so attentively she really believed he knew her sorrows all the leisure moments she oould gain were used in teaching him some feat of dogagility so that jack pronounced him very knowing and was truly gratified to know he had furnished her with a gift answering his intentions

fido was the constant attendant of frado when sent from the house on errands going and returning with the cows out in the fields to the village if ever she forgot her hardships it was in his company

spring was now retiring james one of the absent sons was expected home on a visit he had never seen the last acquisition to the family

jack had written faithfully of all the merits of his colored protege and hinted plainly that mother did not always treat her just right

many were the preparations to make the visit pleasant and as the day approached when he was to arrive great exertions were made to cook the favorite viands to prepare the choicest tablefare

the morning of the arrival day was a busy one frado knew not who would be of so much importance j her feet were speeding hither and thither so unsparingly mrs bellmont seemed a trifle fatigued and her shoes which had early in the morning a methodic squeak altered to an irregular peevish snap

 get some little wood to make the fire bum

said mrs bellmont in a sharp tone frado obeyed bringing the smallest she could find

mrs bellmont approached her and giving her a box on her ear reiterated the command

the first the child brought was the smallest to be found of course the second must be a trifle larger she well knew it was as she threw it into a box on the hearth to mrs bellmont it was a greater affront as well as larger wood so she  taught her with the rawhide and sent her the third time for  little wood

nig weeping knew not what to do she had carried the smallest none left would suit her mistress of course further punishment awaited her so she gathered up whatever came first and threw it down on the hearth as she expected mrs bellmont enraged approached her and kicked her so forcibly as to throw her upon the floor before she could rise another foiled the attempt and then followed kick after kick in quick succession and power till she reached the door mr bellmont and anut abby hearing the noise rushed in just in time to see the last of the performance nig jumped up and rushed from the house out of sight aunt abby returned to her apartment followed by john who was muttering to himself

what were you saying asked aunt abby

 i said i hoped the child never would come into the house again

 what would become of her  you cannot mean that continued his sister

 i do mean it the child does as much work as a woman ought to and just see how she is kicked about 

why do you have it so john asked his sister

 how am i to help it  women rule the earth and all in it

 i think i should rule my own house johnâ and live in hell meantime added mr

bellmont

john now sauntered out to the bam to await the quieting of the storm

aunt abby had a glimpse of nig as she passed out of the yard but to arrest her or shew her that she would shelter her in mrs

bellmonts presence would only bring reserved wrath on her defenceless head her sisterinlaw had great prejudices against her one cause of the alienation was that she did not give her right in the homestead to john and leave it forever another was that she was a professor of religion so was mrs bellmont but nab as she called her did not live according to her profession another that she would sometimes give nig cake and pie which she was never allowed to have at home mary had often noticed and spoken of her inconsistencies

the dinner hour passed frado had not appeared mrs b made no inquiry or search

aunt abby looked long and found her concealed in an outbuilding come into the house with me implored aunt abby

i aint going in any more sobbed the child

 what will you do   asked aunt abby

 ive got to stay out here and die i ha nt got no mother no home i wish i was dead

poor thing muttered aunt abby and slyly providing her with some dinner left her to her grief

jane went to confer with her aunt about the affair and learned from her the retreat she would gladly have concealed her in her own chamber and ministered to her wants but she was dependent on mary and her mother for care and any displeasure caused by attention to nig was seriously felt

toward night the coach brought james a time of general greeting inquiries for absent members of the family a visit to aunt abby room undoing a few delicacies for jane brought them to the tea hour

 wheres frado   asked mr bellmont observing she was not in her usual place behind her mistress chair

i dont know and i dont care if she makes her appearance again i ll take the skin from her body replied his wife

james a fine looking young man with a pleasant countenance placid and yet decidedly serious yet not stem looked up confounded

he was no stranger to his mothers nature but years of absence had erased the occurrences once so familiar and he asked is this that pretty little nig jack writes to me about that you are so severe upon mother  

ill not leave much of her beauty to be seen if she comes in sight and now john

said mrs b turning to her husband  you need not think you are going to learn her to treat me in this way just see how saucy she was this morning she shall learn her place

mr bellmont raised his calm determined eye full upon her and said in a decisive manner  you shall not strike or scald or skin her as you call it if she comes back again remember l

and he brought his hand down upon the table

 i have searched an hour for her now and she is not to be found on the premises do you know where she is  is she your prisoner  

 no  i have just told you i did not know where she was nab has her hid somewhere i suppose oh dear i did not think it would come to this that my own husband would treat me so then came fast flowing tears which no one but mary seemed to notice jane crept into aunt abbys room mr bellmont and james went out of doors and mary remained to condole with her parent

do you know where frado is asked jane of her aunt

no she replied i have hunted everywhere she has left her first hidingplace i cannot think what has become of her there comes jack and fido perhaps he knows and she walked to a window near where james and his father were conversing together

the two brothers exchanged a hearty greeting and then mr bellmont told jack to eat his supper afterward he wished to send him away

he immediately went in accustomed to all the phases of indoor storms from a whine to thunder and lightning he saw at a glance marks of disturbance he had been absent through the day with the hired men

whats the fuss asked he rushing into aunt abbys

 eat your supper said jane  go home jack

back again through the diningroom and out to his father

u whats the fuss   again inquired he of his father

 eat your supper jack and see if you can find erado shes not been seen since morning and then she was kicked out of the house

 i shant eat my supper till i find her said jack indignantly come james and see the little creature mother treats so

they started calling searching coaxing all their way along no frado they returned to the house to consult james and jack declared they would not sleep till she was found

mrs bellmont attempted to dissuade them from the search it was a shame a little nigger should make so much trouble

just then fido came running up and jack exclaimed fido knows where she is i ll bet

 so i believe said his father  but we shall not be wiser unless we can outwit him he will not do what his mistress forbids him

i know how to fix him said jack taking a plate from the table which was still waiting he called  fido fido frado wants some supper come   jack started the dog followed and soon capered on before far far into the fields over walls and through fences into a piece of swampy land jack followed close and soon appeared to james who was quite in the rear coaxing and forcing frado along with him

a frail child driven from shelter by the cruelty of his mother was an object of interest to james they persuaded her to go home with them warmed her by the kitchen fire gave her a good supper and took her with them into the sittingroom

 take that nigger out of my sight was mrs

bellmonts command before they could be seated

james led her into aunt abbs where he knew they were welcome they chatted awhile until frado seemed cheerful then james led her to her room and waited until she retired

are you glad ive come home asked james

yes if you wont let me be whipped tomorrow

you wont be whipped you must try to be a good girl counselled james

 if i do i get whipped  sobbed the child

 they wont believe what i say oh i wish i had my mother back then i should not be kicked and whipped so who made me so  

 god  answered james

 did god make you  

yes

 who made aunt abby  

god

 who made your mother  

god

did the same god that made her make me

yes

 well then i dont like him

why not

 because he made her white and me black

why didnt he make us both white  

i dont know try to go to sleep and you will feel better in the morning was all the reply he could make to her knotty queries it was a long time before she fell asleep and a number of days before james felt in a mood to visit and entertain old associates and friends

departures

life is a strange avenue of various trees and flowers lightsome at commencement but darkening to its end in a distant massy portal

it beginneth as a little path edged with the violet and primrose a little path of lawny grass and soft to tiny feet

soon spring thistles in the way

tupper

james visit concluded frado had become greatly attached to him and with sorrow she listened and joined in the farewells which preceded his exit the remembrance of his kindness cheered her through many a weary month and an occasional word to her in letters to jack were like  cold waters to a thirsty soul intelligence came that james would soon marry frado hoped he would and remove her from such severe treatment as she was subject to

there had been additional burdens laid on her since his return she must now milk the cows she had then only to drive flocks of sheep had been added to the farm which daily claimed a portion of her time in the absence of the men she must harness the horse for mary and her mother to ride go to mill in short do the work of a boy could one be procured to endure the tirades of mrs bellmont she was first up jn the morning doing what she could towards breakfast occasionally she would utter some funny thing for jacks benefit while she was waiting on the table provoking a sharp look from his mother or expulsion from the room

on one such occasion they found her on the roof of the barn some repairs having been necessary a staging had been erected and was not wholly removed availing herself of ladders she was mounted in high glee on the topmost board mr bellmont called sternly for her to come down poor jane nearly fainted from fear mrs b and mary did not care if she  broke her neck while jack and the men laughed at her fearlessness strange one spark of playfulness could remain amid such constant toil but her natural temperament was in a high degree mirthful and the encouragement she received from jack and the hired men constantly nurtured the inclination when she had none of the family around to be merry with she would amuse herself with the animals

among the sheep was a willful leader who always persisted in being first served and many times in his fury he had thrown down nig till provoked she resolved to punish him the pasture in which the sheep grazed was bounded on three sides by a wide stream which flowed on one side at the base of precipitous banks the first spare moments at her command she ran to the pasture with a dish in her hand and mounting the highest point of land nearest the stream called the flock to their mock repast mr bellmont with his laborers were in sight though unseen by frado they paused to see what she was about to do should she by any mishap lose her footing she must roll into the stream and without aid must drown they thought of shouting  but they feared an unexpected salute might startle her and thus ensure what they were anxious to prevent they watched in breathless silence the willful sheep came furiously leaping and bounding far in advance of the flock just as he leaped for the dish she suddenly jumped one side when down he rolled into the river and swimming across remained alone till night the men lay down convulsed with laughter at the trick and guessed at once its object mr bellmont talked seriously to the child for exposing herself to such danger but she hopped about on her toes and with laughable grimaces replied she knew she was quick enough to  give him a slide

but to return james married a baltimorean lady of wealthy parentage an indispensable requisite his mother had always taught him

he did not marry her wealth though he loved her sincerely she was not unlike his sister jane who had a social gentle loving nature rather too yielding her brother thought his susan had a firmness which jane needed to complete her character but which her ill health may in a measure have failed to produce although an invalid she was not excluded from society was it strange she should seem a desirable companion a treasure as a wife 

two young men seemed desirous of possessing her one was a neighbor henry beed a tall spare young man with sandy hair and blue sinister eyes he seemed to appreciate her wants and watch with interest her improvement or decay his kindness she received and by it was almost won her mother wished her to encourage his attentions she had counted the acres which were to be transmitted to an only son she knew there was silver in the purse she would not have jane too sentimental

the eagerness with which he amassed wealth was repulsive to jane he did not spare his person or beasts in its pursuit she felt that to such a man she should be considered an incumbrance  she doubted if he would desire her if he did not know she would bring a handsome patrimony her mother full in favor with the parents of henry commanded her to accept him she engaged herself yielding to her mothers wishes because she had not strength to oppose them and sometimes when witness of her mothers and marys tyranny she felt any change would be preferable even such a one as this she knew her husband should be the man of her own selecting one she was conscious of preferring before all others she could not say this of henry

in this dilemma a visitor came to aunt abbys one of her boyfavorites george means from an adjoining state sensible plain looking agreeable talented he could not long be a stranger to any one who wished to know him

jane was accustomed to sit much with aunt abby always her presence now seemed necessary to assist in entertaining this youthful friend

jane was more pleased with him each day and silently wished henry possessed more refinement and the polished manners of george she felt dissatisfied with her relation to him his calls while george was there brought their opposing qualities vividly before her and she found it disagreeable to force herself into those attentions belonging to him she received him apparently only as a neighbor

george returned home and jane endeavored to stifle the risings of dissatisfaction and had nearly succeeded when a letter came which needed but one glance to assure her of its birthplace and she retired for its perusal well was it for her that her mothers suspicion was not aroused or her curiosity startled to inquire who it came from after reading it she glided into aunt abbys and placed it in her hands who was no stranger to janes trials

george could not rest after his return he wrote until he had communicated to jane the emotions her presence awakened and his desire to love and possess her as his own he begged to know if his affections were reciprocated or could be if she would permit him to write to her if she was free from all obligation to another

 what would mother say   queried jane as she received the letter from her aunt

 not much to comfort you

 now aunt george is just such a man as i could really love i think from all i have seen of him you know i never could say that of henry  â then dont marry him interrupted aunt abby

 mother will make me

 your father wo nt

well aunt what can i do would you answer the letter or not  

 yes answer it tell him your situation

 i shall not tell him all my feelings

jane answered that she had enjoyed his company much she had seen nothing offensive in his manner or appearance that she was under no obligations which forbade her receiving letters from him as a friend and acquaintance

george was puzzled by the reply he wrote to aunt abby and from her learned all he could not see jane thus sacrificed without making an effort to rescue her another visit followed george heard jane say she preferred him he then conferred with henry at his home it was not a pleasant subject to talk upon to be thus supplanted was not to be thought of he would sacrifice everything but his inheritance to secure his betrothed

 and so you are the cause of her late coldness towards me leave  i will talk no more about it the business is settled between us there it will remain said henry

 have you no wish to know the real state of janes affections towards you   asked george

 no  go i say go   and henry opened the door for him to pass out he retired to aunt abbys henry soon followed and presented his cause to mrs bellmont

provoked surprised indignant she summoned jane to her presence and after a lengthy tirade upon nab and her satanic influence told her she could not break the bonds which held her to henry she should not george means was rightly named he was truly mean enough she knew his family of old his father had four wives and five times as many children

 go to your room miss jane she continued

 do nt let me know of your being in nabs for one while

the storm was now visible to all beholders

mr bellmont sought jane she told him her objections to henry showed him georges letter told her answer the occasion of his visit he bade her not make herself sick he would see that she was not compelled to violate her free choice in so important a transaction he then sought the two young men told them he could not as a father see his child compelled to an uncongenial union a free voluntary choice was of such importance to one of her health she must be left free to her own choice

jane sent henry a letter of dismission he her one of a legal bearing in which he balanced his disappointment by a few hundreds

to brave her mothers fury nearly overcame her but the consolations of a kind father and aunt cheered her on after a suitable interval she was married to george and removed to his home in vermont thus another light disappeared from nigs horizon another was soon to follow jack was anxious to try his skill in providing for his own support so a situation as clerk in a store was procured in a western city and six months after janes departure was nig abandoned to the tender mercies of mary and her mother as if to remove the last vestige of earthly joy mrs bellmont sold the companion and pet of frado the dog fido

 hard are lifes early steps and but that youth is buoyant confident and strong in hope men would behold its threshold and despair

the sorrow of frado was very great for her pet and mr bellmont by great exertion obtained it again much to the relief of the child to be thus deprived of all her sources of pleasure was a sure way to exalt their worth and fido became in her estimation a more yaluable presence than the human beings who surrounded her

james had now been married a number of years and frequent requests for a visit from the family were at last accepted and mrs bellmont made great preparations for a fall sojourn in baltimore mary was installed housekeper â in name merely for nig was the only moving power in the house although suffering from their joint severity she felt safer than to be thrown wholly upon an ardent passionate unrestrained young lady whom she always hated and felt it hard to be obliged to obey the trial she must meet

were jack or jane at home she would have some refuge one only remained j good aunt abby was still in the house

she saw the fast receding coach which conveyed her master and mistress with regret and begged for one favor only that james would send for her when they returned a hope she had confidently cherished all these five years

she was now able to do all the washing ironing baking and the common et cetera of household duties though but fourteen mary left all for her to do though she affected great responsibility she would show herself in the kitchen long enough to relieve herself of some command better withheld or insist upon some compliance to her wishes in some department which she was very imperfectly acquainted with very much less than the person she was addressing and so impetuous till her orders were obeyed that to escape the turmoil nig would often go contrary to her own knowledge to gain a respite

nig was taken sick what could be done the work certainly but not by miss mary so nig would work while she could remain erect then sink down upon the floor or a chair till she could rally for a fresh effort mary would look in upon her chide her for her laziness threaten to tell mother when she came home and so forth

nig screamed mary one of her sickest days  come here and sweep these threads from the carpet she attempted to drag her weary limbs along using the broom as support impatient of delay she called again but with a different request  bring me some wood you lazy jade quick nig rested the broom against the wall and started on the fresh behest too long gone flushed with anger she rose and greeted her with  what are you gone so long for  bring it in quick i say

 i am coming as quick as i can she replied entering the door

 saucy impudent nigger you is this the way you answer me   and taking a large carving knife from the table she hurled it in her rage at the defenceless girl

dodging quickly it fastened in the ceiling a few inches from where she stood there rushed on marys mental vision a picture of bloodshed in which she was the perpetrator and the sad consequences of what was so nearly an actual occurrence

 tell anybody of this if you dare if you tell aunt abby ill certainly kill you said she terrified she returned to her room brushed her threads herself was for a day or two more guarded and so escaped deserved and merited penalty

oh how long the weeks seemed which held nig in subjection to mary but they passed like all earths sorrows and joys mr and mrs b

returned delighted with their visit and laden with rich presents for mary no word of hope for nig james was quite unwell and would come home the next spring for a visit

this thought nig will be my time of release

i shall go back with him

from early dawn until after all were retired was she toiling overworked disheartened longing for relief r exposure from heat to cold or the reverse often destroyed her health for short intervals

she wore no shoes until after frost and snow even appeared and bared her feet again before the last vestige of winter disappeared these sudden changes she was so illy guarded against nearly conquered her physical system any word of complaint was severely repulsed or cruelly punished

she was told she had much more than she deserved so that manual labor was not in reality her only burden  but such an incessant torrent of scolding and boxing and threatening was enough to deter one of maturer years from remaining within sound of the strife

it is impossible to give an impression of the manifest enjoyment of mrs b in these kitchen scenes it was her favorite exercise to enter the appartment noisily vociferate orders give a few sudden blows to quicken nigs pace then return to the sitting room with such a satisfied expression congratulating herself upon her thorough housekeeping qualities

she usually rose in the morning at the ringing of the bell for breakfast if she were heard stirring before that time nig knew well there was an extra amount of scolding to be borne

no one now stood between herself and frado but aunt abby and if she dared to interfere in the least she was ordered back to her  own quarters nig would creep slyly into her room learn what she could of her regarding the absent and thus gain some light in the thick gloom of care and toil and sorrow in which she was immersed

the first of spring a letter came from james announcing declining health he must try northern air as a restorative so frado joyfully prepared for this agreeable increase of the family this addition to her cares

he arrived feeble lame from his disease so changed frado wept at his appearance fearing he would be removed from her forever he kindly greeted her took her to the parlor to see his wife and child and said many things to kindle smiles on her sad face

frado felt so happy in his presence so safe from maltreatment he was to her a shelter

he observed silently the ways of the house a few days nig still took her meals in the same manner as formerly having the same allowance of food he one day bade her not remove the food but sit down to the table and eat

 she will mother said he calmly but imperatively  im determined she works hard ive watched her now wrhile i stay she is going to sit down here and eat such food as we eat

a few sparks from the mothers black eyes were the only reply she feared to oppose where she knew she could not prevail so nigs standing attitude and selected diet vanished

her clothing was yet poor and scanty she was not blessed with a sunday attire  for she was never permitted to attend church with her mistress  religion was not meant for niggers she said when the husband and brothers were absent she would drive mrs b and mary there then return and go for them at the close of the service but never remain aunt abby would take her to evening meetings held in the neighborhood which mrs b never attended and impart to her lessons of truth and grace as they walked to the place of prayer

many of less piety would scorn to present so doleful a figure  mrs b had shaved her glossy ringlets and in her coarse cloth gown and ancient bonnet she was anything but an enticing object but aunt abby looked within she saw a soul to save an immortality of happiness to secure

these evenings were eagerly anticipated by nig it was such a pleasant release from labor

such perfect contrast in the melody and prayers of these good people to the harsh tones which fell on her ears during the day

soon she had all their sacred songs at command and enlivened her toil by accompanying it with this melody

james encouraged his aunt in her efforts he had found the saviour he wished to have frados desolate heart gladdened quieted sustained by ms presence he felt sure there were elements in her heart which transformed and purified by the gospel would make her worthy the esteem and friendship of the world a kind affectionate heart native wit and common sense and the pertness she sometimes exhibited he felt if restrained properly might become useful in originating a selfreliance which would be of service to her in after years

yet it was not possible to compass all this while she remained where she was he wished to he cautious about pressing too closely her claims on his mother as it would increase the burdened one he so anxiously wished to relieve

he cheered her on with the hope of returning with his family when he recovered sufficiently

nig seemed awakened to new hopes and aspirations and realized a longing for the future hitherto unknown

to complete nigs enjoyment jack arrived unexpectedly his greeting was as hearty to herself as to any of the family

 where are your curls fra asked jack after the usual salutation

u your mother cut them oft

 thought you were getting handsome did she  same old story is it knocks and bumps 

better times coming never fear nig

how different this appellative sounded from him  he said it in such a tone with such a rogueish look

she laughed and replied that he had better take her west for a housekeeper

jack was pleased with jamess innovations of table discipline and would often tarry in the diningroom to see nig in her new place at the family table as he was thus sitting one day after the family had finished dinner frado seated herself in her mistress chair and was just reaching for a clean dessert plate which was on the table when her mistress entered

 put that plate down you shall not have a clean one eat from mine continued she nig hesitated to eat after james his wife or jack would have been pleasant but to be commanded to do what was disagreeable by her mistress because it was disagreeable was trying quickly looking about she took the plate called fido to wash it which he did to the best of his ability then wiping her knife and fork on the cloth she proceeded to eat her dinner

nig never looked toward her mistress during the procesa she had jack near she did not fear her now

insulted full of rage mrs bellmont rushed to her husband and commanded him to notice this insult to whip that child if he would not do it james ought

james came to hear the kitchen version of the affair jack was boiling over with laughter he related all the circumstances to james and pulling a bright silver halfdollar from his pocket he threw it at nig saying  there take that t was worth paying for

james sought his mother told her he  would not excuse or palliate nigs impudence  but she should not be whipped or be punished at all

you have not treated her mother so as to gain her love she is only exhibiting your remissness in this matter

she only smothered her resentment until a convenient opportunity offered the first time she was left alone with nig she gave her a thorough beating to bring up arrearages and threatened if she ever exposed her to james she would a cut her tongue out

james found her upon his return sobbing but fearful of revenge she dared not answer his queries he guessed their cause and longed for returning health to take her under his protection

 what are our joys but dreams  and what our hopes but goodly shadows in the summer cloud  

h k w

james did not improve as was hoped month after month passed away and brought no prospect of returning health he could not walk far from the house for want of strength but he loved to sit with aunt abby in her quiet room talking of unseen glories and heartexperiences while planning for the spiritual benefit of those around them in these confidential interviews frado was never omitted they would discuss the prevalent opinion of the public that people of color are really inferior incapable of cultivation and refinement they would glance at the qualities of nig which promised so much if rightly directed  i wish you would take her james when you are well home with you  said aunt abby in one of these seasons

just what i am longing to do aunt abby

susan is just of my mind and we intend to take her i have been wishing to do so for years

u she seems much affected by what she hears at the evening meetings and asks me many questions on serious things seems to love to read the bible i feel hopes of her

i hope she is thoughtful no one has a kinder heart one capable of loving more devotedly

but to think how prejudiced the world are towards her people that she must be reared in such ignorance as to drown all the finer feelings

when i think of what she might be of what she will be i feel like grasping time till opinions change and thousands like her rise into a noble freedom i have seen frados grief because she is black amount to agony it makes me sick to recall these scenes mother pretends to think she dont know enough to sorrow for anything but if she could see her as i have when she supposed herself entirely alone except her little dog fido lamenting her loneliness and complexion i think if she is not past feeling she would retract

in the summer i was walking near the barn and as i stood i heard sobs oh oh i heard

why was i made  why cant i die  oh what have i to live for  no one cares for me only to get my work and i feel sick who cares for that  work as long as i can stand and then fall down and lay there till i can get up no mother father brother or sister to care for me and then it is you lazy nigger lazy nigger â all because i am black oh if i could die   i stepped into the bam where i could see her she was crouched down by the hay with her faithful friend fido and as she ceased speaking buried her face in her hands and cried bib terly then patting fido she kissed him saying  you love me fido dont you  but we must go work in the field she started on her mission i called her to me and told her she need not go the hay was doing well

she has such confidence in me that she will do just as i tell her so we found a seat under a shady tree and there i took the opportunity to combat the notions she seemed to entertain respecting the loneliness of her condition and want of sympathizing friends i assured her that mothers views were by no means general that in our part of the country there were thousands upon thousands who favored the elevation of her race disapproving of oppression in all its forms that she was not unpitied friendless and utterly despised that she might hope for better things in the future having spoken these words of comfort i rose with the resolution that if i recovered my health i would take her home with me whether mother was willing or not

 i do nt know what your mother would do without her still i wish she was away

susan now came for her long absent husband and they returned home to their room

the month of november was one of great anxiety on jamess account he was rapidly wasting away

a celebrated physician was called and performed a surgical operation as a last means

should this fail there was no hope of course he was confined wholly to his room mostly to his bed with all his bodily suffering all his anxiety for his family whom he might not live to protect he did not forget frado he shielded her from many beatings and every day imparted religious instructions no one but his wife could move him so easily as frado so that in addition to her daily toil she was often deprived of her rest at night

yet she insisted on being called she wished to show her love for one who had been such a friend to her her anxiety and grief increased as the probabilities of his recovery became doubtful

mrs bellmont found her weeping on his account shut her up and whipped her with the rawhide adding an injunction never to be seen snivelling again because she had a little work to do she was very careful never to shed tears on his account in her presence afterwards

â  other cares engross me and my tired soul with emulative haste looks to its god 

the brother associated with james in business in baltimore was sent for to confer with one who might never be able to see him there

james began to speak of life as closing of heaven as of a place in immediate prospect of aspirations which waited for fruition in glory

his brother lewis by name was an especial favorite of sister mary more like her in disposition and preferences than james or jack

he arrived as soon as possible after the request and saw with regret the sure indications of fatality in his sick brother and listened to his admonitions â admonitions to a christian life â with tears and uttered some promises of attention to the subject so dear to the heart of james

how gladly he would have extended healing aid but alas it was not in his power so after listening to his wishes and arrangements for his family and business he decided to return home

anxious for company home he persuaded his father and mother to permit mary to attend him

she was not at all needed in the sick room she did not choose to be useful in the kitchen and then she was fully determined to go

so all the trunks were assembled and crammed with the best selections from the wardrobe of herself and mother where the lastmentioned articles could be appropriated

nig was never so helpful before mary remarked and wondered what had induced such a change in place of former sullenness

nig was looking further than the present and congratulating herself upon some days of peace for mary never lost opportunity of informing her mother of nigs delinquincies were she otherwise ignorant

was it strange if she were officious with such relief in prospect 

the parting from the sick brother was tearful and sad james prayed in their presence for their renewal in holiness and urged their immediate attention to eternal realities and gained a promise that susan and charlie should share their kindest regards

no sooner were they on their way than nig slyly crept round to aunt abbys room and tiptoeing and twisting herself into all shapes she exclaimed â  shes gone aunt abby shes gone fairly gone and jumped up and down till aunt abby feared she would attract the notice of her mistress by such demonstrations

 well shes gone gone aunt abby i hope shell never come back again

no no frado thats wrong you would be wishing her dead  that wont do

 well ill bet she ll never come back again somehow i feel as though she would nt

she is jamess sister remonstrated aunt abby

 so is our cross sheep just as much that i ducked in the river id like to try my hand at curing her too

 but you forget what our good minister told us last week about doing good to those that hate us

  did nt i do good aunt abby when i washed and ironed and packed her old duds to get rid of her and helped her pack her trunks and run here and there for her  

well well frado you must go finish your work or your mistress will be after you and remind you severely of miss mary and some others beside

nig went as she was told and her clear voice was heard as she went singing in joyous notes the relief she felt at the removal of one of her tormentors

day by day the quiet of the sick mans room was increased he was helpless and nervous and often wished change of position thereby hoping to gain momentary relief the calls upon frado were consequently more frequent her nights less tranquil her health was impaired by lifting the sick man and by drudgery in the kitchen her ill health she endeavored to conceal from james fearing he might have less repose if there should be a change of attendants and mrs bellmont she well knew would have no sympathy for her she was at last so much reduced as to be unable to stand erect for any great length of time she would sit at the table to wash her dishes if she heard the wellknown step of her mistress she would rise till she returned to her room and then sink down for further rest of course she was longer than usual in completing the services assigned her this was a subject of complaint to mrs

bellmont and frado endeavored to throw off all appearance of sickness in her presence

but it was increasing upon her and she could no longer hide her indisposition her mistress entered one day and finding her seated commanded her to go to work  i am sick replied frado rising and walking slowly to her unfinished task and cannot stand long i feel so bad

angry that she should venture a reply to her command she suddenly inflicted a blow which lay the tottering girl prostrate on the floor excited by so much indulgence of a dangerous passion she seemed left to unrestrained malice and snatching a towel stuffed the mouth of the sufferer and beat her cruelly

frado hoped she would end her misery by whipping her to death she bore it with the hope of a martyr that her misery would soon close though her mouth was muffled and the sounds much stifled there was a sensible commotion which james quick ear detected

 call frado to come here he said faintly   have not seen her today

susan retired with the request to the kitchen where it was evident some brutal scene had just been enacted

mrs bellmont replied that she had some work to do just now when that was done she might come

susans appearance confirmed her husbands fears and he requested his father who sat by the bedside to go for her this was a messenger as james well knew who could not be denied and the girl entered the room sobbing and faint with anguish

james called her to him and inquired the cause of her sorrow she was afraid to expose the cruel author of her misery lest she should provoke new attacks but after much entreaty she told him all much which had escaped his watchful ear poor james shut his eyes in silence as if pained to forgetfulness by the recital then turning to susan he asked her to take charlie and walk out  she needed the fresh air he said  and say to mother i wish frado to sit by me till you return i think you are fading from staying so long in this sick room mr b also left and frado was thus left alone with her friend aunt abby came in to make her daily visit and seeing the sick countenance of the attendant took her hornfc with her to administer some cordial she soon returned however and james kept her with him the rest of the day and a comfortable nights repose following she was enabled to continue as usual her labors james insisted on her attending religious meetings in the vicinity with aunt abby

frado under the instructions of aunt abby and the minister became a believer in a future existence â one of happiness or misery her doubt was is there a heaven for the black she knew there was one for james and aunt abby and all good white people but was there any for blacks  she had listened attentively to all the minister said and all aunt abby had told her but then it was all for white people

as james approached that blessed world she felt a strong desire to follow and be with one who was such a dear kind friend to her

while she was exercised with these desires and aspirations she attended an evening meeting with aunt abby and the good man urged all young or old to accept the offers of mercy to receive a compassionate jesus as their saviour  come to christ he urged  all young or old white or black bond or free come all to christ for pardon  repent believe

this was the message she longed to hear it seemed to be spoken for her but he had told them to repent what was that she asked

she knew she was unfit for any heaven made for whites or blacks she would gladly repent or do anything which would admit her to share the abode of james

her anxiety increased her countenance bore marks of solicitude unseen before and though she said nothing of her inward contest they all observed a change

james and aunt abby hoped it was the springing of good seed sown by the spirit of god her tearful attention at the last meeting encouraged his aunt to hope that her mind was awakened her conscience aroused aunt abby noticed that she was particularly engaged in reading the bible and this strengthened her conviction that a heavenly messenger was striving with her the neighbors dropped in to inquire after the sick and also if frado was  serious   they noticed she seemed very thoughtful and tearful at the meetings mrs reed was very inquisitive but mrs bellmont saw no appearance of change for the better she did not feel responsible for her spiritual culture and hardly believed she had a soul

nig was in truth suffering much her feelings were very intense on any subject when once aroused she read her bible carefully and as often as an opportunity presented which was when entirely secluded in her own apartment or by aunt abbys side who kindly directed her to christ and instructed her in the way of salvation

mrs bellmont found her one day quietly reading her bible amazed and half crediting the reports of officious neighbors she felt it was time to interfere here she was reading and shedding tears over the bible she ordered her to put up the book and go to work and not be snivelling about the house or stop to read again

but there was one little spot seldom penetrar ted by her mistress watchful eye  this was her room uninviting and comfortless but to herself a safe retreat here she would listen to the pleadings of a saviour and try to penetrate the veil of doubt and sin which clouded her soul and long to cast off the fetters of sin and rise to the communion of saints

mrs bellmont as we before said did not trouble herself about the future destiny of her servant if she did what she desired for her benefit it was all the responsibility she acknowledged

but she seemed to have great aversion to the notice nig would attract should she become pious how could she meet this case  she resolved to make her complaint to john strange when she was always foiled in this direction she should resort to him it was time something was done she had begun to read the bible openly

the night of this discovery as they were retiring mrs bellmont introduced the conversation by saying  i want your attention to what i am going to say i have let nig go out to evening meetings a few times and if you will believe it i found her reading the bible today just as though she expected to turn pious nigger and preach to white folks so now you see what good comes of sending her to school if she should get converted she would have to go to meeting at least as long as james lives i wish he had not such queer notions about her it seems to trouble him to know he must die and leave her he says if he should get well he would take her home with him or educate her here oh how awful what can the child mean  so careful too of her he says we shall ruin her health making her work so hard and sleep in such a place  john do you think he is in his right mind  

yes yes she is slender

yesyes she repeated sarcastically you know these niggers are just like black snakes you cant kill them if she wasnt tough she would have been killed long ago there was never one of my girls could do half the work

did they ever try interposed her husband

i think she can do more than all of them together

 what a man said she peevishly but i want to know what is going to be done with her about getting pious 

 let her do just as she has a mind to if it is a comfort to her let her enjoy the privilege of being good i see no objection

 i should think you were crazy sure do nt you know that every night she will want to go toting off to meeting  and sundays too  and you know we have a great deal of company sundays and she cant be spared

i thought you christians held to going to church remarked mr b

yes but who ever thought of having a nigger go except to drive others there  why according to you and james we should very soon have her in the parlor as smart as our own girls its of no use talking to you or james if you should go on as you would like it would not be six months before she would be leaving me and that wont do just think how much profit she was to us last summer we had no work hired out she did the work of two girls â 

and got the whippings for two with it

remarked mr bellmont

 i ll beat the money out of her if i ca nt get her worth any other way retorted mrs b

sharply while this scene was passing frado was trying to utter the prayer of the publican  god be merciful to me a sinner

we have now but a small portion of what men call time to hold communion

spring opened and james instead of rallying as was hoped grew worse daily aunt abby and frado were the constant allies of susan

mrs bellmont dared not lift him she was not strong enough she said

it was very offensive to mrs b to have nab about james so much she had thrown out many a hint to detain her from so often visiting the sickroom but aunt abby was too well accustomed to her ways to mind them after various unsuccessful efforts she resorted to the following expedient as she heard her cross the entry below to ascend the stairs she slipped out and held the latch of the door which led into the upper entry

 james does not want to see you or any one else she said

aunt abby hesitated and returned slowly to her own room wondering if it were really james wish not to see her she did not venture again that day but still felt disturbed and anxious about him she inquired of frado and learned that he was no worse she asked her if james did not wish her to come and see him what could it mean 

quite late next morning susan came to see what had become of her aunt

 your mother said james did not wish to see me and i was afraid i tired him

why aunt that is a mistake i know w at could mother mean   asked susan

the next time she went to the sittingroom she asked her mother â  why does not aunt abby visit james as she has done  where is she  

 at home i hope that she will stay there

was the answer

 i should think she would come in and see james continued susan

 i told her he did want to see her and to stay out you need make no stir about it remember   she added with one of her fiery glances

susan kept silence it was a day or two before james spoke of her absence the family were at dinner and frado was watching beside him he inquired the cause of her absence and she told him all after the family returned he sent his wife for her when she entered he took her hand and said tt come to me often aunt come any time â i am always glad to see you i have but a little longer to be with you â come often aunt now please help lift me up and see if i can rest a little

frado was called in and susan and mrs b all attempted mrs b was too weak she did not feel able to lift so much so the three succeeded in relieving the sufferer

frado returned to her work mrs b followed seizing frado she said she would  cure her of talebearing and placing the wedge of wood between her teeth she beat her cruelly with the rawhide aunt abby heard the blows and came to see if she could hinder them

surprised at her sudden appearance mrs b

suddenly stopped but forbade her removing the wood till she gave her permission and commanded nab to go home

she was thus tortured when mr bellmont came in and making inquiries which she did not because she could not answer approached her and seeing her situation quickly removed the instrument of torture and sought his wife

their conversation we will omit suffice it to say a storm raged which required many days to exhaust its strength

frado was becoming seriously ill she had no relish for food and was constantly overworked and then she had such solicitude about the future she wished to pray for pardon

she did try to pray her mistress had told her it would do nogood for her to attempt prayer prayer was for whites not for blacks if she minded her mistress and did what she commanded it was all that was required of her

this did not satisfy her or appease her longings she knew her instructions did not harmonize with those of the man of god or aunt abbys she resolved to persevere she said nothing on the subject unless asked it was evident to all her mind was deeply exercised

james longed to speak with her alone on the subject an opportunity presented soon while the family were at tea it was usual to summon aunt abby to keep company with her as bis death was expected hourly

as she took her accustomed seat he asked  are you afraid to stay with me alone frado  

 no she replied and stepped to the window to conceal her emotion

 come here and sit by me i wisli to talk with you

she approached him and taking her hand he remarked  how poor you are frado i want to tell you that i fear i shall never be able to talk with you again it is the last time perhaps i shall ever talk with you you are old enough to remember my dying words and profit by them

i have been sick a long time i shall die pretty soon my heavenly father is calling me home

had it been his will to let me live i should take you to live with me  but as it is i shall go and leave you but frado if you will be a good girl and love and serve god it will be but a short time before we are in a heavenly home together there will never be any sickness or sorrow there

frado overcome with grief sobbed and buried her face in his pillow she expected he would die but to hear him speak of his departure himself was unexpected

bid me good bye frado

she kissed him and sank on her knees by his bedside his hand rested on her head his eyes were closed his lips moved in prayer for this disconsolate child

his wife entered and interpreting the scene gave him some restoratives and withdrew for a short time

it was a great effort for frado to cease sobbing but she dared not be seen below in tears so she choked her grief and descended to her usual toil susan perceived a change in her husband she felt that death was near

he tenderly looked on her and said susan my wife our farewells are all spoken i feel prepared to go i shall meet you in heaven

death is indeed creeping fast upon me let me see them all once more teach charlie the way to heaven lead him up as you come

the family all assembled he could not talk as he wished to them he seemed to sink into unconsciousness they watched him for hours he had labored hard for breath some time when he seemed to awake suddenly and exclaimed hark do you hear it

hear what my son asked the father

their call look look at the shining ones oh let me go and be at rest

as if waiting for this petition the angel of death severed the golden thread and he was in heaven at midnight the messenger came

they called frado to see his last struggle

sinking on her knees at the foot of his bed she buried her face in the clothes and wept like one inconsolable they led her from the room she seemed to be too much absorbed to know it was necessary for her to leave

next day she would steal into the chamber as often as she could to weep over his remains and ponder his last words to her she moved about the house like an automaton every duty performedâbut an abstraction from all which shewed her thoughts were busied elsewhere susan wished her to attend his burial as one of the family lewis and mary and jack it was not thought best to send for as the season would not allow them time for the journey susan provided her with a dress for the occasion which was her first intimation that she would be allowed to mingle her grief with others

the day of the burial she was attired in her mourning dress but susan in her grief had forgotten a bonnet

she hastily ransacked the closets and found one of marys trimmed with bright pink ribbon

it was too late to change the ribbon and she was unwilling to leave frado at home she knew it would be the wish of james she should go with her so tying it on she said  never mind frado you shall see where our dear james is buried as she passed out she heard the whispers of the bystanders look there see there how that looks â a black dress and a pink ribbon 

another time such remarks would have wounded frado she had now a sorrow with which such were small in comparison

as she saw his body lowered in the grave she wished to share it but she was not fit to die she could not go where he was if she did she did not love god she did not serve him or know how to

she retired at night to mourn over her unfitness for heaven and gaze out upon the stars which she felt studded the entrance of heaven above which james reposed in the bosom of jesus to which her desires were hastening she wished she could see god and ask him for eternal life aunt abby had taught her that he was ever looking upon her oh if she could see him or hear him speak words of forgiveness her anxiety increased her health seemed impaired and she felt constrained to go to aunt abby and tell her all about her conflicts

she received her like a returning wanderer seriously urged her to accept of christ explained the way read to her from the bible and remarked upon such passages as applied to her state she warned her against stifling that voice which was calling her to heaven echoed the farewell words of james and told her to come to her with her difficulties and not to delay a duty so important as attention to the truths of religion and her souls interests

mrs bellmont would occasionally give instruction though far different she would tell her she could not go where james was she need not try if she should get to heaven at all she would never be as high up as he

he was the attraction should she want to go there if she could not see him

mrs b seldom mentioned her bereavement unless in such allusion to frado she donned her weeds from custom kept close her crape veil for so many sabbaths and abated nothing of her characteristic harshness

the clergyman called to minister consolation to the afflicted widow and mother aunt abby seeing him approach the dwelling knew at once the object of his visit and followed him to the parlor unasked by mrs b what a daring affront the good man dispensed the consolations of which he was steward to the apparently griefsmitten mother who talked like one schooled in a heavenly atmosphere such resignation expressed as might have graced the trial of the holiest susan like a mute sufferer bared her soul to bis sympathy and godly counsel but only replied to bis questions in short syllables when he offered prayer frado stole to the door that she might hear of the heavenly bliss of one who was her friend on earth the prayer caused profuse weeping as any tender reminder of the heavenborn was sure to when the good mans voice ceased she returned to her toil carefully removing all trace of sorrow her mistress soon followed irritated by nabs impudence in presenting herself unasked in the parlor and upraided her with indolence and bade her apply herself more diligently stung by unmerited rebuke weak from sorrow and anxiety the tears rolled down her dark face soon followed by sobs and then losing all control of herself she wept aloud

this was an act of disobedience her mistress grasping her rawhide caused a longer flow of tears and wounded a spirit that was craving healing mercies

neath the billows of the ocean hidden treasures wait the hand that again to light shall raise them with the divers magic wand

g w cook

the family gathered by james decease returned to their homes susan and charles returned to baltimore letters were received from the absent expressing their sympathy and grief the father bowed like a bruised reed under the loss of his beloved son he felt desirous to die the death of the righteous also conscious that he was unprepared he resolved to start on the narrow way and some time solicit entrance through the gate which leads to the celestial city he acknowledged his too ready acquiescence with mrs b in permitting frado to be deprived of her only religious privileges for weeks together he accordingly asked his sister to take her to meeting once more which she was ready at once to do

the first opportunity they once more attended meeting together the minister conversed faithfully with every person present

he was surprised to find the little colored girl so solicitous and kindly directed her to the flowing fountain where she might wash and be clean he inquired of the origin of her anxiety of her progress up to this time and endeavored to make christ instead of james the attraction of heaven he invited her to come to his house to speak freely her mind to him to pray much to read her bible often

the neighbors who were at meetingâamong them mrs reed â discussed the opinions mrs

bellmont would express on the subject mrs

reed called and informed mrs b that her colored girl related her experience the other night at the meeting

 what experience  asked she quickly as if she expected to hear the number of times she had whipped frado and the number of lashes set forth in plain arabic numbers

 why you know she is serious dont you 

she told the minister about it

mrs b made no reply but changed the subject adroitly next morning she told frado she should not go out of the house for one while except on errands and if she did not stop trying to be religious she would whip her to death

frado pondered her mistress was a professor of religion was she going to heaven  then she did not wish to go if she should be near james even she could not be happy with those fiery eyes watching her ascending path she resolved to give over all thought of the future world and strove daily to put her anxiety far from her

mr bellmont found himself unable to do what james or jack could accomplish for her he talked with her seriously told her he had seen her many times punished undeservedly he did not wish to have her saucy or disrespectful but when she was sure she did not deserve a whipping to avoid it if she could you are looking sick he added  you cannot endure beating as you once could

it was not long before an opportunity offered of profiting by his advice she was sent for wood and not returning as soon as mrs b calculated she followed her and snatching from the pile a stick raised it over her

 stop  shouted frado  strike jne and ill never work a mite more for you  and throwing down what she had gathered stood like one who feels the stirring of free and independent thoughts

by this unexpected demonstration her mistress in amazement dropped her weapon desisting from her purpose of chastisement frado walked towards the house her mistress following with the wood she herself was sent after she did not know before that she had a power to ward off assaults her triumph in seeing her enter the door with her burden repaid her for much of her former suffering

it was characteristic of mrs b never to rise in her majesty unless she was sure she should be victorious

this affair never met with an  after clap like many others

thus passed a year the usual amount of scolding but fewer whippings mrs b longed once more for marys return who had been absent over a year and she wrote imperatively for her to come quickly to her a letter came in reply announcing that she would comply as soon as she was sufficiently recovered from an illness which detained her

no serious apprehensions were cherished by either parent who constantly looked for notice of her arrival by mail another letter brought tidings that mary was seriously ill her mothers presence was solicited

she started without delay before she reached her destination a letter came to the parents announcing her death

no sooner was the astounding news received than frado rushed into aunt abbys exclaimingâ  shes dead aunt abby 

 who   she asked terrified by the unprefaced announcement

 mary they ve just had a letter

as mrs b was away the brother and sister could freely sympathize and she sought him in this fresh sorrow to communicate such solace as she could and to learn particulars of marys untimely death and assist him in his journey thither

it seemed a thanksgiving to frado every hour or two she would pop in into aunt abbys room with some strange query she got into the river again aunt abby did nt she the jordan is a big one to tumble into any how sposen she goes to hell she ll be as black as i am would nt mistress be mad to see her a nigger  and others of a similar stamp not at all acceptable to the pious sympathetic dame  but she could not evade them

the family returned from their sorrowful journey leaving the dead behind nig looked for a change in her tyrant what could subdue her if the loss of her idol could not 

never was mrs b known to shed tears so profusely as when she reiterated to one and another the sad particulars of her darlings sickness and death there was indeed a season of quiet grief it was the lull of the fiery elements a few weeks revived the former tempests and so at variance did they seem with chastisement sanctified that frado felt them to be unbearable she determined to flee but where

who would take her  mrs b had always represented her ugly perhaps every one thought her so then no one would take her she was black no one would love her she might have to return and then she would be more in her mistress power than ever

she remembered her victory at the woodpile

she decided to remain to do as well as she could to assert her rights when they were trampled on to return once more to her meeting in the evening which had been prohibited she had learned how to conquer she would not abuse the power while mr bellmont was at home

but had she not better run away  where 

she had never been from the place far enough to decide what course to take she resolved to speak to aunt abby she mapped the dangers of her course her liability to fail in finding so good friends as john and herself frados mind was busy for days and nights she contemplated administering poison to her mistress to rid herself and the house of so detestable a plague

but she was restrained by an overruling providence  and finally decided to stay contentedly through her period of service which would expire when she was eighteen years of age

in a few months jane returned home with her family to relieve her parents upon whom years and affliction had left the marks of age the years intervening since she had left her home had in some degree softened the opposition to her unsanctioned marriage with george the more mrs b had about her the more energetic seemed her directing capabilities and her faultfinding propensities her own she had full power over and jane after vain endeavors became disgusted weary and perplexed and decided that though her mother might suffer she could not endure her home they followed jack to the west thus vanished all hopes of sympathy or relief from this source to prado there seemed no one capable of enduring the oppressions of the house but her she turned to the darkness of the future with the determination previously formed to remain until she should be eighteen jane begged her to follow her so soon as she should be released but so wearied out was she by her mistress she felt disposed to flee from any and every one having her similitude of name or feature

crucified the hopes that cheered me all that to the earth endeared me love of wealth and fame and power love â all have been crucified

c e

darkness before day jane left but jack was now to come again after marys death he visited home leaving a wife behind an orphan whose home was with a relative gentle loving the true mate of kind generous jack his mother was a stranger to her of course and had perfect right to interrogate is she good looking jack asked his mother

 looks well to me was the laconic reply

 was her father rich  

 not worth a copper as i know of i never asked him answered jack

 hadnt she any property  what did you marry her for asked his mother

 oh shes worth a million dollars mother though not a cent of it is in money

jack what do you want to bring such a poor being into the family for  youd better stay here at home and let your wife go why could nt you try to do better and not disgrace your parents  

dont judge till you see her was jacks reply and immediately changed the subject

it was no recommendation to his mother and she did not feel prepared to welcome her cordially now he was to come with his wife he was indignant at his mothers advice to desert her it rankled bitterly in his soul the bare suggestion he had more to bring he now came with a child also he decided to leave the west but not his family

upon their arrival mrs b extended a cold welcome to her new daughter eyeing her dress with closest scrutiny poverty was to her a disgrace and she could not associate with any thus dishonored this coldness was felt by jacks worthy wife who only strove the harder to recommend herself by her obliging winning ways

mrs b could never let jack be with her alone without complaining of this or that deficiency in his wife

he cared not so long as the complaints were piercing his own ears he would not have jenny disquieted he passed his time in seeking employment

a letter came from his brother lewis then at the south soliciting his services leaving his wife he repaired thither

mrs b felt that great restraint was removed that jenny was more in her own power she wished to make her feel her inferiority to relieve jack of his burden if he would not do it himself she watched her incessantly to catch at some act of jennys which might be construed into conjugal unfaithfulness

near by were a family of cousins one a young man of jacks age who from love to his cousin proffered all needful courtesy to his stranger relative soon news reached jack that jenny was deserting her covenant vows and had formed an illegal intimacy with his cousin

meantime jenny was told by her motherinlaw that jack did not marry her untrammelied

he had another love whom he would be glad even now if he could to marry it was very doubtful if he ever came for her

jenny would feel pained by her unwelcome gossip and glancing at her child she decided however true it might be she had a pledge which would enchain him yet ere long the mothers inveterate hate crept out into some neighbors enclosure and caught up hastily they passed the secret round till it became none and lewis was sent for the brother by whom jack was employed the neighbors saw her fade in health and spirits they found letters never reached their destination when sent by either lewis arrived with the joyful news that he had come to take jenny home with him

what a relief to her to be freed from the gnawing taunts of her adversary

jenny retired to prepare for the journey and mrs b and henry had a long interview next morning he informed jenny that new clothes would be necessary in order to make her presentable to baltimore society and he should return without her and she must stay till she was suitably attired

disheartened she rushed to her room and after relief from weeping wrote to jack to come  to have pity on her and take her to him

no answer came mrs smith a neighbor watchful and friendly suggested that she write away from home and employ some one to carry it to the office who would elude mrs b who they very well knew had intercepted jennys letter and influenced lewis to leave her behind she accepted the offer and frado succeeded in managing the affair so that jack soon came to the rescue angry wounded and forever after alienated from his early home and his mother many times would frado steal up into jennys room when she knew she was tortured by her mistress malignity and tell some of her own encounters with her and tell her she might  be sure it would nt kill her for she should have died long before at the same treatment

susan and her child succeeded jenny as visitors frado had merged into womanhood and retaining what she had learned in spite of the few privileges enjoyed formerly was striving to enrich her mind her schoolbooks were her constant companions and every leisure moment was applied to them susan was delighted to witness her progress and some little book from her was a reward sufficient for any task imposed however difficult she had her book always fastened open near her where she could glance from toil to soul refreshment the approaching spring would close the term of years which mrs b claimed as the period of her servitude often as she passed the waymarks of former years did she pause to ponder on her situation and wonder if she could succeed in providing for her own wants her health was delicate yet she resolved to try

soon she counted the time by days which should release her mrs b felt that she could not well spare one who could so well adapt herself to all departmentsâman boy housekeeper domestic etc she begged mrs smith to talk with her to show her how ungrateful it would appear to leave a home of such comfort â how wicked it was to be ungrateful but frado replied that she had had enough of such comforts  she wanted some new ones and as it was so wicked to be ungrateful she would go from temptation aunt abby said  we must nt put ourselves in the way of temptation

poor little fido she shed more tears over him than over all beside

the morning for departure dawned frado engaged to work for a family a mile distant

mrs bellmont dismissed her with the assurance that she would soon wish herself back again and a present of a silver half dollar

her wardrobe consisted of one decent dress without any superfluous accompaniments a bible from susan she felt was her greatest treasure

now was she alone in the world the past year had been one of suffering resulting from a fall which had left her lame

the first summer passed pleasantly and the wages earned were expended in gapnents necessary for health and cleanliness though feeble she was well satisfied with her progress shut up in her room after her toil was finished she studied what poor samples of apparel she had and for the first time prepared her own garments

mrs moore who employed her was a kind friend to her and attempted to heal her wounded spirit by sympathy and advice burying the past in the prospects of the future

but her failing health was a cloud no kindly human hand could dissipate a little light work was all she could accomplish a clergyman whose family was small sought her and she was removed there her engagement with mrs moore finished in the fall frado was anxious to keep up her reputation for efficiency and often pressed far beyond prudence in the winter she entirely gave up work and confessed herself thoroughly sick mrs hale soon overcome by additional cares was taken sick also and now it became necessary to adopt some measures for frados comfort as well as to relieve mrs hale such dark forebodings as visited her as she lay solitary and sad no moan or sighs could relieve

the family physician pronounced her case one of doubtful issue frado hoped it was final

she could riot feel relentings that her former home was abandoned and yet should she be in need of succor could she obtain it from one who would now so grudgingly bestow it the family were applied to and it was decided to take her there she was removed to a room built out from the main building used formerly as a workshop where cold and rain found unobstructed access and here she fought with bitter reminiscences and future prospects till she became reckless of her faith and hopes and person and half wished to end what nature seemed so tardily to take

aunt abby made her frequent visits and at last had her removed to her own apartment where she might supply her wants and minister to her once more in heavenly things

then came the family consultation

 what is to be done with her asked mrs b  after she is moved there with nab  

 send for the dr your brother mr b replied

 when  

â tonight

 tonight and for her wait till morning

she continued

 she has waited too long now i think something should be done soon

i doubt if she is much sick sharply interrupted mrs b

well well see what our brother thinks

his coming was longed for by frado who had known him well during her long sojourn in the family and his praise of her nice butter and cheese from which his table was supplied she knew he felt as well as spoke

youre sick very sick he said quickly after a moments pause take good care of her abby or she ll never get well all broken down

yes it was at mrs moores said mrs b  all this was done she did but little the latter part of the time she was here

 it was commenced longer ago than last summer take good care of her she may never get well remarked the dr

we shant pay you for doctoring her you may look to the town for that sir said mrs b and abruptly left the room

oh dear oh dear exclaimed frado and buried her face in the pillow

a few kind words of consolation and she was once more alone in the darkness which enveloped her previous days yet she felt sure they owed her a shelter and attention when disabled and she resolved to feel patient and remain till she could help herself mrs b would not attend her nor permit her domestic to stay with her at all aunt abby was her sole comforter

aunt abbys nursing had the desired effect and she slowly improved as soon as she was able to be moved the kind mrs moore took her to her home again and completed what aunt abby had so well commenced not that she was well or ever would be but she had recovered so far as rendered it hopeful she might provide for her own wants the clergyman at whose house she was taken sick was now seeking some one to watch his sick children and as soon as he heard of her recovery again asked for her services

what seemed so light and easy to others was too much for frado and it became necessary to ask once more where the sick should find an asylum

all felt that the place where her declining health began should be the place of relief so they applied once more for a shelter

 no exclaimed the indignant mrs b  she she shall never come under this roof again never never  she repeated as if each repetition were a bolt to prevent admission

one only resource the public must pay the expense so she was removed to the home of two maidens old who had principle enough to be willing to earn the money a charitable public disburses

three years of weary sickness wasted her without extinguishing a life apparently so feeble two years had these maidens watched and cared for her and they began to weary and finally to request the authorities to remove her

mrs hoggs was a lover of gold and silver and she asked the favor of filling her coffers by caring for the sick the removal caused severe sickness

by being bolstered in the bed after a time she could use her hands and often would ask for sewing to beguile the tedium she had become very expert with her needle the first year of her release from mrs b and she had forgotten none of her skill mrs h praised her and as she improved in health was anxious to employ her

she told her she could in this way replace her clothes and as her board would be paid for she would thus gain something

many times her hands wrought when her body was in pain  but the hope that she might yet help herself impelled her on

thus she reckoned her store of means by a few dollars and was hoping soon to come in possession when she was startled by the announcement that mrs hoggs had reported her to the physician and town officers as an impostor that she was in truth able to get up and go to work

this brought on a severe sickness of two weeks when mrs moore again sought her and took her to her home she had formerly had wealth at her command but misfortune had deprived her of it and unlocked her heart to sympathies and favors she had never known while it lasted her husband defrauded of his last means by a branch of the bellmont family had supported them by manual labor gone to the west and left his wife and four young children

but she felt humanity required her to give a shelter to one she knew to be worthy of a hospitable reception mrs moores physician was called and pronounced her a very sick girl and encouraged mrs m to keep her and care for her and he would see that the authorities were informed of frados helplessness and pledged assistance

here she remained till sufficiently restored to sew again then came the old resolution to take care of herself to cast off the unpleasant charities of the public

she learned that in some towns in massachusetts girls make straw bonnets â that it was easy and profitable but how should she black feeble and poor find any one to teach her but god prepares the way when human agencies see no path here was found a plain poor simple woman who could see merit beneath a dark skin  and when the invalid mulatto told her sorrows she opened her door and her heart and took the stranger in expert with the needle frado soon equalled her instructress and she sought also to teach her the value of useful books  and while one read aloud to the other of deeds historic and names renowned frado experienced a new impulse she felt herself capable of elevation  she felt that this book information supplied an undefined dissatisfaction she had long felt but could not express every leisure moment was carefully applied to selfimprovement and a devout and christian exterior invited confidence from the villagers thus she passed months of quiet growing in the confidence of her neighbors and new found friends

nothing new under the sun

solomon

a few years ago within the compass of my narrative there appeared often in some of our new england villages professed fugitives from slavery who recounted their personal experience in homely phrase and awakened the indignation of nonslaveholders against brother pro

such a one appeared in the new home of frado and as people of color were rare there was it strange she should attract her dark brother â that he should inquire her out succeed in seeing her feel a strange sensation in his heart towards her that he should toy with her shining curls feel proud to provoke her to smile and expose the ivory concealed by thin ruby lips that her sparkling eyes should fascinate  that he should propose that they should marry  a short acquaintance was indeed an objection but she saw him often and thought she knew him he never spoke of his enslavement to her when alone but she felt that like her own oppression it was painful to disturb oftener than was needful

he was a fine straight negro whose back showed no marks of the lash erect as if it never crouched beneath a burden there was a silent sympathy which frado felt attracted her and she opened her heart to the presence of love â that arbitrary and inexorable tyrant

she removed to singleton her former residence and there was married here were frados first feelings of trust and repose on human arm she realized for the first time the relief of looking to another for comfortable support

occasionally he would leave her to  lecture

those tours were prolonged often to weeks

of course he had little spare money frado was again feeling her selfdependence and was at last compelled to resort alone to that samuel was kind to her when at home but made no provision for his absence which was at last unprecedented

he left her to her fate â embarked at sea with the disclosure that he had never seen the south and that his illiterate harangues were humbugs for hungry abolitionists once more alone  yet not alone a still newer companionship would soon force itself upon her no one wanted her with such prospects herself was burden enough who would have anadditional one 

the horrors of her condition nearly prostrated her and she was again thrown upon the public for sustenance then followed the birth of her child the long absent samuel unexpectedly returned and rescued her from charity recovering from her expected illness she once more commenced toil for herself and child in a room obtained of a poor woman but with better fortune one so well known w tould not be wholly neglected kind friends watched her when samuel was from home prevented her from suffering and when the cold weather pinched the warmly clad a kind friend took them in and thus preserved them at last samuels business became very engrossing and after long desertion news reached his family that he had become a victim of yellow fever in new orleans

so much toil as was necessary to sustain frado was more than she could endure as soon as her babe could be nourished without his mother she left him in charge of a mrs capon and procured an agency hoping to recruit her health and gain an easier livelihood for herself and child this afforded her better maintenance than she had yet found she passed into the various towns of the state she lived in then into massachusetts strange were some of her adventures watched by kidnappers maltreated by professed abolitionists who didnt want slaves at the south nor niggers in their own houses north faugh to lodge one to eat with one to admit one through the front door to sit next one awful

traps slyly laid by the vicious to ensnare her she resolutely avoided in one of her tours providence favored her with a friend who pitying her cheerless lot kindly provided her with a valuable recipe from which she might herself manufacture a useful article for her maintenance

this proved a more agreeable and an easier way of sustenance

and thus to the present time may you see her busily employed in preparing her merchandise  then sallying forth to encounter many frowns but some kind friends and purchasers

nothing turns her from her steadfast purpose of elevating herself reposing on god she has thus far journeyed securely still an invalid she asks your symyathy gentle reader refuse not because some part of her history is unknown save by the omniscient god enough has been unrolled to demand your sympathy and aid

do you ask the destiny of those connected with her early history  a few years only have elapsed since mr and mrs b passed into another world as age increased mrs b became more irritable so that no one even her own children could remain with her and she was accompanied by her husband to the home of lewis where after an agony in death unspeakable she passed away only a few months since aunt abby entered heaven jack and his wife rest in heaven disturbed by no intruders and susan and her child are yet with the living jane has silver locks in place of auburn tresses but she has the early love of henry still and has never regretted her exchange of lovers frado has passed from their memories as joseph from the butlers but she will never cease to track them till beyond mortal vision
