chapter i a social event

in a stately mansion in a fashionable portion of one of our principal cities a fete was at its height

carriage after carriage was whirling up to the grand entrance depositing its occupants the house was all ablaze with light and the merry tinkle of silvery laughter was borne out on the summer air to passersby who involuntarily stopped to gaze at the gay scene a beautiful night overhead a pleasant night under foot a silvery moon had just risen and was casting long shadows on the green turf at the side of the house near which a fountain tinkled musically

around the corner of mrs warringtons mansion a balmy breeze was blowing gently while the song of a nightingale bird in a neighboring cedar tree all tended to make it a typical southern summer night in june take a peep on the interior

in a mansion on pennsylvania avenue a fete is at its height carriage after carriage whirl up to the grand entrance the house was all ablaze with light and the merry voices of beautiful and superbly dressed ladies and gentlemen were borne out on the summers air to passersby who involuntarily stopped to gaze at the gay scene

there was a long salon bedecked with all kinds of tropical plants lovely ladies moved to and fro and coquetted prettily with handsome gentlemen

at the door of the entry stands mrs warrington receiving her guests with customary grace she is a handsome woman about forty years of age and bore a smile and pleasant word for everyone her beauty wealth and high birth all tend to make her one of the ringleaders of washington society

among the guests that she is engaged in welcoming was a tall fashionably dressed gentleman he stepped into an anteroom and after a moment returned to mrs warrington and asked nervously in a low tone has miss hawthorne yet arrived 

yes  she replied he turned on his heel and made his way with some difficulty through the crowd

bertram heathcourt for that is his name was about thirty years old and one of the handsomest men in washington his curly hair that was admirably worn brushed away from his high intellectual brow blue eyes and amberhued mustache that half covered a firm but expressive mouth broad shoulders muscular limbs and an upright bearing made him a fine specimen of manly beauty he was the only son of the late col heathcourt his mother having died shortly after his birth threw him on his own resources he managed to get a firstclass education and being an energetic young man had taken to journalism and consequently was editor of the national record 

while wending his way through the crowded salon he felt a fan tap him lightly on the shoulder he turned with a look of pleasure in his eyes as he bowed low before a beautiful girl she was superbly dressed in black velvet and diamonds that suited to perfection her splendid brunette beauty

i was just looking for you  he said and with her hand laid gently in his arm they were moving slowly along

the music is beautiful will you give me this waltz 

yes if you wish it  she said lightly

the next moment they were floating down the long salon to the time of the dreamy music

ah that was delightful  he said as the music suddenly ceased and he led her to the conservatory

mona at last i have the opportunity of relating and relieving my mind of a weight that it has carried for days and weeks my darling  he cried passionately have you not seen that i love you with all my soul i know that i am not worthy to kiss the hem of your garment but if you would only love me a little i would make you so happy you are not indifferent to me will you become my wife 

her lovely face had slowly become paler and paler

her lips had become compressed

he watched her in evident alarm

mona good heavens are you ill 

recovering herself with a supreme effort she was just about to reply when there was an interruption

a haughty woman arrived on the scene

one glance was enough to tell anyone that it was the mother of the girl

mona  she said sharpy when she saw the lovelike attitude in which her companion was bending over her i have a severe headache and i think i shall go home  with a distant bow to the young man she turned to leave the conservatory

with a sigh of relief the young lady rose and together they all passed out with gentlemanly courtesy saw after their wraps and assisted them to their carriage when he was assisting the young lady in he pressed her hand and whispered tomorrow i shall call for my answer  he stepped back from the curb and the elegant equipage swung around and dashed down the street he stood and watched it until it disappeared around the corner i wonder why she grew pale and trembled so surely she couldnt have been angry at what i said  he muttered as he was ascending the steps torn by conflicting hopes and fears he soon grew weary of the gay scene and bidding his hostess goodnight left the house

bertram too poor

when mrs hawthorne and her daughter reached home the former requested the latter to come to her as she had something to say to her half divining what was to come mona followed with sullen silence

mrs hawthorne motioned her daughter to a seat and standing before her she asked in a harsh voice what was that man saying to you when i arrived as i believe so opportunely 

a deep blush was the only answer she received

you do not speak answer me was he engaged in some of his silly nonsense 

he was making me an honest proposal  was answered haughtily

and you dare listen to him  exclaimed the mother trembling with passion and after all i have said to you on the subject too and when there is col clayton with a princely fortune awaiting you

and you are ready to throw away yourself to a beggarly editor who hasnt enough to keep a woman of your extravagant tastes in pin money 

but mother i love him dearly and 

a fig for love  interrupted the mother harshly

it is all silly nonsense that you will get the better of soon there is no such thing as love when there is nothing on which to found it but grim poverty

wealth first love and everything else will follow 

but mother bertram will be rich some day his business is good and he is energetic and he is sure to succeed 

yes and be as old as the hills when he does succeed  retorted the mother where will all your beauty be by that time 

a little shudder passed over the girl not unnoticed by the sharp eyes of the mother and as she observed it she knew the right chord was struck you will be a pretty faded washedout thing by that time  she continued with a wicked leer

while your friends who will forsake you as soon as you become poor are riding driving or going to balls and attending operas you will be at home nursing dirty brats scrubbing washing or doing something else equally disagreeable to one of your fastidious taste i would rather see you dead than married to bertram heathcourt  and after delivering this stinging speech she dismissed her daughter with a haughty wave of the hand she knew her daughter well enough and felt confident that her words had left a deep impression on her mind so she smiled complacently went to bed and was soon sleeping sweetly and dreaming that she was a grand duchess with more silk jewels and money than she could use

not so the words uttered by monas mother had left a deep impression on her mind one not so easily eradicated

being the daughter of a selfish mercenary woman of the world brought up to consider the almighty dollar above everything else that was noble and who was used to making one dollar go as far as three so that she might keep up impressions it was but natural that the picture drawn by her mother was not very pleasing to her taste

standing at the window she heard the noise of vehicles plying over the stonepaved street coming from mrs warringtons ball she thought with a shudder that all this would be denied her if married to bertram heathcourt

i cannot give up wealth and luxury  she cried excitedly i should die if i had to do it oh

bertram why are you not rich i â i love you so and we would be so happy together only â only you are poor and i cannot be the wife of a poor man i â cannot  throwing herself down by the side of her bed the proud and haughty woman gave herself up to the fierce battle of grief that was being waged within her

she lay there until the tolling of a neighboring clock belched forth the hour of two slowly rising she proceeded toward her wardrobe it was quite evident that the better instincts of her heart had been vanquished there was a cold hard expression in her black eyes her full lips were drawn tightly together her fair forehead was distorted by a black frown i will reject him  she muttered harshly and in that decision she brought a world of trouble and heartaches to the door of more than one unsuspecting soul

retribution

bertram heathcourt arose early the next morning and after partaking of a light breakfast proceeded leisurely down to the office on arriving there he took up the morning paper and was glancing over it when there came a tap on the door of the office a messenger came in hastily and asking if he had the honor of standing before the editor handed him the telegram wondering what it could mean he hastily tore it open and read the following come immediately to heathcourt park b â ville station i am dying and wish to see you 

yours richard heathcourt 

very much perplexed he rang for his assistant and after informing him of his intended departure left the building hailing a passing cab he entered and was driven rapidly to the depot purchasing a ticket he seated himself in the car and was soon on his way to b â ville when he left the train at b â ville he found a carriage from the park awaiting him

he was whirled swiftly along over the smooth road toward his destination

heathcourt park was a rare old place its huge tower and broad piazza that extended all the way around it the wide gravel paths separating the green turf that extended out to the deep woods on the opposite side and down to the sleepy river in front with great old cedars and elms under which were numerous rustic seats scatered here and there in picturesque confusion all tend to make it a lovely country dwelling and one of the finest estates in virginia

bertram could not suppress a cry of admiration as he was whirled up to the broad entrance he was admitted by a servant in gorgeous livery who conducted him to the sick chamber

several persons were in the room they moved about with muffled tread and spoke in hushed whispers bertram took them to be nurses

on a bed half covered in the coverlid lay the sick man his face pale and pinched the lips purple the eyes had a vacant look in spite of himself bertram could not suppress a shudder as he gazed on the awful face nerving himself to his task he slowly advanced to the side of the bed took one of the cold hands of the dying man in his and said in a low tone sir â mr heathcourt i have come i am truly sorry sir to see you so ill i hope you will be better soon 

the sick man turned his head slowly upon the pillow and let his eyes rest on the face of the young man and into his own there sprang a look of terror mingled with remorse as he said huskily you sorry for me me and i have done such a great wrong to you and yours  bertram looked at him in astonishment he thought the old man was wandering in his mind he turned to request one of the nurses to summon the physician but the old man seemed instinctively to divine his intention for he caught him hastily by the hand and said it will do no good i am dying now â dying i have sinned and sinned times without number against my god retribution has at last fallen on my guilty head and all that is left for me is atonement for my sins

he paused as if exhausted bertram stood quite still but his face showed signs of conflicting emotions â surprise doubt perplexity presently the old man drew him down and whispered tell them to go out i have something to say to you  bertram did his bidding the nurses who had all this time been standing with openmouthed amazement left the room rather reluctantly when they passed out bertram closed and locked the door returned to the bed and waited in silence

prop me up  said the old man which was done and the old man told a remarkable story which was told with many pauses and gasps for breath the substance of which is as follows my father  began the very sick man was a very rich man and also a proud one â very proud i had a brother that was two years my senior when we were young we loved each other very dearly but i soon began to develop traits of character and habits that he did not approve and naturally he took me to task about them and after he found out that i still persisted in them he threatened to acquaint father of them for this cause i began to find fault of him

about this time there lived in the village a beautiful girl the daugher of a poor working man she was the most beautiful creature you ever saw poor doris i fell desperately in love with her and finally asked her to become my wife and she refused half blind with fury and unrequited love i demanded of her the reason why she would not become my wife and she told me that she loved another i told her by the right of my great love i ought to know the fortunate gentleman she then informed me that it was my brother fierce rage and hate sprang up in my heart against my innocent brother and i determined to be revenged â to kill him i went toward the wood and sat down under a tree called the old elm  developing my plan of revenge late that night i came home and entered the house softly and crept up to his room fortune favored me his door was unlocked i crept to his bed drew back the curtains of the bed and by the dim light of the lamp which was turned low gazed long and earnestly into his face it wore a peaceful smile and the thought entered my mind that possibly doris and he had met and for all i knew to the contrary exchanged confidences the thought added fuel to the fire of my jealous wrath and almost maddened me i raised my hand in which gleamed a sword a present from my father and a moment later he would have been in eternity when the moon which had previously been obscured by a cloud bursted into the room with a flood of mellow light and shone on him his hands were folded on his breast and between his fingers something white was shining i looked more closely and saw that ft was a letter it might be from doris thorndyke the woman we both love thought i jealously and with jealous haste but with due caution i managed to possess myself of it by the light of the moon i read my own fleming you know that i could refuse you nothing you are all the world to me my love my life yes i will meet you by the old elm  and go with you to the city do you think it can be done oh fleming dear suppose your father should know it he would disinherit you for marrying the daughter of a poor working man and clandestinely he would never forgive you oh why am i not rich or why are you not poor i would rather be your wife â yes although you were a tiller of the soil â than the wife of any other man

yours doris thorndyke

and there it ended so that is the extent his love making had gone she was to become his wife i ground my teeth with rage but suddenly a dark scheme entered my mind i started guiltily and looked strangely about and stepping to the window raised it softly to let the balmy air blow over my heated brow that i might think â think 

chapter ii

a love competition between brothers

the old man paused from sheer exhaustion the young man sat with pale face and eyes dilated with horror the pallor having been renewed since the mention of the name fleming a terrible suspicion had entered his mind one that took his breath away that almost unmanned him after a few moments pause the old man continued directly a triumphant smile broke over my face i would let him marry her i knew my father would disinherit him if he did and i would be the only heir

i would be the master of the park â a thing which i had always dearly craved

i determined to kill two birds with one stone rob him of his birthright and be revenged on him for my disappointment i closed the window and returned softly to the side of the bed and replaced the note then lowering the light i left the room and retired

the next day passed without any unusual event

about seven oclock in the evening i took up my position in a thicket near the old elm and waited events

i had not long to wait a carriage came hurriedly up the road and turned into the wood and after driving a few paces stopped about half an hour later there was the sound of skirts and i saw doris coming

she was attired in a dark suit with a heavy cloak over her face i could see a veil a moment later there was the sound of another person and the next instant a man appeared in spite of the heavy ulster which he wore pulled up to his chin and soft hat that was pulled down over his eyes i recognized the upright bearing and princely carriage of my brother fleming and i could scarcely keep from rushing out of my cover and slaying them both as i saw him take her in his arms murmuring low impassioned words of deathless love to her

i controlled myself with a mighty effort and as they walked hurriedly over to the hack entered and were driven rapdly away i left my hiding place and as i walked home my heart was filled with triumphant exaltation

the next day my brother returned and i knew by the happy light in his eyes which he could not conceal that he was the husband of doris thorndyke and the knowledge almost drove me mad

i asked him why he wasnt home last night

something in my voice made him look up quickly and give me a keen glance and when he replied he had stayed in the city with one of his school fellows i smiled mockingly and turned my face that he might not see the triumphant look in my eyes the next day i went to washington and hired a detective who had little trouble in tracing doris out we found out she was staying in a pleasant little cottage in the suburbs of the city after i had been home about four clays my brother suddenly announced his intention of going fishing for a week with some friends my father readily gave his consent and my brother left early the next morning now was my time to strike it was the hour for which i had so patiently waited i told my father at breakfast that i should like to have a word with him in the library he complied and when he had lit a cigar i began my story i told him how the village was ringing with the strange disappearance of a beautiful girl how i had witnessed the meeting between her and my brother and wound up by telling him where he would find him and her

my fathers face was terrible to see he rang for a carriage and bade me prepare to accompany him

we were finally on our way and soon arrived in the city engaging a hack we were swiftly driven to our destination

we found fleming and his wife in the garden with his arm around her waist examining the flowers but i need not tell you of that meeting my father abused him heaped up reproaches upon him cursed him and wound up by forbidding him ever enter his house again also informed him that all letters would be sent back unopened i saw by the reproachful look in his eyes that he knew i had betrayed him we finally left them and when we had arrived home my father retired to his room from which he never left he never recovered from the shock and soon after died then i had things my own way i went to washington and engaged the same detective to abduct flemings wife i would wring his heart as mine had been wrung he should be made to feel as i had felt i said the detective did his work well and after i had her in my power i dispatched a letter to him telling him that his darling wife had eloped with me and by the time he received it we would be for out at sea i knew that would throw him on the wrong scent i simply had her placed in a private asylum where she finally died of a broken heart poor doris poor young thing

previous to this occurrence a son had been born to them and placing the child in care of friends fleming went to europe in search of his wife and after a year of fruitless search returned to this country he finally went into the banking business and for years did well when the war broke out he enlisted at the call for arms and went out to fight and returned with well earned laurels

for twenty years he was known all over the south as col fleming heathcourt he was your father bertram and i am your uncle

bertrams amazement

the old man sank back on his pillow completely exhausted when he had utered those last terrible words bertram sprang to his feet pale as death

you he gasped you my uncle great heavens i see it all now thats why my father never mentioned your name thats why his brow always darkened when my mothers name was mentioned

and â my god he died without knowing that she was true to him â that she loved him to the last

and whirling around suddenly he hissed you traitor you peacebreaker you â you destroyer of a loving household you â 

the old man interrupted him with a feeble wave of his hand as he said huskily bertram i am dying

true true said bertram brought to his senses by the rebuke and carried away by the intensity of his emotion he sat down and buried his face in his hands he wept as only a strong man can weep great heartrending sobs shaking him from head to foot

when the storm of emotion had spent itself the old man said feebly bertram i have sinned and sinned deeply i have wronged you and yours terribly can you ever forgive me

bertram looked at the old man on whom the death damp was swiftly gathering and whose eyes were fast glazing and a great pity sprang up in his heart for him after all it was the demon of jealousy that had taken complete possession of him he pitied him and said earnestly i forgive you indeed i do as i hope to be forgiven

an almost immediate light of happiness shone in the old mans eyes and he turned on his pillow toward bertram and died

the next day mona hawthorne was all in a flutter she could not stay in one place ten minutes at a time

she walked from room to room and then to the garden and then back to the house

the mother watched her for a while in perplexity

then she seemed to arrive at a solution of the mystery she thought that her daughter had ben thinking the mater over and had decided to reject the beggarly editor

a surmise which to say the least was not very far from wrong as the reader can testify

mona had just arisen from the piano when there came a quick sharp ring at the bell her heart leaped like a wild thing the blood surged through her veins like electric fire she heard someone enter the room and raising her drooping eyelids she encountered the admiring gaze of col philip clayton

at that instant she almost hated the man she had been hoping in spite of herself that it might be bertram until she had looked up and found that it was not bertram she did not know nor did she realize how much she did love him she loved him with a love that was her doom she shuddered as she realized what her future would be without him

recovering herself with an effort she calmly extended her hand and motioned him to a seat

afer a few commonplace remarks a painful silence followed she watched him curiously he fidgetted in his chair ever and anon pulling out a handkerchief and clearing his throat

after he had done this about half a dozen times she broke the silence

we seem to be dull  she remarked with a nervous little laugh the colonel tried to smile but made a rank failure of the attempt

the colonel was very much affected by that frown that on entering the room he had seen come over her countenance

he wanted to declare himself but was afraid to do so he did not know in which form he had better put it finally he said in sheer desperation miss hawthorne i came over to inform you that i love you â have loved you dearly for two years and to ask if you will not accept of my hand and my heart

she had been watching him since he first came in and she saw something in his face that told her he would speak about marrying and she had been puzzling her brain as to whether she should accept him now or wait until she had seen bertram if i accept him now she argued i will not have a chance to pledge myself to bertram and thus l fear i will show weakness in the interview with him

so she was about to accept the colonel when he seeing silence repeated his question mona darling wont you be my wife  yes if you wish it  she replied quietly

the colonel was overjoyed it seemed to be too good to be true the possibility that she had consented to marry him for pecuniary reasons never for once entered his mind

the colonel was considered a very amiable man and the catch of the season the forty years which had passed over his head had left no visible effect about him beyond a few threads of silver in his hair and an irongrey mustache which gave him a distinguished appearance his firm upright carriage and military air made him quite a handsome man and mona would have considered herself a most fortunate woman if she only loved him but despite his amiability there was at times a cold glitter in his steel grey eyes and a curve to his well formed lips that showed that he could also be as hard and as cruel as fate when the necessity presented itself

her mother went into hysterics when mona told her of the engagement she hugged and kissed her with a vehemence that nearly took away her breath

oh my daughter my darling child  she exclaimed in great excitement you dont know â cannot realize how you have pleased me it is the dearest wish of my heart to see you married to a man of wealth and influence so that we can take our proper position in society and sitting back in the velvet cushions of her easy chair she smiled complacently

selfish woman her only aim her only ambition was money she would have betrayed her soul for the filthy lucre she was now ready to sell her daughter to a man she did not love simply because it would be the means of securing her position in society

that night as she lay on her virtuous couch

happy lighthearted no thought of the terrible tumble this match was to make entered her mind

chapter iii

a mortal foe

it was a lovely afternoon about four days after the events narrated in previous pages that mona attired in her pretty cream wrapper with costly lace around neck and sleeves and a pink band of costly silk around her waist was sitting in her private parlor drawling over the latest book of fiction when there came a timid tap to her door

in answer to her summons the door was pushed open in a hesitating way and a young girl between eighteen and twenty entered

to say that she was pretty would give a very poor estimate of her charms

viola dunkirk was poor but surely an american beauty and natures hands did well its work beautiful as a poets dream lovely as a sylph with a sheen of golden hair that covered her well shaped head like a halo of light clear milk white complexion that gave token of every thought by little rushes of pink that ever and anon chased each other from brow to chin and from cheek to cheek she was of that strange mixture of golden hair and dark eyes over which poets rave and artists go into ecstasies and that which make a blonde beauty so unusually attractive her beautiful dark eyes shaded by long curling lashes with such a sweet expression to her face made her an object of envy to the fashionable belles for whom she worked

i have come she said hesitatingly in a sweet musical voice to bring that lace you ordered last week and she cast a pleading glance at mona from the depths of her beautiful dark eyes

very well i will inspect them replied the haughty voice of mona

viola was a lacemaker her mother was a feeble woman and her father having died a few years ago the support of her remaining parent fell on her young shoulders they were very poor the father was at one time well to do but by the visitation of misfortune he had lost all caused by some rash business venture viola who had previously learned fancy work at school managed to keep the wolf from the door by the use of her nimble fingers

mona had never liked the young girl her fresh blonde loveliness was in such strong contrast with her brunette charms that she could not but see the difference herself and she was jealous of violas beauty she always seized every opportunity to humiliate the poor girl

viola put down the rich lace carefully on the table and waited my ladys pleasure mona after reading about fifteen minutes longer turned to the girl who had been standing all the while and asked her to bring the lace to her which she did

miss hawthorne looked it over carelessly and with a scornful toss of the head said it doesnt matter much anyhow i suppose youve been in the business long enough to know what is required and if you dont you get your pay just the same so it is i suppose a matter of indifference to you having delivered this brief cutting oration she gave it a toss that sent it to the opposite side of the table

the face of the girl flushed and there were tears glistening in her dark eyes as she picked up the lace and laying ft once more on the table said indeed miss mona i do care i wish you would examine the work and if it does not suit you you know well what to do and i will know what is required i take a pride in my work for it is all i have to support my widowed mother

the sadness in the girls voice as she uttered these last words somewhat modified mona and she said more gently as she took her purse and paid for the work very well it will suit i think youve always done your work well and i presume there is no reason why you should change at this late day and with a wave of the hand she was dismissed

the funeral was over and the will had been read

it was simple beyond a few legacies everything went to bertram heathcourt he suddenly found himself a rich man â a millionaire with more money than he knew what to do with he finished transacting business and started for the city to tell mona the news he arrived in washington late in the afternoon and as mona did not live far he set out on foot on reaching the house he stepped into the vestibule gave a quick imperative ring and handed his card to the servant who came in answer to his ring

not at home sir  said he curtly at that moment monas voice reached his ears she was singing in a clear musical voice absence 

but man  said bertram sharply i hear her voice and know she is at home 

not at home to you sir  replied the servant

and it was evident that he had been previously instructed

carry her my card immediately and tell her i wish to see her  said bertram sternly

at that moment a voice which he recognized as mrs hawthornes said who is it johnson 

its mr heathcourt maam 

what does the fellow want  she asked sharply

he wishes to see miss hawthorne maam 

she is not at home to him  she answered shortly

bertram could scarcely believe the evidence of his own ears

he turned away but had gone only a few steps when he was overwhelmed by thought

not at home to him what did it mean

then like a flash the remembrance of the little occurrence on the night of the ball came to him

he could see it all now he thought that he had solved the problem her mother must have suspected that he was proposing the night of the ball and supposing him to be a poor man did not want any alliance between her daughter and a poor editor to continue any longer

it did not occur to him that mona did not wish to see him he had seen that in her eyes when she looked at him that was different from that bestowed on any one else he thought it simply the maneuver of a worldly woman

i must see her once more if only for a moment

he muttered as he retraced his steps from the premises as far as the corner and stopped as if in dismay

i will do it he said after a moment and taking out a notebook he tore a leaf and wrote a few lines

calling a small boy who was passing and giving him a coin he bade him carry it to the address marked thereon and wait for an answer ask for miss mona and give it to no one else he said the boy darted on his errand

ten minutes passed and then he saw the boy come out of the gate and the next moment he had the answer in hand and was taking in its contents

what he read therein seemed to be a deathblow to his hopes

it was this mr heathcourt

sir â i cannot make it convenient to see you

what my mother did today in refusing you admission she did with my fullest acquiescence while i am writing this i will take advantage of the opportunity to refer to the question you asked some nights since and say that i cannot comply with your request for no other reason than that i am the betrothed wife of another â col philip clayton

what my feelings are concerning the matter it is not necessary to state in the future i prefer that we may meet simply as acquaintances it will save us both unnecessary pain and oblige mona hawthorne

he turned very white as he read it and crushing the leter in his hand he turned on his heels and with a scornful smile on his handsome face walked rapidly down the street

so thats the girl ive been wasting my time on â a contemptuous mercenary coquette i thought she was the embodiment of everything that was good noble generous and unselfish he muttered to himself contemptuously grinding his teeth in chagrin

how long he had been walking he never knew nor which way until he heard a shrill scream and turning saw a young girl struggling in the arms of a man it made the blood boil in the veins of bertram as he saw her making frantic attempts to release herself he flew to her rescue and with one well directed blow from his muscular arm the villain was felled to the ground

turning to the young girl he said i hope you are not hurt i dont think the scoundrel will molest you again

oh sir i thank you so much mother is sick and i was just returning from the doctors when i met this man and he thought to take advantage of the growing darkness to insult me

he will not trouble you more i have settled him allow me to see you in safely to your home

and with her little fluttering hand in his arm they moved away

the discomfited villain deliberately rose brushed the dirt from his clothes shaking his clenched fist at the retreating figures hissed i will repay that blow with interest curse you i hold the trump card i know you bert heathcourt and ill make you regret the day you ever saw arnold campbell and you too viola dunkirk

you shall not escape me

and being dogmatic in the foregoing statements turned and vanished in the gathering darkness and the day came in which he kept his word

pretty bessie hartwell

about a year previous to the ending of the foregoing chapter there lived in a quiet portion of the capital an old merchant by the name of archibald hartwell his wife and daughter

the head of the family was a pompous individual with a bald head keen gray eyes and thin lips that were lmost invariably compressed in a manner that was very suggestive of an iron will

his better half was a thin delicate woman with a sweet face and in spite of furrows on her forehead and lines under her brown eyes she still retained the remnants of a once beautiful face

the daughter is just the image of what the mother once was a fair complexion with red cheeks that rivaled the heart of the blush rose

brown eyes and hair a sweet little mouth that successfully concealed two rows of pearly white teeth

bessie hartwell was a trifle romantic and so it happened that when young and handsome men came to pay court to her in spite of the opposition by the father and the appeals of the mother she having become affectionately attached to one of her admirers married the father swore that he would disinherit her but that had no material effect on bessie she loved her young husband and for six whole months she was extremely happy

arnold campbell was a handsome man good bearing with dark hair and eyes but the sinister lines about the corners of his mouth were effectually concealed beneath his long drooping black mustache

so that the innocent girl who was caught in his toils had nothing to warn her of the character of the man to whom she was joined for life

when arnold campbell came from heaven knows where to washington the city was ringing with the praises of old hartwells beautiful and accomplished heiress so he made up his mind to win her and her money bags for his own

but the old man took objections he was somewhat suspicious of him being a stranger and having nothing to recommend him but his handsome face the old man swore that he was not good enough for his daughter

he had a husband picked out for her

kent howard was not handsome but was honest and true as the day is long he loved bessie with a pure and unselfish love she knew that he loved her but she said she could never love him it happened one night that he had to go into a disreputable portion of the city as he passed by a gambling hell the door was opened and a man held by three or four others was fired out on the pavement he arose bruised and bleeding and looking around his glance fell on kent he gave a start of recognition and turning fled down the street as fast as his legs could carry him but not before kent had recognized the face and form of arnold campbell

the next day he went to bessies and having heard of her infatuation for the young man tried to dissuade her from such a rash step as marrying him telling her of the occurrence of the previous night she told him he was just giving advice for selfish motives â selfinterest as she called it and wound up by telling him never to speak to her again

sad and disheartened kent left her and a few days later when he heard she had married him against the opposition of her parents he departed suddenly to try his fortune in australia

in the dining room of a cozy little cottage in the suburbs of the city sat bessie campbell on a table in the centre of the room was a neat set of tea dishes

a pot of tea and coffee is steaming on the heater in the kitchen and ever and anon she stirred the fire with housewifely precision

he is rather late tonight she murmured anxiously i wonder what can be keeping

she paused because she had just caught the sound of his well known steps on the pavement without

ah there he comes she said gladly

directly he entered his face dark as a thundercloud she went up to him timidly for of late she had often noticed just such a frown as this on his face and putting her arms about his neck tried to kiss it away

you are not looking pleased tonight arny dear

why arnold what is the matter

for he had cast her roughly from him and there was a look on his face that made her shiver with a foreboding of coming trouble

what is the matter arnold oh for pity sake dont look at me like that you frighten me what have i done she asked piteously

what have you done he echoed harshly what have you done shall i tell you ypu have been the cause of all my blighted prospects i might have been the husband of the finest and most well bred lady in the land had you not crossed my path with your pretty face and infatuated me

white as death she cowered from that angry face and trembling like an aspen as he continued now i am tired of you yes you may as well start i am tired of you and we must part this night â aye this hour forever

the hopeless misery and despair would have touched the heart of a fiend but his hatred for her blinded him to her sufferings

arnold why did you marry me if you did not love me she asked piteously oh arnold and her voice was like the last wail of a lost spirit

why did i marry you ha ha why did i marry you silence followed for a moment the laugh which had just ceased was one which made her blood run icy cold in her veins why indeed because i thought your old duffer of a father would finally forgive you and take his children with a sneer to his heart and i would obtain the money bags that i had risked so much to obtain but i have failed in my expectations so i will have to make a change in life i will go to pastures new where a man of my beauty can make life a success

to be truthful bessie i am in love with a pretty damsel â very pretty he continued very candidly and i dont want any encumbrance in the shape of a wife you understand

and he laughed pleasantly unmindful of the fact that a heart was breaking

bessie had fallen into a seat and sat looking into the fire with eyes as black as night from suppressed excitement suddenly she raised her head and asked him in a voice that was calm at least you will let me have my marriage certificate â all in the world i have that will bind me to the old days

a wicked thought shot through his subtle brail

like light and he said after remaining as if in deep thought yes i will let you have it but unfortunately it is in my other coat pocket at the club room i lost heavily tonight that is why i forgot it at any rate you can have it meet me tomorrow night at ten oclock at the old wharf and you shall have it

lost heavily

then he was a gambler this man whom she thought was the embodiment of everything that was noble and grand and she had wronged cruelly wronged poor kent howard and he had loved her

after a short silence arnold said i am glad to see you taking the matter so philosophically you are still beautiful and you may yet make a great match and marry some wealthy old dog

and seeing the horror depicted on her face at the idea of marrying one man while she had a husband living he laughed a low mocking laugh and just then bessie looked tip into his eyes and cried pitifully under thy protection arnold oh let me live let me be thine own

growing to thee more utterly unbearing and upborne till outward things are only as they share in thee a part

look kindly on me let me love thee more

bless me from the deep fullness of thy heart so that my love in its right strength may rise and nevermore pine shrink and thrill

oh love me arnold willst thou love me still

arnold then opened the door and vanished

alone friendless penniless not one friend in all the world to whom she could confide her troubles

these were the thoughts that rushed through bessies mind and then all her pentup grief burst forth in a flood of glorious tears and throwing herself face downward before the fire she wept until she was completely exhausted

when she arose the fire had died out and the faint light shining in the window fold her that day was breaking

she arose and arranging her disheveled hair put on a street dress and giving one last look around the place where she had known such supreme happiness and oh such misery she slowly wended her way into the quiet dawn of the early morning

chapter iv

betrothed casually

when betram heathcourt accompanied viola to her humble little home a iitle thrill ran through every fibre of his being as she turned her innocent dark eyes on him in bidding her good night he could not understand the interest he had suddenly taken in a strange girl he called the next day to inquire after the health of her mother every morning on going out on the piazza viola would find a beautiful bouquet of fresh violets with her name attached to it

so often did they come that she had come to look for them regularly but she would not acknowledge even to herself that she knew from whom they came â that they came from the handsome young stranger whose blue eyes were always before her

every day bertram could be seen at the cottage ostensibly to inquire after the invalid but in fact to be in company with viola who had taken complete possession of his heart

yes bertram heathcourt loved the girl with the strong passionate love that comes to a mans heart but once in a life time and beside which his infatuation for mona had vanished into insignificance she had taken complete possession of him his every heart throb every pulse beat was for her and her alone before he had known her a week he realized that she was the one woman in all the world for him

he was surprised at the intensity of his love

what has become of my love for mona he asked himself in dismay can a man transfer his affections whenever he wishes and so easily too

no bertram he cannot but when a man loves he generally loves something that is good noble and lovable about the object of his love and when all that is good noble and lovable about the object dies why naturally his love dies with it

so it was with bertram he loved or thought he loved mona for her nobility of nature her uprightness of character and unselfishness

and when he found that those virtues had ceased to exist his infatuation died and he found that his every thought belonged to another

and viola well she hardly knew her own heart

she could not understand this sweet new happiness that had recently come into her life that made the earth seem brighter and her pleased with every thing in it she had caught herself more than once watching impatiently for his coming and blushed a rosy red as she realized what she was doing

pshaw what right have i â a poor lacemaker â to think of the rich and handsome mr heathcourt of hcathcourt park

he only comes here to inquire after mother because he is kind and good and likes to please so i will not think of him any more

but she did think of him again â times without number

she could not cease to do so every way she turned his frank blue eyes rose up before her his musical voice rang in her ears she tried to shake off the strange feeling but could not dimly she began to realize that she had given her heart to him â that her heart had left her irrevocably left her

one afternoon she was standing on the stoop watching the beautiful sunset her face wore a sweet pensive expression and she murmured over and over again bertram bertram i wonder what he is doing now i wonder what he is thinking of now bertram i wonder if he knows how completely he has taken possession of my life he is my world i love him

i love you bertram my darling oh god i how i love you 

then be my wife  whispered a low musical voice in her ear as she was embraced passionately to the broad bosom of bertram heathcourt

she had unconsciously been uttering her thoughts aloud and she failed to hear the light steps of bertram as he came quick ly up the green walk and found out her little secret

she lifted her eyes with a startled frightened glance at his face as she lay close to his throbbing heart

love her a poor working girl and he a cultured man of fortune she was speechless terrified she could have been satisfied to love him without any return and would have been happy in the loving she could scarcely believe her senses surely you must have seen viola how completely my life is wrapped up in you  continued the low voice in impassioned tones that thrilled her to her hearts core

without you â ah god would not be so cruel as to separate us â my life would he a blank speak to me dear will you be my wife 

your wife  she gasped breaking away from him and attempting to flee but he caught her fluttering little hand and held it tighly

your wife and i â i a poor working girl and you

yes and you the only woman in the world for me 

you love me dont you 

yes  she said very softly but â 

then nothing shall ever separate us 

there was to be a grand opera at the criterion theatre mona and her mother had procured tickets the theatre was crowded from pit to dome mona and her mother escorted by col clayton occupied one of the boxes and had in full view the play

mona looked lovely in a black silk with rich black lace and diamonds on her shapely wrist in her hair and a costly opera shawl thrown carelessly around her shoulders

col clayton felt his heart swell with all a lovers pride as he saw the admiration she had evinced

at the end of the third act a few acquaintances made their way into the box and they all began chatting gayly

someone casually mentioned the name of heathcourt and mona felt her heart give a heavy bump continuing rapidly and in spite of herself her cheek crimsoned

speaking of heathcourt  remarked one young man with a drawl edgar he is a lucky fellow

have you heard the news 

news  echoed some one else no let us hear it 

oh it is just like a novel some old uncle or cousin whom he had never heard about before had done his father a great wrong when young and in order to atone has left bertram his wealth and one of the finest estates in

hello by jove what is the matter with mrs

clayton mona she is fainting

it was indeed true mona had heard those terrible words and the lights began whirling around and there was a dull roaring in her ears and without a word of warning she had fainted and would have fallen had not col clayton put out his arm and saved her

mrs heathcourt closed the curtains quickly for of all things she dreaded this scene was the worst and hastening over to her daughter she bathed her face in can de cologne and directly she revived

rouse yourself she hissed fiercely giving her a vicious pinch do you want to lose all remember how much is at stake

with a mighty effort she recovered her selfpossession and said with a ghastly attempt at a smile it is nothing only â only the heat is so oppressive

i think she continued turning to col clayton that i will go home it is so very hot

he complied in moody silence for a certain suspicion had come into his mind

why did she faint at the mentioning of his name

he remembered the day when she had consented to be his wife how carelessly she had consented and also that look she had given him when he first entered the room

can it be possible that she married me for my money oh perish the thought i would take my life on her honor but why did she faint at the mention of his name the day came when he knew why she fainted only too well and he cursed the day he had ever seen her

arnold and mona wreak vengeance

the whole city was ringing with the news of the impending marriage of the handsome young millionaire to the daughter of one of the poorest but who was once one of washingtons most respected citizens it was discussed at the table in the clubs and at all the social gatherings

there are two persons the news had a very serious effect upon arnold campbell heard it with all the chagrin and rage of a wicked man who sees his victim escaping from his clutches

mona heard it with the bitterness of death in her heart and she realized that she had lost all that was best and brightest of her youth â her love she also realized how happy she could have been with bertram if she had not been such a fool

that the very girl she hated and whom she had feared as a rival had won the love of the man who was all the world to her increased her hatred tenfold

that night at ten oclock bessie appeared at the wharf the place agreed upon to obtain her marriage certificate she had a haggard careworn look about her which was pitiful to see she walked slowly and feebly to the wharf and glanced around to see if her husband had put in an appearance he had not yet come and bessie set herself to the task of waiting

she stood up by one of the huge posts used to make the boats fast and gave herself up to deep thought

how long she stood there she never knew but a rustling sound reached her ears and turning quickly she had just time to give one piercing shriek when a heavy blow struck her on the temple and she toppled over there was a sudden splash and the waters closed over bessie campbell

at the same time there came a hollow groan to the ear of the wouldbe assassin and dropping his instrument of death he turned and flew down the road as if pursued by seven devils

it was a terrible thing to do he muttered when he had stopped to rest but it is better for she was in my way and i have sworrt to possess viola dunkirk she shall be mine he continued fiercely all the opposition on earth shall not come between she and me

and there was no chance for me to do so while bessie was alive

uugh with a shudder how she did scream

he thought i would not like to undertake the job again and he began feeling his pockets for his handkerchief for great beads of perspiration had broken out over his face

suddenly he stopped short pale as death and began feeling more hastily in his pockets in a nervous manner

its gone he gasped hoarsely and they will find it in the morning and it will be all up with me when the body is found and â great heaven â the certificate was wrapped up in it and then the hounds of the law will have a clew as tb the motive for the deed and â and i cannot go back to look for it

that voice â that voice â i wonder â fool fool that i was to bring it with me i might have known that would be my luck

the baffled villain beat his forehead and gnashed his teeth in a paroxysm of baffled rage

bessie had not been knocked senseless her turning so opportunely and the blinding flash of the lightning had made the blow less effective than it would have been under different circumstances

as soon as she struck the water it had a revivifying effect upon her and being a good swimmer she struck out boldly for the wharf

just as she was clinging to the wharf for dear life  there came a hurrying of feet upon the pier and half dead with fatigue and fright she still clung to one of the pier posts there was another vivid flash of lightning and by the light of it she saw that it was a negro bending over the side of the pier looking anxiously at the place where she had struck the water

she felt her strength failing her and when she saw it was not her husband she called in a weak voice for help

bress de lord said a voice she is alive hold on tight dearie and yousell be all right in a minnit

and the next moment she was safe on the pier

then all her strength seemed to fail her and she sank into unconsciousness

the old colored man looking around for something to bathe her face as he did not have a handkerchief saw by the dim light of the moon which had been previously hidden by clouds something white a little distance away

he stooped and picked it up and saw that it was a handkerchief

umph whats dis he muttered as he felt something hard on the inside ill just stick it in my pocket an lave missus face and carry her home to de ole oman an in de mornin she kin see wot it is specs its a letter some ob de white folks lost today an if tis i can gib it to em in de mornin

and with this he went to bathing bessies face and chafing her hands and as she didnt come around he stooped and took her in his strong arms and set out for his own little cabin which he reached in a very short time

old steve jenkins an old colored man who had lived with his wife in washington for years notwithstanding the blackness of his skin had as good and true a heart as ever beat in human breast

he had been standing in his cabin door looking at the threatenening clouds and considering the advisibility of going to an all night camp meeting about three miles distance the voices of the attendants at which meeting was borne to him on the summer stillness when chancing to look around he saw the figure of a woman plodding in the direction of the pier

his cabin door was open and the light from a wax candle was streaming out across the road which afforded him a good view of her as she went on her way it was such an unusual thing to see and several persons having been found drowned lately his suspicions were aroused he thought the woman contemplated suicide so he determined to be on the watch and prevent such an act if possible

so he walked along in the path behind and saw her make her way to the pier and after glancing around as if in search of some one lean against a post in an attitude of deep thought steve took up his position in one of the empty freight houses and watched her curiously

after the lapse of half an hour he was surprised to see a man come quickly on the pier and after glancing around started softly toward the silent figure

he began to think them lovers and was just fixing to retrace his steps when he saw the man raise his hand that had something in it that resembled a black jack or billy as soon as he realized the intention of the man he stopped as if rooted to the spot being stricken with horror he could not repress a groan when that blow was struck hence arnolds hasty flight

when it was time to keep his appointment with bessie he took his certificate of marriage and wrapping it in his handkerchief he put it in his pocket

his object in doing this was to present it to her in case he should find her on the alert and when she would reach out her hand eagerly to take it he would fell her to the ground

so arming himself with a billy he set out with the result known he went to a hotel engaging a room and retired but that last scream kept ringing continually in his ears and the fear that the lost certificate would fall into hands he did not desire it should would not let him sleep until very late when he fell into a deep slumber and slept far into the morning

when steve reached home he knocked on the door and seeing his curious burden his wife uttered a cry of dismay

sakes alive mercy on us wot is datar you got stebe  just move an let me come in an see wot you can do fur her while i make a fire an heat up de room an den ill told you all bout it  and depositing his burden tenderly on a well worn lounge he soon had a bright fire burning the wife sat chafing bessies hands and bathing her face steve smoking his pipe told the circumstances of the night

de lawd hab mercy  exclaimed clory at the conclusion he sartainly must be a debbil to hit dis buful crittur golly how pale she is and how soft her lilly hands is she suttinly must be a lady she is so â 

clory paused for bessie had opened her brown eyes and sitting bolt upright was staring around in bewilderment

where am i  she asked how came i â oh i remember all now and you saved me how kind of you but who are you 

dats all right honey  said aunt clory but youse in good hands but youse mustnt zert yerself itll be all de wuss fur yer jest lay down now and youse kin go ter sleep while you clothes is adrying  and so saying the good old colored woman hustled off and soon returned with dry clothing

steve stepped into the next room and clory dressed bessie in them and when he returned she was sleeping like a tired child in the clean white bed of clorys

chapter v

to meet only as acquaintances

a day or two after mona had heard of bertrams marriage she wrote him a note requesting an interview with him

she was beside herself with impatience

i must see him again if only for a moment she muttered

when bertram received it a scornful smile passed over his face poor thing he said musingly

poor thing after all the wrong she has done me i pity her but i cannot do as she wishes it is better as she said that we meet simply as acquaintances

it will save unnecessary embarrassment

so he penned her the following short note miss hawthorne i have just received your note and regret to state that a prevous engagement prevents my being able to see you at the time named

besides i think it is better that in the future we meet only as acquaintances and oblige bertram heathcourt

he could not resist the opportunity for such a retaliatory reply

when he had completed the letter he despatched a servant to post it immediately

he had been at heathcourt park about two days having been called on business of importance

when it was completed he started to the city for he was longing for a sight of his loved one

it was in the afternoon of the last day in july when bertram arrived at the unpretentious cottage of viola dunkirk he found that lady under the arbor at the side of the house stitching away at some fancy work that lay in her lap

it was a beautiful picture as she sat under the shade of the green vines with the evening light on her face in her simple white robe with red sash tied loosely around her waist and a spray of violets in her hair

bertram standing under one of the great old cedars in the yard drank in her every movement and he could not but compare her to all the women of his acquaintance immediately a great wave of tender love came over him stepping quickly up to her he took her in his arms and showered kisses on her eyes brow hair and ripe rosy mouth murmuring words of passionate deathless love

viola viola my love my life my all he murmured and his voice was full of impassioned fine enthusiasm bless you my life is crowned with its chief blessing you are mine viola mine â all mine

almost bereft of physical strength by her great love for him she lay with her face hidden on the broad bosom of her impulsive lover for many moments at last she raised herself moved back a little and looked up into bertrams face her own blushing in sweet confusion and her eyes radiant with loving glances

do you really love me so much she faltered her eyelids drooping bashfully

love you why my darling what would be my life without you i shudder to think of it why do you ask dearest

because â because you are so â so far above me

you are such a fine gentleman that i â i am almost afraid to marry you people will say that i married you for selfish reasons but â but you know better dont you bertram you know it is because i â i love you more than i can tell oh bertram if anything should happen to part us i should die i love you so and she cast her arms about his neck and sobbed happy tears it was the first voluntary confession he had ever had from her lips and he kissed her tenderly when she made it as he he said nothing shall ever part us dear

and so these silly actions of which lovers never weary was kept up until the golden sun had sunk to rest and the clock in a neighboring church tower brought to violas mind other thoughts

how selfish i have been i must go and look after mother poor mother she said sadly she seems to be getting worse i have to be very careful of her any little excitement might prove fatal

they had strolled on to the gate and were taking leave of each other

i want you to think a good deal tonight dearest for i want you to name the date the next time i see you

the next time i see you how many things can be done before that time and in after days bertram realized it

mona in rage â mrs dunkirk dies

when mona received bertrams letter she and her mother were sitting in the drawing room she read it over slowly and her face became pale with suppressed passion suddenly she sprang to her feet her face distorted with rage and she hissed it is all her fault she has won my love from me i â i could kill her with my own hand beware viola dunkirk how you cross my path you will regret it

her mother looked at her evil face with a sort of terror she had never seen her daughter like this before

my dear mona she began you must not give way to passion like this you must control yourself

it is too late to indulge in vain regrets you have selected your own destiny now stick to it

i selected my own destiny i how can you say such a thing who was it that poisoned my mind against marrying bertram who was it that told me to angle for philip clayton and forget the beggarly editor the one i might have won from the first it was only a matter of time and short at that you did â you who never did love anyone but yourself and dont even know the meaning of the term and then you stand there and tell me i selected my own destiny and her lips curled in with a haughty scorn

the old lady winced at these homethrusts she knew that every word was true but it galled her to have her daughter to speak to her in that manner

so rallying she said sternly hush how dare you speak to me like that and i your mother too then you must never speak of bertram in that marker again he is nothing to you â nothing just suppose mr clayton were to hear of it he would never

i dont care a fig for old clayton blazed mona

i hate him loath him and it is as much as i can do to keep from telling him so sometimes if it were not for him and his filthy lucre i would now be happy in the love of bertram â the only man i ever will love and wheeling around she came face to face with col philip clayton

he was very pale and there was a cold glitter in his grey eyes as he said sneeringly so â so that is why you consented to be my wife ell i might have known it i wondered at your coldness of manner toward me but i thought probably it was just your natural way i find out that i am mistaken however i never saw more passion in anyones face he continued with withering sarcasm than there was in yours while speaking of bertram heathcourt there is no fool like an old fool but i fear i must disappoint you about the filthy lucre however miss hawthorne i bid you and your mother adieu and with mocking gravity he bowed himself out leaving the two astonished women looking at each other in helpless dismay

the old lady recovered herself first and going deliberately up to her daughter she caught her arm in a vicelike grip and gave her a good shaking

mona you have done it now she said harshly

when mona with flashing eyes had shaken herself free

you have lost the love of colonel clayton and he will never forgive you you will learn to take my advice yet

i have taken your advice too much now retorted the daughter thats why i lost bertrams love

this is another debt between viola dunkirk and myself that has to be cancelled she went on harshly i am going to wreak a terrible vengeance on her â a terrible vengeance

her mother thought it was simply the raving of a disappointed woman but the day came in which she remembered her words and cursed the day in which mona had ever known viola

mona suddenly left the room and proceeded to her chamber going to the window she looked out

the sun was just seting and the earth was bathed in a flood of golden light the birds were singing their good night songs a few pleasure seekers were just returning from their trip and their gay laughter was borne out on the still air of the lovely roving afternoon

but mona had eyes for none of these she was thinking â thinking a plan so diabolical had entered her scheming mind that she shuddered to think of it but it did not deter her no warning voice whispered to her that though it might go smoothly for a while that god in his infinite love and mercy would never allow it to succeed

so she went headlong into the plot that was to recoil on her own head and be her doom

after standing there about half an hour she turned with a low laugh of exultation and said now for the first move toward love and vengeance going to the desk she took out paper pen and ink putting bertrams leter before her she wrote the following in his writing dear miss dunkirk i am very sorry to say that from the force of circumstances i am compelled to ask you to consider yourself free from any alliance with me i thought truly that i loved you but i find my heart has turned to its old allegiance i find that i love her more dearly than ever and hope to be able to claim miss hawthornes hand in a very short while hoping that you will consider yourself as i do dead to me i remain respectfully bertram heathcourt 

having written this she called a servant and telling him to mail it early in the morning she sat down to think of the second movement toward love and vengeance

chapter vi

returns and finds mother dead

viola watched her love out of sight and slowly turned toward the house if i should lose him i believe it would kill me  she murmured musingly

she entered the house its stillness struck her strangely quickening her pace she continued to her mothers room

mother  she called as she reached the closed door mother may i come in it is only i â your daughter  she received no answer a horrible fear shot through the girls heart what if she were worse or perhaps â but no no perish the thought 

but despite this little assurance she opened the door rather quickly and what she saw never left her mind on the bed in the corner pale as snow lay her mother â dead

mother  screamed the girl mother speak to me it is viola â your child  but no answer came from these pale still lips if they were not cold in death no power on earth could have prevented her from answering when that dear voice called

mother oh mother continued that agonized voice oh why did you leave me all alone mother let me die and go with you too and throwing herself on that dear breast she wept as if her heart would break how long she lay she did not know but soon she caught the noise of closing doors and muffled tread and into the room came three women

they were neighbors and were on their back piazza chatting pleasantly when that agonizing scream reached their ears they knew of the illhealth of mrs dunkirk and suspected the cause of the cry so they hastily went over to see if they could render any assistance

viola lay in a halfstupefied condition while one bore her light form to her room the others performed the last sad offices of the dead

they remained all night at watch by the corpse each taking turns to watch by the bedside of viola who lay tossing on her pillow over half the night murmuring always in the same monotonous strain mother oh my mother let me go with you

she fell to sleep far into the night and slept till late the next day she arose calm and collected for she knew she had to cease repining and turn her attention to the practical side of life she dressed herself in a dress of deep black and going downstairs she softly opened the door of the death chamber and stepped in she went up to the couch on which the corpse lay and drawing a chair close by the side of it she gazed long and earnestly on the face of her mother finally she arose slowly and with tears in her eyes said betram is all i have left i am alone in the world

she looked around the room and seeing a letter on the table she went over to see to whom it was addressed there were two of them on the table one without envelope she saw that they were in the familiar handwriting of her mother

one was addressed to bertram the other to herself and marked to be read at once she read as follows my darling daughter when you read this letter i will have gone from you forever please mail the letter at once to bertram heathcourt you have been a good child â a good daughter to your mother and i bless you for it i have been watching the growing intimacy between you and bertram with pleasure

you will marry him i am sure and i am glad â very glad â for more than one reason be a good wife to him be sure and mail the letter to him justice depends on his receiving it goodby my child and may god forever bless you is the fervent wish of your mother

she wept freely over this letter but she could not understand how justice depended on bertrams receiving it she had half a notion to open it but the temptation was shortlived she could not betray her trust to the dead so she sat down and wrote him a loving letter informing him of her mothers death and asked him to come to her then putting a bonnet on and covering her face with a thick veil she went out to mail them

that afternoon the funeral took place viola had saved a little money of her own â enough to bury her parent decently and without the assistance of any charitable institution

after the funeral she was sitting in her room taking comfort from her bible when there came a quick ring at her door bell she arose hastily and went to the door it was the mail carrier he handed her a letter and tearing it open eagerly she read it when she finished her cheeks were ghastly pale and giving a low moan she clutched at her heart convulsively and sank into a deep swoon

chapter vii

lost letter

when viola recovered from her swoon it was dark

at first she could not remember what had happened

but gradually the truth downed upon her mind and with a low moan she staggered to her feet and wended her way to her room

one of the neighbors consented to remain with her for several days â until she became used to the loneliness viola told her she was going to lie down as she had a severe headache but the next day found her unable to leave her room the terrible strain on her nervous system had been so great for the last twentyfour hours that for two days she was utterly prostrated when she began to feel better she remembered the necessity of her finding some work so she gave up the house and with what little money she had she secured cheaper rooms in a different section of the city

bertram was not at home when violas mail arrived a servant went to the village post office for the mail when he was returning home he noticed that the horse he was riding was unusually restless

the servant thought he was thirsty so he went down to the watering place with him to give him a drink

as ill luck would have it some persons in skiffs were passing at the time and as the horse stepped into the water to drink they sent up a loud shout of jollity the horse became frightened and reared the suddenness of the movement caused the servant to lose his equilibrium and in recovering dropped some of the letters in the water as fate would have it violas own letter was among them and before the man could do anything to save them they were whirled out into the middle of the stream and went floating swiftly down toward the ocean the man was very much frightened but he decided not to say anything about it and of course nobody would know of it

when bertram arrived after two days absence he read his mail the letter from mrs dunkirk had a great effect upon him it read thus dear mr heathcourt â i am dying i know you love my daughter and i wish you would come and take charge of her right away for when you receive this letter i shall be in eternity mr heathcourt i will take this opportunity to tell you something strange which happened in my youthful days when i was a young girl in england a young and handsome man came from america and made love to me i loved him dearly and after a while married him we were very happy for about a year in the meantime my baby viola was born

during one of our confidential chats he told me of a great wrong he had done his brother how they both had loved the same woman and his brother being the favored one he had revenged himself upon him by informing his father of the affair how his father disinherited his brother after he had married her and the fortune went to him i was shocked horrified and i chided him for his sin a coldness sprang up between us and every day we drifted further apart until he left me altogether i was alone except for my baby viola i need not go into details

suffice it to say that he gave me money enough to educate my child and keep us from immediate want

he left a note also informing me that i never was his wife he had deceived me the man who performed the ceremony was simply some one gotten for the occasion a man by the name of dunkirk a good man became acquainted with my story he pitied me and finally made me his wife and gave my daughter â my nameless child â the shelter and protection of his honorable name

a few years after we came to america to try our fortune and while my daughter was at school i with the assistance of my husband and detectives managed to get on the track of the man who had wronged me intending that justice should be done his child at least he living under a fictitious name made it very difficult for us to run him to earth and when we were just about to close in on him he died the next news that my detective brought was that he had done justice to the son of the brother he had wronged and had installed him in the place that was his by right of birth

the man that wronged me was richard heathcourt your uncle i watched your growing intimacy with my daughter with pleasure for i knew that a great wrong would be partially righted if you finally married her you say you love her i leave her young life into your hands be a good husband to my child and you will well merit the dying blessing of catherine dunkirk 

when bertram finished the letter he sat staring straight before him at last he said in a very low tone poor woman i guess she is dead now this letter is two days old how she must have suffered

but how much more happily she would have died if she had only known that her child was legitimate i must go down immediately and see after the welfare of my little viola my little darling be a good husband to her may the lord deal with me as i deal with her

he arose as he spoke this last and ordered the carriage

half an hour later he was speeding toward the city

arriving there he appeared at the house where viola had once lived and when he was informed that her mother was buried and that viola had gone off without giving any address he avas well nigh frantic

she was looking mighty strange and queerlike poor thing i shouldnt wonder if she â the woman paused for bertram had rushed out of the gate and down the street like a madman crying viola viola where are you

on and on he ran wildly his face ghastly pale

people stopped to look at him curiously wondering if he was some escaped lunatic but bertram turned neither to the right nor to the left but kept on at a dead run until national yelled a newsboy full account of the drowned girl

the words struck upon bertram strangely he stopped short

extra sir inquired the boy seeing him stop so suddenly quickly bertram paid him for one and glancing at it read the following found drowned a young and beautiful girl about five feet six inches tall dressed in mourning golden hair dark eyes beautiful teeth the rest of the features are so mutilated that she cannot be further described body at undertaker pinkhams awaiting identification

my god  gasped bertram that description tallies with viola i believe it is she i must go and see at once  and wheeling about he called a cab and said to pinkhams undertaking establishment swift as you can double fare 

the driver needed no second bidding the horse fairly flew over the hard ground and in ten minutes he was before the door of the undertaker

paying the cabman he went up the stairs three at a time

i want to see the body the body of the drowned girl  he said when he was in the presence of the undertaker the undertaker looked at him and seeing the anxiousness in his face escorted him to the bedside of the corpse and pulled back the sheet from her face

bertram gave one swift glance great heavens

how i loved her  and fell down by the dead body writhing in an agony of grief that he could give no utterance to except by heartrending groans presently he felt a touch on his arm and looking up he found the undertaker looking at him pityingly the good man was really touched by the young fellows grief

do you recognize her  he asked gently

recognize her  bertram exclaimed recognize her yes she was all i had in the world my viola my own viola 

poor fellow  murmured the good man with streaming eyes but you may be mistaken see

the face is somewhat mutilated 

ah no i cannot be mistaken it is she see

the golden hair the dark eyes and long lashes the white even teeth the sweet lips that i have kissed over and over again it is she i know it oh viola my lost love 

whew the violence of his grief had somewhat abated he said to the undertaker give her a christian burial and charge it to bertram heathcourt  on that day he attended the funeral he brought some violets her favorite flowers and put them on her grave and long after everyone had left he sat there by the side of that grave trying to think what his life was worth now

he finally left the cemetery for the city and as he wended his way up the gravel path of his own home he told himself that his heart was dead within him and buried in the grave of his lost viola

chapter viii

letter found

two days had passed since mona had taken her first step toward love and vengeance on the afternoon of the second day she was feeling very restless and thought she would take a row on the river for a change so she dressed herself in a neat boating costume and calling for a carriage she was driven to the boathouse on the great potomac she hired a little shell of a boat and was soon skimming over the smooth water like a swallow on the wind she rowed up the river about two miles and dropping the oars let the little boat drift with the current

after drifting about half a mile she looked over toward the shore and saw a pretty little place and the notion struck her to go there seizing the oars she steered for it it was indeed a pretty little spot the dark water was almost entirely still schools of small fish frisked about sportingly casting miniature waves along its smooth surface the tall white oak trees that lined the shore and the long drooping willows that hung far out over the water made it a lovely little cove that would have been dear to the heart of any romantic person mona rowed her boat under one of the trees and gave herself up to thought she had been sitting about half an hour looking into the water with an unusual degree of pensiveness when she noticed something white being borne slowly on the water toward her closer and closer it came and then she saw that it was a letter

she leaned out to reach it but the movement caused a wavelet or two to take it farther from her boat

standing up quickly she reached up and broke off a slim branch from one of the willows and with this she slowly fished it toward her and succeeded in grasping it she looked at it in perplexity

where had she seen that writing before and great heaven for bertram heathcourt she opened it with as little compunction as she would had it been her own and read the loving letter written by viola to her loved one when she finished her brow was as black as a thundercloud

fate favors me she laughed harshly suppose he had received this it would have knocked all my plans in the head but i wonder how it came to be in the river

she remained about five minutes longer in deep thought

i will do it she exclaimed after all the end justifies the means i will go to his house and see him if he will not come to me

so saying she seized the oars and turning the boat around she sent it flying down the stream as swift as an arrow from a bow

and so began the second plan toward love and vengeance

bertram heathcourt was sitting in the library with an open book in front of him staring straight at the leaves as if he would read his future there when there came a tap at his door he started slightly

come he said and in answer to the summons a footman opened the door

a lady to see you sir said he

a lady in surprise i wonder who it can be

she did not send her card she simply said that she must see you as it is important

wondering greatly as to who his nightly visitor could be he descended to the drawing room

you he exclaimed in astonishment you mona â miss hawthorne and here great heaven

you must be mad to come here

it was indeed mona her face was very pale and there was a determined compression about her lips and a light in her eyes not good to see

call it madness or what you will i am here and i must ask you a few questions what do you wish to know asked bertram hesitatingly

there was a few moments pause and then she answered i would like to know if you love that pauper viola dunkirk and if you are going to marry her

bertram stood as if rooted to the spot what did it mean was not everybody aware of violas death

you do not answer she continued seeing his hesitation

at last he recovered himself and asked is it possible miss hawthorne that you do not know that viola dunkirk is dead

mona started violently was this true the girl she feared â dead

no â no i did not know it to herself she said if i cannot win him now i have not the power over the male sex that i once had and may as well give him up

there was a long pause which was at last broken by mona who asked

did you love her

did i love her in surprise do you think i would ask her to be my wife if i did not

true true and yet â oh bertram when did you cease to love me â i who loved you first and best after asking me to be your wife to fall in love with that beggar girl even while the words were yet warm on your lips

she looked at him beseechingly her eyes were streaming with tears

bertram was astonished

i beg your pardon he said a little coldly but if viola was a poor girl she was a lady in every sense of the word and she was not a coquette he continued meaningly i would rather you would not speak of her in that irreverent manner

this defence of the girl she hated and above all the covert sjieer in his words to sting her almost drove her to madness

she had no right to come between us â to rob me of my love she cried springing to her feet her black eyes flashing i loved you first and best she had no right to take you from me why did you cast my love back in my teeth after winning my heart

you forget that you are the one to whom that accusation might be applied he said sternly after giving me every reason to believe that you loved me to reject me because i was a beggarly editor and accept col philip clayton because he was wealthy

for one single moment mona was disconcerted â only for a moment instantly a plan shot through her subtle brain and she proceeded to act upon it

chapter ix

mrs hawthornes deceit

beggarly editor col clayton wealthy she said opening her eyes wide in mock amazement what on earth do you mean i do not understand you

explain yourself

bertrams face darkened do you mean to say that you did not write a note to me in answer to a request to see you after your mother had refused me admission to her home informing me that you were engaged to col clayton and that you preferred we should meet hereafter simply as acquaintances

no bertram no i did not write any such note

she said with innocent quietness nor have i received one from you requesting an interview

here he said taking from his pocket the letter in question there look at that and tell me you did not write it

she turned a shade paler as she gazed on die note that had been the death blow to her own hopes and said tremulously no i did not write it oh

heavens i see it very plainly now who would have believed it the one too who should have made my happiness her chief study oh it is cruel

and the hypocrite actually shed tears as she gave utterance to these incoherent words

bertram had not the faintest idea what her words implied he sat watching her in perplexity directly he said what is it miss hawthorne why do you go on in that strain

it is enough to break my heart she said with a hysterical sob wringing her hands then turning abruptly man cant you understand cant you see that that is forgery 

a swift pallor shot across his face what if it were a forgery but it was closely followed by a look of incredulity

a forgery how can it be who could have any object in doing such a thing 

my mother  she said sharply

bertram started but the note i sent you the boy who carried it said he gave it to you as i instructed him to do 

the boy prevaricated  she said sharply i heard him ring and came to the head of the stairs my mother answered the bell and i heard her say what is it i want to see miss mona  answered he ive got a note for her  give it to me i will deliver it  my mother said it seemed as if the boy hesitated

give it here this instant  said mother stamping her foot the boy must have been frightened into complying for i heard mother say now wait for an answer  soon i heard the door slam and knowing that he was gone i came down to see what it was all about what is it mother  i asked it is nothing but an invitation to the opera  she remarked carelessly mother was always at liberty to open my letters so i thought no more of it that night we attended the opera and some one made a remark about your being engaged to that â that viola dunkirk and half dead with unrequitted love i accepted col clayton the next day partly at his earnest request and partly out of spite my mother whom i trusted and whom i believed the soul of honor betrayed me and now ive lost all that is worth living for  and she cast herself dejectedly into a chair and burst afresh into angry tears

bertram felt really sorry that she loved him so well â sorry that he could not respond to her love

the idea that she had uttered a deliberate falsehood never for once entered his mind he did not believe that this girl in order to gain the ends of her own selfish heart would be willing to sacrifice her mother

her mother though a scheming woman loved her dearly and did all of her scheming for her daughters sake after sitting some minutes in deep thought he said i am very sorry for you mona â very sorry

but what can i do

what can you do she echoed eagerly you can make me your wife you need not look so shocked i have no pride now why cant a woman plead for her love just as a man the foolish world debars a woman from obeying the dictates of her own heart when she ought to be allowed to do so her love is all she has oh bertram let me be your wife

she had come close to him and rested her hand pleadingly on his arm looking him directly in the eyes

he moved back a little as he said impossible miss hawthorne i cannot do as you suggest

why cant you

for the simple reason that i do not love you

see my pulse does not thrill at your touch my heart does not throb more quickly it would be wrong to marry you

you used to love me once â until she came between us oh bertram if you do not marry me i shall die my heart is broken

it is no light thing for a man to have a young and beautiful woman standing before him with teardimmed eyes and tell him in a woebegone voice that her heart is broken especially when she is inclined to lay the cause of it at his door no wonder then that bertram seeing her sorrow felt touched by her pleadings and after thinking deeply said mona you have suffered and i seem to be indirectly the cause of your suffering if therefore i can make atonement for the unintentional wrong i will consent to do as you wish i will strive to make you happy and to be a good husband to you but i tell you frankly my heartis dead and the ashes can never be kindled will you accept me at such an expense

yes gladly my own bertram she murmured twining her fair arms around his neck and kissing him passionately the light of a deathless love shining in her eyes she thinks love like mine cannot fail to win love in return

he drew her head down on his bosom and implanted a cold kiss on her forehead and they were betrothed finally he said it is late taking out his watch and the last train goes by in half an hour sit here while i order the carriage he ordered the carriage which soon came around to the entrance and in a short time they were at the station

he had just arrived when he noticed the slender figure of a woman closely veiled come staggering into the waitingroom and in a weary voice ask for a ticket for washington it seemed as if she could hardly stand as she walked on toward the train after receiving her ticket bertram with inherent courtesy offered to assist her but shrinking from him she made some inaudible refusal and passed on there seemed to be something strangely familiar about her to bertram but after vainly trying to think where he had seen her before he dismissed the occurrence from his mind but oh with what force was it recalled in after days

chapter x

violas new home â warning to banker

when viola dunkirk left her home she went to the house of one of her friends and remained to dinner at her friends earnest request in the afternoon they set out together to find a place where viola could obtain comfortable lodging in a respectable portion of the city late in the afternoon they succeeded in finding one ini the suburbs of the city â a pretty white vinewreathed cottage before which was a copse of stately oaks it was owned by a good old widow who had been living all alone and who was just wishing some one would come and take rooms and relieve her of the dullness viola liked her new home very much and decided to move in immediately that night about nine oclock she announced her intention of going to transact some important business

it was rather late for her to go out but that did not deter her in fact viola was longing for a sight of her lover and the idea came to her that if she went to his home she might obtain a last glimpse of him before she started out on her dreary road tomorrow to earn her bread so wrapping a heavy shawl around her shoulders and conceding her face in a thick veil she went to the depot and purchased a ticket took a seat aboard the train and was soon at bville station arriving there she asked the station master how far was heathcourt park he told her and she set out to walk the distance when she came to the handsome mansion she looked at it in a kind of awe it was no wonder she thought that he would not marry her â a poor girl without wealth and refinement how could she ever expect to shine as mistress in a house like that beside beautiful mona hawthorne she was mad to have even thought of it for an instant and yet viola your lover this very instant is thinking how lonely his life is to be and would gladly have given up all the wealth he possessed if you could only be restored to his arms

she wended her way up the slope to the window

there â could it be possible â yes there was mona and here comes bertram into the room how handsome he is at sight of him her foolish little heart began to flutter like a caged bird and she put her hand on her bosom in order to stop its violent throbbing she gazed on them both from her place of concealment wondering what they were talking about

she was unconscious of the time that passed like one fascinated she continued to look at them until mona put her arms around his neck and when she saw him draw her head down on his bosom and kiss her the spell was broken

with a low moan she turned and fled down the gravel path like a doe on and on she rah until the light from the station twinkled out to her like a beacon and she saw it with the same feeling a stormtossed mariner sees for the first time the  lights along the shore she ran until she was completely exhausted and she sat down for a few minutes to rest on the trunk of a fallen tree she arose directly and slowly wended her way to the station and arrived there just a little before bertram and mona

when bertram spoke to her it was as much as she could do to keep from fainting outright but with a mighty effort she managed to get to the car without assistance

she took a seat in the car at one end and covering her face more effectually she cowered down in her seat like a criminal arriving in washington she set out on foot for her home just before reaching her cottage and while she was yet in the copse of woods the sound of mens voices reached her ears

concealing herself beyond some briar bushes she heard the following conversation one of the speakers had a voice that was very familiar

when are you going to tackle the house boss

said a course voice

in three hours time â at halfpast two a m

jimmy this is mighty short notice

yes i just got my bearings and as ive got a job on for tomorrow night i thought that this would be the best time in which to break in the old duffers house

but you havent told me whose house we are to crack yet boss

thats so well it is the old retired banker quimby on pennsylvania wenue here is a bunch of false keys for the door and these are for the safe

it is an oldfashioned affair and i guess it wont be difficult to open secure the boodle if you can without shedding blood but if any one tries to stop you why just tickle him under the fifth rib with your frog sticker

viola did not want to hear any more she knew they were planning robbery and would perhaps kill some one if they were caught in the act here one thought entered her mind and that was to save the banker creeping out of her place of concealment as quietly as possible she sped down the road as fast as her feet could carry her she knew where the great banker resided and she had no trouble in finding his house she ran up the broad stone steps and rang the bell violently as luck would have it there was some one still up and when the door was opened she asked

is this mr quimbys residence

yes

is he in

yes miss he is in buti wish to see him at once

the servant eyed her suspiciously but seeing her prompt decided manner he conducted her into a handsomely furnished apartment

in an arm chair surrounded by papers sat the old retired banker engaged in writing he looked up as viola entered he was a man of about sixty years his hair was long and white which gave him a venerable appearance his eyes were still good and they were very bright as he turned them upon her

you wish to see me miss he asked gently

yes sir she answered breathlessly they are going to rob your house tonight at halfpast two

oh sir if you dont prevent them they may kill some one

robbers coming here he asked in deep amazement

yes sir she panted i was in a copse of woods tonight on my way home and i heard them planning it ishe did not finish it the strain had been so great that the strength which had upheld her all along refused to exist any longer and before the banker could do anything to prevent it she had staggered forward and fell heavily to the floor the banker rang for assistance and to a servant who answered the summons said have a room fixed for her immediately she must remain here for the present

what is it george was asked as a tall woman advanced into the room and despite the streaks of silver that were in her hair she was still very handsome

a young girl wife who heard men planning to rob me tonight and came to warn me she must have exerted herself too much she has fainted

poor young thing said motherly mrs quimby

how beautiful she is how perfectly sweet and lovely take her jaundice to the unoccupied room on the second floor

viola was conveyed to the room mentioned where all manner of restoratives were used to bring her out of her swoon at last she opened her beautiful eyes but there was no look of recognition in their dark depths

the doctors who were called in pronounced it a severe case of brain fever and recommended quietness she lay on the pillow white as a sheet with the exception of two spots burning on either cheek crying always robbers they will shed blood you did not mean it you were just trifling and so on she continued with but little cessation for days and nights

chapter xi

viola adopted the rescue

three weeks had passed since viola went to the house of mr quimby to warn him of the robbers

the night she went to warn him the robbers came but were surprised to find officers of the law lying in wait to entertain them a portion of them were captured but the principals escaped

the banker and his wife fell in love with the beautiful girl at first sight when she recovered and spoke of going away they would not hear her they pleaded so earnestly with viola to stay â to remain and be their child to let them adopt her â that she consented partly to please them and partly because she loved the two gentle old people who had been so good and kind to her she had come to be the light of the house her gay laughter her merry snatches of song and natural vivacity which could not be repressed were in strong contrast to the former grimness and quietude of the grand old house

the old banker and this wife were delighted they loved the young girl who had come into their lives so miraculously

viola was very happy in her new home after she recovered she found herself the belle in fashionable society she rode went to balls parties operas and picnics there was a continual round of gayety

she was very happy in her new home poor girl

she had been so unfortunate in this worlds goods that the other side of life formed a very pleasing contrast and one that was duly appreciated by her so matters ran on for two months without anything to mar its brightness one day viola announced her intention of going for a ride without any escort the old banker and his wife mildly protested and advised her to take a groom but the wilful little miss would not hear of it

i shall be perfectly able to take care of myself

she said gayly as she flitted up the steps and besides she continued somewhat fretfully it is so bothersome to have men dangling at ones heels forever talking silly nothings

dear heart said mr quimby she is the light of my old life â a veritable godsend i dont see how we could ever have got along without her

yes viola is a good affectionate little creature

but there seems to be something strange in her manner sometimes the curious spells of gayety and then absolute gloom have you never noticed it

no why philip i have actually caught her in tears twice do you think lowering her voice that there might be a â a lover in the case there generally is when â hut tut mabel he said contemptuously why there is as much difference between her and other girls as there is between you and other women bowing and waving his hand with oldfashioned gallantry and besides i dont want her to think of young men yet until she has seen bertram heathcourt i should like a match between them above all things

in half an hour viola came flitting down the broad steps and after kissing the two dear faces ran lightly down the steps and was soon galloping down the street she looked lovely in her wellfitting dark blue riding habit with a coquettish hat ornamented with a simple crimson wing of a bird setting on her girlish head her fine golden hair tossed playfully by the breeze people turned and watched her admiringly wondering who the beautiful equestrienne was who sat her horse so gracefully

bertram heathcourt who was on his way to mr

quimbys to pay a call for he was an intimate friend of the bankers saw her just as she suddenly turned a corner and he started back with a wild cry

my god it is viola he cried hoarsely tell me he panted turning to a fashionablydressed dandy with patent leather pumps with pink bows and clad in that very becoming stylo of male attire called skintights which would have puzzled the scientist of any age to explain the phenomenon an eyeglass and the head of his cane in his mouth tell me who that young lady was that just passed on that chestnutcolored horse

the fellow leisurely took his cane from his mouth elevated his eyeglasses and rewarded berttram with a cool stare that made bertram consider the advisibility of knocking him down and was only prevented from doing so by the hope of obtaining the desired infomation

well stand there and stare at me about four minutes longer and not answer my question as a gentleman should bertram rather emphasized the word gentleman and as he had guessed not without the desired effect the dandy straightened himself pushed out his tiny left foot in advance of the right and after making a few vigorous attempts to clear his throat drawled oh baw jove that wath mith quirnby the adopted daughter and heireth of the honorable mr

quirnby the banker shes a dooced pretty girwell she is too dont you think so fresh in the market she is i wath just considering whether i had better go in the rathe you know do you think i have any chanth of winning  and he primped up his mouth showed the gold filling in his teeth and imagined himself the real thing  but bertram did not agree with him in his imagination for in answer to his inquiry he said yes as much as any other consummate coxcomb who waits upon her in a dining hall and imagines himself her equal  and withtout giving the surprised receiver of this speech another glance he strode away

how did he know i wath a waiter i wonder i dont remember ever seeing him before i wish i had him here now i would give him a good thumping for inthulting a gentleman of cultchaw and refinement 

meanwhile viola all unconscious of this little dialogue was riding on her way she passed from the streets of the city into those of the suburbs thence into the high road she rode along leisurely drinking in the beauty of the scenery spread out before her

the grand old trees for which virginia is noted were waving lazily to and fro as if in resentment against the gentle breeze the sun was going down behind the gilded clouds the broad potomac lay before her alive with pleasures and the beauty was greatly enhanced by the blue vista of mountains far in the background she caught her breath with delight at the loveliness of the scene her eyes took on a brighter sparkle her cheeks a richer glow

bang it was a report of a gun in the woods on the left the horse started and reared the shooting had frightened him under ordinary circumstances viola was a good horsewoman but she was so occupied in gazing at the beautiful sunset that when the report was heard she unintentionally dropped the reins the horse took advantage of the situation and seizing the bit in his teeth started off full tilt for the river along the smooth road he sped as if maddened viola managed to get the reins in her hand and attempted to rein in the frightened animal the only result was the bruising of her hands half dead with fear she tried to pull him in and so hard did she pull that the blood oozed from her finger ends

oh heavens i cant stop him she moaned in despair

straight to the precipice overhanging the river the horse sped with dilated nostrils and foamflecked flanks four hundred yards and then poor viola

would nothing save her she was so young to die

oh god am i to die such a horrible death

she moaned piteously is she see a young man on horseback sees her danger raises his gun as if to shoot he hesitates drops his gun and comes toward the runaway at full speed nearer he approaches nearer two hundred yards to the precipice fifty yards from him to her nearer he comes he gives a shout but the sound is drowned in the noise of the hoofbeats

nearer one hundred yards to the precipice ten yards between him and her fifty yards to the precipice three yards still intervene between them see

he reaches out his hand he seizes her around the waist lifts her bodily from the saddle into his own and by a superhuman effort stops his horse just as the the other with a cry like that of a human being vanished over the precipice

it was a brave act â one that few men would have undertaken he turns his unconscious burden in his arms to a more comfortable position and for the first time takes a good look at her the effect was wonderful

chapter xii

viola arnold campbells prey

the young man catches his breath his eyes seem to start from their sockets he almost loses his hold of his fair burden

viola dunkirk he gasps my god how is this the whole city has been ringing with the account of her death and now â he pauses and a triumphant smile passes over his dark face his eyes light up with a devilish expression

she is mine now all mine he said with intense satisfaction i swore to possess you my beautiful viola and i will keep my word you shall be mine body and soul he chuckled wickedly to himself as he realized how completely the young girl was in his power

he rode up the river road thinking deeply presently he muttered i wonder what it all means

she a poor girl dressed in all this finery

he could not answer that query and he finally quickened the pace of his horse as he said i will take her to the rendezvous madge will keep her safe until i get a minister to tie the knot

he turned from the road as he uttered this and rode up to a large rambling house on the river bank

it was a peculiar structure about three stories high

half the windows were out on the upper floor but the doors and windows which were all of wood and the great wheel at the side would have given it the appearance of a disused mill but for the latticed piazza at the front the young man rode around to the side of the house and after dismounting knocked on the door which was soon opened by a woman she was a terrible creature to look upon her figure was almost bent double and had piercing black eyes looking out from under a pair of heavy brows and talonlike fingers and made one at first glance instinctively recoil as if confronted by some wild beast

madge i have brought you a companion and i want you to take good care of her pour some brandy down her throat and when she comes around tell her that the man who saved her life will be in directly to see her dont let her escape do you hear

oh i know how to take care on em she answered in a sharp rasping voice ive taken care of nough on em for you

shut up how dare you mention such things

go and do as i told you

the woman gave a chuckle as she went about her task and he stepped out into the yard

how pooty she is how i hate pooty girls i could tear her eyes out they all are scornful yes stuck up and think theirselves betterll other folks and she showed a set of yellow fangs as if she would devour the young girl then and there

viola soon opened her eyes and gazed about in a frightened manner she found herself in a meagrely furnished room with no carpet on the floor in one corner stood a rickety table in the centre of the floor were two chairs while beside the iron cot on which she lay sat a woman looking at her savagely

viola could not repress a shudder as she gazed on the woman

where am i she asked rubbing her eyes and looking around in bewilderment and who are you

hell be in after a while â the one that saved your life â and im his housekeeper was the surly reply

what gentleman was it who saved my life

youll see for yourself directly she said and then there was an exultant ring in her voice hell soon be in to answer for himself viola remained quiet for a short time looking thoughtfully at the floor suddenly she took out her watch and was surprised to find that it was so late why it is twenty minutes to seven and papa will be so anxious to know where i am cant you tell the gentleman to make haste i shouldnt like to go without thanking the man who saved my â she stopped for the door had opened and a man advanced into the room one glance and viola started to her feet with a wild cry and clutched at her throat as if suffocating

you she gasped you oh pitying heaven

why didnt i perish over the precipice

the woman had stepped from the room as soon as he had entered it the man closed the door locked it and put the key in his pocket and turning to viola with a mocking smile said you seem to shrink from me as if i were an ogre miss dunkirk i am sure i mean you no harm have you no kind word for me and itis such a long time since we have seen each other you remember our last meeting do you not

she was looking straight before her and beyond the nervous rising and falling of her bosom one would imagine that she was a statue

you do not answer me he sard impatiently and after i have just saved your life by risking my own i think i deserve some consideration if nothing more than a look

she realized that she had better say something and act in a conciliatory manner and probably he would release her for that she was wholly in his power she fully realized so with an effort she extended her hand and said i thank you ever so much for saving my life it was a brave act and when i go home i shall tell papa quimby and as he is rich i know that he will remunerate you

at the mention of that name arnold started back

what is mr ouimby to you he asked quickly

he is my adopted father she answered

his eyes lighted up avariciously so this is why she was so finely clothed and was out enjoying the evening on horseback the daughter of the great banker and therefore his heiress if arnold campbell was determined to win her before he was doubly so now the money itself was a great incentive to say nothing of his love

she shall be mine he muttered fiercely with bated breath by fair means or foul aloud he said you are very fortunate in being the daughter of such a worthy gentleman

yes she said papa is very good to me and loves me and that reminds me she said suddenly that he will be very anxious at my long absence i must go to him at once

a peculiar gleam shot into his dark eyes

must you really go so soon he inquired with wellassumed sorrow

yes i have been from home two whole hours

andbesides it is almost dark will you let me pass please

well â er the fact is miss quimby you cannot go just yet

sir she was very much frightened but she spoke without a tremor

well you see it is rather late and you are a long way from home and it would not be prudent to go

i am not afraid sir i have been living here for years and feel perfectly safe in coming and going whenever i please let me pass if you please

the clear searching eyes of the girl were on him and he found it difficult to return her gaze his eyes fell as he said i cannot let you go yet

what do you mean and her voice trembled in spite of herself

he remarked it and the thought that he was frightening her made him answer more boldly miss dunkirk that your ever leaving this house depends altogether on yourself

i do not understand you in surprise what can i do that will cause you to let me leave this house

his face flushed with passion

i love you viola be my wife this very night and you can go he said eagerly

she started from him a step or two

you must be mad to think of such a thing i would never marry without my parents consent and besides i do not love you

perhaps not  but it will come in time

wrong god would never bless such a union

i cannot she said pleadingly it would be then he said angrily you will stay here until you change your mind

he turned on his heel as he spoke and with a pitiful cry viola sprang after him and throwing herself at his feet cried oh sir for the love of heavven dont detain me here think how troubled my father and mother will be at my strange absence  if you have one spark of manhood in your breast you will release me for their sake

i will give you one minute to consent to be my wife if you refuse here youll stay until you do consent he answered doggedly

then hear my answer now without a minutes reflection she cried springing to her feet her eyes blazing her face crimson with indignation i would rather die than become your wife do you hear

god never ordained such nor is there any possible chance of your ever becoming my husband a thief and a murderer i never would marry

what do you mean he cried hoarsely his face ghastly pale

you know what i mean ah ha you may try well to cover it you wretch i know your little secret and will blaze it forth to the world if you do not release me

she knows my little secret thought arnold

nevertheless she shall never leave here other than as my wife then her testimony will not be worth anything i must go to the city early in the morning and secure the services of some not overconscientious clergyman to officiate it is not now a question of love and wealth but a question of safety

viola had sprang after him as he left the room only to have the door closed in her face and a squeaky click announced the fact that the door was locked

the girl became well nigh frantic she screamed and kicked at the door and realizing that all such attempts were failures she ceased

oh heaven help and pity me  she moaned

am in this mans power and unless some assistance comes i shall be forced into a union with him

she was feeling terribly exhausted and she threw herself on the little cot and was soon sleeping oblivious of every trouble

chapter xiii

bertram and monas marriage announcement the engagement between mona and bertram had been announced preparations were being made for the wedding which was decided to take place on the th of september the bridal trousseau had been ordered from the north and portions of the wardrobe were coming every day rolls of silk boxes of gloves and shoes ribbons bonnets fine old lace were arriving daily without cessation mrs

hawthorne was in ecstacies over her daughters good fortune during these days she was an ideal mother

she chatted pleasantly and gave good advice to her daughter she rode drove gave parties and went to operas and all in all she was one of the happiest creatures in the city â at peace with all the world

monas chief delight seemed to be in the presence of her lover when he was with her she was all smiles she talked gayly and sang and tried every artifice with which she was acquainted to be loving

when mr and mrs quimby returned home that night they were surprised to learn that viola had not yet arrived they thought probably that she had stopped at the house of one of her friends but when at twelve oclock she did not return they sent out a couple of men servants to look for her the men returned in two or three hours and said they had not learned anything of her whereabouts the old people were sorely troubled and early the next morning mr quimby went to the police headquarters and informed the chief of violas disappearance the chief told him he thought she could be found and referred him to special officer turpin

dick turpin  as he was usually termed by the rough class had not been a year on the force but his shrewdness and strict attention to business and the discharge of his duty had made him a man who was mortally feared by criminals while his natural geniality of manner and his general temperament had won for him the respect and admiration of his brethren and made him a general favorite with them all

mr quimby appeared at the office of the great detective he found the man busily engaged with a pile of documents on his entering the detective turned on him a pair of piercing gray eyes mr

quimby asked have i the honor of addressing mr turpin the detective 

i am he to whom am i indebted for the pleasure of this visit 

the banker handed him his card

ah  said the detective mr quimby the banker 

yes and i would like you to take a case for me if you are not busy 

well i have a case on hand as you see but i think i can take another  said the detective

very well sir my daughter â my adopted daughter â is missing she disappeared very strangely from her home yesterday 

disappeared 

yes sir and in order that you may fully understand the case i will have to tell you my story 

very well sir let me have all the facts and always remember that whatever you may tell me will simply be in the strictest confidence and as such i shall hold it sacred

the banker began and told the detective the circumstances with which the reader is aquainted from the time viola had come into his family until her disappearance when he had finished the detective sat quite still looking thoughtfully at the carpeted floor finally he said you say she did not tell you anything of her former life except that her mother and father were both dead might there not â add here he gave the banker a keen look as he began again has it never occurred to you that there might be a lover in the case

this second mentioning of a lover in connection with viola and her strange disappearance seemed to give the case a starthng significance as the old man raised his head he answered no â no i have never looked at the matter in that light he finally said you dont know my dear girl sir she was very different from the girls in general and besides if there had been anything of the kind i think she would have told me

the detective smiled cheerfully rubbing his hands vigorously and said in a pleasant manner very well sir i will undertake your case and i will have good news for you soon

the banker arose and moved toward the door

when he had laid his hand on the knob he turned oh by the bye you havent said anything about your pay

oh never mind sir never mind well speak about that when my work is done

you shall be amply remunerated if you succeed

good morning

good morning

five days had elapsed since viola had been a prisoner in the house by the river she had pleaded for her liberty implored stormed and threatened but it had done no good hope had given place to despair

she had made up her mind to meet the issue whatever it might be bravely her tormenter had been to see her this morning and had begged her to become his wife and had left her in anger because of her refusal he told her to prepare herself for on the morrow she would have to become his wife

she was sitting now on one of the hard stools trying to be resigned to her fate but there was a dull pain at her heart when there came a light step in the hall the knob turned in the door and a young woman entered viola sprang to her feet her heart leaped with great joy she was to be free at last

miss mona oh merciful father in heaven i thank thee she cried joyously oh i am so glad you have come to deliver me from that villain â that fiend in human shape how is father and mother she continued breathlessly are they anxious about me oh take me to them please do and i will bless you as long as i live

and the poor girl â poor because her joy was soon to be turned into the bitterness of death â clasped the haughty mona hawthorne about the knees and sobbed for very joy

why my dear girl said mona mockingly you seem to have very pleasant quarters here how do you like them true your furniture is rough but i presume your husband that is to be will refurnish your apartments when you are settled down

viola had slowly risen to her feet and was leaning on the hack of a chair for support her eyes had become black as midnight with horror what did it mean did miss mona â was it possible that she did not come to release her â that she even knew something about her imprisonment perhaps but no no perish the thought no woman with a spark of feeling for her sex would stand quietly by and see one of her fellows imprisoned and forced into an unwilling alliance with a man from whom her whole soul recoiled in loathing

what â what is it you say miss mona she asked in piteous perplexity i â i dont seem to quite understand you

mona rippled out a little tinkle of silvery laughter arid said what my dear little woman i thought i spoke plainly enough i say i hope you will be happy with your young husband who loves you dearly pray accept my heartiest congratulations if it were not that i am so happy in the love of bertram my betrothed i should surely envy you your good fortune

then you did not come to release me oh miss mona she said almost in a whisper the awful anguish and hopeless misery in her voice as she gave utterance to this would have melted the heart of a stone but unfortunately monas heart was made of harder material than stone and she did not notice it

come to release you she said in mock surprise

how could i presume to intrude into this paradise of love when mr arnold campbell â do not mention his name to me cried viola stung into madness by the heartless womans taunts

dont you dare do it i â i hate him loathe him and you too and i believe you have had a hand in this outrage you know more about it than you care to admit

mona had started back quite frightened before this burst of indignation she did not believe viola had life enough in her for that

my what a regular little virago you are mr

campbell your intended husband will have to bring that little temper in check or you will make it warm for him

leave me to my misery you wicked woman

why did you come here

an angry fire flashed into the eyes of mona

why did i come here she echoed advancing meaningly up to the girl shall i tell you well then hear me it was to triumph over you my rival

i knew you were here you are here by my instructions nay hear me out you were in my way

you won the love of my life from me and i am determined on revenge i tell you this because i am now safe in the love of bertram heathcourt and on the fifteenth of this month will become the wife of his bosom now listen your lover was never false to you ah ha you started the rivalry which almost broke my heart strings i shall wring your heart strings as mine have been wrung i wrote that letter telling you that he never did love you that henceforward you would meet as strangers he never received your letter i have it in my possession now

how i got it matters not he now believes that you are dead and in less than a fortnight i shall be his wife while you with a dazzling smile will be ditto of mr arnold campbell you see little viola i have triumphed and there is no use to kick against the pricks you had better accept your fate with good grace and make the best of circumstances

viola never moved she had been looking straight before her since the beginning of monas story she had become pale to the lips her eyes were dilated with horror at the enormity of the sin of the woman whom she believed at most to be proud and haughty

my dear continued mona why do you look like that you quite frighten me you do not look very much like a prospective bride

so you deceived me murmured viola brokenly

and he was true to me he meant it when he said that he loved me he was not doing it to pass away the time

no he was not doing it passer le temps

but so far as you are concerned he might as well have done so well said mona as she moved toward the door i must leave you my dear i will not see you for â oh ever so long after our wedding tour i may drop in to see you so au revoir she paused on the threshold of the door as if to take one last look and what she saw never left her mind until her dying day

viola was acting as if she did not hear her â was not even aware of her presence she was murmuring over and over again bertram did mean it he was not fooling he loved me

suddenly and while mona was still looking at her she started toward the table and snatching up a fork that was lying on the plate from which she had eaten her dinner said good bye bertram my lost love i will never see you again i love you oh so well

mother dear mother i will soon be with you and before the astonished mona could do anything to prevent it she had raised her hand and buried the fork in her breast up to the hilt

great god exclaimed the guilty woman the girl has killed herself

she stood stark still gazing like one fascinated at the crimson stream oozing from the tender breast of that prostrate figure like a flash it suddenly occurred to her that she was the cause of this poor girls death and therefore she was a â no no not that she cried aloud father in heaven what am i

a murderess was whispered in her ear

she wheeled about with a stifled cry but there was no one in the room but herself and that pale dead figure

who spoke she demanded sharply but an empty echo was her only answer my imagination is playing me pranks

she went from the room and soon returned with old madge

the girl has killed herself attend to her at once and let some of the men about the yard bury her at once

with some difficulty the woman succeeded in getting viola on the bed and had soon completed the last sad duty we can perform for the dead

poor viola she deserved a better fate it did not seem possible that the end had come to one so young so good and true poor helpless girl

chapter xiv

monas conscience

mona had returned to her home that night and fearful thoughts were haunting her she could not vanish from her mind that last despairing cry of the poor innocent young girl whom she had so terribly wronged she made an excuse to her mother and after eating a very light supper retired but not to sleep sleep that blessed boon which brings rest and peace to the innocent would not bring oblivion to her guilty mind she undressed herself and laid down

she would ever and anon drop off into a fitful slumber only to start up again with a smothered cry as a voice seemed to whisper murderess from under her pillow finally she arose and robing herself in a wrapper threw up the window drawing a chair close to the side of it sat down to look out

in one of the trees a night bird was singing but its lovely notes seemed to her excited fancy to be crying in harsh tones murderess murderess

in the grass on the lawn beneath her a cricket took up the strain of murderess murderess

oh heaven will those terrible sounds never cease she moaned and closing the window with a bang she arose and began pacing restlessly to and fro until a faint gray streak came stealing through the window and she knew that day was breaking she threw herself across the bed and finally dropped into a kind of deep apathy which lasted until late in the day

madge the old hag had sat by violas corpse all night

the next morning campbell arrived he came eagerly into the room expecting to find viola ready to give him an affirmative answer recognizing how useless it was to defy him but he was horrified amazed when on entering the room he found madge sitting by the side of the bed and on the bed with her hands folded peacefully on her breast lay viola cold and still

he could not believe that he saw aright he rubbed his eyes and pinched himself to see if it was not some horrible dream

whats â whats the matter madge he stammered what does this mean

it means that the gals dead was the short answer

dead he cried hollowly viola dead how â good god who did it woman he said suddenly seizing her arm in a viselike grip how did this thing happen answer me he continued fiercely

did you do it

turn me a loose snarled the old woman what you spose i want to kill her for no i didnt do it

she did it herself

the man stood like one stricken dumb viola killed herself and â great heaven he had goaded the poor girl to her doom

he suddenly cast himself across the prostrate form and groaned remorsefully at the thought of what he had done then calling on her by every endearing name to come back to him to forgive him for the wrong he had perpetrated upon her but there was no movement made by poor viola

he finally arose and asked the woman who had been standing near looking at him with a cynical expression on her ugly visage how it had happened

she told him all she knew about it how mona had visited the girl and after staying in the room a considerable length of time came to her and informed her that the girl had killed herself

so she was here eh he muttered under his breath i wonder if she could â but no the girl was safe from ever molesting her in her love affairs and it would be foolish to think that she would do such a thing

he finally left the old woman alone with the corpse in half an hour he put his head in the door and said madge i am going to town after a coffin to bury the girl in i shall return this afternoon

all right sir

madge sat quiet for an hour or two and then she began to feel hungry she remembered that she had not left the room since the afternoon of the previous day

ill step out and get a bite it wont take long

so saying she hobbled from the room

three minutes passed and a panel in the wall slid back and into the room a woman stepped cautiously

she was tall and dark with black hair and eyes of the same hue there were lines as of trouble around her sweet mouth and eyes but despite that fact she seemed to have been once a very beautiful woman

she advanced cautiously to the side of the bed and gazed long and earnestly at the girl

how beautiful how very beautiful she said

and they hounded her down poor creature as they attempted to hound me â but she paused was she mistaken she thought she saw the lace at the throat of the girl move it was only imagination

no there it is again she bent over closer and examined the girls face then she put out her hand and pinched that of the girl it did not remain pinched and puckered like that of a dead persons but the flesh came back into its place just like elastic

the woman tried the other hand in the same manner with a like result her face lit up radiantly

not dead she murmured joyously i think i can save her if i begin at once

and with incredible strength for a woman she bore her through the open panel and shoved it into its place

about five minutes elapsed at the end of which time madge returned to the room when she looked in and saw that the body of the girl had disappeared she was almost wild with superstitious wonder

where had she gone where could she go she looked under the bedand opening the shutters of the window looked out but nothing rewarded her gaze

she searched every room through and through but no viola could be found

i dont believe that gal was dead shes been a playin possum on us but â i could aswore she was a corpse mr arnold will be wild when he finds out shes gone

and she sat down on a chair by the window and waited patiently for his return

meanwhile the strange woman had borne viola through the panel and after sliding it back into its place walked along the narrow passage until she came to a flight of stairs ascending these she walked along another passage until she came to a wall pressing her finger on a small button another panel slid back which she closed after passing through she entered a room that was poorly but comfortably furnished a clean white bed and a table a few chairs a stove lamp trunk cupboard and washstand constituted its furnishings

the woman lay her burden tenderly on the bed took a flask containing brandy and another of camphor from the cupboard and for two hours worked vigorously on the girl bathing her bands and face in the camphor and administering the brandy a while after she noticed the chest of the girl beginning to rise and fall as if in respiration soon there was a little movement of the hand and a longdrawn sighaccompanied by a quivering of the eyelidswhich announced that viola had at last come out of her trance she struggled feebly to rise but the attempt was a failure and she sank back gasping for breath

the woman raised the pillow under her head and otherwise made her position more comfortable she stood with her hand resting lightly on the girls head with a soothing magnetic touch viola lay quiet with her eyes dosed presently she stirred and when the woman removed her hand she let her gaze wander around the room as if taking in every detail

where am i she asked feebly passing her hand slowly over her eyes and why am i here

the woman put her finger to her lips as if to enjoin silence

hush my dear child she said in a sweet voice that won violas heart on the spot you must recover as fast as you can and the only way to do so is by keeping very quiet and when you get better i will tell you all about it

so saying she drew a chair to the bedside and taking violas hand in hers she stroked it caressingly viola felt a strange sense of comfort and protection in this womans presence she did not question further she only realized with a wild joy that in some miraculous manner she had escaped from the clutches of her enemies and so under the soothing touches of this kind woman she soon dropped into a light and refreshing sleep

chapter xv viola not a suicide

that afternoon arnold drove up to the door of the old river house in a covered wagon which it is needless to say contained a coffin he jumped from the wagon hastened into the house and toward the room where he had left as he supposed the corpse of little viola the woman had heard his footsteps in the hall and had come to meet him he saw by the expression of her face that something out of the ordinary had happened he thought probably â and here his heart gave a wild bound â that viola had after all only been in a deep swoon and had recovered

well said he inquiringly to her

i â i â that is â mr arnold the fact is something very peculiar has happened

yes he said eagerly what is it

well sir continued the woman as if she did not know how to begin i â i just stepped out to get a mouthful of something to eat and when i come back why â why â yes she had recovered

who said anything about her bein recovered

arnolds heart sank like lead he felt like throtthng the woman for having even unconsciously raised false hopes in his breast

why dont you speak he demanded angrily

why do you stand there looking at me like one just awakened from a dream

la sakes i wish it wor a dream somethin wuss dan a dream has happened

a horrible fear began tugging at his heartstrings as he asked huskily what has happened madge for gods sake tell me 

well the truth of the matter is the gals gone 

gone how could such a thing have happened

you must be mistaken 

i doesnt know how it happened all i know is that when id come back from eatin my dinner she was gone you can see for yourself 

arnold pushed her roughly aside and strode into the room and was profoundly surprised he stood as if thinking deeply finally he said how is it madge i cant understand it she must have been taken from the room by some outsider for that she was dead i will swear 

yes sir she was dead and thats a fack and jewhilikens  as if she had found a solution of the mystery continued i bet a dollar some dratted detective has skivered her whereabouts and tooken her back home you say her folks is rich i guess they must a hired him to find her 

arnold seemed to be of the same opinion for he said reflectively i think that is about the size of it but in order to make sure i will go to the city and tonight i will take a survey of the house and find out 

viola slept all that night and a portion of the next day and when she awoke she felt strengthened and announced her intention to the woman of getting up she saw that viola was really looking better and gave a ready consent the woman assisted her to dress and by the time that was completed breakfast was ready and after she had placed it on the table they sat down to the tempting repast when breakfast was finished and the tilings stowed away they sat down by the window and began chatting pleasantly both avoiding as if by tacit agreement to speak of things nearest the minds of each directly the woman said do you know my dear that you look strangely like some one whom i have known your face very forcibly reminds me of him or her who it is i cannot recall now 

do i  said viola with a smile i hope it is like some one you loved for oh dear lady i would like to have you love me please forgive me for saying it but i love you so much 

do you really love me my dear after such a short acquaintance 

i do  said viola earnestly indeed i do and that reminds me you have never told me your name 

the woman remained silent for a while and then said call me mrs smith 

now mrs smith  said the girl softly couldnt you love me a little â just a little 

mrs smith for that we shall call her smiled in spite of herself at the girls earnestness and answered warmly indeed you dear little creature i could and do love you already 

a light came into the girls face and she impulsively leaned forward and grasped the hand of her companion and imprinted a kiss thereon and thus they sat for several minutes clasping each others hand in loving confidence and so by that token did these two women who had come into each others lives so strangely seal a friendship that all the vicissitudes of their after lives could not break

after remaining quiet for some minutes viola ventured to ask mrs smith how came i here â in this house 

mrs smith said as she smiled you will have to ask that arch plotter downstairs how you came to be in the house nay do not be frightened my dear 

for viola had started to her feet with a startled look in her eyes when she found out she was still in the same house you are perfectly safe from him

i have been living here for ten years and nobody knows of my being here not even the other inhabitants of the house 

but â but how do you manage to keep them in ignorance of your presence here  asked viola in astonishment

that is easily explained see here  and she arose and went to the wall pressed a button and a panel slid back in its socket you see my dear this is a secret apartment i do not know what it was built for but i discovered it here years ago when tired footsore and weary i had stepped into this dilapidated old building to rest 

viola looked at the place with great interest she had never seen never heard of anything like it before the woman continued you see that passage that leads to a pair of stairs descending those stairs you come to another secret passage that subsequently leads to a subterranean vault or tunnel follow this tunnel for two or three hundred yards and you will come out at a small cave on the river by the way you see i procure work from several families hereabouts and am enabled to earn a livelihood i come and go when i please without any one being the wiser

she closed the panel and returned to her seat beside the wondering girl you are wondering i can see it in your eyes how came i to take up my abode here would you like to hear my story  i would ever so much if it does not pain you to tell it 

indeed it does not it has been such a long time since ive had any one with whom to exchange confidences that it is rather a relief than otherwise to be able to unburden my mind of its weight to some one whom i can trust it is all a case of mans duplicity womans weakness and suffering on account of an imprudent folly  she said sadly

viola clasped her hand and then gave it a reassuring pressure and then began to listen to the most remarkable story of her life

chapter xvi

mrs smiths story

in the village of bi lived when quite a small girl with my father who was a simple gardener i was a very happy girl though far from being rich we managed to live comfortably and my mother being dead i was the light of my fathers life and loved him dearly i grew from girlhood into young womanhood and people all called me beautiful

there was in the woods a great old tree known throughout the settlement as the old elm it was strange that almost all the trees in the woods were beach and there was not another of its kind to be found a round the village but it stood in the midst of the other trees tall and majestic like a grim sentinel spreading its huge arms out over the others in its vicinity as if in protection it was my chief delight to take a novel or some other interesting book in the afternoon and sit under its delightful shade to read and dream one day while i was so engaged i did not notice that the sky had suddenly become overcast presaging one of our southern storms until the drops began to fall thick and fast i simply had on a thin dress and a straw hat i surely would have been the recipient of a good drenching and probably caught my death of cold had not a young man whom i recognized as the eldest son of the leading personage in our town passed opportunely and seeing my condition offered to see me in safety to my home i need not tell you of the frequent meetings under the old elm of the honeyed words and confidences exchanged suffice it to say that when the summer had gone and the leaves began to fall from the trees i had promised to be the wife of the son of the purseproud millionaire

in the meantime the younger son of this gentleman had met me on several occasions and said he had fallen in love with me he proposed and i rejected him he stormed i threatened and defied him he asked me why i would not marry him i told him that i loved another then he pleaded by the right of his love to know who it was

i told him that it was his brother i never shall forget the look of murderous hate that came into his countenance i shivered with fear when i saw it

it was terrible but secure in the love of the man who was all the world to me his deadly threats of vengeance did not long remain in mind

one day i received a letter from my loved one asking me to meet him the next night by the old elm and flee with him i knew that it was not a prudent thing to do but what girl with the glamour of love over her eyes listens to the reasonings of her own mind or her common sense it is certain that i did not i sat down and wrote him a loving assent and the next evening met him at the place named and before six hours had rolled over our heads we were married

the next day my husband left me in a little cottage and returned home in a few days he came back and said he had come to remain with me for a whole week we went into the garden after awhile and were lovingly examining some flowers together when who should drive up to the door but the father and brother of my husband the stern father denounced his son and heaped reproaches upon him and cursed him and as i stood trembling at his side i could see the wicked exultation in the face of my brotherinlaw the fathers threats occurred to me wtih full force and i knew that in some way he had found out about our elopement and betrayed us

my husband after this seemed cheerful enough and as he was not altogether dependent upon his fathers bounty we managed to get along immensely

a year passed swiftly by in the meantime god had sent into my life a little treasure in the shape of a son after he was given to me my real trouble began my husband began to grow morbid and cold

i could see that everything was not going right i did not complain however but took renewed pleasure in the presence of my boy one day during his absence i received a message that i supposed to be from him requesting me to meet him leaving my baby boy in charge of the nurse i repaired to the place mentioned in the letter and my dear i never saw my child or my husband from that day to this

when i stepped into the carriage sent for the purpose i was seized by strong hands and a cloth placed over my mouth i lost consciousness when i awoke to my surroundings i was aware of being in a room with grated doors and windows strange wild cries screams the babble of silly voices and demoniac laughter could be heard on all sides my child i knew though i had never been in one before that i was in a lunatic asylum and the horror of finding out that i had been entrapped into such a place almost killed me

i staggered to my feet in terror and confronted my enemy my husbands brother i need not tell you how i pleaded with him threatened and begged him for my liberty but he only taunted sneered and laughed at my misery

when i saw that he was so utterly heartless i became indignant and heaped reproaches on him he said to me my dear doris you must not blame me for the part that i have played in this affair for i assure you that i am not the prime mover in it  i indignantly demanded to know who was and he answered your own husband  i never shall forget the horror with which i heard those awful words never my husband whom i believed so good true and honorable my husband whom i loved so dearly and whom i knew loved me so well but why should he do such a wicked thing and what was his object

i stood there speechless my tongue refused to do its work it seemed as if a hand of iron were clutching at my heart at last i managed to gasp and then said sternly i do not believe it my husband loved me and he would never be a party to such devilish work  all right my dear  answered my tormentor with taunting coolness but your incredulity does not alter the state of affairs in the least now listen your husband truly loved you when he married you but his was not the love of a lifetime such as i offered you and which you rejected with scorn

my brother was not born to be a poor man and when my father disinherited him he began to hate you because of the blight you had cast over his life he soon grew tired of you and as he did not care to stain his soul with a worse crime he had you abducted and brought here  it was such a ridiculous story that i could not repress a smile in spite of my terrible situation the idea of my husband being guilty of such a plot against the wife he had sworn to cherish was simply absurdity personified i wonder how it is that god did not strike him dead for telling such a lie

he saw the smile and it seemed to madden him

you do not believe it  do you think i would so wrong my husband even in thought as to entertain such an idea for an instant  read that then he said snatching a letter from his pocket and tossing it to me and see if it does not change your views in regard to your husbands character  i recognized the writing as that of my husbands with a strange sinking of the heart the letter was a short one but oh my heavens how it did shatter my love dream my idol

it was a neatly laid plan of how i was to be abducted and sent to the asylum and after i was put out of the way my husband was to marry a rich widow who i remembered having seen to flirt with him on several occasions you know richard  it wound up that i cannot endure poverty although i have put up with it with seeming good grace so far and now when the opportunity presents itself to better myself think you that i will hesitate for an instant to accept it because one paltry life stands between me and wealth no a thousand times no

the change will be better for my son he will be brought up believing that my second wife is his own mother he will never know the difference and i believe that happiness is to come into my life at last

it was all a mistake from first to last and i hope that in my new life i may be able to retrieve my lost advantages do not be too hard on doris â poor doris

i could not bear to see her again her sad dark eyes would ever rise up before me in silent reproach

fleming heathcourt  that was all my child but who can describe the suffering it brought to me i was faint and dizzy at the knowledge of my husbands baseness it was all a mistake his having married me and oh the pity of it â my child my darling baby â was never to know its real mother to be brought up in ignorance of her very existence i wonder why it did not drive me mad but it did not nor did the other horrors that are presented to inmates of a lunatic asylum drive me mad i stayed there for fifteen years â fifteen long weary years and when one night the asylum caught fire and i escaped i was the same in mind as you or as i am at this moment 

chapter xvii

mrs smith and viola

the woman during the narrative had been looking out of the window her sad dark eyes wandering off from the broad expanse of water to hazy mountains in the distance therefore she did not see viola at the mention of the name heathcourt give a start of surprise and bend forward with renewed interest and gaze scrutinizingly at her face and also the light of a sudden conviction that broke over her

after a short pause viola said tremulously poor mrs smith how you must have suffered

but she continued earnestly i do not believe your husband did such a wicked thing it was all a plot against the happiness of you both by that villainous brother of his

a radiant expression came into the face of mrs

smith for an instant then receded leaving it its usual marblelike whiteness

no my dear child she said smiling sadly you do not know i believe that for once in his life richard heathcourt told the truth â that my husband had ceased to love me and besides the letter was in his handwriting i recognized it as such there could he no mistake

it might have been and i believe it was a forgerg said viola emphatically i do not believe that your husband whom i imagine to be good and true would have done such a thing it was a forgery such things have been done

she spoke with a little bitterness in her voice for she remembered monas words in which she acknowledged that she had forged the note that had blighted her happiness

the woman stooped and pressed a kiss on the brow of the girl my child she murmured tremulously you have made me feel better than you know you have given me hope hope that after all these years of sorrow and suffering that a great wrong may yet be righted â that i may be restored to my loved one 

we shall begin  said viola twining her arms softly about the womans neck we shall begin right away to bring that villain to justice â just as soon as we can escape from here but â but you didnt finish your story 

there is very little more to tell my child i escaped as i told you and came here tired of my weary tramp and hungry the next day i discovered this secret apartment and as i was feeling a little better though still weak from want of food i dragged myself over to yonder cottage do you see through that cluster of trees i asked them for food and work they were very kind to me and for a month i used to go there daily and work after that time they trusted me and i was allowed to bring the work away and do it here although they do not even know where i live so things continued for nine years a year ago that man downstairs and a gang of men whom i have every reason to believe are counterfeiters took up their abode here and i had to be particular not to be discovered i had just returned home the other day when coming up the secret passage i heard the voice of a young girl speaking as if she had been made joyful by some event there happened to be a small hole in the wall where a pine knot had once been and through that hole i saw you kneeling at the feet of that heartless young woman with the black eyes i could not resist the temptation to hear what was being said and the consequences are that i was able to save your life and you will not have to tell me your story 

did you â did you hear  faltered viola paling and flushing alternately at the knowledge that her secret had been betrayed

yes my child  smiled mrs smith reassuringly

all but the name of the young man whom she had taken from you so unfairly 

viola gave a sigh of relief that the woman did not know who the young man was add she told herself that she would not reveal his name she would save the good news to add to the pleasure that mrs

smith would have when the work that they both had to do was finished

arnold campbell was in a plight he had gone to the city and loitered in the vicinity of the quimby mansion all the next day hoping to see something that would indicate to him that viola had returned dead or alive but nothing rewarded his efforts no graceful airy figure had flitted from the open door or down the steps out on the lawn no gay laughter or merry songs had reached his ears telling him that she was alive and well and yet no doctors conveyance had driven up to the curb nor had there been any crepe fluttering from the knob that would say to him in language too eloquent to be misunderstood or ignored that she was dead he had even ventured to inquire of the old gardener if any news of the missing miss quimby had been received but the garrulous old man had said that nobody ever heard head nor tail of her since she disappeared so strangely

arnold had also gone to the morgue and hospital thinking that probably her dead body had been found or that she had been picked up unconscious and taken to the latter place for treatment but no one answering her description had been brought to either place he might look if he felt like it which he did but the result was just the same in despair he turned his face toward the house of mona hawthorne

he found that lady pacing restlessly up and down under the great old cedars arnold acknowledged to himself that her appearance was not that of the best she looked five years older than when he had last seen her her hair seemed as if it had not been attended to her dress was shabby her face pale her eyes had an underlying expression of terror in them that would not be banished and her whole appearance indicated a woman who had a guilty terrible secret and one that could neither rest nor sleep in consequence she came eagerly forward to meet him although she couldnt raise her eyes to his

well she said inquiringly

arnold thought that probably the young woman was fearful of being the cause of the young womans death and had taken some means of getting rid of the body in order to cover up her tracks therefore he said with as much sternness as he was capable you have made a pretty job out of this affair havent you

the guilty woman started and trembled like an aspen did he know that she had been to the house

true the woman knew but she had never seen her before and therefore did not know her she must find out how much he knew so recovering herself she asked laughingly what do you mean 

you know what i mean  said he angrily stung by her manner you know that you came to the river house yesterday and caused her death 

it is false 

it is true you cannot fool me mona hawthorne why did you cause her death answer me

why did you do it 

he had advanced upon her menacingly his eyes blazing his splendid physique trembling with passion

mona was frightened what would he do this man loved the girl would he betray her for the part she had played in it would he avenge the girls death by informing bertram of her sin oh horrors

anything but that there was madness in the thought she must try to conciliate the man

arnold she said i admit that i did go to the river house but i did not kill the girl she committed suicide when she found i had not come to release her she â she became desperate 

is that all  sneeringly

yes  eagerly coming forward and â and is she â have they buried her 

no 

and why  with a frown do you want someone to find out about her and begin making unpleasant inquiries why hasnt she been buried 

because she is gone 

what  almost in a whisper i did not quite hear you do i understand you to say that she is gone 

that was about the drift of my remarks 

gone gone my god and i â i  she staggered forward groping blindly before her and clutching wildly at the empty air fell at his feet in a huddled heap

and for once in her life mona hawthorne had really fainted

chapter xviii

attempt to escape

it is dark in the city of washington with exception of the street lamps that are twinkling here and there it is dark in the old river house to all appearances any casual observer would say that much

but it is not dark in the secret room of the old river house on the contrary a light was burning brightly from a wax candle on the table viola was feeling very anxious as she sat on a chair with her head resting on her right hand mrs smith after her conversation with viola had appointed tonight for their escape viola hungering to see her father and mother and also some one else eagerly acquiesced

but at the same time a heavy foreboding hung over her like a pall she tried to shake it off but could not she could not get rid of the presentiment that something was going to happen

do you believe in presentiment of coming trouble mrs smith she asked that lady who by the way was busy gathering together her little effects and transferring them to a small satchel

what prompted you to ask that question my dear

because i have that strange feeling now and cannot get rid of it

banish it my dear shake it off there is no occasion to fear anything nobody is aware of our presence here

i know that but try as i will i cannot banish it

i cannot but feel that â that we are going to be unsuccessful in our attempt tonight or something else is going to happen to us

i do not believe there is the least ground for such a feeling  said the woman nobody knows of the passage but ourselves and at nine oclock we will start for liberty 

the woman spoke hopefully but at the same time she was feeling rather nervous she would not acknowledge it but she had that same feeling that viola spoke of and it seemed rather singular indeed that they both should be possessed with it

taking a look into another portion of the old river house in a room we see congregated a number of men the room is quite long and wide accordingly it is lighted by kerosene lamps that are affixed to the wall with tin reflectors behind them in order to throw the light out over the room it is a peculiar room there are work benches moulds steel plates and in one corner a small forge in the centre of the room is a long wooden table around which the men are sitting leisurely smoking their pipes while others are playing cards and amusing themselves at other games they have their faces covered with masks behind which their features are effectually concealed directly one of the men arose and laying aside his pipe picked up a gavel and rapping three times on the table said in a voice though muffled and disguised is strangely familiar men it is time we begin business 

the men proceeded to lay aside their occupations and give attention

the first thing i want to say  continued the man who seemed to be chief is that i failed on my last job 

murmurs of discontent were heard on all sides and one a little bolder than the rest said how is that chief how did you happen to fail 

well you men went off on your own hooks and i had to employ strangers to do the job they did not know the hearings of the old bankers house and the result was they botched the job and were caught  they were caught  yes they were caught and it was a close call in my getting away 

good  exclaimed a few i am glad they were caught for botching the job 

its all very well to rejoice that they were caught but you see we missed the money in consequence 

but chief  said one speaker rather anxiously

did you think they might squeal on us 

no well it doesnt make any difference if they do their squealing would have no effect for the simple reason that they do not know me â never saw my face and furthermore do not know of the band

but boys  continued the chief lowering his voice a trifle since you speak of squealing there is something of importance i want to tell you 

instantly everybody was all attention

boys  continued the speaker and the trembling of his voice showed that he was greatly excited

boys there is someone on our track â a spy 

there was a hoarse angry roar mingled with fearful oaths and the men were on their feet in a moment flourishing their revolvers in the air

a spy a spy 

who is he 

tell us who he is 

name him chief 

knife the spy 

and all such angry exclamations arose at once

sh keep quiet men keep quiet there is no occasion for such excitement now there is none here now that is sure the reason that i spoke of a spy is that on the night when i was giving orders to the men i imagined i heard a step in the copse where we were then i thought i heard a sound the second time i gave orders to the men to search the copse but we did not see any one it was very singular that when we went to crack the crib we found them prepared for us and cops waiting to receive us 

is that a fact 

true as gospel 

then there was a spy and we must never rest until we hunt him down have you any idea who he is chief 

no well thats what we must find out now remember all spies shall be shot at sight are you all in favor of that measure 

yes yes 

down with the spies 

very well then now we will proceed to the regular business of the meeting

we find mrs smith and viola sitting with shawls around their heads and shoulders the former with a satchel on her arm a little clock on the shelf strikes nine mrs smith arises and taking up the wax candle says it is time to start my dear are you ready 

yes  answered viola tremulously but â but oh i am so frightened 

there is no need of being frightened  said mrs

smith impatiently and her sharp words brought tears to the eyes of the girl

there there my dear  said the good lady i regret very much that the sharpness of my speech has caused you to cry but there is no occasion even for the least fear indeed not come we will go now 

so saying she picked up the candle and passing over to the panel pressed the button the panel slid back and they passed out mrs smith closing the panel after her they went carefully along the long passage and quietly down the stairs to another passage they went along this one about twenty feet

we must go down another flight and then we will be in the tunnel which will terminate at the river and we will be safe  whispered the elder lady encouragingly as she felt the girl shivering close to her side she pressed another button and a second panel slid back they went through as before the elder closing it they went slowly down the stairs they were now in an underground passage which was close and dark the walls were of wood and the passage was very narrow just as they put their feet on the floor harsh angry cries reached their ears coming right from the other side of the wall just opposite them

oh  cried viola in terror we have been discovered what shall we do 

an angry voice reached her ears just then saying down with the spies 

oh for heavens sake let us run  cried viola panicstricken and she turned to put her words into action

in some manner just how she could never tell as she turned her arm came in contact with that of the woman and the candle fell to the floor with a loud noise the glass candlestick which held the candle made a terrible noise and the noise came to the cars of those on the inside there arose an angry maddened roar a spy  kill them  down with the spy  was heard

there was a series of vigorous blows against the partition and as the partition was thin it soon gave way the next instant the excited men with revolvers in hand came pouring through into the tunnel

chapter xix

did not know his love

bertram heathcourt was perplexed as to what course to pursue here he was to become the husband of mona hawthorne in five days and he did not even love her he not only did not love her but he found out that he loved another yes loved another

loved a woman he never saw but once and that at a distance and who as he thought had never seen him

ever since mr quimbys daughter had passed him on the street he had been thinking of her her face haunted him he wanted to know more of her

when he went to mr quimbys house and found that she was missing he was almost wild although he held himself in control and never by word or look betrayed to his old friend the banker that his heart was slowly but surely breaking he called every day to learn if there was any news of the missing girl only to hear with a heavy heart that there was none

he regretted a thousand times his hasty step in asking mona to be his wife out of pity what was she to him that he should waste the best years of his life to make her happy he asked himself regretfully thinking of how happy he would be with viola should she put in her appearance he could not understand himself or his love was he a fickle man that his love could change with every pretty face he met he asked himself in surprise and yet he was sure that he had loved and still did love viola every time he thought of her it was with the same yearning tenderness that he thought of the bankers daughter

why was it which did he love these terrible questions were unanswerable and his attempting to answer them was telling on him daily his steps grew slow and halting his brow was thoughtful and the lines were becoming deeper and deeper on his noble forehead and around his handsome mobile mouth

each day that he called to see mona she noticed that there was a slight increase of silver threads among the gold of his hair and her heart smote her for an instant only an instant when she saw that he was becoming prematurely old

one morning bertram called at the house of his betrothed his face shining with a grim resolution

he had been sitting up all night trying to solve this momentous problem of his life should he submit to this marriage and so bring the curse of god on their heads should he spoil both their lives by doing this wicked thing for since he had begun to think the matter over he could see that it was wicked

not to marry mona was his determination he would go to monas mother and lay his case before her and if she was a woman with reason and a heart she would see that the best thing to do would be to release him from the engagement and she would do it she could then explain all to her daughter and that would save him the necessity of witnessing her sorrow for he told himself he could not stand it so with a heart light with hope he had gone this morning to put his plan into operation

mona had been expecting him therefore when he came she met him at the door and admitted him

she was also expecting to have him all to herself this morning bertram noticed the eager light in her eyes and suspecting that something was in the wind pressed a cold lass on her brow and made haste to inquire for her mother

i have something to say to her alone that is important  he said in answer to her look of surprise

oh certainly  she said sweetly ringing for a servant you can see mamma all you want now because i will soon have you all to myself and neither mamma nor any one else can come between us 

bertram winced at these words and was rather glad when the servant came and announced the fact that mrs hawthorne would see him upstairs in her sittingroom and straightaway he repaired to the place mentioned

its very peculiar â very peculiar â that he wants to see her and alone too he has always shunned her as much as possible since i told him about her i must hear what it is he says must i believe that i am the subject of this interview strange â strange that i should feel that this is my very last happy day â that i shall never know another 

there is only one thing that will make me unhappy and if that should happen â mona stopped and drew a deep breath and her face became absolutely fiendish in its expression

suddenly she started and a low laugh was hissed from between her livid lips â a laugh that would make little chills creep up ones back as if a blast had blown on one from an empty grave

i must hear what is being said  she muttered in tense tones and with that she flew up the stairs to a chamber adjoining her mothers sittingroom and standing behind the heavy velvet hangings that separated the apartments she listened to her doom

chapter xx

bertrams mistake

bertram found mrs hawthorne robed in a pretty satin wrapper with some fancywork laying gracefully across her lap after the usual greeting he plunged without any preliminaries into the topic nearest his heart

mrs hawthorne i have come to you on a mission of mercy 

is that so  in surprise well state your mission and if it is reasonable i shall be happy to be merciful 

mrs hawthorne i have discovered that i made a mistake in offering my hand to your daughter i do not love her 

the woman started violently her face turned an ashengray hue there was a roaring in her ears and it was by the mightiest effort of will that she kept from fainting recovering she said coldly sir i do not understand you i thought you loved my daughter or else why did you win her heart and offer to marry her 

mrs hawthorne  said bertram slowly he was pained how could he betray even to the mother the pleadings of the daughter for his love it seemed to him as if it should be held sacred but there was no other way to do and so in a straightforward modest way he told her all dwelling quite severely on the part that she had played in the affair as represented by mona when he had finished she sat looking straight before her pale as a marble statue

did mona my own child tell that wicked lie 

she asked more to herself than to him

lie good heavens mrs hawthorne what do you mean 

mrs hawthorne aroused herself there were lines of pain on her face and for the first time in his life bertram thought she looked noble noble she should look noble she did look for there was a noble resolution in her heart if her daughter was wicked enough to tell so base a lie on the mother who bore her lowering her and making her appear a contemptible deceiver then that daughter was not fit to be the wife of this good man â of any honest man

mr heathcourt i am not a good woman but i love my daughter and for her sake i have schemed and planned done everything except actual sin to promote her welfare i have done these things for her not through any selfish motive â and the thanks i have received â oh heavens but it is hard to think that my daughter my own child should lower me in the estimation of my acquaintances should make me appear a liar and a cheat mr heathcourt i have been cold to you when you were poor mercenary toward you when you came into wealth but i did not write that note to you do not even know that you wrote one i now pronounce my daughters story a base wicked fabrication and i absolve you from your engagement with her go you are free 

at the same time there came to their ears a low moan accompanied by a heavy fall in the apartment adjoining and on appearing there found mona in a dead faint on the floor her hand clutching the lace at her throat as if in agony tenderly bertram placed her on the couch and the maid who had come in answer to the mothers ring began applying restoratives

it was a long time before she regained consciousness she finally opened her eyes and as they fell on bertram she gave utterance to a hard and bitter laugh

why dont you heap reproaches on my head for the deception i practiced on you  she asked harshly

he did not say a word he only sat looking at her with a halfpitying expression on his face

youll never marry me now  she said hungrily

you hate and despise me dont you 

no mona i do not hate you but â youll never marry me so it is all the same now listen to me there is such a thing as a womans love being turned to hatred i hate you just as truly as if you were the loathsome serpent that you are do you hear hate you hate you 

mona for gods sake dont speak that way 

it is true i hate you bend down and let me whisper a few words to you  she seized the lapel of his coat as she whispered in his ear the effect was magical

bertram started up gasping for breath the shirt he wore could not have been whiter than his face

my god mona  he gasped it is untrue i never will believe it 

it is true i knew it all the time she has been a prisoner for days and no one knows her fate but me 

it is false viola is dead i saw her dead body three months ago 

you did  mockingly i dont see how that can be when you saw her alive and well the day she disappeared from the home of old quimby the banker 

my god mona do you mean to say that they are one and the same now i understand why my heart should cling to both of them mona for pitys sake tell me where my darling is 

this mentioning of his affection for the girl she hated so cordially seemed to madden the girl

i will never tell you where she is â never  she cried fiercely you must be mad to think i will give my rival into your arms to triumph over me after all my scheming have you never heard those expressive words hell hath no fury like a woman scorned  

just heaven i cannot will not believe that one so beautiful can be so false 

cant you well just listen while i tell you how false ive been see if a woman cant do or be anything for love and vengeance when i found out that you really loved that pauper girl viola i was determined to part you so i wrote a letter to her imitating your writing telling her that you had been flirting with her and that you loved me and that you were always to meet as strangers she poor little fool believed that it was from you and fled from her old home the afternoon you saw her on horseback i was standing about forty feet from you and i saw the effect it had upon you by careful inquiry i managed to find out where she lived and how came she there knowing that you would not rest until you saw he i determined to remove her from your path

fate favored me that same afternoon something happened that saved me further trouble that threw little viola into my clutches and there there shell stay for nobody shall ever know her fate prison tortures the rack wild horses could not drag the secret from me 

there was a hollow groan behind them and bertram turned and he had just time enough to put out his hand and save mrs hawthorne from falling heavily to the floor she having had occasion to leave the room had returned unperceived and had heard chapter xxl burglars break in on mrs smith and viola

mrs smiths presence of mind did not desert her for an instant when the very first blow was struck on the frail partition she knew that she had to act and act quickly so seizing the girl by the arms she shoved her under the stairs which they had just descended she was just preparing to follow herself when the angry men began pouring into the passage

heaven only knows what would have happened if their anger had not given way to surprise at sight of the woman the men involuntarily halted and stared at her aghast they were so sure it was a man

they soon became repossessed with anger and made a combined rush toward her

a female detective slit her gullet

hold

the effect was electrical the command rang out like a clarion they were accustomed to obeying that voice when it was heard and this occasion was no exception to the rule the chief advanced and turning to the men said do not injure the woman yet

but chief they all remonstrated weve just swore to kill all spies at sight

thats it answered the chief but is she a spy

do not injure her yet well carry her into the den and question her if she does not give a satisfactory reason for being here why shell die thats all

viola under the steps heard these terrible words with bated breath she knew the woman would never tell why she was there and the result would be death

a cold sweat broke out over her at the thought of this innocent woman dying at the hands of these cowardly assassins so she made up her mind then and there that it should not be if she could only slip out when they were not looking she could hurry and get assistance they had hurried the woman into the room the chief bringing up the rear viola stooped to come from under the steps when a nail projecting from one of the boards caught her shawl and tore it making the noise that cloth generally does when being torn the chief heard the noise and turning before viola could draw her head back saw her

i will be with you directly men

so saying he drew his revolver and lifting the mask from his face that he might see better came up to violas hiding place

you had just as well come out he said when he reached the stairs

receiving no answer and no movement being made about complying he reached his hand under the narrow steps seized her by the wrist and pulled her out

let me go she cried as though her heart would break trying hard to conceal her features by wrapping the shawl about her face

none of that you might as well stop resisting

it will be â he stopped for he had torn the shawl from her face and viola stood revealed alive and in the flesh

arnold campbell for as our reader has long suspected it was he started back his revolver dropping from his nerveless grasp his face was very pale and the distending of his eyes which seemed to start from their sockets showed that he was gazing at the girl in abject terror for a full minute he stood looking stupidly at her finally he said in a husky whisper you viola dunkirk i thought you were dead 

i wish i were  groaned the poor girl oh i wish i were father in heaven let me die 

the man had now fully recovered from the shock of the meeting and he saw the necessity of getting her out of the way before any of his pals saw her so taking her by the arm he said come along with me 

i will not â i will scream for help 

he stooped and picked up his pistol and pointed it at her while an angry gleam shot into his eyes and said if you do not come with me without any trouble i will kill you where you stand 

viola like the most of women was mortally afraid of a pistol and it proved more of a persuader than anything else that could have been done

dont dont point it at me  covering her face with her hands that she might not see it i will do as you say i will go with you indeed i will 

very well then come on 

he led her along the long passage until they came to a door he took a key from his pocket and inserting it in the door opened it then he led her across a room to another door through which they passed then they ascended a flight of stairs and entered another room that was furnished just like the one in which she had been previously imprisoned

and but for its being larger she would have thought that she was in the same room

now viola my darling  he said after fastening the door i am pleased to see you i had given you up for dead but i find you still in the land of the living and as pretty as ever aye as a picture 

she made no answer she simply sat with her hands covering her face a picture of heartbroken despair

you see my darling  he said going up to her and laying his hand caressingly on her shoulder

that i love you is no mistake why not accept my love there is no use of kicking against fate i have you in my power why dont you surrender 

why indeed she realized that it was useless to resist him longer it seemed as if fate was against her â that it was ordained that she should be this mans wife she shuddered at the thought of it but she saw no way to escape him she had been so hopeful that through the efforts of mrs smith she would be reunited with her loved ones but now the good woman was a prisoner and her last hope was shattered why not end it all â as she could not die â by marrying this man probably he would not molest her further after she was his and then she could go home to her people explain it all and afterwards lay down and die the thought kept growing upon her until she decided to act upon it so when arnold put his hand upon her shoulder she did not shrink from him he noticed this and the thought that she was about to give in sent the blood flowing through his veins like molten metal

oh my darling my sweet love why dont you be my wife  he asked passionately clasping her to his throbing heart and pouring a flood of kisses on her hair cheeks and lips i love you viola no man would do any more for you than i my love for you is honorable and honest i will make you the best kind of a husband simply because i adore you

be my wife viola be my wife 

she lay passively against his breast neither repulsing nor responding to his caresses her whole soul revolted at the idea of a union with this man who was a thief and a murderer in intent if not in reality

but that was the only way out of the difficulty as she lay in his arms the face of her first love arose before her and with a bitter sob she released herself

goodbye bertram  she said in an agony of despair goodbye we were never made for each other we must part now and forever henceforth our ways lay apart 

what do you mean  began the villain his face lighting up with hope do you mean that you will consent 

yes  she said in a voice choked with anguish i will be your wife 

chapter xxii

viola consents â arnold delighted

the man could scarcely believe the evidence of his ears had this determined selfwilled girl consented to be his wife he could not understand it he had expected to frighten her into marriage at the muzzle of his pistol but now of her own free will she had consented

he was almost wild with delight he strained her to his breast and almost smothered her with kisses

when his passion had somewhat subsided he said viola dearest you must not think i am too bad

everything is fair in love and war you know

not too bad a man that will plan robbery a leader of a gang of robbers a counterfeiter and not too bad these thoughts shot through her brain like lightning but she refrained from uttering them and simply asked youll give me a little time before you â that is before we do this thing

his face fell time what did she want with time did she want to think of her situation and then change her mind or worse was she expecting aid from the outside both of these thoughts were rather unpleasant and he determined to have the thing over as soon as possible

i will give you until tomorrow night at ten oclock i will have a minister here how does that suit

oh thank you thank you that suits very well said the poor girl glad of that little respite before her terrible ordeal

and there is something else she continued

after we are married you will not molest me â that you will not be troubled very much to go your way and allow me to go mine

oh certainly not all i want is to possess you â to know that you are mine he replied quite willing that she should make terms now but determined that he should take the reins in his own hands when they were married

thank you said the girl now leave me if you please and he did so

we must now take a look at one whom we have almost forgotten in our interest in the fortunes and misfortunes of our heroine it was weeks after bessies rescue that she was able to be up and about

when she finally recovered she realized the necessity of finding employment after days of discouraging failures she finally obtained employment as saleslady in one of the big department stores at the drygoods counter she became encouraged at this and worked steadily in the place without any mishap for three months in the meantime bessie had taken up her abode in another portion of the city with a kindhearted motherly lady and she was beginning to feel almost happy late one afternoon when she was sitting on the piazza of the cottage enjoying the cool breeze blowing from the river and watching the sunset a carriage drove up to the house next to her

she would simply have given it a passing glance if it were not for the sight of someone whom she thought she recognized sitting within the face of the person was turned in another direction so that he did not see her when the carriage stopped he stepped out bessie looked more closely and grew pale to the lips gave a gasp and springing to her feet dodged behind a honeysuckle vine as the man turned his face toward her she recognized the face of the person as that of her husband he did not stop but passed hastily up the steps and rang the bell the door was opened and he passed in bessie wondered what he wanted there she knew that that was the home of a minister and she could not flunk what he wanted with one except â and at once she thought of what he had told her about his love for another young girl came to her and she felt she almost knew that he had come to engage a minister to perform the ceremony she did not know what course to pursue only one thought forced itself into her excited brain â she must save the girl

but how should she go to the police she saw that it would be useless if they were to ask her how she knew he was going to marry what could she tell them so deeply was she thinking that she did not realize the flight of time until she heard that wellknown voice say to the minister who had followed him out on the piazza at halfpast nine the carriage will be here at halfpast nine sure

very well sir i shall be ready came the answer

halfpast nine halfpast nine hark

the clock is chiming nine now she has only half an hour in which to think what should she do

what could she do for fully ten minutes she stood still trying to think of some way to save the girl

like an inspiration came a plan and darting in the hall she flew up the stairs like a flash and soon returned wearing a black dress and veil taking a dark hat from the rack she ran down the steps and opened the gate just as the hack drove up to the next door at the same moment an old man came along the sidewalk going in the opposite direction

he stopped and gave her a scrutinizing glance and turned and looked at the vehicle and without a word passed on his way bessie was annoyed at the mans curious actions and waited to see him out of sight

the man was evidently not thinking of her for he crossed the street and disappeared around the corner

then bessie closed the gate softly and gliding up to the hack like a shadow disappeared under it the next moment the minister came down the steps and entered the carriage and they were all whirled swiftly away

chapter xxiii

bessies ride

one could imagine the flurry bessie was in and her many thoughts

away went the hack flying over the hard asphalt âstreets like the wind but bessie curled up among the springs clung to them with all the tenacity of life and death she did not know in which direction they were going but she knew by the scarcity of lamps and by the balmy breeze that they were on the country road somewhere near the river after about half an hours ride they stopped and she from her hiding place saw the minister get out and start toward the house she just had time to drop down in the road when the driver cracked his whip and the carriage dashed off she lay curled up on the ground and saw the minister go up to the door and knock and after a few moments he was admitted by the dim light in the room she recognized the person who admitted him as her husband then she arose to her feet and stood looking at the house in perplexity

what should she do

she did not see a figure standing behind a tree about twenty feet from her gazing at her with an eager light in his eyes she walked swiftly up to the house hoping that fate would throw some opportunity in her way by which she could enter the house

the figure behind the tree stepped from his hiding place and noiselessly glided after her she walked around the house until she came to the back door

all at once it opened and she had just time enough to dodge behind the corner when she saw an old woman almost bent double with a repulsivelooking face come out of the door down the steps and hobble toward the stable

bessies heart beat with joy as she noticed that the woman did not lock the door as soon as the woman disappeared she came from her place of concealment and approached the door the unseen figure all the time kept the same distance from her she put her hand on the knob and turned it the door flew open and she stepped across the threshold before she could close the door a sudden gust of wind blew out the light and she was in total darkness she closed the door however and began feeling her way toward the place where she had last seen another door she found it and opening it passed through she stopped still and listened and after a moment the sound of voices was borne to her ears from a room on the left

looking up the passage from whence the voices came she saw a single ray of light shooting out from a keyhole eagerly she went toward it and reaching the door she knelt by the side of the keyhole and listened

poor viola when she was left alone stood where she was for twenty minutes at least finally with a weary sigh she cast herself down upon the iron cot

not to weep oh no she was past weeping poor girl but to think lying there she began to think over her past life from the time she left school a happy hopeful girl how although poor she was free from care these were her every thought until the first blow in the form of her fathers death came then how happy she had been working for her poor an valid mother then she thought of the time when she had first met bertram heathcourt how bright and beautiful her life had been and all the time her real trouble was forming in a dark cloud above her head ready to burst and overwhelm her why had they ever met why why what had it ever brought her beyond that little dream of happiness

and now â heaven help her â she was about to be united to this man â united for life the very thought of it was the embodiment of everything loathsome and repugnant what was her life worth now

nothing â absolutely nothing what hope had she of ever being happy again none

with a miserable moan of heartache she turned on her pillow and had soon forgotten her troubles in a deep dreamless sleep

the next day passed as miserably as the night

about ten oclock the old woman came to bring her breakfast violas head was resting on her hand and as the woman turned to go viola noticed that the woman was looking at her in a very peculiar manner following the direction of her eyes she saw that she was looking at the diamond ring on her finger

a faint ray of hope dawned in her heart as she thought that probably this woman could be bribed into releasing her

she arose and approached the woman

you were looking at my ring she asked

who said so

no one only i thought you liked it and would like to have it

the womans eyes glittered avariciously but she did not reply

would you like to have it

mebbe so

well if you will release me  she said eagerly i will give it to you 

but to this the woman gave no answer

if that is not enough  she continued her face flushing with hope as she saw the womans silence and thought she might be won over to her side i will add this to it  going down in her pocket and pulling out her watch and when i get home i will give you five hundred dollars besides 

the woman smiled a sarcastic smile as she said it aint no use miss i know that you havent got that much to your name mr arnold said so

he said you was a poor lacemaker and if you is how is yer going to give me five hundred dollars 

violas heart sank and tears of disappointment started to her eyes

indeed i am rich and i will do as i say i have just been adopted by rich people and if you release me they will remunerate you 

i dont believe a word on it say miss if theyre so rich why dont they do somethin about findin you i know theres detectives nough in washinton to find a needle in a haystack why hasnt they found you eh 

viola saw that the woman was not to be convinced and with a last wail of despair cried oh my good woman for pitys sake for heavens sake release me surely you could not stand by quietly and see one of your own sex in sore trouble and not come to her assistance no woman could do that 

i am sorry miss but i cant do you no good

why you doesnt know nothin mr arnold would kill me if i was to loose you i couldnt think o such a thing not by no manner of means said the old woman earnestly after which she went out and closed and locked the door

the hands of violas watch pointed to ten oclock

viola paler than usual heard the noise of a carriage drive up to the door of the house in a few minutes the minister entered preceded by arnold campbell who was in his most factitious mood

well my dear you see we are on time and have not been guilty of causing you what every woman hates â under the circumstances â to be kept waiting

are you readly my love

without a word she arose and put the tips of her fingers on his arm and the ceremony began which progressed very nicely until the clergyman asked if there be any one present who can give reason why this couple should not be united let them speak now or hereafter forever hold your peace

the wouldbe bridegroom involuntarily glanced around but no one having spoken the minister continued arnold campbell he proceeded will you have this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife etc i will he answered viola dunkirk will you have this man to be your wedded husband etc i will she said faintly but imagination leads us to believe that she said high hill

i pronounce you â hold on stop great heavens i object to this marriage it is nothing more nor less than a sacrilege

chapter xxiv

arnold attempts bigamy â wife objects

the objection to the marriage fell upon the trio like an exploding bomb and the effect upon each was different the minister with surprise and annoyance viola with hope and joy arnold campbell with â well no one knows what the emotion or emotions with which he gazed at that slim pale figure standing in the doorway pointing her finger at him in condemnation and lifting a pair of big accusing eyes at him â the figure of his wronged wife bessie had he been confronted by a ghost he could not have been paler or more rigid

bessie alive was all that he could say

i pronounce this marriage a sacrilege and forbid it to proceed any further

why my dear woman asked the minister seriously

because that man has a wife living

its a lie gulped the baffled villain

has a wife living said the minister that is a serious matter how do you know he has a wife living

because i am his wife

the minister frowned as the words rang out clear and firm

viola uttered a glad cry and burst into tears of joy

arnold stood pale and still as a statue he could not utter a word his tongue seemed paralyzed

can you prove what you say my good woman have you a certificate

bessie faltered for a moment in her previous excitement she had forgotten all about the certificate of marriage the only proof that would be accepted to verify her statement

he is my husband sir said she falteringly and he has my marriage certificate

arnold who had witnessed his victim slowly slipping through his fingers in a paroxysm of rage and hate suddenly brightened up

that woman must be mad he said i have seen her often enough but never had anything to do with her you see she cannot prove what she says to be true

it is true said bessie oh sir dont let that wicked man wrong this lovely young girl he cannot marry her i am his wife

ha ha he laughed jeeringly you cannot prove anything

can you prove that you are this mans lawfully wedded wife my good woman again asked the minister

no sir i can only give you my word

i can prove that shes his wife if she cannot

came from the doorway and they again wheeled about to face a newcomer

he was a man of seemingly fifty years old medium height and rather stout his hair and beard were long and gray on his nose rested a pair of glasses and he carried a heavy cane in his hand bessie recognized him in spite of his glasses as the same man she had passed at her gate before leaving home

arnold looked at him menacingly and said who are you you old duffer

i am said the man in a muffled voice the avenger of this pointing to bessie young girls sufferings and wrongs

well sir said the minister are you prepared to prove that this young woman is the wife of this young man

yes sir

well where is your proof sir

there it is going into his pocket and bringing out a folded paper here is mrs campbells mararge certificate

bessie uttered a glad cry as she caught sight of that precious document and sprang eagerly forward taking it from him and kissed it and pressed it to her bosom while tears flowed freely from her eyes

campbell on realizing that he had been foiled sprang forward with a cry like that of a wounded animal and clutched the old man by the throat he expected to have a picnic in throttling the old man but it seemed as if the old man objected to taking a part in the feast for with a quick motion of his muscular arm he threw off arnolds grasp and catching him by the collar he shook him until his teeth chattered the old man seemed well preserved and his joints very firm as he danced around like a whirlwind with a quick sweep of his feet he tripped arnolds legs from under him and before the baffled villain realized what had happened he found his wrists securely encircled by a pair of steel darbies

who are you man gasped arnold

who am i quizzically echoed the old man

yes who are you what right have you to commit this outrage

by the right of the law sternly man i am dick turpin the detective

with a groan the prostrate villain closed his eyes

he had fainted outright

turning to the wondering lookers on the man said you would like to know how i came in possession of mrs campbells marriage certificate well it can be told in a few words one night i had occasion to go to a wharf as a gang of river pirates were becoming very troublesome while standing on the pier in one of the unused freight houses waiting for some sign of the pirates i saw this young lady come onto the wharf i was curious to see what she intended to do at first i thought she contemplated suicide but after she had been waiting quite a time i changed my mind so busily engaged in watching her that i did not see the approach of another party until that whelp had struck her to the water by a flash of lightning that broke upon the scene at the same time i recognized both parties so horrified was i that i could not repress a groan as i saw her disappear over the side of the pier that scoundrel must have heard it for he turned and fled from the place as if pursued by a legion of fiends i came to the side of the pier hoping to see some sign of the girl after a moment i heard her call for help and i soon had her safe ashore i carried her to the house of an old colored man to whom i had once rendered service and i knew that he would protect her with his life

the next day when i called to see her she was sick but the old negro came to me and handed me a parcel saying that he had gone down to his boat which lay under the pier that morning and had found the parcel he wanted me to see whom it was for as he could not read so that he might give it to the owner i took charge of it and instructed the man not to say anything about it i opened the parcel and found that it was a marriage certificate i resolved to keep it as it would enable me to spring a trap on the villain when he least expected it everything went well until tonight when i met this young lady at her gate i recognized her and seeing the carriage standing so close by i thought there was something wrong so i passed on and crossing the street hid behind a tree and saw her crawl among the springs of the vehicle it happened that the carriage passed by me and i had no trouble in springing up behind it and we all rode out together the rest you know 

chapter xxv

villain pleads for mercy

by this time arnold had regained consciousness and as he realized that his race was run he began to whine for mercy but it had no effect on the stonyhearted detective

after a while viola spoke

oh sir that man has made a good woman who was with me a prisoner make him tell you where she is and release her

that was not hard to do arnold seemed on account of his defeat to be all down and out and readily told where she was soon mrs smith was clasped in the arms of her friends

when they had become quiet the detective stepped out and gave a shrill whistle in an instant a man appeared

hurry to town fitch said the detective and get the patrol wagon

in an incredibly short space of time the patrol wagon arrived

well said the detective we are all here and as our business is completed here we might as well vacate

they all reached the city safely and by the request of the detective all save the minister remained in quarters prepared by him he had a hard time to persuade viola to remain overnight

i cannot remain she said my father and mother are anxious about me and besides â she did not finish but a deep flush completed the statement

oh he is all right  said the detective in his bluff hearty manner you need have no fear on that score 

but  she said shyly dropping her eyes you do not understand that he is to be married to that woman tomorrow and i must try and prevent that 

you need not be uneasy  said mr turpin i will attend to things all right and besides if i did not it would be just the same the engagement between them is off i want to see you with rosy cheeks when i come in the morning you are very pale now 

he did not know that it was a rush of happiness that had made her pale and what a struggle she had to keep from fainting outright from excess of joy

bertram heathcourt in spite of the blight that had fallen upon him was happier as he rang the doorbell of the great banker mr quimby on the succeeding morning than he had been for months as soon as he was admitted he inquired for the banker mr

quimby was looking very ill his steps were growing feeble and he was becoming morose and thoughtful in strong contrast with his once buoyant step and hearty jolly air although he had no news for bertram that did not quench the ardor of his hopefulness after the usual greeting bertram confided his secret to the old banker and you may be sure that the old gentleman was as pleased as he was surprised he heartily sympathized with the young man and made up his mind that he would redouble his efforts to find his daughter

bertram was very hopeful that his lost love would be restored to him not so with the banker he had begun to lose all patience with the detective

the man had had the case long enough to bring it to a successful issue instead of which he had not even put in an appearance so he and bertram decided to go and see him this morning and if he had made no progress on the case to take it from him they found the detective enveloped in a pile of papers as usual he greeted the gentlemen cordially and after exchanging greetings took from his pocket a cigar case and offered its contents to the gentlemen

i did not come here said mr quimby testily to indulge in luxuries i want to know what youve done in the case youve had so long

there was a twinkle in the gray eyes of the detective as he said oh yes the case by jove

mr quimbys brow darkened

is it possible that you have forgotten all about it

what kind of a man are you youve had the case five or six days and promised to let me hear from you soon and now youve actually forgotten all about it

the detective could hardly keep from laughing outright as he watched the exasperated old man walking up and down the floor

the fact is mr quimby business has been so brisk that â brisk fiddlesticks said the old man angrily i asked you plainly whether you were able to undertake the case and you said you were if you were too busy why did you not say so and i could have engaged someone else and thus saved valuable time

ill have you discharged from the force sir

well mr quimby  said turpin his manner changing i have not wasted valuable time and if you will call here at two oclock i will show you that i have not 

the old man wended his way home disconsolate enough not so with young heathcourt his heart beat high with hope

xxvi a happy meeting

love had sharpened bertrams glance and he had noticed something in the detectives eye unnoticed by the banker that made him think that the detective had not been altogether unsuccessful and for that reason he was very hopeful in consequence

that afternoon about one oclock mr turpin went to the place where he had left the women he soon had them transferred to his office at two oclock sharp the banker and heathcourt entered the two women were behind the screen and as she heard the old man ask well now what progress have you made toward finding my daughter she could hardly refrain from running out and kissing him

i find that your daughter disappeared on the ninth instant

well everybody in the city knows that

yes but everybody doesnt know what became of her

at this instant the office boy entered and handed the detective a despatch

the detective who had been standing on reading it turned white as a corpse and dropped toward his chair falling into it he covered his face with his hands the two men looked on in wonder

are you ill mr turpin asked the banker anxiously and his voice took on its natural gentleness in strange contrast to its former sharpness

in answer the detective handed him the dispatch

it read your prisoner has escaped justice when i went my rounds i found him hanging from the bars of his cell with a silk handkerchief around his neck he is dead

crowley warden of the fourth district jail

the banker read the telegram and looked at the man in surprise it seemed as if a prisoner of his had committed suicide but there was nothing in that to have such an effect upon any man it did indeed seem strange here was a man who was as bold and fearless as a lion who daily came in contact with criminals of the worst sort here he was trembling like an aspen and as weak as a child at having received the news of a villains suicide what did it mean what could it mean

the detective partially recovered his selfcontrol and said mr quimby i will not quiz you any further i will tell you all that i have accomplished

and he told the banker all that had happened from the time that the case had been given to him for investigation

and you really know my daughters whereabouts cried the banker joyfully while the young man began to tremble with excitement

yes she is in this city in this neighborhood in this house this very room

both men sprang to their feet as viola pale but with a glad light in her eyes came from behind the screen followed by bessie

here the curtain doses on the meeting of father and daughter and between lovers suffice it to say that explanations followed and the crooked path was made straight the rough way smoother

when everything had become partially quiet after the first excitement of the meeting the detective found himself confronted with the most trying ordeal of his life

mrs smith had confided to him her secret and now the denouement was in order he arose and making a vigorous effort to clear his throat said mr heathcourt do you ever remember having seen your mother do you know what she was like

the young mans face showed a blush but he answered bravely no sir i do not my mother was very unfortunate and we were separated before i was large enough to remember her

have you ever heard of her do you know whatever became of her

pardon me mr turpin said bertram again blushing but speaking with dignity i would rather not speak of my poor mother as i said before she was very unfortunate and as she is dead i shall hold her memory sacred from the intrusion of strangers

dead said the detective in a peculiar way

how do you know she is dead have you any evidence of her death

bertram turned pale and gave the man a keen glance

no i have no evidence beyond my uncles dying statement he said that she was dead

has it ever occurred to you that he might have been mistaken about her death asked the man with the same mysterious look such things have happened

his manner rather than his words struck on the young man strangely and he arose to his feet now his suspicions fully aroused

man you know something and are afraid to speak of it what is it

i thought probably your mother may be alive and wishes to see you and â what do you mean if you know anything why dont you tell it

what would you think if your mother were to walk out on this floor alive and well what would you think

great god he muttered what is it you are saying for heavens sake tell me do you know anything of my mother my mother alive and we reunited after twentyfive years of separation you must be mad and yet â do you know anything of her is she alive

there was a long pause and then the detective answered solemnly she is alive and well and waiting to clasp you to her bosom

bertram stood stock still his face was almost ashen in its paleness his arms were folded across his heaving bosom after a silence during which time he could hear his own heart beat yet standing as firm and steady as a marble statue he said almost in a whisper alive alive my poor wronged mother alive

oh god i thank thee with my whole soul where is she take me to her

and for the first time while she was present he seemed to have forgotten all about viola â forgot her very existence

the detective stepped back to the screen and moved it aside and there sitting on a lounge with a happy angelic light in her eyes an expectant blush on her face was the almost strange but clearly loved mother the next instant they were clasped in each others arms mother and son were reunited

chapter xxvii excitement over

the excitement was all over everything had been proven to the satisfaction of all parties the natural instincts of bertrams heart had claimed this woman for his mother and besides that there was found around her neck an old gold necklace with the miniature of doris heathcourt and her husband given to her by him when they were a young and happy couple on her finger she still wore her wedding ring upon the inside of which was engraved from f to d june th  

a month had elapsed since the events narrated in the previous chapter bessie was living with viola as companion viola had returned to her father and mother at home and bertram had taken his mother home to the park bertram with all the impetuosity of a young lover had told the banker that he must have viola for his wife immediately viola and the old gentleman had remonstrated and tried to induce the young man to be patient but all in vain reasoning was not one of his prominent qualities where his love was concerned they had spoken of preparations for the trousseau and other things preparatory to the marriage bertram had decided and declared that he did not want any preparations made nor a great show of his marriage he said also that his mother was very lonely and that they must consent for her sake

viola had shown bertram that she had a will of her own by positively refusing to marry him immediately for she had said with great dignity that it of the gentleman to permit the young lady to name the day and not to force her into a marriage before she was ready with a twinkle in her eyes she said if your mother is very lonely i will consent to become your wife in a month

the young man seeing how determined she was had to be satisfied the conclusion reached caused bertram to send workingmen by the score to the park where preparations were soon ready for the great event

finally the auspicious day arrived the morning dawned clear bright and pleasant at ten oclock the ceremony was to take place

viola was up with the lark and going to the window threw it up with smiles of joy on her beautiful face uplifted toward heaven she clasped her hands and gave thanks to god that he had blessed her in this the one hope of her life she then dressed and calling for her horse took a brisk gallop before breakfast halfpast nine finds her surrounded by a bevy of pretty girls all her most intimate friends they are laughing and chatting gayly just then mrs

quimby put her head in at the door and said she never gazed upon a more picturesque scene

viola noticed the wistful look in her eyes and she knew that the kindhearted old lady wanted to spend the last few minutes with the girl who was as dear to her as her own child

so viola requested them to let her have a few words with her and after giving her an affectionate kiss they all filed out of the room soon the sound of carriage wheels reached their ears and mrs

quimby arises and says well my daughter you are about to leave me

have i been good to you have you been happy here 

how can you ask such a question  inquired viola her eyes filling with reproachful tears i could not have been happier were you my own mother i could not have loved you more 

my darling daughter  ardently exclaimed the dear lady and she put her hands on the girls head and by the closing of her eyes and the movements of her lips viola knew that she was giving her a blessing

the bridal party was assembled the few invited friends are all standing in pretty groups around the principals

they make a very handsome couple  so says everyone

bertram wore the conventional groom costume and he never looked handsomer or happier viola was the subject of admiration her dress was a triumph of the modistes art it was truly exquisite in its absolute simplicity it was made of white satin with draperies of white silk the decollette corsage was finished at the neck with a border of fine white french lilacs she wore a wreathed veil and other beautiful trimmings the only ornament worn by her was a necklace consisting of three rows of pearls and in her hand she carried a beautiful bouquet of white roses she carried herself with a grace and charm of manner that was indescribable there was not a touch of awkwardness but an easy selfpossession which was as charming as it was unusual in one so young during the hush which had fallen over the party and amidst chants of music from the organ the minister began and completed the ceremony

and now viola dunkirk was the beloved wife of bertram heathcourt

they drove away amidst a shower of rice and slippers the latter being thrown by mr quimby himself

and may they continue to be as happy as now

chapter xxviii bessie consents

as has been stated bessie had been the companion of viola since the latters rescue all the remonstrances of bessie could not make viola change her decision that after her marriage bessie should come to the park and continue to live there and as bertram so earnestly voiced the sentiment bessie consented

viola and bertram both sympathized with the poor girl they knew that she had suffered and they did all they could to make her happy

the detective too seemed to take a great interest in the girl he had advised her to go to her parents and tell them all and he was sure they would forgive her and take her back to their hearts but when he had told her to do this she had shrunk from him as if he had cut her with a lash

oh no no i could never go to them with my wrecked life and then too i know that they would never forgive me never it will soon be all over

dont you see that i am getting thinner and thinner every day mr turpin i am slowly but surely dying

the detective started and exclaimed huskily for gods sake dont speak so i cannot bear it

if anything of the kind should occur it would kill me i â i could not bear it i â 

and he stopped and turning abruptly left her alone

two whole months have elapsed since mrs hawthorne heard the confession of her daughters sin from her own lips she had been conveyed to her room and never left it before the expiration of three weeks she was a dead woman

bertram did not hear the account of her death until after the funeral when he heard of it he went to call on mona to see if he could render any service and found that she had gone

she had gone she had disappeared as effectually as if the earth had swallowed her ito its bowels and further search failed to reveal anything of her whereabouts

time passed on if every other person had forgotten mona viola had not somehow she could not get rid of the impression that she had not seen the last of her and the correctness of the impression was proven sooner than she expected

one night bessie had complained of a severe headache and retired early viola with her usual solicitude went to bessies room before she retired to her own she took some smelling salts and taking a seat beside the head of the sick girl held the salts to her nose and gently stroked her forehead with her soft white hand

under the soothing touches of her soft and experienced hand the girl began to feel better and soon dropped to sleep viola seeing the effect of her work gently left the room and retired but strange as it may seem as soon as viola had left the room bessies illness seemed to return with redoubled force she tossed on her pillow for an hour trying to sleep but could not finally she arose and putting on a wrapper began pacing the floor it seemed to have no better effect and in despair bessie went to the window threw it up thinking that the cool air would make her feel better and refreshed

what was that

she could have sworn that she saw a darkrobed figure skulking along in the shrubbery no it was all a fancy of â no there it is again sneaking along as if it did not desire to be seen what did it mean

bessies first impulse was to arouse the house but then she thought it might possibly be some servant who had been out for a time and she had no desire to cause anyone trouble she was sure it was a servant when she saw the figure turn in towards the servants rooms and disappear behind the house so she drew her chair beside the window and gave herself up to thought presently the clock on the mantel struck one no sooner had the sound died away when another sound came to her ears what was it

nothnig her imagination was playing pranks with her

hark there it was again she was sure she heard stealthy footsteps pass her door she arose softly and going to the door quietly opened it and peeped out

yes there it was the figure of a woman in black

what did it mean this was not the servants part of the house and if she was a servant what did she want there did bertram have any dishonest persons in his employ what was she doing sneaking in this portion of the house

impelled by some force stronger than herself she noiselessly glided after her she saw the woman pass swiftly along the hall and stop at violas door and after trying a few keys in the lock opened it and passed in bessie was close at her heels viola always kept a lamp burning in her room on the centertable and by its light bessie could see viola sleeping peacefully on her pillow with a smile on her red lips

her golden hair was streaming over the pillow and one hand rested under her head while the other was lying on the coverlet rivalling it in its whiteness

bessie could also see a woman dressed in mourning with a black veil drawn back from her dark face her lips were compressed into a cruel smile the whole expression of her face was something terrible to see

in her hand bessies eye caught the glitter of something she could not see very plainly but instinctively she guessed that it was a dagger bessie stood as if paralyzed when the full force of the womans intention dawned upon her she could not scream she could not move a finger she looked at the proceedings of the woman as if fascinated she saw the woman go to the lamp and turn it up full then she saw her return to the side of the bed and gently pull back the coverlet and gaze long into the face of the sleeping girl with an expression of fiendish hate on her face then the woman danced around as if an mad delight at the helplessness of her victim she began to make gestures as if she was talking explaining something raising her eyes to the ceiling for about fifteen seconds she was quite still lowering her eyes she slowly raised her right hand in which gleamed a dagger and the next instant viola would have been in eternity but before the weapon descended there came a piercing scream the spell had been broken and springing to the bell cord bessie gave it a violent tug she had roused the house

chapter xxix wouldbe murderer falls to death

the woman turned with a stifled cry of fright and fled toward the door bessie had to go a little distance from the door in order to seize the bell cord and before she could return to it the woman had darted through and toward the staircase bessie gave chase and so close was she to her that she managed to catch the shawl from her shoulder this caused the woman to redouble her efforts to escape and she made a spurt forward and began lowering her veil this proved the most disastrous thing she could have done in lowering her veil it momentarily cut off her view ahead failing to see the marble statue just at the point where she was to turn to descend the stairs resulted in her running against it with force enough to have killed some people she was simply momentarily checked and started off again but the statue had fallen directly across her path and as she started forward she tripped struggling desperately to regain her equilibrium she tripped again falling headlong down the heavy oak stairs bouncing from step to step finally landing in a heap thirty feet below with a sickening thud bessie stopped and covered her face with her hands in horror

the servants began to arrive on the scene halfdressed wfth terrorstricken faces

what is the trouble asked bertram who had just arrived what does it all mean

bessie was trembling like an aspen and could not speak from horror

oh bessie for heavens sake tell us what it is

bessie could only groan

bessie bessie my goodness what has happened asked mrs heathcourt standing behind her children in terror

o my god she is dead she is dead gasped bessie at last

what dead just heaven who is dead

for answer bessie pointed to the place where the motionless figure lay they all looked

bertram and viola gave one glance and instinctively looked into each others face and there they read the whole occurrence

yes she is certainly dead said one of the men servants who a little braver than the rest had gone and examined her

poor girl murmured bertram mingling his tears of sympathy with those of his wife who was already weeping on his shoulder poor misguided mona

yes it was mona poor girl her mothers death seemed to have crazed her and she wandered from her home when she recovered her reason a month later she found herself in a hospital in richmond va

as soon as she was strong enough to leave it she resolved to go to washington d c and prosecute the one desire that had taken full possession of her entire soul â to revenge herself she would kill the girl who had robbed her of her love she would kill the man whom she had loved too well â whom she had loved with a love worthy of a better consideration

and lastly she would kill herself

she came to washington with the result known

bertram after notifying the authorities and after the inquest had been held over the remains of mona had instructed the jurors not to give the facts in the case to the newspapers they complied and the jury found a verdict that the deceased had met death by accidently falling down stairs in the house of bertram heathcourt

bertram ordered the body buried at his expense and placed in a plot in the clairmount cemetery near the family vault of the heathcourts

two years have passed and bessie is still at the park she is looking paler and growing thinner every day so much so in fact that it has become quite noticeable to those with whom she daily came in contact

bertram and viola have advised a change of air and scenery but she would not hear of it she had also refused to follow the advice of mr turpin and return to her parents whom he was confident would forgive her it seemed as if she was waiting for something every day she would look up eagerly when the mail arrived and if there was anything for her after reading it she would sigh heavily as if it was not from the one she expected the days flew by into weeks and weeks into months

one day the detective drove to the park with an expression of grim determination on his face he inquired for bessie and when they were alone in his quick but earnest manner and without any parleying he began straightway to lay his heart at her feet

it breaks my heart to see you dying by inches and nothing being done to save you be my wife and let me shield your life from every storm i will cherish it as the dearest thing ever given into my keeping i love you i have loved you longer than you know what do you say will you be my wife

now bessie was in sore straits she did not know herself she felt a strange attraction for this man â a feeling of peace and safety in his very presence she liked him well not to say loved him and yet how dearly she loved the memory of the absent kent howard

it pained her to have discontinued a friendship which had been so agreeable and she told him so

mr turpin she said i admire you very much

i also appreciate the honor you do me by wishing to marry me after my wrecked life i do not know about love in justice to you i will tell you my heart as much as i know myself

and she told him about the occurrence previous to her marriage of how much she liked him turpin and how dearly she loved kent and also told him that the hope of seeing kent howard once more and hearing the words of forgiveness in her ears for the wrong she had done him was the only thing that kept her alive

mr turpin regardless of her love for kent howard continued to press his claim finally bessie consented but before the day appointed for the marriage bessie died which was a crushing blow to the haughty mr turpin

five years have elapsed two women are standing on the broad piazza at the park admiring the beautiful sunset it needs but one glance to tell that they are the two mrs heathcourts mrs heathcourt the elder is still beautifulalthough her brow is becoming wrinkled and her hair gray viola is almost the same viola as of old only she is becoming less fragile looking her superb form has in it now the fulness of matronhood and her cheeks the same glow her eyes the same sparkle as she gazes on the crimson sky as they had shown that afternoon on the cliff when she was in such imminent danger

together the two women turned as the sun was sinking behind the western horizonand walked along the piazza to the other side of the house where they stopped to gaze at the pretty picture that their eyes beheld

seated in an easy chair is bertram handsome as ever a tigerskin rug under his feet and he is dividing his attention between an old virginia cheroot a newspaper and a curly golden head peeping up between his knees

mrs bertram heathcourt while standing quietly by gazing on bent forward over the back of the chair in which was seated her love tenderly placed her arms around his neck and gently pressed a kiss on bertrams forehead

suddenly the little tot of four summers called out mamma gamma here turns my uzzer gamma an gampa timby

yes yes said viola smiling

bless him said mrs heathcourt the elder bless him god bless you all my children

and together they go down the steps to meet the newlyarrived party
